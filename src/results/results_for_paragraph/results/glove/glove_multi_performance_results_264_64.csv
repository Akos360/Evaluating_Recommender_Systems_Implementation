188,404,0.998,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"teacher-created artefacts are the norm (using âteacherâ to mean anyone, including a team of designers or fellow learners, that intentionally or otherwise helps another to learn). So it is with interest that I read this chapter reporting on personal learning environments, but talking about them in the context of intentional teaching, courses, workshops and other planned processes. Self-regulation can occur at many scales. We may choose to control different aspects of the learning process but almost always delegate control to others at many stages, whether to the author of a chapter or learning object, the leader of a workshop, our PLE or the widgets within it. Some tools described in this chapter such as Etherpad and Flashmeeting hinge on social engagement, which entails a need to be at the very least mindful of the schedules, needs and goals of others. This highlights a tension that exists in nearly all PLE implementations, that they support our social learning activities, but that those social learning activities themselves, with our fellow learners and teachers, provide shape and form to our learning. For instance, I was not surprised to read that relatively little use was made of Etherpad and Chat in the events described: given that participants were collocated it would not normally be very useful to provide alternative real-time collaboration tools, especially as the tasks did not appear to focus on production of a permanent artefact but were simple part of some active experimentation to use the toolset. At the heart of all my reflections on this chapter is the fact that PLEs are more than just a way to keep things organized in our learning lives. Done well, they are generative toolsets that can act in some ways like a teacher, offering guidance, inspiration, motivational support and structure to the learning experience. But, at the same time, they seek to provide freedom from such a teacher role, to be soft tools to support self-regulated learning. They are thus both teachers and not teachers at the same time. Their innate softness is perhaps the reason that the evaluations performed in this chapter focused on helping people to use the tools in a manner that is anything but self-regulated and explains why it is so hard to pin them down. A PLE is personal: every individual builds processes and methods around them, configures his or her own space but, at the same time, that space is shaped and influenced by the people, resources, learning objects, tools and expertise that are available. This tension lies at the heart of education. When we educate ourselves we choose the parts that we delegate to others more than those who follow a more guided path but, through the shape of our tools, the people around us and simple path dependencies, we have many of our decisions made for us and, at a finer granularity, always delegate at least some of the teaching process to others. Getting the right balance is a tough task to perform well and partly explains why case studies like the one presented here have a vital role to perform in helping us to understand that better."
123,6,0.997,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"is able to convince him that they are any better, since their claims to wisdom do not hold up under critical scrutiny. Socrates, at least, admits that his beliefs about the world and society may turn out to be false, and so he may be the wisest, in the sense that he realizes the limitations in his own convictions and beliefs about the world (Plato, 1966). There is a Socratic quality to the intervention from the pushback tractor driver at the airport, a willingness to challenge a person in power, in the name of doing things right together. He persists with his questioning even after he has experienced rejection and irritation from the higher ranked person on the receiving end of his messages. Socratic philosophy is practical at heart, both in the sense that it can address concrete questions about how one should act and live, here and now, and in the wider sense of being oriented toward the goal of leading a richer and better life. It rests on an assumption that an examination of personal beliefs, desires, and habits can lead to significant breakthroughs of knowledge regarding how to live a good life. You may come to realize that your current priorities and ways of living are not consistent with what you actually value and see as important, and so have reasons to make changes. We can interpret âKnow yourself â as a recommendation to look inwards, to examine oneâs own feelings, desires, commitments, preferences, and habits. Another interpretation of the Socratic motto is that the process of attaining self-knowledge requires you to look outwards, and take note of your own place and role in a community. Who are you among these people? How is your life and your aspirations connected to what other people are attempting to do in their lives? This relational dimension of being a person can be lost if Socratesâ motto is understood solely as an exercise in inward meditation on what matters in oneâs own life. Self-examination in the Socratic sense can consist in an inward and an outward orientation. The former may be the one that springs to mind when we read the motto in isolation, but the latter discloses the social dependencies of human endeavors, and is essential in attempts to understand fallibility at work. A Socratic examination of life at work can consist of asking questions that highlight relational and collaborative aspects: How is what you are trying to achieve at work dependent upon your colleaguesâ efforts? How"
117,181,0.997,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Conclusion In this chapter, I set out to explore in more detail the way in which daily wanting is worked upon in the context of unfolding sociomaterial interaction in residential dementia care, and I asked what we may learn about good care from taking a closer look at these practices. I stated that wanting is an expression of subjectivity, and being respected in this is a prerequisite for living a good life with dementia. At the same time, wanting something is a relational process. How it is acted upon thus is an ethical and political question. Nobody wants to constantly be overruled by another person, and indeed much work goes into avoiding coercing somebody. To describe what is done instead, I coined the term âsociomaterial will-workâ. The concept highlights care workersâ and residentsâ attempts to align the otherâs wanting with their own as a form of labour and as dependent on sociomaterial relations. I described care workers doing will-work by (1) sculpting moods and emotions, (2) managing attention and (3) creative negotiation involving time and materialities. With smiles, cups of hot chocolate and foot baths, changes to the order in which care is provided and to who shows up at a residentâs bed, care workers strive for a positive way of relatingâof being ânicely engagedâ in conversation and activity. Will-work ventures into the space between doing nothing and exerting force. It is the âurgingâ that care workers name when seeking alternatives for coercion and neglect. I have argued that this aligning residentsâ wanting makes the caregiversâ work good care. I have offered an alternative understanding of the willânamely as something that is âdoneâ in sociomaterial interaction, in which it can be aligned by making it relational. Indeed, instead of dismissing âdaily wantingâ of those living with dementia, my analysis enables thinking about it. At the same time, the finding that moods and the feeling body can be appealed to in care encounters and that materialities can be used in creative negotiation with residents, offers new ways of thinking about what good care may entail in situations in which residents want something that their care workers understand as ânot goodâ for them. As such, my contribution is one that can inform care practice."
299,25,0.997,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"questions of values and public policy somehow corrupts their academic purity and virtue. Moreover, like others, I found that applied work enlivened the basic one. Thus, when I tried to sort out when privacy should yield to the common good, for instance, to protect public health, I found it helped me think through more generally how one is to deal with clashes between two core values (Etzioni 1999). Most of what follows is applied. To some, the term âethicsâ evokes values such as veracity, loyalty, and truthfulness. However, the ethics domain is much vaster. It concerns itself with individual rights, social justice, peace, and much else. Cases in kind follow. They all deal with current challenges both in societies and on the global level. Part I asks how we can determine what a good life is. Many measure it by how happy people are. Happiness in turn is assumed to be derived from high income that enables one to lead an affluent way of life, mainly viewed as being able to consume a lot of goods and services. However, evidence shows that by and large (there are always exceptions when one deals with social science data), once income rises above the level at which peopleâs basic needs can be met, it adds little to their happiness. Other social scientists studied whether what one does gives meaning to life. However, meaning can be gained by joining a gang or ISIS. At least from an ethicistâs viewpoint and, as I see it, from most peopleâs personal viewpoint, something is missing, something rather profound, namely, the sense of doing good. It is a sense that leads people to make sacrifices not for self-glorification, not to feel good about themselves, but to service others. I am not writing about saints, but about parents who take care of a severely disabled child, about spouses who take care of their partners with cancer or Alzheimerâs, and about volunteers who go into places that are unsafe to help those in danger (see Chap. 1). The three Abrahamic religions have a clear perception of what human nature is; I call it one of a moral wrestler. Although they differ on the weight they accordâand the ways they depictâthe forces that make us stray, they share the basic understanding of human nature. For Catholicism, the original sin plays a greater role than the yetzer hara (bad instinct) in Judaism; and neither embraces the Protestant notion of predestination. Islam emphasizes humansâ inherent goodness (fitrah), which must be upheld against base desires and sinful outside influences. However, all see life as a struggle between doing good and being tempted to violate our sense of what is right; all see room for some form of punishment as well as redemption. Social science by and large, with notable exceptions, has moved away from this view of human nature. This is not true merely for economics but, we shall see, also for psychology, sociology, and anthropology. If we could do more to incorporate the concept of the moral wrestlers into the social sciences, we might be able to learn more about what makes for better human beings and better societies (see Chap. 2). Part II is dedicated to an examination of human nature. Are we out to maximize ourselves and does society work well when each person focuses on what they consider good? On a basic level, this issue has been debated as the difference between homo economicus and homo sapiens. Those who adhere to the rationalistic paradigm, the one that treats people as homo economicus, assume that humans have"

These work like interfaces through which we experience, interact with, and semanticise (in the sense of making sense of, and giving meaning to), the world. In short, we grasp reality through concepts, so, when reality changes too quickly and dramatically, as it is happening nowadays because of ICTs, we are conceptually wrong-footed. It is a widespread impression that our current conceptual toolbox is no longer fitted to address new ICT-related challenges. This is not only a problem in itself. It is also a risk, because the lack of a clear conceptual grasp of our present time may easily lead to negative projections about the future: we fear and reject what we fail to semanticise. The goal of The Manifesto, and of the rest of the book that contextualises, is therefore that of contributing to the update of our conceptual framework. It is a constructive goal. We do not intend to encourage a philosophy of mistrust. On the contrary, this book is meant to be a positive contribution to rethinking the philosophy on which policies are built in a hyperconnected world, so that we may have a better chance of understanding our ICT-related problems and solving them satisfactorily. Redesigning or reengineering our hermeneutics, to put it more dramatically, seems essential, in order to have a good chance of understanding and dealing with the transformations in (a)â(d) and hence shape in the best way the novelties in (1)â(4). It is clearly an enormous and ambitious task, to which this book can only aspire to contribute.

247,214,0.997,Humanities World Report 2015,"the needs differ immensely across disciplines. Many of our interviewees had very simple demands for such support: (NA11) Office or quiet space. Library with books and Internet access. Computer. We donât need a lot, but thatâs not so true for people doing visual and sound studies and new media. They need more sophisticated computers. All of these things are available on this campus. The notion that the humanities are cheap, as in they do not require a lot of infrastructure, was mentioned by several interviewees. One respondent said: (NA7) Science requires a team of senior investigators and an army of graduates and postgraduates and you need space and expensive equipment. But in the humanities, itâs difficult to recruit grants to remove you from teaching. I am on a number of grant evaluating committees, and we have a deliberate policy of trying to weight our provisions for junior faculty because they really need it. Iâm taking a sabbatical year next year, which is three years overdue. I need to finish a book, and what I need is time to sit at home in my pajamas and write. Weâre about to lose our offices that we have right now, and weâre moving to a new site, which just has cubicles. But that doesnât bother me too much. This sentiment was echoed by a Russian scholar who did not identify any special needs: (R2) Nothing special, actually; every anthropological research is usually done by a single scholar, we do not work in teams as sociologists usually do, so that in this respect we are closer to historians and philologists. Another respondent identified infrastructure as research time: (NA10) I think part of the infrastructure of a university has to be regular time to do research. I think thatâs being questioned, due to a lot of budget cutting. I think universities that can bring in large grants, so itâs the lab sciences. I think the humanities are having a hard time establishing the need to do research. There is a feeling that the research can be done on the side in inexpensive ways. But, of course, it takes time and travel. Our university has dramatically improved its"

I think weâre well beyond the era in which borrowing methods and discourse from other disciplines makes one interdisciplinary. The bar that I would set today is that you have to be working with other people in different disciplines on common projects. NA10: Interdisciplinary work is almost by definition collaborative, because itâs very hard for people to control knowledge within one discipline, much less many. As8: Even in the single field of linguistics and culture, you may see a single scholar, or indeed scholars from a single country, with a different source of language and materials/resources that are oftentimes different. They have to work together and conduct collaborating research. E13: Iâd divide [interdisciplinarity] into two types: soft and hard. ... Hard interdisciplinarity involves specialists from different disciplines gathering together over a common object or text. As a result, their own individual ways of operating have to change. E2: Of course the term interdisciplinary is vague. Do we mean that scholars of different fields collaborate and that each brings in a specific expertise? Or do we mean, as some people claim, that we need to dissolve the disciplines altogether? (C) Post-disciplinarity: The last extract suggests a different concept altogether, also alluded to by another respondent: E9: Iâve heard the phrase post-disciplinarity used. Iâm not sure I understand it, but I donât think interdisciplinarity will or should take us to a point where disciplinary boundaries actually vanish. We shall leave post-disciplinarity on one side, since it was only of marginal interest to our respondents.7 By contrast, collaborative interdisciplinarity is extremely important to the humanities, as we shall see in more detail below. For the purposes of this chapter we shall refer to it as âmultidisciplinarityâ. One point should be uncontroversial: a multidisciplinary project will require individual researchers to be interdisciplinary in the first sense mentioned above (A)1, and to an extent the second (i.e. using the sources of other disciplines). But it surely does not require the third, (A)3, a strong sense of mastering another discipline; indeed the"
378,99,0.997,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"Manfred Max-Neef developed a helpful tool to understand human needs that increases the creative imaginary space for sustainable innovations that target experienced utility and well-being. This popular Chilean development economist has called himself the âbarefoot economistâ after spending 12 years with the poorest communities in Latin America. His moment of revelation came when understanding that none of the mainstream market-based economic concepts were of any relevance to them. Much of his work has thus been built on proper empirical experience in non-marketized societies. It therefore provides some fascinating reflexive systemic insight into the effect that living with certain institutional setups has on the way actors see and experience the world. In an interview with Democracy Now! Max-Neef explained that his return to immersing himself in experience rather than deducing theoretical models made him conclude that we need an entirely new language in order to understand better what people really need. According to him, mainstream economics has nothing to say in support of the poorest people in the world if strategies are supposed to emerge from local systems rather than disrupting them. If you live in poverty, behaving like the selï¬sh, insatiable atomic accumulator of mainstream theory wonât get you very far, says Max-Neef: âYou cannot be an idiot if you want to survive; you need networks of cooperation and mutual aid.â In those communities, he observed, competition and the promise of monetary gain are not required for people to demonstrate enormous creativity, innovation and willingness to collaborate (Max-Neef 2010). To illustrate which fundamental human needs he observed instead, Max-Neef has developed a matrix whose key messages I summarized in Table 3.2. The matrix limits the number of existential human needs to approximately nine. He does not argue that the list of nine existential needs is deï¬nitive or set in stone, but he says he is conï¬dent that a change in those basic needs would at best occur at a very slow pace. Also, these needs should be understood as interrelated and without hierarchies, except for the need of subsistence or survival, which comes ï¬rst (Max-Neef 1992: 204â205). Here Max-Neef differs from other need-satisfaction approaches, many of which place self-actualization at the top and social, as well as material"
131,145,0.997,The Ethics of Educational Healthcare Placements in Low and Middle income Countries : First Do No Harm?,"Clearly there are many reasons why this approach is both necessary in India and Uganda as these roles are not considered a part of normal health worker roles and would present real challenges to the NHS, in terms of privacy and infection prevention control. Once again experiences such as these and the critical thinking they provoke provide fertile ground for discussion with peers on return rather than immediately transportable policy options. In the spirit of epistemic humility, having particular concrete experiences and being able to reï¬ect on them and conceptually abstract such experiences, gave some students the opportunity to reconsider how they would practice in the future, in terms of how they would relate to both colleagues and patients: I wasnât too aware of understanding people and the differences they have due to culture and religions and. I think just having a bit more knowledge . . . if I was to obviously care for a patient who was of a different religion or culture I think I would probably take the time to go away and actually learn a bit more about it and to be able to understand them a little bit better like in that sense.

143,568,0.997,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Mindset #5: The Educator The Educator, also known as the friendly guru, possesses the gift of deeply comprehending both worldviews, intuitively reading individuals, and seeing the worldview others adhere to. He or she is in a unique position to create awareness for both sides, lifting those stuck in their narrow mindset out of their own boundaries. Without the Educator, there would be no reflection on what is happening or, more importantly why it is happening. The Educator introduces reason and structure into what is happening and connects history with the present in order to show options for the future. During our research, we were fortunate enough to meet a handful of these community members who have become role models in Kenyaâs international technology sector. It is impossible to draw up a conclusive list that does justice to all of them, but this short list combines tremendous wisdom with a strong sense of community that Ken Njoroge, Mike Macharia, Joseph Mucheru, Isis Nyongâo, Carey Eaton,19 Jimmy Gitonga, Ory Okolloh, Erik Hersman, Juliana Rotich, and Bitange Ndemo all share in common. Pitfalls of this mindset are that you become a highly visible go-to person, meaning you will get enmeshed in highly political and contested issues, will have to play multiple roles, and may easily get sidetracked into a political agenda that would not allow you to fully focus on business."
78,368,0.997,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"If action is indeed characterised as a beginning whose consequences can never be undone, scientific discoveries and technological developments are action by excellence, as they cannot be undone and correspond to new beginnings. Thinking about what happens to us and framing the challenges in a hyperconnected era is one of our generationâs tasks, and this ought to be done by balancing fears with confidence and control with wonder. Indeed, to reinforce and nurture the public space in a hyperconnected era, there is an urgent need to balance the omniscience-omnipotence utopia, pervaded by fear and control-seeking, with the plurality and natality perspectives, pervaded by confidence and wonder. This balancing generates a space where fears and risks are compensated by the confidence in beginnings, shared intelligence and practical wisdom. It generates a space where meanings are rooted in âin-betweensâ rather than in âthe more, the betterâ and where challenges are approached with âboth/andâ dualities rather than with âeither/orâ dilemmas. To some extent, it invites to shift away from the dominance of a risk governance approach to a literacy approach. Literacy is the set of skills, understood in a wide sense, which enables the experience of plurality. Hence, abilities to communicate are central to literacy understood in the wide sense. In a pre-digital context, literacy is about reading and writing, but it goes much beyond the technical ability and reaches out to the ability to understand, to contextualize and to be persuasive. For example, each of us learn very young and, most often, very painfully, the subtleties of communication. We all experienced the differences between what we want to say to our mother or to our best friend, or between what we want to say in confidence, and what we want to say loud and clear. When things go wrong, we learn and we adapt, and little by little, we acquire that extended literacy. Literacy is made of a mix of technical, social and ethical skills and considerations. It is also highly evolutive."

We have used the word awareness here as in many cases this is not about developing new skills but remembering and revitalising skills. In this example the bio medical engineer volunteer is talking about the fundamental science that lies at the heart of his profession but lies dormant in the UK: Itâs made me think about things completely differently. About the way I work in the NHS particularly in times of resource constraints and trying to think laterally about the way you do things. It makes you go back and think about things in their fundamentals . . . of course physics and that kind of thing. UK degrees are fantastic but they are so theoretical.
46,29,0.997,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"valuable achievements that must be considered for evaluating a personâs situation comprehensively. If not, it might get overlooked that a good choice with respect to one domain was â all things considered â a tough or even tragic one. Since capabilities are a kind of freedom, it also becomes clear that the approach gives a high value to peopleâs agency, which is, according to Sen, understood as the faculty to act and bring about change according to oneâs values and objectives (Sen 1999b, 19). In the end, people should be able to identify with their choices and actively shape their own lives; it is therefore decisive for a just society to provide the conditions to make this, in fact, possible. It is crucial to understand that the notion of well-being as it is used in the capability approach must not be identified with what is typically termed âwelfareâ in political philosophy or economics, where the term is understood exclusively in relation to individual preferences or happiness. As shown, this position was powerfully rejected by Sen. Or to put it differently, the notions of well-being, on the one hand, and functionings and capabilities, on the other, are closely related, and there is by now a vast literature confirming this diagnosis (Comim, Qizilbash and Alkire 2008; Deneulin and Shahani 2009; Biggeri, Ballet and Comim 2011). Welfare, on the other hand, in Senâs terminology, is only one aspect of the overall well-being of a person and must not be reduced to it. A personâs capabilities (but also achieved functionings) depend on many different factors. They are a product of a personâs abilities and skills, as well as the political, social and economic context she finds herself in. They obviously usually depend on resources; without the necessary goods, it is simply not possible to live a self-determined life according to oneâs own conception of the good. However, what matters is the ârelationship between persons and goodsâ (Sen 1980, 216) and what the relationship allows us to do and be. In this context, the term âconversion factorsâ is helpful. It was introduced by Sen to conceptualize the relation between resources and the realization of certain functionings, and it calls attention to the degree a person in fact can use the goods at her disposal for her purposes. At least three different kinds of such factors can be identified, all of which have to be taken into account when evaluating the real freedoms somebody has access to (Sen 1992, 19â21; Sen 1999b, 70â72; Robeyns 2005, 98â100). First, there are personal conversion factors. Our physical, psychological and emotional characteristics, as well as our achieved levels of skills, influence what we can âgetâ out of the resources we command. If we are in good health, for example, we do not need a lot to achieve basic mobility. However, due to illnesses or impairments, moving around can"

Not only is the language of techpreneurs with all its buzzwords completely different from that of other sectors, but also what is considered to be âhipâ and âcoolâ differs. The devil is in the details!â and admittedly, learning the details is difficult and time-consuming. A training program for both Kenyans and foreigners, however, could facilitate a controlled exposure to the culture of oneâs counterpartâa unique opportunity to learn how the game is played. Not everyone picks up these peculiarities right from the start. Rather than going through a painstaking six-month period in which everyone only scratches the surface, this solution can be a unique opportunity to learn the meaning of and reasoning behind each othersâ behaviors and terms. As always, there are also downsides to this mindset. The Innovator is met with opposition, resistance, and a small peer group to work with. Counterintuitive and inherently new solutions face an uphill battle until they become recognized and fully accepted. The bearers of this mindset will therefore find only few supporters who fully understand and support the solution. So being able to take a long breath when working through potential failures and to bear with comments such as âI told you it ainât worth it!â are assets."

The only way scientists have obtained this knowledge is through an engagement with death.â Pastor DieudonnÃ© earned a License degree in physics (equivalent of an M.A.) from the University of Kinshasa (UNIKIN). After working as a teaching assistant at the university for a few years, he abandoned the academic world because he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his faith with his work as a scientific researcher. For Pentecostal Christians, any knowledge that distracts the Christian from Godâs path is perceived as anti-Christian. Knowledge in itself is not diabolical or divine, rather the difference lies in the source of knowledge. Some knowledge is God-given (euti epay ya Nzambe). Most Christians have received this gift of knowledge (bwanya ya Nzambe), which allows them to understand the world, to interpret signs of the material world as metonyms of invisible powers and spirits, and act upon it (Pype 2012: 112â115). However, other kinds of knowledge are inspired by the devil (ya Satani). To understand whether certain knowledge is âChristianâ or not, one should look into its consequences: does it sow death, as, for instance, the atomic bomb? Or does it harm people, as do weapons, for example? The types of knowledge that do not âcome from Godâ are abstract and irrelevant for daily social life. Pastor DieudonnÃ© explained how he had refused to continue his postgraduate studies at the university. Having finished his License degree with a dissertation on metallurgy, he felt uncomfortable with the level of abstraction that studies in physics entail. The mysteries of abstract thinking undoubtedly lead to the devil. According to pastor DieudonnÃ©: There were certain demands that I could not perform. Especially things that you cannot grasp with your five senses. We have five senses, but some scientific experiments rely on another sense. As a Christian, my 6th sense is my faith. If I cannot feel, taste, hear, see, or smell something then I need to believe that God is there. But, I know that in those sciences, people do not rely on God."
90,75,0.996,"Informatics in the Future : Proceedings of the 11th European Computer Science Summit (ECSS 2015), Vienna, October 2015","Each research project is a chance to enhance our assets being it in the form of knowledge and experiences, the developed algorithms and tools, written publications, social network of collaborators or something else. With each project we would like to ensure a better starting position for the future. Sometimes collaborations or just research projects themselves turn out not to be what we were expecting. Still we want to recognize their potential benefits for our long-term vision and turn them into success. If we are putting our time and resources into something, we should do it honestly rather than minimizing the efforts needed to fulfill the requirements or just ensuring a few more months or years of funding for the people. We want to reach the goal with people improving in knowledge/experience, consciousness, happiness, richness. After finishing a research project people should have more individually and as a group. Similarly as in any business collaboration, also in research we should keep going until everybody walks away feeling goodâwe achieve a win-win situation, everyone wins and there are long-term benefits. This may take efforts, especially as there is often a limited time frame, but that is where the true leadership takes place. In any relationships, it is good to be kind, show gratitude, acknowledge contributions and thank people for their contribution whatever it is. We all like when our contribution is recognized, even if we do not work for that recognition. When we express our gratitude people are inspired to keep collaborating and contribute even more. To be successful in what we are doing we look at merging our goal and our life while keeping a good balance and no separation of all the ingredients. We know from our own experience as researchers that our research is with us all the time and often some of the best ideas we get outside the office hours. As suggested by Mladenic in an interview (Brodnik et al. 2006) âbeing a scientist is more a way of life than occupationâ."

Having been on paternity leave for 2â4 weeks, all the interviewees had acquired at least some basic skills, such as changing nappies, by the time they stayed alone. Most fathers therefore describe the acquisition of skills as a process which goes beyond the role of a care âhelperâ. This includes learning how to be an âindependentâ or self-sufficient carer by taking on responsibility alone, learning the ins and outs of emotional care rather than just instrumental care such as changing nappies and feeding, and âtesting oneselfâ as a solo carer. Thatâs when we truly become parents, isnât it? When we have such a close tie to them that we know just by the kind of crying, or by his manner, what he wants â¦ that kind of awareness is very important, I think it shows how close you are, and thatâs what it really means to be a father. (Rafael, 28, management consultant, 1 child) To all effects this was my first complete experience of being a fatherâ¦ during that time you understand thatâ¦ there you have the real proof that your life has changed, right? And that everything will be different, your priorities change completely, your priorities, your timetable, everything. So I, during that month, I had the concrete proof that the most important thingâ¦ was that baby, it was Pedro, and also the idea of the responsibility that this implies is something which, I think, really changes you as a person, especially someone who has decided to use the shared parental leave, it was a big experience (Ricardo, 43, economist, 1 child)"

Still, I believe that historians who study the history of foreign countries need to experience the culture firsthand. I have lived more than six years in the US. I do not think that I could write American history the way I do without that experience. NA10: I think every field is affected by digitisation of knowledge, generally for the best. But I think thereâs still a lot of value to traditional methods and working into archives. Further along the critical spectrum, others warned of various risks to the quality of research: ME2: Iâm lucky to be of the generation that has made the transition between the analogue and digital worlds. Iâm familiar with analogue research, so I know about and can be critical of the hierarchy of sources available on the Internet. Not all sources are on the same level. Itâs often difficult to get students to understand that. ... some younger researchers lack a critical sense of the sources, because they have not worked enough with analogue material; they attempt to minimise the qualitative assessment of sources. Af1: Digitisation tends to produce the younger âcut and pasteâ scholars, too lazy to do actual under-the-hood, retro research, they surf Google books, cut and slice expressions and segue them into a conference paper. ME4: As regards research, digitisation does not necessarily save time. The facility of digitisation makes you keep searching, and so makes you avoid the moment when you need to think and write. (Itâs easier to read on a computer than to think and write.) Digitisation doesnât affect or reduce the real effort required for research. In the end itâs got to be your own work. As13: It seems that researchers read less and have less incentives to work on something really deep or taking a lot of time. However, it must be stressed that all but one of these also pointed out the advantages of digitisation, so they were by no means purely negative. In fact only one out of our 89 respondents showed outright hostility.: NA4: Iâm a Luddite. I think that DH are essentially bankrupt.

Events at SÃ¸bakken nursing home serve as an illustration of the extent to which the ethical emphasis in an organization should be on avoiding harm or on doing good. The leaders Borvik and Norlin shifted the attention from the former to the latter, thus prioritizing the residentsâ wishes for more activity and coming closer to life over protective measures. Creating awareness about the distinction between prescriptive and proscriptive ethics is in itself valuable, since it can generate rich discussions about priorities in the workplace. One outtake from what doctor Westad told me is that it can make sense to immediately acknowledge a mistake, in order to stop victims from wrongfully blaming themselves for a terrible outcome. Both doctors who contributed to the discussion of learning from failure in healthcare see open talk about past mistakes as a genuinely future-oriented initiative, when it is motivated by a wish to learn and do better next time. An ethics of fallibility can have a normative component, addressing how one should respond to mistakes at work, and a descriptive component, focusing on explanations of moral misconduct. Normative input can come from duty ethics and consequentialism, traditions that differ in their emphasis on whether moral qualities like respect, honesty, and fairness are more important than maximizing good outcomes. Descriptive input can"
46,17,0.996,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"children, in particular toddlers and newborns, compared to that of (some) animals. There is some philosophical debate about why we should treat such young children differently compared to bonobos or other apes, and this debate is centered on issues of rationality, autonomy and the ability to experience harm. We do not have a clear-cut answer and we also do not engage with this question in this book. Our premise is to say that human children have a moral status which implies that we should treat them with respect and be concerned about their well-being and well-becoming. We will later on explicate what this means in terms of responsibilities of different agents of justice towards children. Whether this moral status should also be applied to other non-human children is not our concern; we leave it to others to debate whether or not a just society would also require us to battle child poverty among non-human animals. Closely connected to that issue is the second question: the status of children not yet born. This question has two aspects, both of which are connected to a rich as well as controversial philosophical and political debate. On the one hand a society which wants to realize justice for all its children has to take a stance on abortion and also on what it owes to children during pregnancy. We also do not give a answer here, although we will briefly touch upon the issue that it can have harmful consequences if the mother is poor during pregnancy and that this health risk for the baby has to be taken seriously. It is a very delicate question whether or not the right answer here is mandatory prenatal care, based on evidence that being poor influences reproductive health and that girls living in poverty more often get pregnant (voluntarily and involuntarily) than their non-poor peers. On the other hand we focus in this book more or less exclusively on children already born, and we do engage with questions of intergenerational justice. Poverty reduction and alleviation, also during childhood, fight an injustice that should not exist from the start, and intergenerational justice is part of the larger question of how we can make sure that each and every child that is born is free of poverty. This book is organized in four chapters. Chapter 1 develops a concept of social justice for children. We will argue that the capability approach provides a good framework and discuss some issues that arise when applying this approach to children. Neither Sen nor Nussbaum have written much about children, how a capability-oriented concept of justice for children should be constructed and in what ways it differs from a concept for adults. The most important modification we want to make is to have a more dynamic understanding of functionings and capabilities, since childhood is a phase of development. Furthermore, an initial focus on achieved functionings seems advisable, since children"

However, my perception was a bit wrong, as I learned more about the psychological background than anything else. Fortunately, psychology does interest me, mostly as to how people think and their perception of products and their surroundings. In my opinion, however, the learning line is a bit too much. After one course of 5 ECTS, I had learned enough about psychology, with the two other courses of Human in Technology merely acting as repetitions of the ï¬rst course. My interest faded because of these repetitions and my motivation began to decrease. The project, on the other hand, was a lot of fun. We used the information we learned in a practical sense. My conclusion therefore is that one course with lectures and one project is sufï¬cient; in this way, you keep students motivated. In this project, I learned about the different persuasive techniques, the usability and how all these features are important for achieving an application with a goal of changing the way people think. The USE learning line could stand to become more useful for students, however the concept is clear and USEable!"
245,1291,0.996,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"instruments through which they may reorient the EHEA. There are therefore still opportunities for higher education practitioners and policy makers at different levels to make their voices heard. This section of the books arising from the Bologna Researchers Conference provides a valuable contribution to this debate through three reasoned and well-researched contributions as well as, it is hoped, through this essay brining the section together. Rather than seeking to draw an overriding conclusion from three contributions that all stand on their own and that approach the âfuture of Bolognaâ from different angles, I would like to offer a ï¬nal thought from yet another angle. With the possible exception of âemployabilityâ, there is hardly a word that occurs as frequently in current education debate as âqualityâ. However, quality is more often than not presented as an established entity, something that is âout thereâ and all we have to do is strive for it and preferably achieve it. However, it makes little sense to assess whether we do something well unless we know what we are trying to do in the ï¬rst place. The quality debate may be rich in describing ways of reaching and not least measuring quality, but it is surprisingly divorced from considerations of what purposes education should serve (Bergan 2005; Council of Europe 2007, 2012). Consideration of the link between higher education reform and the broader purposes of higher education has also been subdued in the development of the EHEA. This is not to say it has been absent. The EHEA builds on a set of values that comprise academic freedom, institutional autonomy, and student participation, and several communiquÃ©s refer to the multiple purpose of higher education. Nevertheless, a relaunch of the European Higher Education Area, intended to give higher education policy the place it deserves in European debate, but equally to give European societies the kind of higher education they deserve and that they need for their future developments, will require a much more sustained debate on the kind of Europe we would like to have and the kind of education we will need to achieve our goal. This debate will need to be philosophical and practical at the same time, since it will need to establish a clear connection between principles, policy, and practice. That will hopefully (re)motivate the higher education community, the policy making community, and our community tout court. It is the kind of debate to which the present author has sought to contribute (Bergan 2011) and to which the following quote from the Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul is highly relevant: And so I ï¬nd our education is increasingly one aimed at training loyal employees, even though the state and the corporations are increasingly disloyal. What we should be doing is quite different. It turns on our ability to rethink our education and our public expectations so that we create a non-employee, non-loyal space for citizenship. After all, a citizen is by deï¬nition loyal to the state because the state belongs to her or him. That is what frees the citizen to be boisterous, outspoken, cantankerous and, all in all, by corporatist standards, disloyal. This is the key to the success of our democracy (Saul 2009)."
123,175,0.996,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"moral philosophies of John Stuart Mill (2002/1859/1863) and Jeremy Bentham (1970/1789). It claims that the decision-maker should always seek to maximize the overall sum of utility for all those affected by the choice at hand, and thus base the decision on a kind of cost-benefit analysis on behalf of all stakeholders. Duty ethics, based on Immanuel Kantâs moral philosophy, holds that there are moral values that should never be sacrificed in the name of a good outcome. Human dignity, fairness, honesty, and respect, should always have priority over considerations about common utility, according to this line of thinking (Kant, 1998/1785). Teacher A can seek advice from these two ethical traditions. Duty ethics will claim that she should choose the honest and truthful option and be open about the mistake towards Alex and his mother. Considerations about whether their lives will be better or worse depending on the disclosure or not are irrelevant from this theoretical perspective. In the here and now, we should be open with each other and not hide the truth, no matter what might happen next, because that is in line with core values of human dignity. Consequentialism, on the other hand, will claim that teacher A should consider the probable outcomes of her alternatives. Will it be harmful to Alex and his mother to continue their lives under the illusion that teacher A has seen great progress in his behavior at school, and is optimistic about his future, or will it be more harmful to them to have the truth about the mistake revealed? Answers to these kinds of questions will determine the consequentialist advice to teacher A. At the moment in time when teacher A has to make her decision, there is no concrete way of knowing or predicting future outcomes for Alex and her mother. However, studies of the so-called Pygmalion effect indicate that teacher expectations about performances from pupils can become self-fulfilling. In one study, teachers at an elementary school were told that some pupils could be expected to be âintellectual bloomersâ in a particular school year. Tests at the end of that year showed that the pupils identified in that manner actually had enhanced performances, compared to other pupils, even though they from the outset were singled out randomly. Positive expectations from the teachers, then, appeared to have a concrete, positive effect on how the students"

143,434,0.996,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"entrepreneurs, we noticed two challenges getting in the way. One, many ideas are not scalable, usually because the original problem itself is too small. Two, teams rigidly focus on building their idea, as opposed to doing whatever it takes to solve their problem. What do bigger problems look like? When Elon Musk was deciding what to work on after PayPal, he wrote down a list of five issues that will most affect the future of humanity: the Internet, sustainable energy, space exploration (permanent extension of life beyond earth), artificial intelligence, and reprogramming the human genetic code. Tesla and SolarCity were both founded to take on the significant challenge of sustainable energy. And while he initially focused on better electric vehicles, better batteries and solar installation were clear additions. One of our favorite Kenyan companies, Sendy, recognized the need for access to formal goods within an informal and continuously evolving infrastructure. Most folks do not receive goods at an address, making e-commerce mostly ineffective. And between an inconsistently distributed retail sector and terrible traffic, it is costly to track down the goods you might want. Today, Sendy offers real-time, point-to-point urban deliveries using smartphones and motorbikes. But it is not inconceivable for them to manage last-mile scheduling and logistics for any kind of inventory. The challenge is enormous. We can refer back to Tataâs humility as an example of putting problems above ideas. I mentioned his original sketch was a shielded bike. It looked a bit like a fancy rickshaw. However, after two months of prototyping and testing, his team found that consumers were much more interested in an affordable car. So they shifted. As long as he was achieving affordable, safe transit, the specific idea was not important. One might look at our challenge of creating a human-centered, learning mindset around problem solving and say, âObviously you should pursue education for founders or young teams.â But what my time spent doing new business creation and transformation at Jump taught me is that people learn through the work.

If everyone lied all of the time, or many people much of the time, it would be very hard for society to function. This matter provides an illustration of the Snow Two Cultures thesis: computer scientists trying to address fault tolerance and safeguard computer networks have made considerable progress towards understanding how a system can work correctly even when some or possibly many of its components, consistently or occasionally, deliver wrong information. Every ethicist should have read the Paxos paper. On the other hand, the most obvious lesson, once you have learned from such work how to deal with systems that lie, is that if there is a choice truth always wins. We deal with lies because the world is imperfect and TCP/IP loses the odd packet or two, but things would be so much easier if Alice could always trust Bob. The rational arguments are not enough; truthfulness in human affairs is in the end an ethical issue. What better evidence could there be, for the last example of a discussion arising from an informatics conference, than the titanic Volkswagen lie of 2015? The software engineers, and their managers, and most likely the managers of their managers, apparently thought that results-faking software would gain VW a few points of market share. The company will, it seems, recover; but only after providing, through its egregious violation of the Principle of Truth, a textbookquality example of unethical behavior, sure to serve many generations of future ethicists."

In fact, this is the way identity-related aims are addressed in Estonian national curriculum: âIn the process of solving historical problems [...] [the studentsâ] national and cultural identity, tolerance and positive attitude to the values of democracy developâ (Estonian Government 2002, similarly 1996, 2011, 2014). As can be seen, the curriculum mentions these things rather in passing, cautiously, so there is a lot of space for individual interpretations by the teachersâmore space than in the case of the more cognitively oriented aims. This explanation is also supported by the teachersâ comments on the statement The current teaching of history is too âself-centredââconcentrating on the Estonian and European past produces young people with narrow worldviews. Although some of the teachers admitted that current history teaching in Estonia was too self-centred (ethno- or Euro-centric), most of them did not oppose the focus, either supporting Estonia- and Europe-centred history teaching with pedagogical or ideological arguments (thus negating excessive self-centredness), or considering such a state inevitable. The âself-centrednessâ was justified by the necessarily limited teaching time and, thus, the inevitability of choosing some kind of a focus in history teaching, as well as with reference to the pedagogical principle that teaching should commence with what was closest to the student. Connected to this was the argument that history teaching is first and foremost about understanding oneself and learning about oneself and that in support of this goal Estonian and European history is the most important (see more in kello and Masso 2012).

[Also, from answer to publication question: They have no choice but to conduct research on smaller areas within disciplines.] R6: For Russian humanities, though, [interdisciplinary] approaches are still novel, largely due to the fact that most researchers are locked into discipline-specific departments. Some respondents went a step further and said that monodisciplinary attitudes manifest themselves in institutional ways: NA7: The disadvantage for doing interdisciplinary work, especially for young scholars, is that professional life is still very much embedded within disciplines. And so you donât get credit for multi-authored publications, for example. NA10: There are many challenges of interdisciplinary work. Many of the professional rewards are within disciplines and departments. Interdisciplinary work can be easily marginalised ... R9 (an environmental historian): Many disadvantages concern the position of an interdisciplinary researcher to find her/his place in the professional community. You are not a biologist any more, but for a long time even after getting a degree you are not considered to be a professional historian. It happens because you have no connections, you do not have a prominent teacher in your main field, thus you are not belonging to any group of disciples. This is particularly important for the scientific community in my country where many people have their own professional genealogy, being a disciple of a disciple of a famous intellectual.

I would like to propose some additional metaphors that describe the architect. These are not distinct. Rather in an agile world each architect has all of them. Personally, I have acted in all these roles, often in many of them simultaneously. 9.1 The Tribal Elder In this role, the architect acts as the guardian of the collective memory. He has seen the domain evolve and the architecture evolve. He understands why decisions were made. He understands the deeper meaning of the various dependencies. He is also very expeâ rienced beyond the scope of the particular problem. He remembers mistakes that were made, and how they can be avoided. He remembers useful lessons. He has seen how many predictions that were made with certainty do not materialize, and he has seen many surprises. He has a wealth of stories that he is happy to share to make his point. He might not be as âhands onâ or as quick on his feet as some of the younger ones, but he more than compensates for that with maturity, understanding of human nature and experience. One of the challenges with retrospectives and with lessons learned, is how do we preserve these insights over time? How do we maintain a record of these lessons? In a lean or agile environment, this tribal elder is constantly making sure that lessons that were painfully learned are not forgotten. The challenges for a tribal elder are many. Too often he expects that people will accept his word on authority alone, rather than on the merit of his idea. On occasion we might ï¬nd that the tribal elder has lost touch with the times, as lessons learned a long time ago might not be relevant any more, and the tribe elder will try to keep us in line with dogmas that are no longer relevant. So this architect needs to be humble and to have a very good sense as to when his experience is of value, and when it is outdated. In my group, we are constantly caught up in the tension between a generic product and a customized product tailored to meet the customer. This tension has existed for over twenty years, and we periodically cycle from one extreme to another. Now, when someone suggests a shift from a generic product to a customized product or vice versa, the tribal elder (me) will tell stories of what worked and what failed in the past. The tribe elder will warn of pitfalls, while taking care not to dampen any enthusiasm."
116,59,0.996,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"In the discussion and analysis of a particular dilemma, the focus can be on all six of the dimensions addressed in the Navigation Wheel, or it can be on the tension between the answers we receive to two or more of the questions. The decision-maker can face a choice of giving primacy of economy (here we have a potentially profitable business option) or identity (it is not really us to act that way). The dilemma can be to prioritize between ethics (according to the principle of equality we can do this) and reputation (it may nevertheless harm our public image), or between law (it is illegal) and morality (I believe it is the right thing to do), and so on. The main purpose of the Navigation Wheel is to assist the decisionmaker in his or her efforts to analyse the available options and keep track of the relevant dimensions of the situation. Is a person who has participated in ethics training and become familiar with the Navigation Wheel better equipped to deal with moral dilemmas and work, and less likely to engage in serious moral wrongdoing? Organizations who hire me to conduct ethical training obviously hope so, but I think there are limitations to what we can achieve simply by making people familiar with tools of ethical analysis. If all it took to establish responsible conduct in organizations was ethical tools, this book could have ended here, with the presentation of the Navigation Wheel as the final analytic device to apply when facing moral dilemmas. Instead, it continues, to attend to how even people with excellent analytic skills, well trained in the use of the three versions of the categorical imperative and in other ethical principles, can become involved in moral wrongdoing at work. Even the ancient idea that tough moral decisions can be safely left to people of particularly strong and stable moral character, will come under critical scrutiny in the remaining chapters."

Itâs a vision from the info consumerâs side, not from the creatorâs. It ignores the investment of time, energy and thought into the creation of whateverâs being accessed or copied. Still, there is a lot to be said for public domain ownership including âopen sourceâ. It has to be the creatorâs decision of course, what level of ownership to respect. Mark Hardenâs Art Archive has a vast array of beautiful scans. For all intents and purposes, itâs a virtual storehouse of art treasures dating back to cave paintings. The siteâs philosophy is that people should feel free to lift five or six images for nonprofit purposes. Yet does not reality dictate that anyone can lift as many images as they please and put them to whatever use? Thereâs two realities. At the Battle of Trafalgar, or some such battle, Admiral Nelson declares, âFull speed ahead!â His assistant protests. âBut what about those ships?â Nelson, holding up a telescope to his blind eye, the eye everyone knows is blind, replies, âI see no ships.â Orâ¦âDo what I said.â When you say âreality dictates,â there are a lot of realitiesâ¦ So that is why I do not countenance most of todayâs so-called web standardsâ¦ We need something much better and it is my duty to try to make a different reality which can supplant that other reality. I mean, a few hours on the web and you can have a whole lot of gifs and jpegs. Now, those things are being posted with a lot of implicit assumptions which the courts will be settling later, and whether you can repost, etcetera, is entirely uncertainâ¦ By the way, all these museums that are trying to claim copyright on 2000 year old things that they happen to own, God knows whatâs going to happen with thatâ¦like copyrighting the human gene. Computer Lib decries âthe creeping evil of Professionalism.â âI see Professionalism as the spreading disease of the present-day worldâ¦â I guess my claim at this point on that subject would be that everybody is seeking greater legitimacy and better pay for what they do, whether welding chips together, typing, or passing on the supposed validity of art objects. Professionalism is the stance that âI am highly trained; therefore, my work should be very expensive.â In the case of what Talcott Parsons called professionalism, a highly technical definition, we have an association which governs entrance to the trade based on competence and training. So thereâs considerable similarity between the Plumbersâ Union and the American Sociological Association. The upside is charlatans are pushed out of the field. The downside is talented but unqualified people are pushed out and you donât have all the options you should. Nowhere is that professionalism elitist class more obviously breaking down than music.

57,102,0.996,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","Work With What You have We think of relations with respondents as a kind of role-play: we do not pretend to be anything other than ourselves, but we do present particular versions of ourselves that we think will help us build the relation, and establish the best possible connection with our respondents. There are widely different strategies for this, which have a little bit to do with oneâs personality, but actually more with how we are seen by others on the basis of ascriptive categories like nationality, age, and gender. Below, we set out some opposites to illustrate how different characteristics propel us towards different rolesâbut these are stylized foils. In reality, our interviewer persona is not so entirely fixed: it may evolve over time, it partly depends on the type of respondent, and sometimes we may even change gear in the midst of an interview to get more traction. Our researcher in India and Mexico, a young man doing research on forms of repression, typically tries to make the relation with respondents as informal as possible, often meeting people multiple times, looking for ways to break the ice, trying to make it âclickâ. This approach seems quite natural when meeting journalists or human rights activists, who often have values similar to our own. But he has also applied it with âagents of repressionâ: police or security officials. One of his most revealing interviews has been with a security agent in a bar, who was detailing how he harasses opposition politicians for a living, while drinking and using cocaine. For our Morocco researcher, a young woman operating in the Arab world, such an approach would be a recipe for disaster: diving into informality with a relative stranger, seeking repeat meetings, being in places where alcohol or drugs are consumed could all lead to misunderstandings. Instead, she stresses her professional persona, makes it clear that interviewing people is âworkâ, and while engaging in the necessary small talk as described above, she deflects questions about her private life. Our Kazakhstan researcher, operating in a context less marked by stereotypical views about the sexual morality of western women, steers an in-between course. She would not meet respondents at a bar or in the evening, but her approach is a little more informal. She uses her nationality, making assumptions about respondent impressions of Italian culture, and emphasizing similarities like the importance of hospitality, late dinners, and big weddings.

The same is true for the capability of practical reason and that children should be able to plan their own lives. This is certainly not possible in the same way as it is and should be for adults. Likewise, political participation, having the right to seek employment and to hold property are highly problematic for children, especially younger ones; these are not proper capabilities for them. If we think in terms of functionings instead of capabilities, which is more adequate for young children, these items on the list become even more problematic. Other capabilities are suitable for children, like health and education, but they should be interpreted in terms of functionings rather than capabilities, and they have to be adapted in regard to the actual development stage of the child. Basic competencies and knowledge in literacy, math and science are a good thing for a child of school age, but for the first months of life, children need to achieve other functionings first and have certainly other needs. The same inadequacies can be found in regard to Robeynâs list, but that is no wonder, since she drafted it not as a universal list but one with a particular topic in mind: namely, gender injustices; more specifically for adults, not young boys and girls. Being able to work in the labor market is for many children more a threat than a unit of justice; being able to raise children is a very problematic issue for teenagers, and there are many good reasons to assume that reproductive health during adolescence also includes family planning and being protected from unwanted pregnancy. What we would like to make clear is simply that a list for children has to look different than a list for adults, even though there are some very important overlaps. We now want to present and discuss six criteria for selecting functionings and capabilities that matter for children for the issue of social justice: (1) A functioning or capability that is used for an analysis of injustice has to reflect a truly important dimension of a childâs well-being or well-becoming; in this sense, it has to be child-specific. Justice for children is concerned with things that really matter for them and not with supplements or âextrasâ. As we have seen, the category of functionings is at first a formal one, and in theory, one could make it a question of justice if a child is able to whistle or stand on her head. This would, however, be a distortion of the concept of justice, which should look at functionings that make a substantial difference to a childâs well-being and well-becoming. The genuine importance"
46,64,0.996,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"are definitely many valuable but noncommensurable options as to how to live oneâs life as an adult, maximizing well-becoming is probably not even a coherent idea. We see, therefore, that questions concerning the well-being and well-becoming of children are deeply entangled with general considerations about the good life. And since we agree with the diagnosis of political liberalism that there is no objective way to fully determine the nature of the good life (Nussbaum 2001; Rawls 2005), we also reject the mentioned ideas about maximization. On the other hand, we are always concerned with context-sensitive thresholds that are specified according to the living standards in that society. This reflects partly what is possible in a state but targets a different issue; namely, that it is important for justice for children that children do not fall behind for arbitrary reasons and that determining the adequate threshold by looking at the level that typically is achieved in that society is essential. For example, if most children in a society are able to acquire a certain level of knowledge and if that knowledge is used for further education or in the job market, it is reasonable and feasible to demand that all children be brought up to that level. This does not imply that each and every child should become a scientist but that each and every child should finish primary and secondary school and that all children that do so should be on more or less the same level. Finally, justice for children in modern welfare states always has a forward-looking perspective. As technology and livings standards grow and as we gain more knowledge on childrenâs lives and health, we naturally can provide for them better; as a consequence, demands of justice also improve. In a historical perspective, this is quite obvious: the standards of justice for children 150 years ago were different; we did not know about many illnesses or about how they were transmitted and cured and we were still at the beginning of building public infrastructure like railroads, electricity and clean water in all places. Hence it was simply not possible to have all children grow up and live under the conditions we can easily secure for them nowadays and are seen as ânormalâ today. Of course, the requirements for participating as an equal in the society one is part of have changed considerably, too. The knowledge and education needed for practicing full citizenship in a modern society today is different from what was necessary fifty or sixty years ago. And since this feature of political participation is usually given much weight by capability theorists (Anderson 2010; Nussbaum 2006; Sen 2009), the relevant thresholds have to be adapted accordingly.

I contend that doing will-work (rather than neglecting or overruling residentsâ wanting) makes the caregiversâ work good care. Good care includes being attentive to peopleâs desires and striving âto lighten what is heavy, and even if it fails it keeps on tryingâ (Mol et al. 2010, p. 14). Good dementia care, then, âpersistently strives to create conditions for and enable better interaction, and also to afford people living with dementia positions in which they can act and exert valued forms of subjectivityâ (Moser 2010a, p. 295). Coercion or neglect forecloses opportunities for âbetter interactionâ. Through coercion, positions in which subjectivity can be exerted are not afforded, and wanting can, by definition, not be shared. If wanting cannot be done together, and cannot be aligned, it remains unilateralâ which can be harmful in situation where one must agree and where there are power differences. In these situations, will-work aims to achieve what is good for those living with dementia (an assertion that often relies on professional knowledge) in a way that is pleasant for the resident as well as for the caregiver. At the same time, it must includes a reflecting upon whether the task at hand must be completed now, and in this particular way. In the remaining pages, I describe the work care workers do on residentsâ wanting as (1) sculpting moods and emotions, (2) managing attention and (3) creative negotiation involving time and materialities."
46,60,0.996,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"and in the life of the community (Lansdown and UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre 2001). Such an approach to childrenâs development also makes clear that the concepts of functionings and capabilities, which are often clearly separated on a conceptual level, are in practice deeply entangled. Certain functionings have to be secured so that real choices can be made, and the situation of children illustrates this point further: as evolving agents, they rely on certain levels of health, education and social inclusion in exercising their choices â not only in terms of accessible opportunities but of actually realized functionings. Thus, for many social evaluations, it is reasonable to make functionings the most important category of analysis, especially when children are the target group. In the next chapter, we will also show that a focus on choice and freedom is often not the best way to scrutinize and evaluate the injustice of child poverty. Without downplaying their competencies, skills and agency, in many contexts it is basic to look at what has been effectively achieved and not at the options that are available to them. It matters, for instance, that children are in fact well nourished, not that they are capable of being so. A few provisos are necessary: Firstly, we do not claim that this list is finished. It is open for discussion and further scrutiny, and other researchers using different methods or working on questions in a different context will produce slightly different lists. Secondly, the similarities to the lists of Nussbaum and Robeyns suggest, as we have stated before, that some functionings and capabilities are important for both children and adults. Thirdly, this list is still very vague and needs to be further specified in order to be able to be applied in different contexts. Nonetheless, it is a start, and we will use this list, more specifically some of the functionings and capabilities on it, to further examine the injustice of child poverty in the next chapter in more detail. We position ourselves therefore with a rather pragmatic approach within the mentioned discussions about adequate lists for theorizing justice. We do not aim for completeness; nevertheless, we are confident that on this basis we will be able to build a strong case that child poverty profoundly violates what social justice demands. Before we can do that, however, we have to discuss the issue of the rule or principle of justice we want to endorse."

Peate (2008) similarly identiï¬es the importance of communication skills for negotiation whilst Banatvala and Macklow-Smith (1997) refer to communication as affecting the ability to liaise between diverse groups. The following example illustrates these boundary spanning skills and their value to a hierarchical NHS: I often didnât ask the name of the scrub nurse because I never thought it would be relevant to me, I never thought Iâd want to know the name of the guy whoâs pushing the trolley in and out of corridors. But you come here and realise actually just by getting to know the cleaner which you may not do back in the UK so just building those personal, professional relationships with people can make a big difference to your outcome.

The sentence above was spoken after one of us (FC) had countered what she interpreted as the academicâs territorialized landscape of interdisciplinarity with a question about the untoward relationalities unfurled by postcolonial studies â as well as by other interdisciplinary theoretical domains that have been committed to queering the pitch of orthodox histories and geographies. In many ways, we understood this researcherâs response. In calling for interdisciplinarity, no one wants to be misunderstood as championing sloppiness, and few, we imagine, want to be interpellated as the inevitable jack of all trades and master of none. We certainly would not want to find ourselves endorsing, say, an analytical philosopher who planned to get by in an interdisciplinary project, untrained, as a sociologist; we do not wish to champion an anthropologist who imagines she can, in a trice, become a conceptual artist. But in this chapter we want, nonetheless, to challenge the spatial logic of fences and neighbours â and the specific forms of territory it brings into being. Here is discipline thought through the figure of the happy householder â willing to reach over the fence, for sure, but still very keen to maintain a proper sense of where the boundaries lie. Indeed, there is an important claim embedded in this metaphor (and one hears it all the time) of good fences, insofar as it dramatizes what is still sometimes an unquestioned assumption about the primacy of the private space of disciplinary training. Whatever our â and your â feelings about private property might be, it strikes us that there is a pernicious notion, embedded here, that maps intellectual inquiry on to the taken-for-granted boundaries of relationships between public and private space. (In this regard, we find it intriguing that many writings that address cross-disciplinarity employ language that conjures private property relations. We might turn, for example, to the philosopher Brian Massumi, who discusses the âpoachingâ of a scientific concept (which, moreover, on his account, does not result in âprevent[ing] it from continuing to function in its home environmentâ, and who maintains that if he âwere a concept, [he] could emigrate and stay behind in [his] home countryâ [italics in original] (Massumi 2002, 21)); or to Thomas Osborne, who describes interdisciplinary movements via languages of poaching and trespass (Osborne 2013).)

And this is also what taxes make us do if they should sustain. In our contemporary societies, there is an endless giving and receiving going on with state and with societyâevery day and in manifold different ways. Against this background it is interesting to explore taxation in terms of reciprocity. We saw in research about taxation that four different types of reciprocal relation could be identified. First, reciprocity that expects something very explicit in return for taxes paid; a tit-for-tat relation. I expect something in return for having given/paid my tribute to the state although, as Mauss stated, obviously time lags between giving and receiving something in return. Second, it implies a relationship with others in the sense of wanting to behave in a similar way. Reciprocity here is a copy-cat relationship. Such a reciprocity can be invoked by any human behaviour: it is learning by doing what others do and making sure we do the same thing. This way of seeing reciprocity is closely related to situations where we all pay a fair shareâthe third typeâwhen taxpayers comply because they expect that others will pay their fair share. If we all put what we owe into the same treasure chest, we have all paid. Implicit here is our trust that taxes collected will be distributed evenly. Finally, reciprocity also regards being treated uniformlyâit is a question of equality. Here scrutiny is directed towards the power of the law and the interpretation of the law through"

Really engaging the students successfully means starting with them where they are, iteratively exploring with them rather than lecturing at themâwhatever the expectations that their own field sets about how education actually works. Exploring in this way is a challenge to do within the framework of their existing curriculum. At least, it is a challenge to do in a satisfactory way. More time and depth are needed to get past the flattening of social science to a set of recognizable tools or a body of largely pre-intuitable societal knowledge. We will need more, and longer-term, engagements if we want to get across its power as a set of alternative methodological strategies for getting a grip on the world. The starting point for the PAGES collaboration was this realization: interdisciplinary collaboration is hard. That proved true all along the way. When it succeeded in PAGES, the outcome had much to do with trust, voice, and personal relationships. The only adequate way to close is with admiration for those colleagues and NE students and postdocs who made it possible for social scientists to engage with nuclear engineers."

86,458,0.995,Nuclear Back-End and Transmutation Technology For Waste Disposal : Beyond The Fukushima Accident,"25.1.2 Why has Such a Situation Occurred? One reason is that expressing oneâs opinion is not necessarily viewed in a favorable light at school and in the home. The way of thinking in Japan, encapsulated in the saying wa wo motte totoshi (harmony is of utmost importance), leads to virtue being placed on conforming to the views of others rather than asserting oneâs own opinions. It is partly because of this feeling that Japanese people in general have had relatively little practice in expressing their ideas and opinions to others. In recent years, debate-based lessons have been introduced by some elementary schools, but the spread of such lessons through elementary school education as a whole has not been sufficient. The second reason is rooted in the pivotal role given at the elementary level to sakubun, or essay writing. Pupils practice exploring their emotions and putting them down on paper, but not how to think in a logical way and support their opinion with evidence. A third reason given for the situation described here is the complexity of social problems nowadays, making understanding difficult for âordinary people,â who just give up even thinking about the issue. The more complex issues become, however, the greater the necessity for citizens to engage in discussion, express their opinions, and then make decisions. It is, therefore, incumbent on each citizen to grapple with and discuss such issues. Judging from the present situation, it does not seem that staging public debates, having experts offer explanations, or other simple methods can serve as a substitute for real engagement by the citizens.

223,106,0.995,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"To the budding geographer the time-bound message could not be misunderstood: Capture the power of social relations in a net of scientific laws and then, like your friends in physics, chemistry, and medicine, you too will have acquired the means not merely for understanding the world but for changing it as well. If the natural scientists know how to construct rockets that take them to the moon, if they know how to generate energy by enriching uranium, if they know how to save lives by transplanting hearts, then your duty as a social scientist is to discover similar techniques for eradicating poverty! Before you accept that challenge, though, be sure to ask yourself first why no one now reads Plato and Aristotle for what they had to say about physics or medicine, then why so many continue to return to the plays of Sophocles and Shakespeare for their insights into the human condition of hopes and fears, love and hate. How does the circumstance that we have accumulated knowledge in some areas and not in others relate to Aristotleâs remark that we should look for precision in each class of things just as far as the nature of the subject admits and that it would be equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician as to demand scientific proofs from a rhetorician? No small order given to a young man inexperienced in the actions that occur in life and therefore prone to pursue each object as passion directs. And yet, how could I possibly have ignored the challenge? GO ON, GO ON. The list of required readings included the classics of location theory, cognitive science, decision theory, systems analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, spatial statistics, and a sprinkle of historical geography, all of it somehow yoked together in Walter Isardâs conception of Regional Science and its extension into Peace Science, the latter firmly anchored in the Quaker-thin interface of scientific knowledge and political action, John Deweyâs pragmatism and the collections of the Barnes Foundation never far away. A formative experience it was, the handsome fellowship that in 1963â1964 took me to North Armorica and the intellectual hubs of the Wharton School, Berkeley, and Northwestern. Great. Yet, in hindsight, the seeds might well have been planted 10 years earlier by the odd gymnasium teacher who did whatever he could to introduce his rowdy pupils to the concentric rings of von ThÃ¼nenâs isolated state and the cost curves of Alfred Weberâs isodapanes. Perhaps I was the only one to pay attention, but the truth is that I can still feel in my body the boyâs excitement when he literally saw why there were so many gauchos on the Pampas and so many steel mills along the Ruhr. The rhetorical power of geometric construction on the high wire, von ThÃ¼nenâs agricultural landscape depicted as an archerâs target with the bullâs eye as the central city on a homogeneous plain (more correctly the Junkerâs own estate), Weberâs factory finding its place of least cost, the Archimedean point that is located at the center of a Euclidean triangle whose corners are the concepts of transportation, labor, and agglomeration.

117,161,0.995,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"residents who do not want the same as themselves in activities of daily living (ADL) care encounters âdifficultâ or exhibiting âchallenging behaviourâ (e.g. Higgs and Gilleard 2015, pp. 89â90). But they frequently stop short at unpacking how this encounter plays out when it presents itself. To want something is an expression of subjectivity, and being respected in oneâs desires is as much part of living a good life in a dementia care home as it is elsewhere. But how can we think about what residents want in cases which lead their care workers to assert that what a resident wants is not good for her? Indeed, if care were just about âgetting the job doneâ then the way it is done would not be relevant. In practice, however, this clearly matters. As care worker Cici remarked: âAs a normal human being you do not want to be forced all the time!â Similarly, one may not want to be left to oneâs fate all alone either. Indeed, there is a lot in between. This is not to say that coercion or neglect never happens in care work. When Ms Lichthart woke up covered in her own faeces, but was nevertheless resisting a shower, two care workers held her in a tight grip while another washed her quickly. It seemed âthe only way to do thisâ. Ms Lichthart indeed needed a shower, but by washing her this way, what she wanted was overruled. Yet, rather than concluding that âthings are not going well in careâ because these situations do occur, I want to emphasise here that such generalisations about care work miss something: they miss the work that care workers do on a daily basis to prevent these extreme measures. This work becomes most visible in situations in which what a resident wants is opposed to what a care worker wants. Debates on the will are an obvious starting point to take a closer look at these situations. Thinking about the will has long been the domain of philosophers. In the most general sense, philosophers have understood the will as the ââfaculty, or set of abilities, that yields the mental events involved in volitionâ, where volition is understood to be âa mental event in the initiation of actionââ (Brand 1995, p. 843 in Murphy and Throop 2010, p. 7). Debates on the topic have focused on the (in)compatibility of relative freedom and determinacy of human choice and action. Within these debates, moral philosophers attach particular value to the free will. After all, whether, or to what extent, we can act freely informs whether we have a choice to act in a good or bad way in the first place. Put differently, without a will that is free (at least to some degree), moral decision making is not possible."

This adaptive flexibility was also the basis for the outcome, which proved to be much more diverse and complete than could have been anticipated. Phase 3, hence, has provided us with unique know-how about and insights into human behavior, influences, and participation in processes of change.

However, with a deep understanding of computing, one can not only raise the questions of morality in more depth, but one can also see that Total Information Awareness is a technically unworkable fantasy (like the Star Wars program pursued by the Reagan administration in the non-fictional 1980s) providing a false rationale for treating everyone as a suspect. In other words, one reason that we must understand computers now is so that we can understand what is happening, and make informed choices, as members of a computationally-steeped democracy. We need to understand computing so that we can see past deceptions about what computers can do, and how computers work. As"

In our society, we were socialized to go to high school, get extremely good grades, go to university (and, in my case, go to the top course), excel in the university, and then be successful. Breaking away from that moldâcoming to terms with the realization that âHang on, this particular path that has been prescribed doesnât actually make sense for me and doesnât fit with my interests and passionsââwas quite a clear departure from the norms of our society at the time. Of course, my dropping out of the university was difficult for my mom, because it is not what people do. Saying, âWell, this doesnât make sense for me; Iâm going to do something differentâ is a form of rebellion. And the way you then express itâand it was not rebellion for rebellionâs sakeâis a very specific reflection of why this was not going to work for me and why there ought to have been a much better, much more exciting path to pursue for my career. What were some of the main learnings you took with you from 3Mice? 3Mice (a Web hosting and design company in Nairobi) was a fantastic learning opportunity because it was the first business I set up. The most important thing I took out of 3Mice is that one can actually do these things and do them well. I think the fact that, from nothing, we set up a business that became reasonably well known in the country was a very powerful lesson. The other lesson unfolded when we became an Africa online company, witnessing a Pan-African business in the making very early on in my career and to see, again, that it can actually be done. The other more practical lessons were on the âhow-toâ side, like how to get products to market and how to build teams. What really matters are people. 3Mice was a partnership of three people, and what got us all excited was creating a company very early on. However, it was a common motivation, a common vision, and a common purpose that kept the partnership alive as the business model changed and evolved.

The truth is, there is no shortage of intelligent, exploratory entrepreneurs in Kenya. The challenge is recording and exposing what they have learned so that how we work can be improved. The faster we can make the learning cycle, the better we can become. As a normal practice of creating ventures, Brave is deeply involved in both listening to and learning from respected entrepreneurs as well as encouraging experimentation and improvement in every new generation of builders.

They could be educators and help the blind learn how to see; this is what science has done for the entire human race. But learning to see is a chore, so most, especially marketing people, are not interested. This is too bad, especially when we consider the efforts the two-eyed people like Ted have to go through to even have a glimpse happen. One of the keys is for the two-eyed people to turn into evangelists. Both Ted and our mutual hero, Douglas Engelbart, worked tirelessly over their lifetimes to point out that, in this dial-tone world, the emperor not only has no clothes but his cell phone canât transmit real music. Yes, Iâve mixed a metaphor or two. Another key is to make a working system of the future. This was ARPAâs and especially PARCâs main mission. Make something that works, not just for a demo, but for a group of people. Some of what I showed during my talk is what Steve Jobs saw, and the Macintosh was a result of his glimpse and also interpretations of that glimpse by him and others at Apple. But it missed a number of really important ideas. Many of Tedâs and Dougâs ideas have been missed. So, with all this working against someone like Ted, why bother having visions? Standard schooling is already trying to convert two-eyed children into standard children, that is, into blind children. Why not just put more effort into this and save all the bother? To me, the visionaries are the most important people we have because it is only by comparing their ideas with our normal ideas that we can gauge how we are doing. Otherwise, as it is for most people, normal becomes reality, and they only measure from that less broad view of reality. Toss Ted back into this mix, and youâve upset the Apple cartâand thatâs what we need! This allows us to see that normal is only one of many possible constructions of reality, and some of them could have been much better. In addition, the normal ideas in the future could be very different and much better from what is considered reality today. Letâs be very thankful that we live in a place where two-eyed people were really supported in the 1960s and at least tolerated today. And let us also be thankful that we have a two-eyed person like Ted Nelson who has been tirelessly energetic about not just having ideas but also about going out and telling people about those ideas, not letting them die, not letting them get absorbed into the low-pass filter.

118,578,0.995,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"17.2.3 Greater Public Good and Rationality, by Denia Djokic, University of California, Berkeley In a society comprising many stakeholders, there is no consensus on the definition of the âgreater public good.â For the case of each stakeholder, this utilitarian construct is based on a certain combination of: information, misinformation, different ways of interpreting the same information, lack of information, and most of all, different value systems, some of which do not always fit into the neat frame of a traditional cost-benefit analysis. In student discussions at this summer school, we tried to delve deeper into the meaning and function of the cost-benefit analysis. We asked questions such as whether seemingly âirrational decisionsâ were merely a different framing of the same cost-benefit analysis, where different stakeholders (e.g., nuclear engineers in contrast to the public) simply weigh the risks and the benefits differently. There is no simple answer, and furthermore I have no doubt that the solution depends on much more than just âcommunicationâ between the stakeholders. A good first step, however, is to encourage this kind of thought among the population that has traditionally been a major influence in top-down decisions: the nuclear engineering community. All these insightful and fruitful discussions at the summer school made me wonder: why is it that we nuclear engineering students are not usually challenged to think this way? We seem to be well trained in our field, and yet there seems to be a very large gap in our education. Undoubtedly, nuclear engineering students from UC Berkeley and the University of Tokyo are well educated in the breadth and depth of the discipline. However, in my nuclear engineering graduate school training to date, I have found that we are groomed to be inside-the-box thinkers without the necessary training to understand nuclear issues holistically. To solve technical problems, we are taught to draw clear boundaries around a limited problem, because without a clear definition, you cannot find a solution. Despite the fact that this method of solving problems often breaks down when scaling up to societal levels, the rhetoric among nuclear"

In his opinion, friends doing business together have to be on guard all the time, because of the fragility of this combination: Q: How in general do friendship and business relate to each other? Have you been in a situation where they got into conflict? P10: (â¦) business is quite a test for friendship (ispytanie dlia druzhby). Many passed the test but many did not, and either friendship or business crashed. (â¦) it is a difficult test (tiazheloe ispytanie). I have at the moment no conflicts between friendship and business, but if you are conducting business with friends you have to be constantly ready that it will lead to conflict. The same with family relations. Some think that it is a bad idea to conduct business with your wife. But there are situations where it works well. (director, p10) The respondent does not detail the nature of the test. But this could mean, for example, giving a customer-friend credit without guarantees, or not demanding written, formal contracts which could be interpreted as a lack of trust between friends. Unlike in previous examples, friendships could also be built upon already existing business relationships. Some respondents considered this variation easier than the preceding one: In my opinion if a good business exists, a friendship will be born. The other way around is rarer and thatâs why I try to avoid building business with friends. (general director, p7) Another respondent supported this reflection by warning against starting a business with someone only because he is a friend. It may be pleasant to drink beer with a friend, but besides this, he may turn out to be a useless business partner: But the other way around [turning business into friendship] â as much as you like. You can have a great time working together and in addition you may also spend free time together. (director, p39) This difference may be due to asymmetric dynamics of transformation of the ties.

223,306,0.995,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Knowledge as Practice: Keeping Information Available A new approach is thus not only desirable but apparent as soon as one specifies how a pragmatic philosophy of knowledge should proceed. It should not simply identify as true what proves useful (although a notion of use will indeed be important). It should ask how people act in contexts in which the concept of knowledge makes sense. The strategy just outlined has already been employed by Craig (1990), who introduced an additional reflection to make his point: What is called knowledge can be best constructed in contrast to a sociocognitive state of nature without or before If what I shall say is along the right lines, the core concept of knowledge is an outcome of certain very general facts about the human situation; so general, indeed, that one cannot imagine their changing whilst anything we can still recognise as social life persists.

99,333,0.995,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"As BOOTs focus on providing welfare services that are not yet being offered (enough) in a particular neighbourhood, there is a strong interaction with the local welfare system in the different neighbourhoods in which they are located, and they maintain a closely cooperating network of partners. In fact, the most innovative aspect of BOOTs is the binding role that an educational facility like the HvAâas a fresh and more neutral actor in the field of welfare provisionâplays between different (welfare) organizations that are operating within the same territorial boundaries, yet not necessarily cooperating much. When BOOTs first started, for many welfare organizations that were already in those neighbourhoods, this was a difficult transition to make, as they had been used to providing a particular service in a certain way and were generally very much focused towards the insideâon their own activities/ organization. BOOTs bring many of these different, so far disconnected, actors together, which not only provides a clearer overview of the services that are present in a certain neighbourhood and of those that are lacking but it also stimulates all partnering organizations to have a more outward look. As the manager of BOOT noted: (â¦) You have to give it a lot of time to build up a trusting relationship. And, the most importantâand in that you can educate other organizations a bit tooâis that you put the residents at the centre of it all. Because itâs actually a bit weird that you would see this as competition â¦ You have been put there with money from the government to carry out services for the residents. If you can do that better with someone elseâs help, it is a bit weird if you wouldnât want to do that.

Organizations were very much turned towards themselves, and well, they had to start working more result-driven.

118,770,0.995,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"23.6 Citizen Scientist: From Nuclear Engineers to GKS1350021 Dear Nuclear Engineers, will you take up the work of creating and operating an online, open-access, comprehensive, scrupulously updated, politically neutral,15 and above all transparent and comprehensible âlibraryâ of nuclear science? Which would have all the features, pointed out earlier, of the Ex-SKF Blog, and if not Pinedaâs poetic skills, at least her ability to communicate scientific concepts and facts in words accessible to lay readers? For this to happen, you must think and act like citizen scientists. You must understand that your value to society is not determined by your expertise; rather, your worthiness as a nuclear expert is determined by your motivations and actions as a private citizen. Because: every technological artifact, from microchip to nuclear reactor, is developed and deployed by human hands, and each one comes into being through a very long chain of human hands comprising the entire process from manufacture through installation to deployment to maintenance. In a so-called normal state of affairs, we pay scant attention to this chain of human hands despite knowing that each pair of hands is attached to an individual human being whose skills and work ethic affect our lives profoundly through their effect on the final quality of the technological artifact they have helped to produce. On the other hand, the abnormal state of affairs is when a crisis suddenly forces us to pay attention to the chain of human hands. In a crisis, such as the meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi NPP, not only do we begin to see the human agency behind technology that normally goes unnoticed, we realize how just a few hands can make an enormous and even irreversible difference in the way the technology under crisis will henceforth affect our individual lives. How communication enters the picture: Although it is true, and not just fashionable, to say that âtelling the whole truthâ can no longer be expected from mainstream media, one of the lessons learned by GKS1350021 is that turning to alternative sources of information via the internet or personal networks was not inherently more assuring or indisputably more reliable. Short of giving up on filtering information altogether, the same questions will appear before us again and again no matter what the form of communication: How are we to understand, assess, and integrate the information that is before us?

Although the debate about whether to accept grant funding or venture capital funding is very much alive among entrepreneurs in Kenya, it focuses on a small piece of the puzzle. Entrepreneurs should consider very carefully the choices they make about not just their revenue model, but also the myriad other aspects of organizational culture that they adopt. When designing the structure of a new company, what templates are being used to influence it? Incubators? Peer competitors? Successful foreign companies? If the latter, how different is the market those companies succeeded in from the one you are in?

124,206,0.995,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"Each agent will correspond to a unique set of partitions of histories at choice points, and along any history, there will be a particular set of choices the agent makes and without which the agentâs life would not have followed that history. So from the point of view of that history, it will seem that the agentâs choices will have accumulated to make the agent the individual she has become. From this point of view, a simple version of existentialism seems vindicated. But it is more complex than that, because the choices of others also influence the history one takes, and therefore the subsequent choices with which one is faced. In the end, then, the individual one becomes is profoundly influenced by the choices of other agents, as well as by her own, and this is where the simple existentialist picture fails. And there is another layer of complexity added when we look beyond a single history. The totality of the agentâs choices throughout the Belnapian world is also uniquely associated with that agent, and reflective not merely of what the agent does become (along this history or that) but also of the agentâs potential, which we may consider is equally essential to their identity. At this scale we begin to see the agent as a unique collection of possibilities for action. When we survey this larger picture, balancing the agentâs tree of possibilities against the developments of those possibilities along a given history, we find a new perspective on the old nature/nurture debate: we need not choose between nature and nurture as the sources of oneâs character, and we must indeed add a third factorâwill. Nature has its role in providing our potential as seen in the treewide totality of the choices available to us; will has its role through our choices; nurture has its role in the choices of others which influence and limit our choices. Together they work, along any given history, to create a uniquely matured version of the agent, different from what they could have become had they not had that potential, different from what they would have become had they made different choices, and different from what they would have become had others chosen differently, as well. Another aspect of the focus on agency rather than on agents, as we have begun to see, is that there is nothing in the models for such systems that rules out the possibility that a given agent has been making choices throughout time, and will continue to make choices throughout time along each history. This is, of course out of keeping with the fact that the logic is intended to reflect the situation of mortal agents and agents who are not perpetually active. If we undertake the task of constructing a quantified logic of action we can expect to be able to remedy this situation, perhaps by introducing a distinguished predicate is alive into the language and making appropriate provisions for its interpretation in our models. The many quandaries associated with quantified alethic modal logic tend to make us shy away from a quantified logic of action (which could hardly present fewer such challenges) at least for the moment. But let us contemplate a slightly enhanced propositional logic of action and use this to get at least a preliminary look at some of the challenges involved in taking account of the finitude of agents. Suppose that in addition to the other more or less standard components of models for our logic of action we include a function Q (for quick, in the sense of alive)"
82,35,0.995,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"To say that infinitism has consistently had a bad press would be claiming too much. Infinitism had no press at all, since until very recently nobody took it seriously. The reason for this is not difficult to discern. In an epistemological tradition dominated by Aristotelian and Cartesian foundationalism, a position like infinitism is highly counterintuitive to say the least; for how could anybody, in Aristotleâs words, âgo through infinitely many thingsâ? It is therefore not surprising that infinitism is hardly, if ever, mentioned in treatises or textbooks; and if it is mentioned, then it usually serves as an example of a blatantly ridiculous way to go. Yet it cannot be denied that infinitism sits well with some modern ideas about the nature of knowledge, such as that knowledge is essentially fallible, and that the human search for it is, indeed, without end. Despite many attempts to show the contrary, it is not at all clear how these ideas, which so many of us endorse, can be smoothly combined with foundationalism or even coherentism.15 In this book we will investigate the consequences of an infinitist response to the regress problem. We do not propose to defend infinitism as such. Rather our aim is twofold. On the one hand, we intend to show that some standard objections to the position are not as strong as they might seem at first sight. On the other hand, we explain how our analysis of these objections brings about insights that cast new light on the traditional positions, foundationalism and coherentism; as we will see, a careful analysis of infinite justificatory chains will teach us interesting novel facts about finite ones. In the end we somehow try to get it all, sketching the contours of an infinitist version of coherentism, which also acknowledges the foundationalist lesson that we should somehow make contact with the world. We will return to this in the final chapter. All-important for the development of infinitism was the work by Peter Klein. Around 2000 Klein wrote a number of papers in which he took the bull by the horns and presented infinitism as a genuine competitor to coherentism and foundationalism. Here is how Klein introduces his view in a relatively early paper: The purpose of this paper is to ask you to consider an account of justification that has largely been ignored in epistemology. When it has been considered, it has usually been dismissed as so obviously wrong that arguments against it are not necessary. The view that I ask you to consider can be called âInfinitismâ. Its central thesis is that the structure of justificatory reasons is infinite and nonrepeating. My primary reason for recommending infinitism is that it can 15 For a prominent attempt at reconciling foundationalism and fallibilism, see Audi"
278,1,0.995,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Industrial ecology has come of age: it has its own journal, its own society and, in this volume, a first full retrospective â âtaking stockâ of its first quarter of a century as a scientific field. It is a remarkable achievement. To speak of society as having an industrial ecology would barely have been understood, as little as three decades ago. Early in the 1990s, I submitted an article for a newspaper with the phrase industrial ecology in it, only to have the editor send it back to me, corrected to industrial âeconomyâ. At the time, we all knew exactly what the industrial economy was (or thought we did), but clearly industrial âecologyâ could only be a typo. When I explained that it was not, the editor deemed it best to remove the term, because âno one would understand itâ. Two decades later industrial ecology is a clearer concept than industrial economy. The former even has its own Wikipedia entry; the latter, strangely, does not. Language is a curious commodity. Its malleability appears sometimes to be almost infinite. Meanings change and mutate over time, as intellectual territory is created and destroyed. We can respond to this linguistic contortionism in several distinct ways: at least two of them are wrong. One of the wrong ways is to suppose that the meanings embedded in terms are not just fixed but rightly so. We can spend a lot of time and energy defending the territory that language creates: defile my meanings at your peril; they are part of my identity and protect my legitimacy in the world. This is a subtly disguised variant on G. E. Mooreâs (1903) naturalistic fallacy: what is, is what ought to be; and woe betide offenders. The best way to avoid such an error is not to be too attached to the precision of language. Alternatively we can celebrate the loss of meaning in late, postmodern, advanced consumer capitalism, where nothing is any longer sacred, and definition counts for naught. Accepting this fluidity of meaning, it is all too easy to allow ourselves to float above rigour and define away contestation. In fact, a cynical variation on this theme is to deliberately employ such tactics to create your own territory. Academics throughout the ages have fallen foul of this. Let us put two unfamiliar words together and build a career from it. Come on; it is easy: epigenetic precognition, categorical"
116,127,0.995,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"workplace beyond ethics. Confirmation bias is the tendency we have to notice and seek information that confirms our beliefs, and to be inattentive to information that provides us with reasons to change our beliefs. The phenomenon is well documented in research (Nickerson, 1998), and produces formidable challenges in many professions. Police investigators can make up their minds about which person has committed a crime, and only pursue and notice information that confirms that conclusion. Teachers can have preconceptions about the intelligence and abilities of their pupils, and fail to see upward and downward spirals in their developments. Researchers can be so satisfied with their hypotheses and explanations of phenomena that they become blind to glaring counterevidence and reasons to revise them. In these and other professions, knowledge about confirmation bias is part of the professional training. This is nevertheless a pervasive decision-making trap, and one that emphasizes the need to have communication climates where colleagues look out for each other and intervene when someone at work stubbornly holds on to one belief or viewpoint rather than revises it in the light of new and relevant information. The other psychological phenomenon that can slow down a process of identifying and addressing morally relevant aspects of behaviour in an organization is the bystander effect. Research on human behaviour in real situations and in experiments show that the greater the number of bystanders to an event where somebody needs help, the less likely is it that any one of them will actually help (Darley and LatanÃ©, 1968; Hudson and Bruckman, 2004). One cause for this effect seems to be that we consider responsibility to help in a situation to be one unit that we share evenly with the other people at the scene. If we are one hundred bystanders to a critical situation, we seem unconsciously to split responsibility into one hundred tiny pieces, leaving each of us with one hundredth of a responsibility to intervene and help. That is a very small piece of responsibility. If we instead are fifty bystanders, the responsibility is double that of in the previous situation, but one fiftieth of a responsibility is still very little. This way of thinking is what Derek Parfit labels mistakes in moral mathematics. We do have individual responsibilities to help, no matter how many others are present. It is unreasonable to consider responsibility to be one cake we share evenly into thin slices. Each has his or her own cake of responsibility. Another cause for the bystander effect is that each of us tend to interpret the inactivity of the others as a sign that nothing serious is going on, DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0014"

We produce the substance, we produce pure ideality. But come back to the reduction. However, we can only guess what we throw away when we realize phenomenological reduction? They could be two possibilities: â¢ Either we act so that it will try it and we will imagine that the thing can do without the other properties and therefore these properties are not essential (essence); â¢ Or we have some premonition of what is the nature of thong and on this basis we identify irrelevance properties of thing.

So the natural world - that world, I am talking about and I can speak about- precedes de facto existence the pure ego and his cogitationes as being on that is earlier.[6 Â§ 56] Our approach is something else. We believe that the constitution of any thing as a whole is always the composition properties of the stimuli that were pulling from sensors of entities, which are already in advance as a singular. They are what the human mind recognizes through operations identity and negativity, and these properties are combined by human thinking (given together) so way that we realize constituted a thing (for example a cup) as a whole. Properties have their basis in existence. Human thinking is only recognized that as a specific feature in that they are assigned to something what was already defined before by operation of identity and of negativity in encapsulated structure of endocepts. Property is what is formed and what stands out in relationships. Without any relationship can not reveal what actually is, can not reveal their essence. The stimulus comes to the brain even different neuronal pathways and they are also in different parts of the brain identified. For example the visual center of the brain is divided into several areas. One of them, for example, identify vertical lines and again from those stimuli that mark the horizontal, in other parts of the brain are different colors, is identified in another movement, etc."
395,63,0.995,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"However, it should also be noted that safety rules will not always develop spontaneously in professional cultures, or in the management practices of executives. Referring this time to the suggestion put forward by Rhona Flin, managers may well respond automatically that a good manager will always care about safety, as if there were no need for autonomous thinking or formal conclusions on this speciï¬c subject. However, specialised reflection and instruments are not in themselves enough, they need to incorporate communities of practice. Silvia Gherardi, once again, clearly demonstrates that safety rules cannot be learned outside the process of learning to work well. For example, people learn to pay attention to noises as a matter of both skill and self-protection. In Linda Bellamyâs contribution, we ï¬nd the major idea that all this is not purely technical: as a professional doing a job, one ï¬rst seeks to assimilate the right thing, what one can tell oneself and others is good work, valuable work, even and especially with respect to activities that carry little value in the symbolic division of labour. What this chapter adds to these ideas is the fact that all this takes place within the power relations speciï¬c to todayâs enterprises. The terrain on which these ideas are propagated is not indifferent to the way in which they reinforce situations or actors, and ask others to evolve in their practices or their power. This does not mean diminishing the status of certain actors to the beneï¬t of others, but changing the terms of the compromises. In power relations within large organisations today, the power exercised by support functionsâthrough the primacy of standardsâdeprives ï¬eld managers of a great deal of leeway for action. This power, despite the diversion via participatory management, leaves little room for regular discussion of the relevance of organisational rules. However, rulesâin particular safety rulesâ are not purely and simply âimplementedâ: they need to be discussed (what relevance, what correspondence with actual situations and the real problems that those situations occasion; what effectiveness, what degree of validity, what connection with other professional practices?). What this work argues for would therefore entail two-way information flows: information that not only flows downwards, but also upward flows of information that are rarely incorporated into managerial decision-making, often more taking the form of complaints from ï¬eld personnel and their managers, criticisms of existing rules and plans, etc. Central management departments need to be able to hear negatives. They need to be able to interpret opposition and debate as something other than resistance to change. This is anything but simple for central management, which feels challenged in its interpretation of the problems and in its construction of solutions, as well as in its authority, when there is resistance at ï¬eld level. This would mean companies that tolerate being what they are: spaces in which there is a multiplicity of points of view, between which there is no immediate accord or even a possibility of accord. What can be done for this to be tolerable, given that a company cannot permit disorder? To achieve this, it needs to be accepted that organising, introducing organisation into day-to-day operations, and notably the organisation of safety, is not about implementing organisational rules and letting them operate unchanged for a given time; the issue is organising, a continual activity of organisation. And this is not a task for the departments"
191,287,0.995,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"elements in the rapport phase, such as building trust and making the child feel secure. Not having to rush, and knowing that the childâs concentration span is limited, helps the interviewer stay calm and focused on the child, and able to observe the childâs behaviour, language and reactions to questions, various tasks and topics. During this session, the child should also receive information about the reasons for the interview, preferably in a way that is not an invitation to start talking about the actual case. Props like a picture book, a puzzle or drawing materials can be used in the first session, to help the child start talking. In DCM, drawing material is usually the only play material used. As in DCM, the child should be informed of the basic rules of communication for the interview, including that the child can say I donât know if there is something they simply do not know, and to correct the interviewer if they say something that may be incorrect. The props mentioned above can also be used to examine the childâs knowledge of concepts such as quantity, size, colours and shapes. By talking about neutral matters while using props, the interviewer and the Barnahus counsellor explore the childâs cognitive abilities. In the first session, questions should primarily be open, to see if the child understands open questions. The interviewer will also use more specific questions, such as what, who, where and how, to explore the childâs responses. In this session, it is also important to encourage the child to tell the truth. Young childrenâs understandings of abstract concepts like âtruthâ and âliesâ are complicated matters in a legal context. Here, however, the interviewer is only required to inform the child about the rules of telling the truth so that the interview meets legal requirements [Criminal Code Â§ 128 (StraffeprosesslovenÂ§ 128)] and fulfils the regulations of child investigative interviews Â§10 [Forskrift om avhÃ¸r av barn og andre sÃ¦rlig sÃ¥rbare fornÃ¦rmede og vitner (tilrettelagte avhÃ¸r)]. Normally, the interviewer introduces a recent event the child has experienced, and the child will then be asked to say more about itâ in order to explore the childâs ability to master the free narrative form. If not, information collected in the preparation phase will be used to explore the childâs abilities to narrate prior experiences."
117,164,0.995,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Work on Wanting: Sociomaterial Will-Work Before going into the ethnography of ADL encounters in which wanting is aligned, I want to highlight two methodological interventions that I make with this chapter. Firstly, I contend that the term âwillâ suggests a coherence that hides the relational nature of coming to want something. I therefore suggest that, rather than understanding the will as something we âhaveâ, we should understand it as something we âdoâ in unfolding sociomaterial interaction. Secondly, since my interest here is in understanding the alignment that is strived for in the process of wanting in dementia care settings on a daily basis, I differentiate between âwillingâ and âwantingâ. I separate a more cognitive intending, pertaining to the realm of the legal and long-term decision making (âwillingâ), from a more immediate, emotionally and physically informed activity (âwantingâ). I understand wanting10 to be a fundamental expression of subjectivity, including activities such as desiring, longing, wishing and, significantly, not wanting, which is done in unfolding sociomaterial interaction on an everyday basis."

Meanwhile, we retain an inexhaustible reservoir of vision and of contrariness. Once this power of resistance enlists practical ingenuity and living social forces in its service, it can do more than may seem feasible. The fact about us is that we are the beings who never entirely fit into the social and conceptual worlds that we build and inhabit. There is always more in us than in them. Although we can improve them, we can never improve them enough to lose reasons to resist them. We can â indeed we must â deny them the last word, and keep it for ourselves. We can â indeed we should â see, do and create more than they countenance. Social innovation is the creation of a new way of acting and cooperating in some part of society. As society is divided into distinct domains that are arranged according to different rules and conceptions â the worlds of business, of politics, of social services, of the âthird sectorâ, of the academy or of the media â the practice of social innovation must always begin in one of these areas. It must identify a problem that has not been solved in that corner of society and that cannot be solved by its conventional practices and established institutions. It must exemplify, through a practical initiative, a way of understanding the problem and of dealing with it. It must do its work in such a way that the initiative does more than address the immediate problem. It must also suggest a path for the reform of the part of social life in which it began, with implications for the larger society. For example, if it begins as business it must be successful as business and yet effective as well in the advancement of a concern that business, as now organised, commonly fails to share. Its innovations must point beyond themselves. Today the opportunity for such a practice is likely to be greatest in departments of social life that are orphaned by both the state and the market, or that lie in a netherworld between economic and political action, or that require initiatives that neither business firms nor political parties seem capable of conceiving and promoting. Such an activity cannot take place unless it has an agent. Social regimes are organised to reproduce themselves. If they allowed no room for their own reshaping, social innovation would be impossible â except through individual and collective rebellion, in the favouring circumstance of crisis. If they had done much more to open themselves to challenge and change than they have, social innovation might be unnecessary. It is in the real, intermediate situation that social innovation becomes both needed and possible as a practice bidding to become a movement. It takes its cue from the failure of political parties and of business firms, and more generally of all established organisations in society, to do what needs to be done to address the unresolved problems of society."
143,432,0.995,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"continuously grounding ourselves in data all around usâfrom consumers, teams, and stakeholdersâwe were able to increase not only impact, but the speed of work. You might call it human-centered problem solving. Leaders who found a clear purpose, built empathy, and continuously learned, were able to organize their teams to solve what often seemed like impossible challenges. For instance, I recently left a meeting with Ratan Tata [former chairman of the Tata Group of Mumbai] awestruck by his masterful use of purpose, empathy, and learning to solve one challenge after another. Tataâs Nano project started as a sketch in his diary of a moped with a shield. Seeing families of four piled together, unprotected from wild traffic in the middle of often harsh Indian weather, was unacceptable. He believed every family should have access to safe transit. Tata took the sketch to his colleagues to experiment on solutions for what would ultimately become the worldâs most affordable car. His efforts have shocked automotive manufacturing and, more important, improved transportation safety for thousands. The thing is, despite all his success, he spent most of the conversation inquiring about us. I have never met a more humble and curious person. I walked away realizing his practice of humility and curiosity was what actually allowed him to notice his surroundings and continue to learn (at age 77!). Humility and curiosity were the foundation of Tataâs personal legacy of success. Looking back, it seemed nearly all our successes, on seemingly impossible challenges, involved leaders who valued humility and continuously learned. If we were able to apply our skills in problem solving to Africa, perhaps we could accelerate the development of more human-centered problem solvers like Tataâpeople who seem to do the impossible. So we founded Brave! Jessica, why is there such a strong focus on talent? And how do you ensure you match the right talent with the right opportunity?

Do they still function, does blat exist nowadays? P4: In state structures it stays as it was. In my opinion there is no doubt about this. But in business â this is a complex question. It is clear that parents try to push their children forward through all means. This is a normal parental instinct, and here blat functions. Another matter is that it functions precisely as an exchange of favors. I have an example in mind, where a big boss arranged for his children to work in different companies. With this it happens often that the child does not correspond to the requirements presented by the companies. But the child was employed precisely because dad had given in one way or another a favor to this company. And so this happened in full scale. As for business, I think that in big companies this also functions, but not in small ones. Here I doubt it. Q: Why? P4: In small companies people are visible (na vidu), everything is counted and the budget is small. If a small company has to employ someone to win a state organized tender, this causes a financial calculation: How much do we lose by employing this kid and how much do we win by getting this order. (general director, p4) In all, despite the significant changes compared to Soviet-era blat, the present-day Russian society and economy still seem to leave room for informal practices more or less reminiscent of blat. Even though these practices may be neither as pervasive nor culturally specific as in the Soviet Union, they still continue to exist, particularly in the public sector and state-controlled parts of the economy."

Some of them we have a hand in ourselves, and with the right knowledge, we can positively influence our wellness and the quality of life for ourselves and our environment. This does not just produce better physical health, but also a much greater degree of pleasure in life, higher general productivity and an improved sense of well-being. The POP research has tried to make this visible for you. In general, we can state that human health is determined by what we eat, breathe, drink and how we move physically with the right motivation. Awareness of these factors also alerts us to the elements that can be act as disturbances. We tend to be more aware of the origins and quality of our food. We tend to stop smoking and ventilate our houses better. We more often travel by bike or public transportation, leaving the car at home or even selling it altogether. Things that used to determine the coziness of our homes, like an open ï¬re, candles or aromatic sticks, are replaced by other healthier, more positive alternatives. We also notice that we are talking with each other more and more often about subjects like air quality and health. There are also things we cannot influence because they belong to our DNA-related system, or they are engrained in the reigning culture or structure of society, or they are endemic to the climate in which we live. That is why AiREAS also involves the government, science and innovative entrepreneurship in our common mission. The POP investigation is therefore valuable for influencing every aspect of society and stimulating innovation in which we can all be involved. With our research, we try to give reassurance to everyone that this can all have a positive effect on our health and well-being, as well as a positive outcome for the global issues we face, just by giving the example and showing the results. Hopefully, you have received sufï¬cient tips and insights to enable you to make up your own mind and take action accordingly. If you need help, you can always rely on the support of the entire AiREAS team of partners, including all specialized professionals. In the name of the entire POP team, we thank you for your involvement and value-driven input."

Maybe such preferences says more about the person than the situation; because a personâs stance is often determined by the subconscious desires, hopes and fears driving that individual.

108,57,0.995,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"The diagram above shows the need for a deeper identification process after one has identified the actors using violent tactics. The question to answer after initial identification is the ever relevant why. Why do they have an agenda that involves violence? Only after these why-questions have been answered will it be possible to formulate a practical, purposeful course of action to engage these actorsâand also those who already have an acceptable agenda. The engagement can be directly on the actors or towards structures on the social field which one estimates would affect these actors. Once again, it is more rewarding to act on changing the social field than aiming at certain actors directly, as it is not sure or even likely that you have identified all the actors you want to target. It is important to remember this, even if this discussion to a large extent deals with the actors. Aiming at the social structures will in its turn affect even actors you still donât know about. In the end, it is humans and their behaviour you want to see a change in, but the road might have to go through structural change first."
48,5,0.995,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"systematic review of relevant research,1 it is likely to have been biased towards our own research on time predictions. That is the privilege of authoring a book. On some of the topics we address, only a few research studies have been published, sometimes only one. The results and recommendations based on such limited evidence should be taken with a grain of salt, so please use your common sense if advice or a result sounds unreasonable in your context. The terminology used when talking about time predictions is far from standardized. Other terms are effort estimation, time forecasts, and performance time predictions. We will use the term time usage prediction or just time prediction in this book. Although the bookâs focus is on how much work a task or project requires, we also add results on the prediction of the point in time (completion time) and the number of days (duration) in which we predict the work to be completed. The book starts with a brief chapter on prediction successes and disasters, illustrating how poorly and how well people can be at predicting time (Chap. 1). We then reflect on how judgement-based time predictions are made and how central they are to our lives (Chap. 2). If you are mainly interested in the practical aspects of time predictions, you may want to skip these chapters and go directly to Chap. 3. That chapter describes the basis for time predictions, with an emphasis on the importance of probability-based thinking. A good grasp of this chapter is important for an understanding of what comes later. The chapter on overoptimism (Chap. 4) gives several possible explanations of why time predictions are often overoptimistic. As you will learn here, a tendency towards overoptimistic time predictions is not necessarily caused by a disposition towards overoptimism and may have many other explanations. Chapter 5 reviews common time prediction biases, their importance, and when they are likely to occur. An awareness of these biases is important to improve time prediction processes. In many situations, a simple number stating how many work hours are required is not enough. One would also like to know something about the conï¬dence in and the uncertainty of the time prediction. We have, therefore, included a chapter reporting what is known about our tendency to be overconï¬dent (Chap. 6), that is, the tendency to think that our time predictions are more accurate than they are. In Chap. 7, we describe how to improve the accuracy of time usage predictions through the use of evidence-based techniques, methods, and principles. The two latter chapters are the most practically oriented. If you just want advice on how to improve time prediction and uncertainty assessments, these are the main parts to read. Finally, we include a guide to selecting time prediction methods (Chap. 8) and a chapter describing how easy it is to influence people into making overoptimistic time predictions (Chap. 9). Besides the authors (the sequence of authorship was determined based on coin flips), a number of people have contributed to this book. In particular, we would like to thank Karl Halvor Teigen, Scott Armstrong, and Jostein Rise for valuable"

Yoshikawa If you ask me, I would say that it is innovation that will help solve the problem of an aging population, environmental problems, etc. That is because the solutions donât lie in how many of an existing product is sold, but in creating new products. The size of the Japanese market is ideal for conducting various experiments. To borrow your words, it is as you say that leading country in resolving societal problems has more opportunities for business commensurate with their status. Komiyama The Japanese system and its mentality are impeding such pursuits. For example, new business models such as ride sharing like Uber has a hard time becoming popular in Japan. Yoshikawa This is a clichÃ©, but donât you think there is a lack of an enterprising spirit? Going back to the story of disposable diapers, I happened to hear from the person who developed this. This person told me that the proposal was finally accepted on the third try. We can also add to that why the first robot vacuum cleaner was not developed in Japan. Apparently, it had been developed, but there were negative opinions like âwhat were they going to do if the robot bumped in to the alter, knocking over the candles, and starting a fire,â so they couldnât launch it in the market."
299,74,0.995,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"In response I draw on the difference in the literature between subjective well-being (as reported by those studied) and objective well-being. Subjective well-being is surely a much more meaningful and richer concept than that of happiness. Studies of happiness in the hedonic/experiences sense assess how satisfied a person is at a given moment by asking questions such as âhow happy are youâ and âdid you smile frequently yesterday.â In contrast to those seeking to understand well-being, use questions such as âhow satisfied are you with your life in generalâ and âdo you feel that you have purpose or meaning in lifeâ (with possible responses on a ten-point scale). However, this concept raises two questions. First, a relatively minor one, whether all or even most people have a clear and stable conception of the purpose of their lives and its meaningâand to what extent they formulate such notions mainly in response to the questions asked, and whether when asked again, under different circumstances, they would not provide rather different answers. (By the way, this measurement would make young people come off as less well than older ones because many young ones are less clear about their purpose/meaning than older ones). Second, there can be little doubt that people who state that they have a purpose and a meaningful life may be jihadists, gang leaders, produce ads to promote the purchase of cigarettes, or sell subprime mortgages. I see no correlation between being a good human being and leading a purposeful and meaningful life. To get at the moral dimension one would need to ask people what they did during the last weekend; what they would do if everyone in their group did free ride: how improper they consider keeping cash in a found wallet; how they rank inequality versus economic growth; and other such questions. Objective well-being can include moral assessmentsâand anything else those who study the connection wish to include. Examining such studies shows that definitions of objective well-being reflect the values of the researchers, not their subjects. Thus, some students of objective well-being assume that people who live in a society that has a lower environmental footprint than others are more just, and are at peace with others who are better off. Othersâif they have higher income, pay fewer taxes, and are freer from government regulations. That is, this concept moves us in the right direction but still faces two challenges: (a) it mixes moral and non-moral determinants of well-being, preventing us from measuring the moral factor, and (b)"
209,78,0.995,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"We assessed student perceptions of public engagement and its usefulness in various ways. In our module evaluation questions, we often asked âOverall, to what extent was the public participation module a beneficial part of your learning in this course?â with responses to both on a five-point scale ranging from ânot at allâ to âa great deal.â In addition, to better understand perceptions of conducting ELSI engagement activities in the context of science courses, we asked students at different points, sometimes both before and after engaging in all of the module activities, to answer an open-ended question that read, âIn your opinion, how important is it that science students--including beginning science students such as you and your classmates--learn how to think about the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) pertaining to science? In 2â3 sentences, give your answer and a brief explanation of why you think as you do.â Finally, to assess perceptions of the value of public engagement in general, in A4 of Study 5, we additionally asked âSome people feel that the government should primarily rely on expert opinions, not citizen opinions when making policy decisions. What do you think? In your opinion, how much weight should government give to citizen opinions (like you wrote above) when making decisions about the future of nanotechnological development and regulation?â This question was accompanied by a five-point response scale ranging from âNone!

She rightly wanted to give visibility to a behaviour which, she suggested, should serve as a model for others to follow. Many, including all the newspapers that reported the news, had the same reaction as the Italian Minister of Health. In a note on the high school website, the class described their decision to be collectively vaccinated as an âact of solidarityâ towards Simone. There is no doubt the classâ decision was motivated by noble sentiments and that, considering that many of them would not otherwise have got vaccinated, it was in fact an act of solidarity. This nice story is particularly suited to introducing a book on the ethics of vaccination for three reasons. First, it clearly illustrates, on a small-scale scenario, the practical application of a concept with great ethical relevance when applied on a large scale, namely, that of herd immunityâa concept I will return to later in this chapter and throughout the book. Second, the story shows why we need to develop an âethics of vaccinationâ, as the title of this book suggests: being vaccinated is a decision that not only could benefit the vaccinated individual but alsoâand indeed more importantlyâcontributes to protecting other people around us, thus raising the distinctively ethical question of whether and to what extent we should do something that is not only or even primarily in our self-interest (actually, the individual benefit of vaccination will be minimal or even negligible in some cases, as we will see in Chap. 2). Third, the story suggests that protecting vulnerable people through herd immunity is a collective enterprise, that is, something individuals cannot do alone but need to do together. The collective nature of the effort gives rise to a collective action problem and a tension between collective and individual responsibility. Such tension calls for a philosophical inquiry that can yield precise ethical and, ideally, political prescriptions. The philosophical inquiry around collective and individual responsibilities will be dealt with in Chap. 2. The policy implications, viewed in light of a principle of least restrictive alternative in public health policy, will be the subject of Chaps. 3 and 4. In this first chapter, I will discuss some of the sources of the ethical problems raised by vaccination and some of the ethically relevant facts about vaccination, clarifying the exact scope of the present discussion and what important ethical issues will be left out. This book will be successful if, at its conclusion, it will have convinced the reader that in a world where people simply behave in a minimally ethical wayânot heroically, only decentlyâa case like that of the Italian high school class should not be seen as particularly praiseworthy.

82,227,0.995,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"unjustified foundationalist viewâ (Klein 2007b, 28). His argument is different from ours, in that it refers, among other things, to a reasonâs availability. We however believe that our reasoning about fading foundations can capture Kleinâs most important intuitions, and we will come back to availability in the next chapter. Let us sum up. In doxastic justification the choice is not between indefinitely going on and the unjustified foundations view. There is a third possibility, provided by what we know about infinite chains. Once we have recognized that any justification that Bn gives to B1 diminishes as the distance between the two is augmented, we might decide to stop at Bn because the justificatory contribution that any further belief would bestow on B1 is deemed to be too small to be of interest. When exactly a justificatory contribution is considered to be negligible depends on pragmatic considerations, but our two tables show that we are able to make these considerations as precise as we wish. This third possibility goes unnoticed in the debate between Bergmann and Klein. Because the fact of fading foundations has not been taken into account, they fail to realize that the expression âstopping at a belief Bn â can have more meanings than those that have been envisioned in the literature. It need not mean âmaking an arbitrary moveâ, as some coherentists have claimed. Nor need it imply that Bn is taken to be unjustified or self-justified. Rather, an agent can decide to stop at a belief Bn because she realizes that, for her purposes, Bn+1 has become irrelevant for the justification of B1 . She finds that the degree of justification conferred upon B1 by her beliefs B2 to Bn is accurate enough, and she feels no call to make it more accurate by taking Bn+1 into account. For her, the justificatory contribution that Bn+1 gives to B1 has become negligible, and with our tables she can precisely identify a point at which the role of Bn is small enough to be neglected, where we use the word âjustificatoryâ as before as meaning probabilistic support plus something else. In this way we have given a more precise meaning to contextualist considerations that have been often expressed. For example Klein: The infinitist will take the belief that q to be doxastically justified for S just in case S has engaged in providing âenoughâ reasons along the path of endless reasons. . . . How far forward . . . S need go seems to me a matter of the pragmatic features of the epistemic context.9"
223,417,0.995,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"One can try to systematically adopt the emic view by drawing on ethnographic decision tree modeling (Gladwin, 1989). The textbook example for this theory is not one of foragers but rather of American college students and the question of whether or not they go to have lunch at McDonaldâs. The technique is that one tries through interviews to elicit as many criteria as possible that are said to be relevant for this decision to go or not to go (criteria such as whether one likes the food, likes the service, knows where a McDonaldâs is). Then the criteria are sorted according to a decision-making tree, which is subsequently tested against the decisions that the college students actually report when being asked where they have lunch. That is, the model should account for most of the decisions observable in real life. Failure to do so would indicate that a criterion is either missing from or misplaced in the decision-making tree. As a product of inductive reasoning, the tree makes predictions on the basis of probability and takes account of local values and decisionmaking criteria. If some of the decision-making treeâs underlying criteria and values are subject to change (e.g., with age), decision-making trees will likely differ from one cultural or subcultural group to the next. One can thereby test and substantiate a relativistic hypothesis through the inductive reasoning of probability. Again, this model of ethnographic decision trees works well in some instances. It apparently holds in particular for small-scale farmers and their choices of which crop to grow and when. Stated differently, it seems to work in settings of small homogeneous groups with decisions of seasonal regularity. It does not work as nicely with foragers, however, as I found when trying to employ this method with San (âBushmenâ) in Namibia. The individuals there are not homogenous in their responses, and it seems that the decision to move camp is not considered an instance that can be looked at through the lens of probability but rather only in personal terms as it were. The question that I asked in my field research was not about going to McDonaldâs (Namibia being one of the worldâs few countries without McDonaldâs). Instead, I asked what locals thought about attending secondary school, which for them means moving away from home, attending boarding school, or staying with distant family. There was no problem in eliciting an ethnographic decision tree. Everyone agreed that secondary education was important and that children should take this opportunity if they had found someone to pay their fees, buy them a school uniform, and offer them a place to stay. There was also agreement that discrimination by teachers or fellow students, food shortage at the place one was staying, or similar problems should not be permitted to make the children quit school. Despite this consensus, however, individuals constantly, and often for highly idiosyncratic reasons, deviated from the outcome predicted by the model. It emerged in this research that the social agents concerned refused to see major personal choices (such as moving away from home to attend school) as decisions to be taken from a perspective of nowhere in particular. The agent was not regarded as replaceable by anyone else. There was no notion of âall things being equal,â which would have allowed for a neutral weighing of alternatives. This personalization of decisions applied to the manner in which the agent is perceived, the fact that a decision is seen to be analogue rather than digital, and the degree to which individual"

Thus a grant proposal crossing disciplines A and B is likely to be reviewed by an expert on A and an expert on B â neither of whom is necessarily likely to feel favourably towards the other, nor towards the interdisciplinary proposal as a whole. Below, in providing examples of peer reviewer comments we have received on some of our interdisciplinary grant applications, we dwell on what such comments might tell us about the possibility â or impossibility â of intervening in the field of interdisciplinary research on the mind and brain. The quotation that begins this section comes from our first example. With some of our neuroscientific collaborators, we had proposed to run a series of brain-imaging experiments whose design would not be specified in advance, but which would emerge iteratively from a series of interdisciplinary workshops that we would run. This got short shrift: âIn my field (scientific and medical neuroimaging)â, one reviewer wrote, âit is imperative to describe the proposed experiment in detail, e.g. paradigms, number and type of subjects, analysis plan ... . I did not feel sufficient information was provided to indicate the quality of outputs.â Here, we rub up against keenly guarded disciplinary norms surrounding robust research. But if this neuroscientist found our proposed experiment too loose and underspecified, another reviewer (likely someone from the social sciences) found it too concrete: our proposal demonstrated a ânaÃ¯ve realism about the experiment and its ambitions for experimental convergence ... [while the] ambition to establish a more general protocol to be followed by others is epistemically naÃ¯ve and unreflexively normativeâ. The broader problem becomes clear here: try to design an interdisciplinary experiment that puts together the empirical rigour of neuroimaging and the conceptual openness of the humanities, and there is a good chance that you will be condemned by neuroscientists for your ambiguity, and by humanities scholars and/or interpretive social scientists for your empiricism. In a second example â from a peer review of a different grant application â we were informed that while our project had âpotentialâ, we should not only do more to test our proposed approach (presumably prior to applying, again, for funds), but specifically provide âevidence of potential to engage neuroscientists in a reciprocal relationshipâ. The reviewers did not see sufficient evidence of âreal collaboration with the community [we were] targetingâ. Note, first, how the injunction to engage our targeted community (âneuroscientistsâ) betrays the assumed direction of travel: it seems inconceivable, for example, that the field might be too entangled"

The dominant approach to improving care [in low-income countries] (as a result) involves continuing professional development but (as Byrne-Davis et al. point out), âlittle is known about their impact on practiceâ (2016: 59). One might argue that the best way to deal with this situation is not to deploy British professionals as volunteers but to improve local human resource management systems to require senior staff to be present and take on training roles, and for the health system itself to develop CME systems rather than relying on foreign interventions. In the capacity-building work we are currently engaged in, in the area of bio-medical engineering aimed at increasing the skills levels of practising technicians, we are beginning to lobby for the development of a CME system and to support the development of its constituent modules. At present, no such thing is in place.2 However, for the time being, this is the context within which professional volunteers will engage on a day-to-day basis. One might argue that training in itself is innocuous and can only add value. And, the more people we train presumably the more potential there is for positive systems change. One of the SVP volunteers expressed this view in an interview and in response to a question about the role that volunteers could play in system change: I donât even know how [a volunteer] would go about [engaging with systems]. There are so many levels of mistrust and corruption. Where to even start to inï¬ltrate the system and go about it in the right way especially if youâre a foreigner trying to come in and introduce policy. Itâs not even a can of worms. Itâs like a reservoir of snakes. Education is something you canât take away from someone and so thatâs something we can do continually, teach and set an example and then itâs up to that individual if they carry on what you have imparted."

49,380,0.995,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"A simple movement, which is thinking, always creating reflection of being and by this way thinking constitutes things and the world. Constitutional activity of thinking is usually linked to speech, to âlogosâ, but the thinking is movement, not language itself. Thinking is something what enables speech. However, it may break away from the speech and perform reflection being that exists at the level of perception, or on the other side at the level of certainty of the truth about essences that speech is not able to capture. If we want to differ essences and their processes of constitution as follows movement of thought, it is necessary to distinguish a layer of thinking from the layer of beings. If we did not do so, it would be ontological conception in contradiction. That's because it does not allow it to accommodate the multiplicity as a totality and a differentiation of the thinking and what there is another form of existence and how it is possible. It should be borne in mind that even the initial exclusion of thinking can do nothing else but thinking itself. Thinking is not deducible from being, because it would first have to devote itself. Much easier is to accept of independence of thought, which is in addition to being and which carried out the difference in essences. How can we explain in detail the processes of differentiation of entities which is carried out by thinking. Thinking in discourse performs comparisons between current percepts and endocepts, ie, thinking is saying ""that's not it"" or ""that's it."" Basically, these processes are therefore negation and identity. For example, when we want to characterize what is white, then our thinking is saying white is what is not red, what is not blue, what is not black, what is not yellow and so on. And when we are looking on something white then our thinking is saying it is like white. Percepts are constitutes by this way. However, if we do not built own mental picture of the world's, it means endocepts that precedes perception (it is probably before puberty), or if it is a new sensation, the mind does not have its own basis for comparison, we create then the things on comparisons with other sensations. This process is based on negation, because we cannot determine the percept by otherwise. Let's say that in the prepubescent stage of ontogenetic development we determine all things on the level of sense. For example ""salinity"" as something what is ""not bitter"", ""non-acidic,"" ""not sweet""."

Even though the actors did not always think in field theory terms, it is still possible to apply that perspective. To that should be added that much indicates that MiloÅ¡eviÄ and Tudjman, without any actual theoretical knowledge, could think and act in a manner reminiscent of the field theory approach. That is something you can and also probably actually do if you are an actor on the field. The opposite can be said about many of the other actors who really did not try to understand the social field and thus really did not take the duel-situation between them and their counterparts seriously. One can also see that it was possible to extrapolate the coming events by studying the actors and that their rationality also could be perceived. This is exactly the information one needs if one wants to affect actors by changing the social structure on a field. PSYOPS could be applied right through the whole event chain, not only during the phase when open war was played out. Even a bombing or an assassination of other actors than those you want to affect can be part of a PSYOPS operation. Exactly what could have been done is speculative and beyond the point of this text. The important thing is that it was possible to operate in this setting with a social field perspective as guidance. The aim has been to show that field theory can fulfil the criteria necessary for a theory to qualify as a valuable instrument for military planning. The discussion has demonstrated that social theory can be employed as an operational tool. The theory can serve to encourage reflection and therefore refine oneâs thoughts, provided that it is first understood and assimilated as a way of thinking. This provision was fulfilled when the theory was shown to be able to be linked, for example, to the questions and issues that a military intervention might have to face. The theory was also shown to be applicable to the empirical example given. One counter to this claim is of course that it is a theoretical examination of empirical data that has been conducted. The next step is to apply the theory in an actual empirical study. But for this to be possible the theory must first be further developed and then practical measures taken to enable theoretical ambitions to be realisedâin other words a task outside this study. One question that is inherent and needs to be answered following this type of study is: what resources are required to enable the creation of a field theory image of military area of operations?"

But for others, the choice of language can have complicated political connotations, especially for researchers of local or dual heritage. Like our own Morocco researcher, a colleague of Moroccan descent who has grown up in Europe conducts interviews in French or English. This is not because he has difficulty speaking the local dialect of Arabic, but because his accent would lead a respondent to make immediate assumptions regarding his familyâs regional background and social class. His fluent English and French and prestigious academic affiliations can offset this, but in turn cause him to be seen as more of an outsider. By contrast, a colleague of Turkish descent who has spent most of his adult life in Europe finds that his accent gives him easy access to elite circles, but can cause him to be distrusted by ordinary Turks, and even more, Kurds. He prefers to use English in his engagement with Kurds in Europe. Even when we get started with the real interview, there is always an initial part where you try to measure each other. As researchers, we try to assess how much we can push, not starting right out with the big questions. If we feel that there is a difficulty with a particular question, we may skip it and return to it later. Not all of this is about political sensitivities: not everyone is used to giving concise, to-the-point answers even to straightforward questions, and multiple approaches may be needed to get a question understood and answered. But when sensitive topics are being broached, it is all the more important to engage in a careful ritual dance. Showing up like a newshound, pen in hand and firing off questions will alienate even well-disposed respondents. We have all experienced situations in which establishing trust was unusually difficult. We will illustrate three of the four most common reasons, as we have encountered them: suspicion, ideological hostility, fear, and personality. An example of suspicion was experienced recently by our China researcher, who was exposed to a kind of reverse interview by a policy-maker. For half an hour, she was asked directly and indirectly what she wanted, why she does this kind of research, why foreigners are interested in the details of Chinese policy-making, why our project got a big grant, what the EUâs interest in providing such grants might be, and so on.

Indeed, in this book, we have hopefully established a number of trailheads (based on current state-of-the-art knowledge about important aspects of the entrepreneurial process) and then offered some insights into possible trails that can be blazed from these trailheads. The proposed trailblazing has largely focused on the notion of individualsâ thinking, feeling, and acting in relation to potential opportunities embedded in communities and often extreme contexts. This is not to say that there are not important trails to be blazed at the entrepreneurial team, firm, institutional, regional, and other levels of analysis. These levels of analysis are not within our area of expertise, so it is more difficult for us personally to highlight potential trails at these levels of analysis even though we believe that they exist. We look forward to seeing advancements at these levels of analysis as well. Regardless of the level of analysis (or across levels of analysis), maintaining an open mind to novelty is critical. We need to have an open mind about the philosophical approach. This does not mean that an author should use a different philosophical perspective for each paper (although he or she certainly could) but that we should be open enough to allow others to have a different philosophical perspective underlying their research. If we converge on a specific philosophical perspective, perhaps as the result of more closed-minded editors, reviewers, and authors, then we discourage trailblazing and âkill offâ an important source of potential new insights. We are not advocating an approach of âanything goes,â but we, as scholars, should (should is a strong word, but it emphasizes our strong belief) judge research based on the traditions and expectations in which it is embedded. In a similar way, it is important that entrepreneurship scholars remain open-minded to different theoretical lenses and ways of generating new theory. Indeed, to the extent that people can apply new theories to entrepreneurship research, there is an increased chance of uncovering new insights into entrepreneurial phenomena as well as making contributions back to the literatures from which these âborrowedâ theories come. Therefore, while we can borrow theories to understand entrepreneurial phenomena, it is important to go one step further and look toward âblendingâ to make a contribution back to the solutionsâ origins. That is, in applying a specific theory (from outside the entrepreneurship domain), what adaptions to that theory are required to apply it to an aspect of the entrepreneurial context? Exploring this question provides a basis for"
117,66,0.995,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"2. Joan Tronto has provided a somewhat similar representation from a feminist-political perspective (cf. Tronto 1993). There are, however, several differences to our approach, particularly the fact that for Tronto, compassion with the other person and the understanding of care as a collective process play an important role. This is not the case in our proto-ethical approach, which is why we will not go into Trontoâs work in more detail here. A critical study of the fundamental aspects of Trontoâs approach is provided by Edwards (2009, pp. 233â238), an overview to different concepts of care (including Trontoâs approach) is provided by Kohlen and Kumbruck (2008). 3. Carl Amery undertook the interesting exercise of allowing the âminor charactersâ of the parable (the priest, the Levite, the innkeeper and even the leader of the robbers) to express themselves and to explain their respective actions (cf. Amery 1973). 4. It seems, as we wish to note only in passing, to be immaterial for the significance of the ought whether it was created as an existential factum, as we claim here, or whether it encountered me as a facticity. 5. Protest against the tendency of caring ethics to interpret care fundamentally as something essentially goodâan idea brought forth primarily by Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddingsâhas also arisen within the field of nursing studies, cf. for example Allmark (1995); Bradshaw (1996); Edwards (2009, pp. 232 ff). 6. âCare is an affectively charged and selective mode of attention that action, affection, or concern at something, and in effect, it draws attention away from other things. In practice, a person who cares is one who has already chosen an object to care about. Consider, however, that prior to securing a thing to care for, a person must have the capacity or willingness to respond, to be called into action, to be hailed by that object or phenomenon. In short, a person who cares must first be willing and available to be moved by this other.â 7. â[T]here was notable consistency between students and nurses in reasons for entering nursing affected by neither age nor level of experience. This finding along with high levels of innate personal traits that are conducive to a caring and cooperative nature suggests that individuals are drawn to nursing for similar reasons. There was a general consensus by participants that âall sorts of personalities make a good nurseâ and the dominant trait of a good nurse is that âdesire to careâ.â"

Who buys, how and what. And then you will run straight into all these red directors. (general director, p3) According to another respondent, the question of the Soviet mentality was connected to generations and was only relevant to those educated in the Soviet era, whereas the new post-socialist generation had new values and new problems: P4: Today there has grown a completely new generation which is already in business life. Currently I deal with people who are not solely working in IT firms. They have managers of my age, that is, around thirty. We all went to school in the Soviet era. Q: Do you have different values or do you work differently? P4: I donât know, it is difficult to talk about the others. I can only say that in my mind those around thirtyâthirty-five still remember school well. Those who finished school in the beginning of the 1990s already have completely new values and they look at life in a completely different way. In my head, the Soviet legacy still remains. (general director, p4) An example of the problems of transformation for the Soviet generation was learning how to behave in business. This knowledge consists of, for example, working routines and habits and is accumulated over time in organizations but is rarely put into writing (cf. Podolny and Baron 1997). These habitual ways of acting are thus usually not learned from books but typically by imitating or interacting with colleagues or a mentor, or simply by doing. One of our respondents, who had worked for most of his career in the Soviet Union, emphasized â in addition to learning new habits â the unlearning of the Soviet routines and ways of acting when comparing himself with the 20-year-old CEO of a well-known software company: Q: There are things which are difficult to learn from books, which you can only learn through your own experience or by observing the experience of your older colleagues. For example, how to think in a new, innovative way, how to relate to people, how to conduct business. Have you had these kinds of cases?"

Typically, the former condition holds in fields like mathematics where it is possible to distinguish clearly between a correct and a wrong answer, and there is a common praxis shared by those working in the field for arriving at problem solutions. However, this may not be the case when dealing with social problems where the difference between right and wrong may be based on value judgements not shared by all involved, and where there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding what is known about a problem (Funtowicz, 1993). Collective intelligence becomes increasingly difficult to employ when incorporating knowledge from different academic disciplines or non-scientific knowledge based in traditional cultures (Berkes, 2008) or unarticulated lay practices. It is almost impossible when the knowledge that one party professes to possess is dismissed as worthless by other parties, such as is common in highly politicised or value-laden debates (Head, 2008). Social innovation meets neither of these conditions. It is complex, with high coordination requirements, and requires judgmental evaluations. As such, it is tempting to say that social innovation is simply not a good arena to use collective intelligence. However, a deeper look at how social innovation happens makes this conclusion appear less certain."

134,52,0.995,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"regards to mathematics). Nevertheless in both science education and mathematics education there is a growing body of evidence-informed work about what makes for a good curriculum. Perhaps the most fundamental issue is that of content. In science education there has been a growing acknowledgement in recent times that many school curricula are overloaded. Too much time is spent covering a myriad of specific, often isolated, pieces of content with the result that the larger picture is lost. It is clearly important to have a curriculum that facilitates, or at the very least enables, students to progress in their learning as best they can. Studies on studentsâ progression in learning (whether in mathematics, in science or more generally) have often been interpreted as though learning progresses up a ladder or in stages, so that each rung of the ladder (or stage) needs to be reached before subsequent progression can occur. Unsurprisingly, fine-grained observations of studentsâ learning, such as those by Shapiro (1994), reveal that learning is rarely like this. Not only do learners sometimes regress, they also at times miss a stage (or rung on the ladder). The implication for curriculum developers is that concepts need to be ordered in a logical sequence that facilitates learning but it should not be assumed that learning proceeds inflexibly along such a route. Learning can be more like putting together the pieces of a jigsaw, where this can be done successfully in a number of ways rather than in one predetermined order. It is generally agreed in curricula round the world that mathematics and science should be core subjects. Given this, there are a number of important considerations as to which subjects should be taught in the European Schoolsâ curriculum. Parents and students will invariably bring their own understandings about curriculum planning to any discussion of a reform process. This means that if parents hold traditional views about subjects within a curriculum, for example, that there needs to be three separate sciences (i.e. physics, chemistry and biology), then it follows that, as far as they are concerned, a general science curriculum is going to appear incomprehensible or, in their view, represent a simplification and thus reduction in the quality of this important area of the curriculum. It doesnât matter whether parents are correct in their judgements about the subject make-up of the curriculum, their beliefs are significant factors in any decisions made by European school curriculum-makers, and need to be taken into account accord-"
262,125,0.995,"Reality Lost : Markets of Attention, Misinformation and Manipulation","The goal of science is to research, understand, and explain the world and the way it works as far as the existing scientific methods will allow. Science seeks truths and knowledge about nature, social conditions, humanity, and technology. The self-declared goal of science does not fall far from that of journalism. According to the principles stated in the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the primary obligation of journalism is to the truth, but not in an absolute sense. This journalistic truth âis a process that begins with the professional discipline of assembling and verifying facts. Then journalists try to convey a fair and reliable account of their meaning, valid for now, subject to further investigation. Journalists should be as transparent as possible about sources and methods so audiences can make their own assessment of the information.â7 The world is constantly evolving, and new information may come forth, and thus journalistic truth, just like scientific truth, is tentative. Journalism has to be as transparent as possible when it comes to sources and methods making it possible for readers to make up their own minds about their views and the correctness of the information put in front of them. Journalism should also be careful to avoid bubble formation and always keep news in proportion but not leave out important details. Journalistâs Resource notes that âJournalism is a form of cartography: it creates a map for citizens to navigate society. Inflating events for sensation, neglecting others, stereotyping or being disproportionately negative all make a less reliable map.â8 Sensationalism and poor journalism, as well as pseudoscience, put the reliability of the map under pressure and complicate navigation."
192,259,0.995,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In a self-reflective mood, during a conversation with Paula Curry, Cantor confesses that scientific research is not as straightforward as is sometimes suggested. Most scientists suffer from what he refers to as a âdissociative personalityâ (p. 113). On the one side, they are rigorous believers in the experimental method with its set of rules, bent on advancing knowledge (in other words: S2). On the other hand, they remain fallible human beings with all the accompanying emotional foibles (in other words: $). One of the gravest occupational hazards in science, moreover, is simultaneous discovery. Sooner or later, somebody else will have the same idea. Scientists are driven by one desire: recognition by their peers (the Krausses of this world), but in order to obtain recognition, priority is essential. To score a Nobel Prize, one has to be the first to reach the summit. Thus, the push for priority is enormous. And the only way to establish priority is to be the first to publish. In other words, due to the confrontation with arginine (the object a), the self-contained expert (S2) falls victim to disruptive desire, and this results in a split (Spaltung) between adherence to methodological safeguards (S2) and the desire to maintain his advantage, his momentum, so that Cantorâs eagerness to score ($) suddenly seems to overrule his impeccable technique. Krauss is Cantorâs scientific conscience or superego. If the experiment proves impossible to replicate, Krauss may accuse him of sloppiness, or even fabrication: âSurely he is not calling you a â. Paula stopped shortâ, p. 109). And once someoneâs credibility in science is damaged, it can never be repaired. The only option left to Cantor is to do the experiment himself, to become his own Servant as it were, and to design a second experimental test, climbing Everest by a different route (p. 116). Because he cannot trust Stafford anymore (p. 113), he has to take the experiment literally in his own hands, doffing his costume for a lab coat. It is only via working through that the methodological requirements and desire for recognition can be reconciled again. Various instances of self-reflection can be discerned on the epistemic level. In his Nobel speech, looking back on his experiences, Stafford suggests that the failure of the Harvard team to replicate the results was due to a procedural discrepancy that was âreally quite trivialâ, adding that âif there is one lesson to be learned from this experience, itâs that even the smallest details should be put in oneâs notebook â¦ You never know which details may turn out to be crucialâ (p. 198). This self-reflection not only concurs with the principles of experimental methodology, but also with the psychoanalytic rule that one should report any observations; that one should take care not to exclude any of them, for in principle nothing is irrelevantâ. Even seemingly trivial details (the bagatelle) may prove to be highly significant (Freud 1917/1940, p. 297). But in the novel, the role of the analyst, listening to the dialogues (the flow of university discourse) with evenly-poised attention, and from an oblique perspective, falls to Leah, the expert in Bachtinian analysis (p. 82). She is not at all interested in proteins, membranes or arginine, but rather in the grammar of biomolecular discourse. When challenged to share her observations (by Jean Ardley, Leahâs supervisor, who happens to visit them), she points to the remarkably role of the term âweâ in experimental discourse. Why do scientists always use the pluralis majestatis (âWe, scientistsâ, âWe, the authorsâ) when speaking about science? What is wrong"
269,22,0.995,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"One of the founding premises of this volume is that there is no âview from nowhereâ for conceptualizing, investigating, and writing about brains, minds, bodies, and their environments. Different modes of investigation carry with them different archival legacies, and conventions of thinking and writing. As any theorist of translation, or historian of science will know all too well, there is no straightforward, translucent âlanguageâ through which any of us can present research findings, let alone arguments. As much as we want to trouble a model of disciplines in which each is confined to her own pen, let us stress that this book is written, unapologetically, by two authors who have been trained in different corners of the interpretive social sciences, and who ally themselves with social and cultural theory. Having spent significant amounts of time and resources training ourselves up in cognitive neuroscience, as well as working closely with neuroscientists, we consider ourselves to be â as social scientists go â relatively well versed in the neurosciences, and in the rhetorics through which those sciences move forward. We will do all we can to speak to, through, and with those rhetorics in what follows. Nonetheless, we do have particular networks of citations, modes of address, and means of presenting and analysing our interlocutorsâ arguments and empirical materials. This will provoke discomfort in some of our readers and friends steeped in other, scientific traditions for writing, and thinking and reading. But this, in many ways, is a volume about learning to be discomfited."

We have a long list of desiderata that in effect entail reengineering much of the physical and social world around us, even the self. We Americans are keen to prevent the alarming deterioration of the environment, to attain higher rates of economic growth, to reduce inequality, to curtail the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent offenses while simultaneously reducing drug abuse, to end war and genocide, to foster human rights, to reform campaign finance, and to improve our knowledge, skills, and self-awareness (most recently through âmindfulnessâ). When then-President Bill Clinton was asked, on the eve of a new year, what he wished for his fellow Americans in the year to come, he responded: âHave all your dreams come true.â Sadly, a deep gap exists between our aspirations and our capabilities. We aspire to re-engineer much the world, but actually we are often buffeted by forces we neither understand nor control. Revisit the list of desiderata introduced above; it soon becomes clear that we have made little progress on most of these fronts, and we actually have fallen back on quite a few of them. All too often, we do not even agree about how to tackle these issues, nor do we command the know-how, resources, political will, or personal dedication to proceed successfully. After conducting a review of the history of how we acquired these ambitions, and the role of science and technology in fostering them, I asked where we go from here. It seems obvious that either we must greatly scale back our ambitions, or we must double down and find more effective ways to proceed. Actually, it is likely that we will have to do both. Science and technology are seen by some as the most promising sources for finding ways to catch up, for controlling history rather than being subject to its vicissitudes. Others see science and technology as exacerbating the problem. Here, too, there might be a third way."

She is particularly interested in the employeeâs social skills. âDoes he function well with his colleagues?â she asks. If Ben gives an honest answer, he is likely to be stuck with the employee for a long time. If he is vague about the employeeâs social skills, he may get rid of a problem. He then runs the risk that his honesty will come up for questioning later. It also feels wrong to lie to another person in order to get rid of a problem at work. Lying in this case would be an attempt to transport oneâs own problem over to someone else, instead of taking responsibility and deal with it in oneâs own organization. How should Ben respond to the question about the employeeâs social abilities? Ben must choose between being honest about an employeeâs antisocial behaviour and telling the truth, an option that seems guaranteed to block the employeeâs move to another organization. Like Anne, he acknowledges that whatever he decides to do, something will be wrong. At first glance, it can appear to be an obvious example of a false dilemma. Ben can choose between honouring the moral value of being truthful to others, or giving priority to a selfish need to get rid of a human resource management problem. We can understand that it is tempting to withhold information and thereby help the difficult employee on his way to a new job, but doing so would violate the moral duty to be honest in business dealings. Ben might reason that the employee deserves another chance in a new work environment. If he can open a new page in his career, he might blossom and be better able to fulfil his personal and professional potential. That is all very well, but these considerations seem weak and constructed to camouflage a violation of a moral requirement to be straightforward and honest as a reference person. The extent to which Benâs situation is a real or a false dilemma will depend on the details of the case. I have used the case as a starting point both for ethical teaching of business managers and business school students, as well as for research in moral psychology, where the purpose has been to map the extent to which the situation creates moral dissonance and gets managers to engage in moral neutralization activities (Kvalnes, 2014). I return to that topic in Chapter 11. The participants in ethical training have conveyed their experiences from being on both sides of the table under circumstances where one party is strongly tempted to keep silent about the negative features of a person applying for a job. Some have been untruthful as reference-persons. Among those, some have lived to regret it because the choice has backfired. DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0004"

This feature of âlay peopleâ being the âusersâ and âday-to-day supervisorsâ of the systems experts devise, is what makes their input more valuable upon considering what is too costly to plan at the normal engineering scale of time and probability. The method suggested in this study may contribute to such efforts in its approach to clarify what input we are asking from whom. This is not to say that conventional expertise is neutralized. Resilience is essentially about the efï¬ciency of the system, so we are acting as those âplanning and controlling the system from outsideâ when we feel the need for resilience. When considering how to formulate resilient solutions, we need to integrate expertise, and consider in systems and balances.

It is also so culturally rich and subtle that numerous interpretations can be drawn from it. However, I wanted to quote him here because he manages to indicate the deep-seated and complex template of viveza, or what is called la viveza criolla in several Latin American countries, or in the case of Brazil, jeitinho. The concept denotes a form of cunningness and calculated astuteness that forms part of the Latin American imagery of collective personhoods and social arrangements. âFirst we invent the trampa (the trick, trap) and then the law, with enough cracks to allow us to go through with la trampa,â said Ezequiel MartÃ­nez Estrada, Argentinian intellectual and author (La Nueva 2010, authorâs translation from Spanish). It describes the socialization of an individualized and shameless anything-goes behavior, whereby only a fool obeys the rules. In Venezuela, the concept encapsulates everything from corruption to shady or semi-legal rebusques (inventive ways of making quick money or earn an extra income), jumping ahead in the bus line, pushing oneâs way through by force in a traffic jam, refusing to offer prioritized seating to elderly and pregnant people on the metro, a general lack of respect for others and any kind of self-seeking behavior. It could also be used to denounce politicians or career climbers, or anyone who seek to get ahead through cunningness and foul play. In colloquial speech it is often used when someone tries to be clever or trick themselves out of (or into) something, as in no seas vivo/a (donât be inventive/donât be mischievous). While it is commonly referred to as a negative trait, it is also at times ambiguously interpreted as a positive trait symbolizing the ability to survive in a difficult environment, a âtalent for life,â and, to a certain extent, social success. Sometimes, you would hear people practically boast about their capacity to enrich themselves through petty corruption or favorable rebusques. Among some, it seemed to be considered a sign of masculinity."

This fundamental problem often makes it maddeningly difficult to find something specific in Google Books. Almost in complete contrast to Google Books is JSTOR (www.jstor.org), short for Journal Storage, a collection of academic journals whose articles have been organized and catalogued in a gloriously meticulous manner. JSTOR started out as a restricted site, but after a shameful incident involving the prosecution and tragic suicide of a programmer determined to make the contents of JSTOR freely available, it has been made much more accessible to the general public. For those who can read traditional Western music notation, the International Music Score Library Project (imslp.org) is to music scores what Google Books is to books. IMSLP is an enormous repository of digitized scores that are no longer in copyright, and they are fortunately catalogued and indexed in a highly usable manner. If you think about the ideas of Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson in regard to the ability to create our own web of documents, something seems to be missing. Websites such as Google Books, JSTOR, and IMSLP are resistant to the type of arbitrary linking that they envisioned. Modern word processing and spreadsheet applications accept storing links to sources of information, but not in a very flexible manner. The website that comes closest to Wellsâs concept of a World Encyclopedia is obviously Wikipedia (wikipedia.org). The basic concept of Wikipediaâan encyclopedia that can be edited by its usersâcould easily have resulted in something that degenerated into chaos and consequent uselessness. But under the studious and conscientious direction of Jimmy Wales (born 1966), it has instead become the single most essential website on the internet. In World Brain, H. G. Wells wrote An Encyclopedia appealing to all mankind can admit no narrowing dogmas without at the same time admitting corrective criticism. It will have to be guarded editorially and with the utmost jealousy against the incessant invasion of narrowing propaganda. It will have a general flavour of what many people will call scepticism. Myth, however venerated, it must treat as myth and not as a symbolical rendering of some higher truth or any such evasion. Visions and projects and theories it must distinguish from bed-rock fact. It will necessarily press strongly against national delusions of grandeur, and against all sectarian assumptions. It will necessarily be for and not indifferent to that world community of which it must become at last an essential part. If that is what you call bias, bias the World Encyclopedia will certainly have. It will have, and it cannot help but have, a bias for organization, comparison, construction and creation. It is an essentially creative project. It has to be the dominant factor in directing the growth of a new world."

We have argued that we need to view safety through the patientâs eyes and that safety needs to be approached very differently in the varying settings along the patient journey. This implies in turn that we need to think more explicitly about what kind of safety strategies are most useful in different contexts. We can now draw these themes together and consider the new directions that emerge. In this chapter we first review the ideas and arguments of the book and summarise the transitions in patient safety that we believe are needed (Box 11.1). We then set out a compendium of safety and risk management strategies which can be selected, combined and customised to any healthcare setting. Box 11.1. Five Transitions for Patient Safety"

That the humanities have such a role may seem obvious, but it turns out to be a disputed area. Academic research in literary criticism, art history and music has certainly had an aesthetic function in the past. Nowadays, there is no shortage of critics outside academia, writing and talking in the media, who aim to guide the general public in its appreciation of different kinds of artwork. But is this something modern-day academics do in the humanities? In the case of literature, it may actually be controversial to attribute such a role to researchers, perhaps because of trends such as postmodernism or, more generally, the âdemocratisationâ of public life, and hence the demise of academic expertise in matters of aesthetic appreciation.31 It was notable that very few of our respondents mentioned aesthetic appreciation as a value of the humanities. Here are two exceptions, both from North America: NA11: I would remind [an impatient and potentially hostile audience] first, that the way they live their lives and the pleasure they get from the world, some high percentage of that comes from their education in the humanities. Learning how to distinguish between good [and bad] forms of communication ... , between canned and serious things, between superficial things and profound things. And this doesnât just go for aesthetic experience, but just being an intelligent consumer of media, politics, business and sciences. Again, I know this sounds old-fashioned but it helps people think broadly and deeply with discrimination. If they donât care about that, then thereâs not really much to say. You canât convince them. NA14: Iâd prioritise aesthetic appreciation, i.e. the way research can make possible new and sophisticated forms of aesthetic pleasure. This is bound up with the way it shows how aesthetic pleasure has changed over time. But note that in the first of these quotes aesthetic value is mentioned only briefly and is considered âold-fashionedâ."

Two of the goals also provide targets for governance improvements and the quality of institutions and partnerships, which should help the implementation process (UN 2015). Some critics may lament that these goals are pipe dreams, too ambitious and sometimes contradictory, given that the socioeconomic pledges can only be realized if the targets for environmental protection are missed. I think that this will certainly be the case if the spirit of transformation and radical change that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed in his 2014 preparatory report on reaching the SDGs is lost. Ki-moon wrote, âTransformation is our watchword. At this moment in time, we are called to lead and act with courage. We are called to embrace change. Change in our societies. Change in the management of our economies. Change in our relationship with our one and only planetâ (UN 2014: 3). It is this spirit of transformation that I want to support with this book. To me it holds a renewed window of opportunity for the radical changes that in essence the sustainable development agenda always held. And I want to show that radicalness in purpose should not be conflated with a call for instant revolution, tearing down the system or hostility to dissenting ideas. Radicalness in purpose is equivalent to holding a vision or belief in what could be possible if X, Y or Z was to change, an imaginary that stirs up energy, commitmentâand persistence in taking the many incremental steps required to get there. Sociologists use the term âimaginaryâ to capture more than ideas: it includes a set of values, institutions, laws and symbols with which people imagine their social whole. Without this combination of radical imaginary and persistent progress toward it, not much transformation will happen, at least not in the direction of sustainable development. The path dependencies that shape humanityâs activities and development dynamics today are pushing and pulling in a decidedly non-sustainable direction. This is why I also want to make the case that we should not simply stick the label âtransformationâ on any amendment to the status quo, or call each technological efï¬ciency gain an âinnovation.â If the benchmark for the changes to which we aspire is not radically different to the one that has guided development solutions so far, humanity will not escape those strong path dependencies. At the same time, dismissing the role that incremental steps play in getting there means ignoring the insights that complex system research offers about patterns of change. So juxtaposing the two approaches as entirely separate strategiesâa practice often used to discredit someone elseâs proposalsâdoes not help. What helps is to keep each other challenged with respect to both the radicalness of the imagined outcomes (what do we deem possible) and the amount of change in this direction that the next, often little, steps could bring (what do we do to make it happen). This book speaks to this combination under the tagline of radical incremental transformation strategies. The purpose that these strategies should serve here is long-term sustainable development as deï¬ned in the Rio Declaration of 1992 and"

217,2,0.995,Finite Difference Computing With Pdes : a Modern Software Approach,"understanding of all details involved in the model and the solution method. Everybody nowadays has a laptop and the natural method to attack a 1D heat equation is a simple Python or Matlab program with a difference scheme. The conclusion goes for other fundamental PDEs like the wave equation and Poisson equation as long as the geometry of the domain is a hypercube. The present book contains all the practical information needed to use the finite difference tool in a safe way. Various pedagogical elements are utilized to reach the learning outcomes, and these are commented upon next. Simplify, understand, generalize The bookâs overall pedagogical philosophy is the three-step process of first simplifying the problem to something we can understand in detail, and when that understanding is in place, we can generalize and hopefully address real-world applications with a sound scientific problem-solving approach. For example, in the chapter on a particular family of equations we first simplify the problem in question to a 1D, constant-coefficient equation with simple boundary conditions. We learn how to construct a finite difference method, how to implement it, and how to understand the behavior of the numerical solution. Then we can generalize to higher dimensions, variable coefficients, a source term, and more complicated boundary conditions. The solution of a compound problem is in this way an assembly of elements that are well understood in simpler settings. Constructive mathematics This text favors a constructive approach to mathematics. Instead of a set of definitions followed by popping up a method, we emphasize how to think about the construction of a method. The aim is to obtain a good intuitive understanding of the mathematical methods. The text is written in an easy-to-read style much inspired by the following quote. Some people think that stiff challenges are the best device to induce learning, but I am not one of them. The natural way to learn something is by spending vast amounts of easy, enjoyable time at it. This goes whether you want to speak German, sight-read at the piano, type, or do mathematics. Give me the German storybook for fifth graders that I feel like reading in bed, not Goethe and a dictionary. The latter will bring rapid progress at first, then exhaustion and failure to resolve. The main thing to be said for stiff challenges is that inevitably we will encounter them, so we had better learn to face them boldly. Putting them in the curriculum can help teach us to do so. But for teaching the skill or subject matter itself, they are overrated. [18, p. 86] Lloyd N. Trefethen, Applied Mathematician, 1955-."

You have to create a vision with a flash of insight from the small number of clues that are found. A true discussion brings a flash of insight similar to that of Holmes to ordinary people like us. An unexpected idea might occur to someone when people with a sufficient accumulation of knowledge keep discussing an issue seriously. This leads to a leap to a new model. We Japanese are not good at having such a discussion. What we have to acquire is such a cultural climate for discussion. The role played by universities is important for structuring knowledge. When the student newspaper of the University of Tokyo planned to run a story titled âThe University of Tokyo 2050,â I wrote the following two things. One is that there will be a major change in the composition of students. Unlike today, one third will be students who come primarily from senior high schools. Another third will be students who return to school after having been in the workforce. Still another third will be students from abroad. Students will diversify to this extent, and faculty members will similarly diversify. The second thing I wrote is that people who conduct research deeply just as it is done today will account for half of researchers, with the remaining half represented by people who specialize in relating different parts of the whole of cutting-edge knowledge held by humanity. That is, we need more people to study structuring and integrating knowledge. It is important to âstructure knowledgeâ and use information technology (IT) effectively, in order to integrate knowledge and to create a holistic vision. IT is good at accumulating and searching information, to begin with, and this is now being networked over the Internet. Therefore, humanity will be able to solve many of the problems it confronts today if knowledge is structured, if IT is used successfully, if discussions are carried out, and if the correct knowledge is employed at the correct place at the correct time. It is precisely for this reason that âstructuring knowledgeâ is essentially important."

This is because struggling while attending to certain complexities inherent in a particular task can lead to robust learning (Reiser, 2004; Simons & Ertmer, 2006). A job aid does not meet the definition of scaffolding already because it is not meant to lead to learning, but it also is disqualified because it only simplifies tasks and does not highlight complexity therein (Belland, 2014). Fourth, to qualify as scaffolding, students need to meaningfully participate in the target task and have an understanding of what success at the task means (Mahardale & Lee, 2013; Wood et al., 1976).

78,72,0.995,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"The common sense vision on knowledge and information is underlined by the omniscience/omnipotence utopia. The assumption is that, if only we knew everything that there is to know, we would act perfectly, or, alternatively, that mistakes and wrong doings could be attributed to a lack of knowledge. This, again, has been challenged by some schools of thought for some time, but is now becoming commonplace. Indeed, we are orphans of the encyclopaedic ideal and subject to the new experience that the binding constraint is not our knowledge, but instead our attention capacity. Information, and even knowledge, is like what used to be a natural resource: plentiful. We have shifted our sense of boundlessness from natural resources (now recognized as finite quantities) to information and knowledge. Indeed, with the digital transition, there are fewer and fewer activities that do not produce a âdigital shadowâ. All the electronic devices we engage with (portable or not) leave a recorded trace: where we are, what we read, what we buy, not to mention the information we post about ourselves on social networks or blogs. Information is akin to natural resources of a third kind, besides the non-renewable and the renewable, we have the exponential. Instead of aiming at a global or encyclopaedic overview, we need to learn to navigate through information-saturated waters, and make sense of and value the abundance of information through datamining and other filtering activities. This radical mental shift has consequences on our behaviours as knowers, in our collective representation of what knowledge and information are, on the link between knowledge and action (consider the veil of ignorance) and also, more concretely, on the framing of the fundamental right to privacy, as the current principles of control and data minimisation on which the privacy framework is built fail to grasp optimally the new societal concerns regarding privacy, reputation and image."

You can overcome this risk by backing up the crowdsourcing process with a jury of experts who monitor the process and can intervene and provide a final evaluation, where required. There is always the risk of a participant losing his or her idea without getting paid for it. This might even happen without the initiatorâs appearance: it is possible that other participants or external viewers steal the idea. In this context we have to mention that it is frequently only the winner who gets rewarded for his or her inputâall the other participants miss out although they might have contributed several days of dedicated effort for the purpose of the challenge. For contestants, crowdsourcing and open innovation are a very debatable source of income. The safeguarding of a contestantâs property is left to his or her own resources. Researchers should therefore check the agreement drawn up between them and the platform host to see whether intellectual property is covered properly. This can be ensured by documenting timestamps and with the help of a good community management through the platform host. Of interest to both parties is the delicate question of profit participation: what happens if the participant receives 1,000 Euros for his or her idea but the company makes millions out of this idea? The question remains why a researcher or other collaborator should join in without any certainty that his or her contribution at any stage of the research/creation process is of value, whether it will be appreciated and adequately remunerated. So, the initiator and participant have to take a careful look at legal protection. Actually, this can prove to be quite easy: The initiator can set up the rules and the participant can decide, after having studied the rules, whether he or she agrees and wants to participate or not. A situation under constraint, such as financial dependence, is often rejected a priori. Assigning intermediaries can often serve to adjust a mismatch. The more specialized the task, the more weight rests with the expert or ââsolverââ. Internet communication enables the solver to draw attention to unfair conditions: Both platform host and initiator are interested in retaining a good reputation; any possible future participants might be discouraged. Much depends on the question of how the Internet can be used to connect B2C or B2B companies, scientists or research institutions to target groups and how to receive desired opinions and ideas; but also how to integrate scientists in particular? How to ensure and achieve valid results? What legal, communicative, social factors need to be contemplated? And what further steps are there to mind after a crowdsourcing process? It would be unflattering if customers, scientists and creatives were motivated to participate but, after that, nothing happened or they werenât mentioned in reports on the crowdsourcing process. That would only cause or aggravate frustration and that is something nobody needs."

But society must present a social space, which allows those strategies to be used in a legitimate way. Furthermore, the actors must be structured so that they actually take the opportunity to use this space of possibilities which the structure of society present. In short, both the actors and society need a certain structure, otherwise, the violent scenario does not play out. This is the closest to a law we can come. If it was not for the play between society and actors then such a case as the one in Yugoslavia would play out more often than it does. Michael Mann is also preoccupied with the question of responsibility: If a few bad guys were responsible, how did they acquire such magical powers of coercion and manipulation? And were they quite so coherent in their planning; so in charge of events? After all, atrocities were committed by thousands of persons, and many more thousands stood around, either egging them on or doing nothing to stop them.9"
82,75,0.995,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"justification relation primarily a logical relation, as is stated by Richard Feldman and Earl Conee?12 Or should we follow David Armstrong and Alvin Goldman and hold that it is ultimately causal?13 Which answer one gives to Q1 and Q2 depends largely on whether one takes an internalist or an externalistic view of epistemic justification. Our intuitive understanding of epistemic justification, which Kant would have called âconfused and undeterminedâ, revolves around two aspects that philosophers of all times have struggled to amalgamate.14 On the one hand, justification has to do with the way the world is: it would be inappropriate to call our beliefs justified without requiring that they represent, at least remotely, how things actually are. On the other hand, justification applies to the way the world appears to us: it would be awkward to call my beliefs unjustified if I have reasoned impeccably towards a conclusion which, through some freakish turn of fate, happens to be false. The fact that externalists tend to stress the former, world-centred aspect of justification, while internalists emphasize the latter, agent-centred aspect, is reflected in their answers to Q1 and Q2. What do internalists and externalists say about the ontological status of the relata in âA j justifies Ai â? Concerning Ai , the thing justified, there seems to be not much disagreement. In the case at hand, both factions assert that Ai is a proposition, or a belief in a proposition.15 But what about the ontological status of the justifier, A j ? Here the answer depends on which of the many different versions of internalism or externalism we are talking about. It also depends on whether A j is regarded as something that is itself inferred or as suffices to make a proposition a reason for anotherâ (Williams 2014, 237). As will become clear later in this chapter, we agree that a relation of entailment or of conditional probability is not sufficient for saying that one proposition is a reason for another. However, if Williams is implying that such a relation is not necessary either, then we part company. In general, Williamsâ approach to the epistemic regress problem is inspired by the later Wittgenstein and by ordinary language philosophers like Austin, and as such tends to eschew a more formal or theoretical approach, like the one that we pursue in this book. 12 Feldman and Conee 1985; Conee and Feldman 2004. 13 Armstrong 1973; Goldman 1967. 14 Verworren und unbestimmt â see Kantâs treatise âEnquiry concerning the clarity of the principles of natural theology and ethicsâ (Untersuchung uÌber die Deutlichkeit der GrundsaÌtze der natuÌrlichen Theologie und der Moral) of 1764.

We recall agreeable conversations with Hans Mooij and Simone Mooij-Valk about translating Kant and â vis-aÌ-vis the motto of this book â Thomas Mann. 15 But only in the case at hand, for A can also be another cognitive state than a belief, or even a non-cognitive state."

People care less and less for other people, except for those at the very core and the immediate family. She is convinced that this climate of uncaring has a larger impact than we would like to admit. It creeps in, she says: in the beginning people might object, then you get accustomed and used to it, and thus accommodate this egoistic feeling. If we buy into Monaâs reasoning, it is valid to question if the centennial tax law as well as the rise of the sharing economy was a sign of the times; that it reflected a society where fewer and fewer people âcareâ about each other. The law that was seen as successful at the time (cf. Lodin 2011) both politically and in its legal construction turned a blind eye to peopleâs need for everyday exchanging.

223,307,0.995,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"I do not try to be equally transhistorical. But I do subscribe to Craigâs project to develop a âprototypical caseâ (p. 15) or a social core situation of knowledge use by spelling out what one could not do without it. I am less satisfied with his answer. Craig (1990) constructs only a very basic original situation of knowledge, and he actively refuses to introduce necessary extensions. The basic problem he refers to is that reliable information is needed from someone else. It is this other person, not some presocial believer, to whom knowledge is typically (and prototypically) ascribed. This construction has two components. The first is unproblematic, but not sufficient: âTo put it briefly and roughly, the concept of knowledge is used to flag approved sources of informationâ (p. 10). What is missing is, again, a specific way to distinguish knowledge from mere information, however approved its sources may be. Craigâs way of solving the problem brings in the second component: Although there are many possible sources of information, only personal informants are said to have and convey knowledge. Once again, the verb to know is employed to make the distinction plausible, but Craigâs text also includes a substantial pragmatic argument: Natural sources of information and even cultural artifacts cannot cooperate with the seeker of information; other members of her or his epistemic community can. The idea is most interestingly illustrated by books. Craig explains both why he does not want to attribute knowledge in this case and why some notion of knowledge still seems appropriate: Books and the like [are] excellent sources of information, but never, even in the spirit of metaphor, said to know anythingâ¦Not that specialist knowledge of any kind is required to unravel their secretsâa large part of their point is to provide a perspicuous source, accessible to anyone with a command of the language they use. But they have none of the psychology of the prototypical informant: they have no beliefs, they do not act, they are not felt to co-operate with us, and they cannot empathise with us so as to anticipate our purposes. Besides, they have a special place amongst the sources of information: they are the evidence laid down by creatures that are prototypical informants precisely as the most perspicuous vehicle of their information.

This event horizonâthe next Big Oneâprovides an important perspective on a set of operations that happen each and every day in this area, and which, from residential choices to seismic-mapping activities, from memorialization to projection, deï¬ne and help bring the potential consequences of a major earthquake into existenceâinto visibility. This ethnography is built on my own research in the Bay Area of San Francisco, where I have identiï¬ed the network of scientists and experts who connect science with their own experience of living in a seismic place and help making the Bay Area resilient [82]. As discussed above, when it come to evaluating a risk or thinking about a disaster, âknowingâ is a complex operation. In the academic context, it is often taken for granted that scientiï¬c and expert knowledge surpasses lay knowledge, and that risk would be better prevented if only residents could think more as scientists do. Here, I want to show that, in the Bay Area, scientists and experts have also learned to think as residents do; re-deï¬ning their hierarchical categories, comparing and discussing everyday risks to re-situate the earthquake threat in a time frame and context of an individualâs life span. As discussed by one respondent living in San Francisco, involved in risk prevention and the development of building codes, With earthquakes, theyâre so rare and extreme that to understand them, you have to think of them in the spectrum of everyday risks, monthly risks, and yearly risks. These all get compiled together and, most people, whether they articulate it or not, theyâre aware of that difference. You rarely ï¬nd people that dumb that they donât understand risk in their daily life. [It] doesnât mean they always make the informed decisions, but they have an innate understanding of the rarity of things.10"
116,120,0.995,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"The main conclusion I draw from the study of the moral reasoning of business leaders when confronted with the reference dilemma is that the concept of moral neutralization is very relevant for understanding how people in organizations can overcome moral dissonance and end up acting against their initial moral convictions. Ariely (2012) has a name for what happens when the original moral misgivings concerning a particular option disappears: The what-the-hell-effect. Once the moral resistance has gone, the road lies open for new routines and practices. The following quote from Tyler Hamiltonâs book about being a cyclist in Lance Armstrongâs team illustrates the mentality we can find on the other side of the fence: You could have hooked us up to the best lie detectors on the planet and asked us if we were cheating, and weâd have passed. Not because we were delusional, but because we didnât think of it as cheating. It felt fair to break the rules. (Hamilton and Coyle, 2012)"

With the added functionality of learning from their mistakes, they will have a life of their own. Thus, a rudimentary self will continue to live in cyberspace even after our death. Once we have reached the point when an entirely, conscious self can be transferred, we will have managed to transfer the human mind to a machine.

Finally, the pro-action response is one where the decision-makers go beyond industry norms and expectations, and shows innovation in coming up with unexpected and brilliant solutions to the challenges at hand. Even Carrollâs responsiveness model offers input to Hjalti and the decision he faces. He can choose reaction, and claim that it is not his responsibility as a business owner to uphold activities in remote parts of Iceland. It is the politicians and the local and national authorities who should address that issue. Hjalti can go for defence, and become minimally engaged in what happens in the local communities once his plants are closed down, or he can involve experts in an accommodation effort to identify how a company like his can contribute to social development in remote communities in Iceland, following their advice. Finally, he can choose pro-action, and explore ways to generate activities in those communities, making them less dependent on the fishing traditions of old. He can offer the fishing plant facilities for free or for a very low price to entrepreneurs and innovators who can generate other kinds on employment in the communities. He can collaborate with education providers, who can help his employees to identify and pursue alternative careers. All may not be bleak, even though the employment in fishing disappears. It is worth noting that one of the alternatives that Hjalti considers, of selling the company and leaving the dirty work of closing down the plant to others, is another course of action where utilitarianism and duty ethics will offer conflicting advice to the decision-maker. The utilitarian focuses on the outcome of the alternatives, and since they in all relevant senses appear to be the same, it would not be better, or less worse, for Hjalti to sell and leave the unpopular decision to others. Whether he directly or only indirectly causes this painful outcome for the local community, is morally irrelevant from a utilitarian perspective. An evaluation from a duty ethics perspective, on the other hand, can claim that there is a morally relevant difference between what a person does, and what he or she merely lets happen. We are primarily responsible for what we decide actively to do, and not so much for what we are passive witnesses to, even though we may have been in a position to stop that from happening. Duty ethics also gives emphasis to intention, and as noted in Chapter 3, the Doctrine of Double Effect distinguishes between intended outcomes and outcomes that are merely foreseen DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0009"

All of these big questions are embedded within the world of philanthropy. This book looks at how these questions play out in the choices people make about how to help each other in eleven Asian economies. Culture and history surely play a role as does information and data. Throughout Asia, societies are evolving and new models of governance are being tested. Some of them will succeed and others will not but in the iterative process of moving forward, we will all continue to explore and experiment with the relationship between governments, companies and people. Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the most dominant power in the world, with its soft power extending far beyond military and economic might. America has helped shape the way we think, the way we act, the way we dream and the way we treat one another. Much of this influence has been very positive and the world has welcomed the values prescribed in a Judeo-Christian set of principles. Now, at a time when India and China are once again becoming dominant world powers, the question is: what will be the influence of our soft power? This book, by casting a spotlight on Asian philanthropy, is coming at a pivotal moment in time. We are pleased to be part of this conversation. Both of us have long embraced our fortunate ability to make contributions to improving peopleâs lives and helping to progress societies. We see more and more of our peers coming to the realization that we have a role to play and we should do so with intention and with care. Post war modernity, globalism, education, and various reforms have accelerated job and wealth creation as well as philanthropy. This book fills the important need of shining a light on the patterns of philanthropy and volunteer organizations in Asia today. It provides models and strategies of effective engagement as well as showcasing the changes now taking place. We are pleased to be part of bringing this important book to the growing number of donors and philanthropists, government policymakers, non-profit leaders, teachers and students who may be drawn to social service and philanthropy and who can really use the information and insights contained here.

And that this is their main reason for choosing this profession. In the following example, youth coordinator â1â tells about his reasons for applying for the job: 1: â[The job is] very versatile. And I like working with the vulnerable â those who have the harshest conditions. It ended up that way when I taught in high school â that I was asked to work with those young people, who many of my colleagues thought were difï¬cult and challenging. But at the end of the day I thought that when you back track a little and see why they are like they are, then I had no problem saying âI think they deserve another chanceâ. There is something there. But many of my colleagues would not take on that job, because it was hard work, they were externalising, it was heavy. But I liked being in it and understanding why it is like it is. Why they are like they are. Then it is much easier to change the path forward â to help them on this path.â Hence, the focus of the youth coordinators isâin my experience from interviews and observationsâresource-based in both words and in action. I have not once experienced punishment of the offenders articulated as a rationale for their work. The common notion amongst them seems to be that a âchainâ of caring professional as well as private help is provided around the young offender with the youth plan as the guide.21 A chain that can be removed at the young personâs (or his/her guardianâs) will. That a less friendly alternative will then take over is something that they are aware of and live with, but not something they necessarily condone or think they can be held responsible for."

All these different functionings and capabilities can be used together to specify what the general functioning and capability of education encompasses and thus which level children should reach. Such specifications are necessary to put justice to work in policies. To state that each and every child is entitled to be educated is a phrase that might read well in a constitution, but it is not possible to evaluate the success of a certain policy or to criticize a state for failing its children on the basis of such a general statement. One has to know what it means to be educated and what the thresholds are. Here again, it is clear why the concepts of well-being and well-becoming are more suited for the task than the concept of dignity â a failure to educate all or some the children in a state can violate their well-being and in particular their wellbecoming without being a violation of their dignity. What becomes clear when setting a threshold in this way is that another distinction gets blurry; namely, that between functionings and capabilities, on the one hand, and the conversion factors needed to achieve them, on the other hand. In the case of education, for example, it is very plausible to assume that compulsory schooling for a certain number of years is a conversion factor for being educated and not the functioning itself. Nussbaum seems to understand it in such a way herself, as she writes that it is up to debate whether compulsory education should last for twelve years, claiming that under the given circumstances, nine years of schooling is not enough. In our view, this reflects pragmatic issues and the fact that many conversion factors have some value in themselves and are not to be used only instrumentally. To finish school is important because it implies that the children have gained certain knowledge and skills and because the official degree itself is of value in the labor market or in the pursuit of higher education. For pragmatic reasons, it is sometimes easier to determine conversion factors, which, again, are often resources. In regard to health, for instance, most empirical research uses thresholds like a child receiving certain vaccinations, which is surely not a specification of health itself but a means to achieve and sustain health. It is simply easier to measure than health itself, and it is also easier to design a policy based on the claim that each and every child should get certain vaccinations. One more thing is extremely important: If setting a threshold always implies specifying a general functioning or capability into a set of more"

31,38,0.994,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Pitcher was one of the first philosophers to realise that while Epicurusâs argument might be difficult to wholly dismiss, it can be successfully circumvented by posing a different kind of subject to which harms might accrue. Pitcher accepts the annihilation thesis and asks: âthe dead, if they exist at all, are so much dust. How is it possible for so much dust to be wronged?â(Pitcher 1984, p. 183). In answering his own question he distinguishes between two kinds of subject. The post-mortem subject, call him Harry, perhaps mouldering away in some grave, and the ante-mortem Harry, as he was at some stage of his life before he died. According to Pitcher, while death cannot be bad for Harryâs corpse it can be bad for the ante-mortem Harry. Feinberg agrees with the Pitcher thesis and elaborates on the idea of ante-mortem harm. What follows is philosophical convergence, which brings together Feinberg and Pitcher, and that might for the sake of convenience be referred to as the FeinbergâPitcher account. According to FeinbergâPitcher it is not intelligible to talk of a subjectâs survival after physical death, nor does it make sense to talk of"

A working vaccine would have been a perfect outcome in this disruptive struggle for power between the researcher and his virus ($ â a). In that case, the phage would have ended his discontent, his anonymity, by making him famous, turning his life into a success story after all. But the idea of medical benefits functions as a faÃ§ade, a pretext for his urge to dominate nature in her most elementary (viral and microbial) dimensions, working himself into a state of neurasthenia â in accordance with Dostoyevskyâs insistence that intellectual activity is, in final instance, a âdiseaseâ (1864/1972, p. 18). In conclusion, we are not confronted with a moral dilemma in the sense of a problem that can be solved by developing or abiding to rules and regulations, such as the codes of conduct and ethical principles of research with human subjects. Although such practices (developed by professional ethicists) may help to subdue the tension, making microbial research more manageable no doubt, they will not abolish the basic divide. The desire to control life may become addictive precisely because it is driven by a disruptive compulsion. As a science novel, Arrowsmith opens up and dramatizes this basic rupture, thus furthering our awareness of the gap between what basic research produces and what clinical medicine basically needs. And this divide not only affects the knowledge dimension, but the normative dimension (the level of morality and of the Self) as well. According to Arrowsmith, what is considered integrity in the realm of basic research is regarded as misconduct in medical practice, and vice versa. But this may not the final word. Arrowsmith is the first real science novel, as we have seen. In the next sections we will explore how these tensions are addressed in other novels, notably in Chap. 7 (Cantorâs dilemma) and Chap. 9 (Intuition)."
28,278,0.994,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"small way, when patient testimony is used and deployed by psychiatrists as evidence. This is especially useful when patients confound expectations (as in Watsonâs 1970 study), or requires significant intellectual work to make it fit (as in Waldenberg, 1972). However, this is principally a study of specific hospital practices, a certain set of psychiatric ideas about the social setting, and how these might resonate with a wider political context: a shift from a welfare-based, socially interventionist consensus to one of individuated, market-oriented competition. Roy Porter champions ideas of the âpatientâs voiceâ as central to the history of medicine, but this is not my principal area of interest.9 I am far more concerned with how ideas and research practices interact and produce the concepts and shorthand that humans use to understand themselves and others. Basing this book on the experience of the patient would make it a very different project. In addition, Joan Scott writes persuasively: When experience is taken as the origin of knowledge, the vision of the individual subject (the person who had the experience or the historian who recounts it) becomes the bedrock of evidence on which explanation is built. Questions about the constructed nature of experience, about how subjects are constituted as different in the first place, about how oneâs vision is structured â about language (or discourse) and history â are left aside.10 I am most interested in how âvision is structuredâ, in how ideas and practices come to influence what is possible and explicable behaviour, and how these change. This is not to demean patients or their stories, experiences or identities, but to say that this history attempts something different. The patients and their experiences recede in this telling, as do the psychiatrists to an extent. What is left are practices, arrangements, ideas, concepts â all the things that recur in psychiatric journal articles and government documents. This, like all history, must resemble its sources, but remains useful â hopefully to people other than myself â because it enables new connections to be made around self-harm, society, psychology and politics. It might make the various individuals involved in the story less visible (in terms of their experiences), or flatten them out to their research contributions, but it also allows new links: between categories of identity and the rise of professional groups; between broad political contexts and clinical categories; between an intellectual climate in psychology and psychiatry and the ways in which we understand selfdamaging behaviour; between politics and the ways in which people understand themselves and their identities."

Surely we are entitled to expect more from ethical theories. The Categorical Imperative can lead to such absurd conclusions (such as the injunction not to lie to a would-be murderer) that it is better to consider it as an elegant intellectual exercise on Kantâs part, rather than a rule intended for practical use. Also disturbing to someone trained in scientific reasoning is the Kantian use of intentions to judge the morality of actions. Rational thinking needs objectively assessable criteria. Results are subject to objective assessment; intentions are not. A traditional idea often proposed as the key to ethics is the âGolden Ruleâ: treat others the way you would wish them to treat you. While useful, it is clearly insufficient, and not always applicable. For a soldier who sees an enemy taking aim, making sure to shoot first is not unethical, but contradicts the golden rule since he most likely does not wish the other soldier to do the same unto him. More fundamentally, the ruleâs naÄ±Ìve assumption of symmetry does not hold in most cases and leads to hypocrisy. A man discussing the ethics of abortion cannot possibly understand the procedureâs potential effect on him, and would be dishonest if he pretended otherwise; ditto for a young adult discussing the ethics of policies for the old, or a billionaire discussing the ethics of unemployment compensation. Another example of traditional approaches to ethics is Spinozaâs treatise. It deserves praise for its emphasis on human freedom and for attempting mathematical-style deductionsâmathematical, however, in style only. A satisfactory system of ethics requires fresh thinking."
275,348,0.994,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"12.2 Compatible and Incompatible States The conjunction fallacy does not mean that people always judge the probability of a conjunction as higher than each of its conjuncts. That would indeed be counter to probability theory. Just imagine that the choice between (a) and (b) was presented without the story about Linda. Then one would expect everyone with some notion of probability to choose (a) over (b), as confirmed in [35]. But when asked the question after first hearing the story, even people schooled in statistics fall victim to the conjunction fallacy. Why is this? The question generated a host of publications with possible explanations over the last several decades (see [19] for an overview). Among the many kinds of explanations offered, two stand out in particular. One assumes that words such as âandâ and âprobabilityâ are misunderstood by the participants, or at least not understood in their formal interpretation. The other assumes a reasoning bias. A recent overview [30] concludes that the latter has the best support of the two. But this answer begs the question: if there is a reasoning bias, where does that reasoning bias originate? Indeed, we are not satisfied with just knowing there is such a bias, rather we would like to describe how that bias unfolds as a cognitive process. To do so, let us formulate the participantsâ judgements as the outcome of a decision process. The explanations in the literature almost invariably involve two competing states, one in which Linda is a bankteller, and another where she is a feminist. To most participants in the experiment these states are not compatible, and whether bias or reasoning, each can in principle tip the scale in favor of one state or the other. In order to make headway, we have to take a closer look at the notion of compatible and incompatible states. In this presentation we will formulate states in the language of quantum cognition. Especially for the reader who is not already familiar with this approach, we will first recall some concepts from quantum mechanics. One such concept is the (formal) notion of compatible and incompatible states. Incompatibility lies at the heart of Heisenbergâs famous uncertainty principle. It holds that when we are certain about a quantum particleâs momentum, we are necessarily uncertain about its position, and vice versa. Position and momentum are therefore called incompatible states. On the other hand, again given the momentum of that particle, we can still measure its kinetic energy with certainty, momentum and kinetic energy thus being compatible states."

With a negative outcome, the responsible executives would most likely have received criticism for wasting the investorsâ and the ownersâ money to no avail. The research literature acknowledges three categories of moral luck. The most prominent one is resultant moral luck, where the entrepreneur story from the north of Norway and Merck and the river blindness medicine are examples. Then there is constitutive moral luck, which has to do with the elements affecting a personâs character. Nature and nurture, genetic heritage and culture, can affect the extent to which a person is respectful, honest, kind, and benevolent in his or her interactions with other people. Good or bad luck plays a significant part in the formative processes, yet we tend not to take it into account when praising or blaming people for the character traits they have. The third category goes under the name of situational moral luck, and concerns the moral tests a person faces or avoids, and the extent to which character traits become publicly exposed. A person can be morally fortunate to never face situations where her moral weaknesses are exposed, or morally unfortunate to never get a chance to demonstrate personal courage and honesty, since the situations she faces do not call for the application these moral qualities. There is room for a fourth category of moral luck, not yet identified or discussed in the studies of this phenomenon. We can call it relational moral luck, and it concerns the social environment a person finds himor herself in at the time of decision-making. At crucial points in the process of judging and reasoning about what to do, the decision-maker depends on feedback from others, in the form of support or opposition to the ideas that are on the table. In an organization, he or she needs colleagues who intervene and question the assumptions that are present in the reasoning. I return to the concept of relational moral luck in the final chapter of the book, where I dwell more explicitly on the nature of the thought processes that lead from contemplation of options and alternatives, to action, and the extent to which their quality depends on the social side of decision-making. To what extent does moral luck pose a challenge to the coherence of our moral reasoning? Nagel and Williams thought that they identified a deep tension in the way we think about right and wrong when they introduced the concept. Moral luck is no doubt a thought-provoking concept and can serve as a reminder that success and failure often DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0006"

Second, the words most emphasized by Gimmestadâs main boss in the conversation after the event were that he trusted that there would be no repetition of that particular kind of mistake. âI am sure that you will never again land with the brakes on in your pilot career.â He has turned out to be right about that, but on hindsight, Gimmestad believes that his bossâ words made him exaggerate his attention to the brakes, at the expense of other and equally important aspects of the situation before, during, and after a flight (Gimmestad, 2016). When a person is encouraged to focus on one particular aspect of a complex situation, it can lead a blindness to other significant aspects, as documented in studies in perception psychology (Mack, 2003; Chabris & Simons, 1999). When you tell a pilot or a professional in other settings that they are not likely to that particular mistake again, it can create a strong motivation to make your words come true. That in itself can trigger aspect blindness since it draws the professionalâs attention to one particular aspect of the situation, much as in the gorilla experiment (Chabris & Simons, 1999), mentioned in Chap. 2. Gimmestad says that the period after the dramatic landing was one where he was particularly attentive to the brakes, and made himself vulnerable to overlook other important matters in the cockpit. That might have been the time in his career when the safety of flying with him was at its lowest. Inattentional blindness is a phenomenon that poses a threat to safety, and to the success of other collaborative processes. One by one, individuals have a limited ability to perceive what goes on around them, and depend upon colleagues to intervene when they are blind to significant aspects of what goes on in their work environment. As noted earlier, the experience of being blind to something that is right in front of their eyes comes as a considerable surprise to participants in experimental studies. It can generate a realization that we are dependent to a high degree of input from other peopleâs perspectives in order to get a rich and adequate understanding of what goes on in our work environment. The next section focuses on a model central to systematic efforts in aviation to counter the pervasive threat of inattentional blindness. It is a model"
137,127,0.994,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Several factors seem to encourage this profile in our study: first, these are men who were previously highly involved fathers within an egalitarian conjugal division of work, a context which encourages them to deconstruct and neutralize gender in family roles (e.g. all things may be done by him or her). Secondly, these are highly educated men who emphasize the value of work-family balance rather than just their work life and personal careers. Thirdly, these are pro-active fathers who make an extra effort while on leave, in order to make sure they know how to do everything and more; this ties in with an ideal norm of individualized parenthood, where it is important not only to take everything on, but also to do everything in oneâs own way. In this profile therefore, in contrast to the previous profiles, we cannot say that it is âhome aloneâ leave that actually generates the discourse of gender deconstruction. However, the findings demonstrate that the period of leave allows these men to put their changing conceptions to the test, particularly as far as the interchangeability of fathers and mothers is concerned."

Indeed, the process of coming to be able to operate fluently and effectively with tools and symbols is common to all learners as they appropriate the practices and âhabits of mindâ of a discipline. The human mind (and indeed the human brain) re-forms itself to accommodate these new discipline-speciï¬c ways of operating. For instance, Donald (2001, p. 302) has explained that literacy skills transform the functional architecture of the brain and have a profound impact on how literate people perform their cognitive work. The complex neural components of a literate vocabulary, Donald explains, have to be built into the brain through years of schooling to rewire the functional organization of our thinking. Similar processes take place when we appropriate numbers at school. It is easy to multiply 7 by 8 without representational supports, but if we want to multiply 12,345 by 78,654 then we write the numbers down and follow the speciï¬c rules of the multiplication algorithm. It is because we have been able to internalize reading and writing and the decimal system, that we are able to perform the corresponding operations with an understanding of their meaning."

Yet he also believes that he lost his dignity when he âwent in bedâ. His chess partner Gregorius admits that he has no idea what dignity really means, but insists that it does not get lost when the body begins to fail. The interpretations of dignity that this short excerpt point to are already quite diverse. One is connected to willpower and effort (resisting torturers), the other is independent of either and refers only to the frailty of the ageing human body. This book aims to illuminate the concept of dignity in the 21st century.2 What does it mean in the West? What does it mean in the Middle East? And could there be a common understanding? Or is there a common essence? Our attempt to answer these questions from a Western perspective will be done from a broad base, which includes ï¬ction, politics and everyday life (e.g. sports), as well as the philosophical literature. There are three reasons for doing so:"
223,405,0.994,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"space, a conceptual trap that we encountered in the literature. Fifth, we note the need for movement between nonverbal and verbal forms of interaction in creating knowledge and sharing meaning. When people limit themselves to just talking, they tend to become stuck. Choosing not to talk during a phase of experimentation with bodily forms of knowing and communicating is generative; and verbal communication is needed once more for shared reflection. The action experiments confirm how valuable it is for us as researchers to move out of our comfort zone when we are seeking new knowledge. We took two such steps in this project. First, we decided to participate in such an open exploratory process rather than stand back as observers or facilitators of a clearly structured workshop. Second, we chose in this chapter to focus our analysis solely on the visible evidence recorded on film. Both steps have proven highly generative. However, we recognize that the focus on the visible in our analysis did not give us access to certain important aspects. In order to explore the meaning the participants were giving to their actions, we need to listen to what they said and then connect that back to what we have observed. An analysis of the spoken words would enable us to correct or refine our configurations, for example. The other aspect we have not yet attended to are the power dynamics in the Studio for Social Creativity. Of course, they were present in the situation, for conflict in the region and tensions between groups at the college were two of the drivers for conducting the sessions in the studio. Moreover, there were differences in status among the participants (e.g., students vs. different levels of faculty; Palestinian Arab vs. Jewish backgrounds; men vs. women; and artists, academics, and practitioners). Exploring those dynamics in the construction of social space and use of physical space would require analyzing the spoken and written (e.g., graffiti) aspects along with the visible process. Another issue that needs to be examined is the potential paradox inherent in the Studio for Social Creativity. We have posited that the undifferentiated and unencrusted nature of the space is an important condition for enabling participants to generate new ideas and ways of engaging there. How will its potential as a space of possibility be maintained for groups to return to over time? The more they use the space, the more likely it is that they will build mental models of how to use it (even if they leave it unencrusted), making it harder on their return for them to break out of an unusual way of having used it. We sense a need to engage more frequently and intimately with the world of the arts to stimulate our learning. Actors and musicians have experience with the paradox because they have to keep being creative on the stages they return to night after night. Fortunately, some artists are seeking inspiration precisely by moving out of the spaces they know in order to engage in learning creatively with people from other worlds, including academics (Berthoin Antal, 2015). Acknowledgments We are grateful to the Institute for Advanced Study, Constance, for giving the first author the time and space to develop ideas for this chapter."

After hesitation in the 1960s, Boserup did not join the increasing reliance on mathematics in economics. Therefore, she found herself in a delicate position when someone presented a mathematical âBoserup modelâ and wanted a reaction from her, which happened several times. Some people said she should engage more in that discussion and take a stand on the proposals. But you know, these people are mathematicians. If they want to call their models âBoserup modelsâ, why should I be against it? I get a chance that others are becoming interested in what I have to say.

In coming to understand their project, the authors set themselves against a recent, high-profile account of collaboration (between natural scientists and social scientists) gone wrong, by Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett (Rabinow and Bennett 2012). Whereas Rabinow and Bennett had argued for rather more frank speaking in highly-charged interdisciplinary spaces, DF and his colleagues suggested, in deliberate contrast, that: [our] success might have come precisely because we did not speak frankly; we did not seek the truth; we totally failed to acknowledge â let alone discuss â the consequences of our experimental situation. What we did, instead, was to try to work and live within a zone that was just about ambiguous enough to keep everything together â that was sufficiently averse to frank-speaking to keep the worst of the resentments at bay.

We started out with modeling a very specific case, namely the spreading of a flu among pupils and staff at a boarding school. With purpose we exchanged words like pupils and flu with more neutral and general words like individuals and disease, respectively. Phrased equivalently, we raised the abstraction level by moving from a specific case (flu at a boarding school) to a more general case (disease in a closed society). Very often, when developing mathematical models, we start with a specific example and see, through the modeling, that what is going on of essence in this example also will take place in many similar problem settings. We try to incorporate this generalization in the model so that the model has a much wider application area than what we aimed at in the beginning. This is the very power of mathematical modeling: by solving one specific case we have often developed more generic tools that can readily be applied to solve seemingly different problems. The next sections will give substance to this assertion."

The other issue I feel we have with the education system is its outright bias toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Do not get me wrongâI think STEM is very important. But I also feel that the humanities, arts, and physical education are just as important. Again our kids have been conditioned to grow up to become doctors and engineers. In Kenya, the exit point from primary school is a nationwide examination called the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education. Millions of students appear for this exam around November, and by January, the results are out. There is generally much fanfare, and the highest-scoring students are identified, celebrated, and interviewed. And every year, without fail, these kids are asked what they want to be when they are done with education. They invariably respond with some variation on doctor, surgeon, engineer. I cannot recall ever hearing any of these kids say they want to be poets or dancers or artists. In our schools, a smart kid is one who is good at math or science; a kid who is good at drawing, curiously, is referred to as âtalented.â But not smart. For society as a whole to flourish, each of these disciplines brings something to the table. We need STEM. But we also need arts. And physical sciences. And humanities. A holistic approach to our development capacity. How will more âcuriousâ students graduate from the education system? I have always felt that the really good teachers can only be truly recognized after they have left their students to themselves. Allow me to explain what I mean by that. Given that our education system is optimized around passing exams, anyone with a good memory can cram facts and dates and regurgitate them at exam time. But knowing facts and understanding and internalizing them is a different kettle of fish. Good teachers plant a seed in your head, and usually you are blissfully unaware of it. They instil curiosity. Curiosity is what will make you go to the library and look for books on how electricity works. Not because there is an exam or because you have been asked to. You have gone on your own because you simply want to know. Things you learn out of curiosity, or genuine passion, stick in your head a lot longer than those bullet points you crammed to pass an exam and almost immediately forgot. This model of a teacher standing in front, rapping out notes, and then students regurgitating the same notes back at them during exams needs to be reviewed. I have interviewed software"

We worked to make these almost as simple to use as those for shooting and being shot, and we rearranged the menus so that they were at the same level. We created new curricula, introducing Kodu in new ways, and new sample games, emphasizing our new sensors and actions. We did all this in the context of talking with early teens from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds, and we ran after-school programs in a variety of middle schools, using versions of Kodu iterated between each program. What we found, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that by the end we were seeing a much wider variety of games. There were more types of play, and a broader range of subject matters. In fact, what we eventually found was that Koduâs visual polishâan important part of its initial appealâbecame one of the barriers. Its models and animations were created for a system that made shooting and racing gameplay easy. When teens started considering making a broader set of games, they saw a mismatch between their potential game systems and the ways the games could appear on screen. But in a sense, when teens observed this it was also positive. It was the beginning of a critique of the assumptions built into Koduâs available elements, opened by shifting the available rules without shifting the data. To my knowledge, what we did with Kodu has not been done with any other tool. Current tools and ideas may aim to broaden understanding of computing, they may focus on computational media literacy, and they may embody lessons learned from media making. But they are divorced from critical thinking about their representationsâfrom point of view, from politics. They havenât been critiqued regarding the way their technical specifics connect to ideas of the world, much less reshaped in response to critique. When this is how we do work in our field, we run a significant risk. We run the risk that all these well-intentioned projects end up solving precisely the wrong problem. Nelson did not say that we can and must understand computers because the IT sector (or the surveillance state, or Walmart) has an urgent need for more computingliterate worker bees. Nelsonâs challenge is only answered if we educate people who are prepared to disrupt business as usualâand to invent the broad, thoughtful media of the future."
124,547,0.994,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"forces, updating knowledge from public observation or more private sources is the key topic in dynamic-epistemic logics (van Benthem 2011). It is natural to add epistemic operators of all these sorts to logics of decision and action, and in fact, this is happening in logics of games (cf. van Benthem 2014). Many kinds of knowledge relevant to action scenarios are local, having to do with what agents know temporarily as they make a choice. But more global âprocedural knowledgeâ about the future of the process is essential, too, and then the trees of STIT may lose their grip. If I know something about your space of possible strategies, the informational situation will need âSTIT forestsâ rather than trees to distinguish the alternatives (cf. van Benthem et al. 2009). The same complication arises in genuine multi-agent scenarios. One cannot assume that agents know everything about others, and to cope with this variation, again, models have to be complicated beyond the basic STIT format. Pursuing these matters is beyond the scope of this chaper, but explicit modeling of knowledge seems inescapable in a serious theory of choice and action. For a discussion along these lines, see Pacuit and Simon (2011) for a logical system that merges ideas from STIT and PDL while explicitly representing the agentsâ knowledge. We see it as one virtue of our linking up STIT and PDL that experiences in the latter area can then be enlisted for the former. Our next section will present a case study, of one particular dynamic epistemic logic with added STIT features."

On the lighter side, we recall that only when MÃ¼nchhausen has yanked very strongly at his hair, was he able to move, and then not only himself, but taking with him the swamp, and the Earthâthe whole world. (c) It is noteworthy that in the realm of todayâs particle physics (or High Energy Physicsâwe have seen that these two terms mean the same) no evidence is found that the existing principles of relativity and of quantum theory need to be corrected or extended in any way; even though we are in a new situation. (d) After my report, it might seem as if the end of elementary particle physics has come. However, what I have presented arises from speculative hypothesis. And even if everything were correct, we would not come to an end, but find ourselves at a new beginning: in all the above considerations only strong interactions were considered, and not in terms of particular form of forces, but only in terms of the ever-changing composition of the âelementary particles,â and we have never spoken about their individual characteristicsâtherefore our conclusions were completely independent of all these additional known particle properties. Thus we have described the average behavior, the statistical behavior. But the main focus of high energy physics is precisely on all these more detailed individual properties of the new particles and the forces acting between them. And there is the question, why these forces? In this regard we stand at a new beginning. (e) Many physicists still believe in the possibility of exploring deeper and further to ever more elementary building blocks. One must follow this line experimentally and cannot be misled by intellectually satisfying speculation into believing that the scientific question is settled. (f) I have tried to describe everything in everyday language, in words, that we physicists use, when we talk about such things at tea. To you, the reader, everything must look very mysterious, especially the claim that each âelementary particleâ in different ways has been created from all the others. Take it to be âasif-speechâ, as a blurry image of what can be formulated much more precisely with the help of mathematics or technical jargon. With this report I also, as an aside, hope I have made you understand why we high energy physicists yearn so much for the next European 300-GeV accelerator, which will now probably be built."
223,21,0.994,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"In decision-making and goal-oriented social action, formal logic must be combined with knowledge, expertise, skills, and the newest information. Because actors differ in their levels of information, knowledge, skills, experience, and educational achievement, they arrive at very different decisions if they follow the principle of rational decision-making. What seems rational to an agent who has little expertise and relies on public information might be irrational to an actor with great expertise or to a stock broker with insider knowledge. â[A] given act may appear rational at the time it is undertaken; yet when a different goal is activated to which that act was detrimental it may appear irrational and one might come to regret itâ (Kruglanski & Orehek, 2009, p. 647). High levels of knowledge, skill, expertise, and early access to important information help people come to decisions that are apt to achieve the desired goal. Gaps in expertise, skills, educational achievement, and information usually restrict goal attainment.12 Like any goal-directed activity, thinking can be done well or badly. Thinking that is done well is thinking of the sort that achieves its goals. When we criticize peopleâs thinking, we are trying to help them achieve their own goals. When we try to think well, it is because we want to achieve our goals. (Baron, 2008, p. 29)"

This will include the following sub-sections: The Importance of Diversity Within XP, Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias, and ï¬nally The Positive Impact of XP. 3.1 The Importance of Diversity Within XP It may or may not be true that the number of women in XP is a bit higher than elsewhere in the industry, but even if it is, they are still in the signiï¬cant minority. Itâs important that we donât simply sit back, cross our arms and say âOh, we use XP. We donât have a problem with women in IT. Weâve solved that one already.â There is still room for improvement, and XP practitioners have an even greater responsibility than elsewhere in the industry to increase the numbers of women in tech. This is true for several reasons: XP emphasises the importance of seeing things from the end userâs perspective. This is helped when we have things in common with our end users. Obviously those end users are as diverse as our populations are. The more diversity we have within our teams, the better chance we have of appreciating our end usersâ experiences. Also, XP is a forward-looking movement which emphasises flexibility, change and progress. As agilists, we value individuals and interactions over processes and tools, therefore if there is any group of people (for instance, women) whose ability to contribute towards their teams is compromised in any way, then this should be a matter of importance within the XP community."

While the majority of the interviewees refuse to be an active part of the media discourse (e.g. active in social media or giving interviews to journalists), all interviews emphasized the importance of social media. Social media is judged as a chance for the Catholic Church to reach people they would not reach otherwise: âbut if you want to reach people you have not reached before, then you have to walk new paths (â¦) find new paths which you havenât tried yet. And that can be done by using mediaâ (NKG275140136_2). However, the majority referred to the level that we can call translocal scope. For example, the interviewees often approve the Catholic participation in public debates by referring to figures such as the chairman of the German Bishopsâ Conference or Pope Francis. Media is seen as a possibility for those representatives in translocal positions to communicate via a strong Catholic voice in the public. When one priest was asked about his opinion on Cardinal Marx, he said: âAll the others are very reserved. However, it needs people who have the courage to go there [in talkshows, the authors] and to do it and I think Marx can do that. He is very communicativeâ (KÃD246150346_1). We can observe similar arguments when it comes to media coverage on Pope Francis. For example, one priest stressed the outstanding media-related characteristics of the pope: âHe was so good. Protestant colleagues envy us a little â¦ because suddenly you are the subject of debate for a few daysâ (KÃD246150346_1). Being active in media seems to be a necessary criterion for being part of the public discourseâand therefore abilities and character traits that are seen as compatible to the media are well appreciated in persons of a translocal authority position. At this point, we can observe a distinction between the different religious figures and roles within the organization and their relation to media. Whereas certain media skills are seen as a necessary characteristic for a translocal figure of authority, the same is not characteristic for local authorities. As one priest put it: âWell, I think it is important to say: we have to be active [in Facebook], as a parish. But that does not mean that I, as the priest, also have to do that, right?â Even if they stress the necessity for the Catholic Church to reach people outside the classical parishes, social media are not seen as the right tool for that within a local scope. Most of the priests see their area of influence as limited to their parish and try to hold up a local profile: âI cannot reach the public from Flensburg to Munich, but letâs say it like that: sometimes Iâm glad that we are different here in situâ (KÃD246150346_2)."
253,123,0.994,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","killed on impact. If you do not swerve, both victims will be struck and killed; so there is good reason to think that you ought to swerve one way or another. But what would be the ethically correct decision? If you were programming the self-driving car, how would you instruct it to behave if it ever encountered such a case, as rare as it may be? Striking the grandmother could be the lesser evil, at least to some eyes. The thinking is that the girl still has her entire life in front of herâa ï¬rst love, a family of her own, a career, and other adventures and happinessâwhile the grandmother has already had a full life and her fair share of experiences. Further, the little girl is a moral innocent, more so than just about any adult. We might agree that the grandmother has a right to life and as valuable a life as the little girlâs; but nevertheless, there are reasons that seem to weigh in favor of saving the little girl over the grandmother, if an accident is unavoidable. Even the grandmother may insist on her own sacriï¬ce, if she were given the chance to choose. But either choice is ethically incorrect, at least according to the relevant professional codes of ethics. Among its many pledges, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), for instance, commits itself and its 430,000+ members âto treat fairly all persons and to not engage in acts of discrimination based on race, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expressionâ [23]. Therefore, to treat individuals differently on the basis of their age, when age is not a relevant factor, seems to be exactly the kind of discrimination the IEEE prohibits [18, 33]. Age does not appear to be a relevant factor in our scenario as it might be in, say, casting a young actor to play a childâs character in a movie. In that movie scenario, it would be appropriate to reject adult actors for the role. Anyway, a reason to discriminate does not necessarily justify that discrimination, since some reasons may be illegitimate. Even if we point to the disparity of life experiences between the old and the young, that difference isnât automatically an appropriate basis for different treatment. Discriminating on the basis of age in our crash scenario would seem to be the same evil as discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender, disability, national origin, and so on, even if we can invent reasons to prefer one such group over another. In Germanyâ home to many influential automotive companies that are working to develop self-driving technologiesâthe right to life and human dignity is basic and set forth in the ï¬rst two articles of the very ï¬rst chapter in the nationâs constitution [9]. So it is difï¬cult to see how German law could even allow a company to create a product that is capable to making such a horriï¬c and apparently illegal choice. The United States similarly strives to offer equal protection to all persons, such as stipulated in the fourteenth amendment of its constitution. If we cannot ethically choose a path forward, then what ought to be done? One solution is to refuse to make a swerve decision, allowing both victims to be struck; but this seems much worse than having only one victim die, even if we are prejudiced against her. Anyway, we can force a decision by modifying the scenario: assume that 10 or 100 other pedestrians would die, if the car continued forward; and swerving would again result in only a single death. Another solution could be to arbitrarily and unpredictably choose a path, without prejudice to either person [34]. But this too seems ethically troubling, in that we are"
275,345,0.994,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In this experiment, the participants consistently rated option (b) as more probable than (a). However, according to the axioms of probability theory, the conjunction of events is less probable than a single event, so (b) must be less probable than (a). This type of judgement errors has been found so invariably that it became known as the conjunction fallacy (see [31, 34] for other such fallacies). These findings are not widely known, let alone implemented, by programmers designing the communication part of autonomous systems. The latter systems so far adhere to the laws of probability and logic, which is their strength. Their weakness, however, is to not account for how humans make decisions. For example, an intelligent system that would correctly answer (a) in the experiment above, might bewilder the human who was expecting answer (b). In turn this could erode that humanâs trust in such a system. Let us take another, more concrete, example from technology soon to become reality. Suppose you arrive late in the evening at a meeting. As the street is clearly indicated as a tow zone, you let your self-driving car find a parking space elsewhere to park in your stead. Later you come back and find that it parked in the first free spot in that same street. Would this not be the time to reconsider your trust in the autonomy of the car? And so you instruct it not to do this again. But then it politely explains [24] that the tow zone only applies during rush hour, thus restoring your trust. An even better scenario would be that when you leave the car to park itself, it would tell you that yes, this is a tow zone, but only during rush hour. Machines have become smart enough to do the first part, in this case finding a parking space and park. But then, is it not time to work on the second part, where the machine proactively explains its actions from the humanâs point of view? Or the part where it can foresee a human error because it knows how a human would reason in a particular case? This stands to hugely help humans put trust in autonomous systems, and in the current presentation we show a direction one could go. To elaborate the problem we want to address, before trying to solve it, consider Wittgensteinâs often cited remark âIf a lion could talk, we could not understand himâ ([37], p. 223). The remark has been food for much thought and speculation (that it is probably true) for half a century, notably in the philosophy of language. We wonder, however, that if we cannot even understand a lion, whence the confidence that we will understand machines when it comes to communicating with them verbally? Here we think that Wittgensteinâs own, less quoted, comment can lead the way [37]: If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgements. This seems to abolish logic, but does not do so â It is one thing to describe methods of measurement, and another to state results of measurement. (p. 391, our italics)"
227,59,0.994,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Kilpatrick (1987) marked a historical milestone in research related to problem posing and points out that âproblem formulating should be viewed not only as a goal of instruction but also as a means of instructionâ (Kilpatrick 1987, p. 123); and he also emphasizes that, as part of studentsâ education, all of them should be given opportunities to live the experience of discovering and posing their own problems. Drawing attention to the few systematic studies on problem posing performed until then, Kilpatrick contributes deï¬ning some aspects that required studying and investigating as steps prior to a theoretical building, though he warns, âattempts to teach problem-formulating skills, of course, need not await a theoryâ (p. 124). Kilpatrick refers to the âSource of problemsâ and points out how virtually all problems students solve have been posed by another person; however, in real life âmany problems, if not most, must be created or discovered by the solver, who gives the problem an initial formulationâ (p. 124). He also points out that problems are reformulated as they are being solved, and he relates this to investigation, reminding us what Davis (1985) states that, âwhat typically happens in a prolonged investigation is that problem formulation and problem solution go hand in hand, each eliciting the other as the investigation progressesâ (p. 23).

This critical moment in a concert hall is a miniature example of how human fallibility can affect the quality of what people are trying to achieve together. Excellence in this performance depends on the detection of error, and an initiative to halt the course of events it sets in motion. Musicologist and conductor Mette Kaaby sees it as a nightmare situation, one that should not happen but may nevertheless be a reality. âA performance of Mozartâs Requiem is all about collective precision. The choir and their conductor has put down hundreds of hours of practice together, to get the details exactly right. They are supposed to breathe, move, and sing together as one entity. The conductor needs to be sensitive to what happens among the choir members, and should be able to note signs among them that something is wrong. When that does not happen, it can create a musical crisis.â (Kaaby, 2016). The narrative about the conductor and the choir builds on an event that actually took place in a concert hall. What happened next was that one singer saved the day by discreetly correcting the tone from the conductor. The other singers started from that new tone instead, and the performance went well. There was a barrier system in place to stop the conductorâs initial mistake from developing into a collective breakdown in the form of bad singing. The narrative also highlights other dimensions of coping with fallibility at work, as will emerge in the concluding reflections below. This book has addressed how individuals, groups, and organizations can handle fallibility at work. It has highlighted how mistakes are not necessarily bad, since they can generate breakthroughs in innovative processes. Kaaby explains how there can be musical contexts where starting from a mishit tone can generate unexpected new dynamics among musicians. You open the wrong door, and explore what you find there, rather than turn around and insist on opening the door you were planning to open in the first place (Kaaby, 2016). Even in cases where mistakes lead to a bad outcome, there can be important learnings to"
116,26,0.994,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Kant does not claim that we should not use other people as means, and would accept that we pay someone to sweep our floor or bring a parcel to the other side of town. What he considers morally forbidden is to use someone solely as means to an end, where the ways we involve them put hindrances on their opportunities to live a meaningful life. A slave-owner uses the slaves as merely as means to an end. If Ben tells lies to get rid of the difficult employee, he is using the other person merely as means to achieve his own goal of creating a more harmonious workplace. A utilitarian can argue that torture and other horrible acts under some circumstances are not only morally permissible, but also morally required, since they maximize utility. From a duty ethics perspective, conclusions like that expose the absurdity of the utilitarian outlook. The response from utilitarianism is to criticize duty ethics for providing too much moral protection to individuals, generating passivity in situations where lives can be saved, and societies protected. Utilitarianism embraces the concept of dirty hands, or the idea that it is sometimes morally acceptable to perform actions that in and of themselves are horrible, in the name of the greater good for all those affected. Moral reasoning and justification in organizations can show traces of utilitarianism and duty ethics, even when the protagonists have limited knowledge of the two traditions. Ethical theories tend to capture different kinds of moral intuitions and gut feelings about how one should act under given circumstances. We can explore the issue further in the light of a fictitious story developed on the basis of remarks from the British philosopher Philippa Foot (1967, pp. 8â9).

124,580,0.994,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"content must represent a fact that exist at that moment or will exist in the world in its real historic continuation. As I already said, agents live in an indeterminist world. Their future is open. At each moment where they think and act, they ignore how the world will continue. However, their attitudes and actions are always directed by virtue of their intentionality toward the real historic continuation. Whenever parents refer to their next child they refer to their next child in the real future. In order that a present attitude or illocution directed at the future be satisfied, it is not enough that things will be at a posterior moment as the agent now represents them. They must be so later in the real future. So the satisfaction of propositional attitudes and elementary illocutionary acts of an agent at a moment requires the truth at that very moment of their propositional content. The notion of satisfaction is a generalization of the notion of actual truth14 that takes into account the direction of fit of attitudes and illocutions. The relation of fit or of correspondence is symmetrical: if a proposition fits the world then the world fits that proposition. However there is more to the notion of satisfaction than to that of actual truth because one must consider the direction of fit from which the correspondence must be achieved between the mind and the world in the analysis of satisfaction of attitudes, just as one must consider the direction of fit from which the correspondence must be achieved between language and the world in the analysis of satisfaction of illocutions. There are four possible directions of fit between ideas and things, just as there are four possible directions of fit between words and things. Just as assertive illocutions have the language-to-world direction of fit, cognitive attitudes have the mind-to-world direction of fit. They are satisfied when their propositional content fits the world. In that case the agentâs ideas15 must correspond to things as they are then in the world. On the contrary, volitive attitudes have the opposite world-to-mind direction of fit just as commissive and directive illocutions have the opposite world-to-language direction of fit. They are satisfied only if the world fits their propositional content. In that case represented things in the world must correspond to the agentâs ideas. Each direction of fit between mind and the world determines which side is at fault in case of dissatisfaction. In the cognitive and assertive cases, the agent is at fault in the case of dissatisfaction. So when the agent realizes that there is no correspondence between his or her ideas and represented, that agent immediately changes his or her beliefs and is ready to revise his or her assertions. This is why the truth and falsehood predicates apply so well to satisfied cognitive attitudes and assertive illocutions. A belief and an assertion at a moment are satisfied when they are then true and unsatisfied when they are then false. Satisfaction and dissatisfaction amount to actual truth and actual falsehood in the case of cognitive attitudes and assertive illocutions. However, the truth predicates do not apply at all to volitive"
386,70,0.994,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"2.4 Concluding Thoughts on Hierarchy The public administration is a convenient case to become familiar with the structure of hierarchies. Max Weberâs âiron cageâ is a powerful image to illustrate the unconditionality of hierarchies: if you want to stay in the system, you have to obey, no matter what! Research in the 100 years since Weberâs death, however, has contributed to softening the iron cage by asking naughty questions. Would the organisational units really need the expanding budget they claimed to need? Were they able to control what they claimed to control? Could the organisational structures be adapted to organisational patterns in businesses? And could the costs the administration was causing be justified? Businesses dealing with each other are already a lecture in âhierarchies for the advancedâ. Economic models start to get complicated as soon as power asymmetries are to be considered. However, power asymmetries in the chain are the rule rather than the exception in the economy. Or have you ever wondered why your insurance puts you on hold when you call them, though you wouldnât do that to them when they call you, let alone why they never actually call you? Finally, hierarchies in the family will be all too âfamiliarâ to most of us. However, these hierarchies are extremely dynamic. Apparently, we should be kind to our kids in family businesses, because later on todayâs small pests will be responsible for the very fate of the business. By now, readers may have formulated a naughty question of their own: what does all of this have to do with agriculture? More than with, for instance, the educational administration, the health sector or families running a taxi business? Well, many findings of this section can be transposed to other sectors. Agriculture is just a worldwide melting pot with an extremely long tradition that has collected many, and significant, cultural habits. And as the food trade is arguably the most essential backbone of every economy, the farming sector serves as an ideal case in point for the significance of socioeconomics."
116,9,0.994,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"When I put this question to the financial advisors, many of them appear to experience what I in this book will call moral dissonance, a discrepancy between their moral convictions what they are tempted or ordered to do. On the one hand, they want to live in accordance the professional standard indicated in the title of being a financial advisor. Their primary goal should be to serve the client, the secondary goal to make profits. From a moral point of view, then, they realize that they should be honest to their customers and state frankly what they think would serve their personal economies best. On the other hand, their own income depends on sales of financial products, and their employers expect them to show good results. Anne may enter their office the day before the personal sales report for the month is due, and the advisor can be in a position where a sale to Anne will have a big positive impact on what happens in the meeting with the supervisor. In similarity to the corruption cases, top management seems to choose willful blindness over detailed knowledge of the practical consequences of the incentives they present to their employees, in the shape of the conversations that go on between their employees and customers. Conflicts of interest are at the core of many ethical challenges in organizations (Nanda, 2002ii). The financial advisor can decide to give priority to his or her self-interest and the employerâs interest ahead of the customerâs interest, with very little risk of detection. A similar pattern is present in relations between professionals and their clients, customers, students, and patients in other setting. These situations are different from moral dilemmas, in that they do not pose a choice between options that are more or less on equal moral footing. They are not choices between wrong and wrong, but between one option that is morally obligatory and right, and another option that is tempting, but morally wrong. Professionals often have strong incentives to choose the morally wrong options, and when they found out, face stern moral criticism. The public tends to expect and demand strength of character in the professionals, a disposition to withstand temptation to exploit their superior knowledge for personal gain. Studies in social psychology suggest that this reliance upon character is misplaced, and that organizations should instead attend to the incentives employees have for balancing between self-interest and client interest. This book presents two streams of research and inquiry to support a rethink of ethics in organizations. The first is moral philosophy and ethics, which contributes with analytic tools to handle moral dilemmas and other challenging situations at work.

299,56,0.994,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"to secure âafterlife consumptionâ (Azzi and Ehrenberg 1975). Put simply, reductionists claim, individuals spend money and time on religion in this life with the expectation that they will be rewarded handsomely after death. Needless to say, the evidence for the nature and size of these rewards is not extensiveâ¦. To dismiss the role of moral commitments in decision making, satisfiers go to great lengths to explain âsurprisingâ behavior. One example is the prevalence of tipping at restaurants. Tipping does not make sense from a reductionist perspective, particularly given that it is not legally required and that people tip the same regardless whether they intend to return to the restaurant in the future (Kahneman et al. 1986). As a result, reductionists have tended to regard tipping as âmysterious or seemingly irrational behaviorâ (Lynn 2006). Michael Lynn and Andrea Grassman, for example, explain the prevalence of tipping at restaurants as a way to âto buy social approval and equitable relationshipsâ (Lynn and Grassman 1990). Reductionist theories in the field of psychology similarly try to debunk moral behavior. Elliott Sober points out that it is âeasy to invent egoistic explanations for even the most harrowing acts of self-sacrifice,â for while such arguments may seem âforced,â they are difficult to falsify without being able to read minds. For example, one âfixtureâ in the debate about egoism is the soldier who throws himself on a grenade to save his comradesâthough seemingly a purely selfless act, psychological egoists argue that the soldier ârealizes in an instantâ that acting with cowardice would condemn him to a lifetime of guilt and shame that would be worse than death (Sober 2000). In other words, the soldier acts in his own self-interest to achieve âa better life, in terms of welfareâ or utility (Shaver 2014). However, this line of argument raises a host of difficulties for egoism. The soldier might insist he is acting morally or out of duty, in which case the egoist must argue that he is lying or deluded. Similar reductionist arguments have proposed a âbequest motiveâ to explain âexcessiveâ saving (Jurges 2001), as well as a âtaste for altruismâ on the part of nonprofit employees, who are said to âderive well-being from participating in the enterprise, and are thus willing to accept a lower wageâ (McGinnis 2011). Some have even argued that suicide represents a utility-maximizing behavior for an individual whose âtotal discounted lifetime utility [...] reaches zeroâ (Hamermesh and Soss 1974; see also Becker 2012). If one assumes that all acts are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, one can only conclude that saints âmust beâ masochistic, deriving net pleasure rather than pain from their sacrifices. If one abandons the reductionist assumption and allows for other factors to explain behavior, acts of self-sacrifice and altruistic behaviorâof affirming value commitments in generalâbecomes much easier to explain: people are sometimes compelled by moral considerations to âdo the right thingâ even if they do not expect to derive any pleasure from such actions. Much more important, most people, most of the time are pursuing both pleasure and affirmation. They differ a great deal in the extent that they are dedicating themselves to one kind of pursuit or the other, and the same personâand community and societyâchanges in that way over time.

During the transformation journey it was very evident that it is far easier to implement and solve systemic obstacles than changing people mindset. Eg. It was easy to improve the CI/CD system as compared developing expertise or making people take ownership and being accountable. Participation of people across the organization itself is a challenge when people are not clear of what the beneï¬t to them is, even after lot of planning and persuasion, signiï¬cant number of people in leadership team felt that there was no need for transformation 2.0 as we had improved on quality and timeliness of deliverables, also among the people who actively participated1 there was a skew towards Scrum Masters and Engineering managers (Fig. 3)."

FC recalls that both authors expended significant energy, over the course of many drafts, adjusting the wording so that it carried enough punch for the cultural theorist and historian, and enough nuance for the neuroscientist: in particular, the many (many) annotated drafts of the article reveal, for her at least, ongoing, shared anxieties about the politics of word choice; about how, or whether, normative claims might be made; and about if and how to include sentences that pointed to the future of the field. And yet despite these risks and efforts, co-authoring brought, for FC, significant pleasures. For a cultural theorist engaged with the history of science, the opportunity to co-author and publish in a scientific journal shifted her position of annunciation from the usual disciplinary one of external commentary to one of audible authority within a field. She surmised that for a neuroscientist, the opportunity to participate in meta-conjecture, and to intervene in the overarching frameworks and potential ontologies at work in oneâs own field, might offer a somewhat unusual, and yet potentially productive, intellectual position vis-Ã -vis one of the scientific objects that is the focus of much of his research. What collaborators cannot control, of course, is how they get read, or how they will be subsequently positioned against one another. At one stage in this process, FC followed up a shared invitation, to an interdisciplinary event, to ask whether it would be of interest to hear a linked presentation (from both FC and her neuroscientific collaborator) that included some reflection on how this cross-disciplinary partnership had developed. She received a warm reply â but one that warned her of the preponderance of âcutting-edge neuroscienceâ at the event, and thus likely scepticism about a talk that would go âtoo deeply into the genealogy of a fieldâ. Some historical context was welcome, she was told â but perhaps not too much. The key was not to work too hard at âreaching across the divideâ (between the sciences and the humanities), but simply to present cutting-edge (neuroscientific) work. Her respondent lamented, additionally, that humanists were sometimes âquite lazyâ and not up to speed with the science (this writer, we note, came from the humanities). There are many important points embedded here â not a few of which we are inclined to agree with. But what is especially fascinating is the way in which a concern about an ostentatious reaching across the divide ended up not only reinscribing an unequal dyad of science (cuttingedge, worthy of admiration, and excitement) and the humanities (that"

211,6,0.994,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"How do people think? By understanding how people think, we can do a better job of explaining their actions. Both of us (the authors) were drawn to this topic in the extreme context of entrepreneurship. This context is extreme because the actions associated with entrepreneurship can have a substantial impact on the individual taking the actions, the economy, communities, the environment, and society as a whole. For example, to explain why one individual creates a venture to benefit the community (Shepherd and Williams 2014) whereas another individual creates a venture that harms the natural environment for personal gain (Shepherd et al. 2013), we need to understand peopleâs cognitionsâwhat happens in their minds. Not only are the outcomes of entrepreneurial actions extreme (in their impact), but the associated decision making is also extremeâextreme in uncertainty, complexity, time pressure, emotionality, and identity investment. We felt that investigating cognition under such extreme conditions afforded us the opportunity to workâand push forwardâthe knowledge frontier. That is, we were able to take the existing body of knowledge (from relevant literatures on cognitive science, decision making, and other aspects of psychology) and adapt it, twist it, and blend it to make a new form that would explain entrepreneurial cognition. For example, how do people make decisions in highly uncertain environmentsâthat is, when one does not know the odds of different alternative outcomes occurring (i.e., risk), nor does one even know the possible alternative outcomes"

Fallers seem to put the falls behind them, and even express less fear of heights than those who lack experience of falling (Poulton, Davies, Langley, Menzies, & Silva, 1998). The freedom to climb that I experienced as a child was part of a more general freedom to roam and be away from our parentsâ gaze for long spells. At the age of seven, I could be away from my home for hours, without my parents knowing where I was, with whom, what we were doing there, and when I would return. Today, seven-year olds in the same area do not have nearly the same opportunity to move beyond the home or the gaze of adults. If a mother and father today had been similarly unaware of their childâs whereabouts, it would most likely have been seen as something the local child welfare authorities should look into. The restrictive tendency is present in many cultures (Francis & Lorenzo, 2006). Evolutionary childhood studies suggest that it may inhibit childrenâs mental and physical development (Sandseter & Kennair, 2011). This chapter explores how the upbringing of children can affect the extent to which they are capable of and prepared to deal with risk, uncertainty, and fallibility in adulthood. More specifically, it discusses how childrenâs engagement in risky play can prepare them for encounters with real and probable adversity as adults, and also the critical quality moments where the next decision they make will crucially impact the outcome of processes at work. The aim of the chapter is to consider possible links from findings in childhood research to theories about peopleâs capabilities to cope with fallibility in work settings. First, it discusses research on beneficial effects of childrenâs engagement in risky play, most notably the anti-phobic effects of such activities (Sandseter & Kennair, 2011). Second, it draws parallels to three sets of concepts that are relevant with regard to how people prepare for, deal with, and rethink their roles in critical events where mistakes and errors occur. All of them have roots in stoical philosophy, in that they highlight the need to meet adversity with a calm and collected attitude. They are (i) resilience understood as the capacity to bounce back from adversity (Goldstein & Brooks, 2005; Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000;"

Immanuel Kant considered the act of overcoming oneâs desires to do the right thing to be more praiseworthy than acts where there was full harmony between reason and inclination, and the decision-maker could behave correctly without inner struggle. Various accounts of authentic leadership share with virtue ethics an assumption about firmness of character. How will the leader respond to an opportunity to earn quick money by acting against his moral convictions? The standard answer from virtue ethics is that it depends on the stability and robustness of leaderâs character. If he is an authentic leader, or so the contributors to this field of research argue, internal moral standards will guide his decisions and conduct, and he will thus not give in to temptation. Empirical research in social psychology indicates that the characteroriented approach has underestimated how circumstances affect decision-making. Aspects of the situation often appear to override character in affecting a personâs response to a moral challenge. A range of experiments has demonstrated that circumstances influence what people actually do when they face a moral test (Alderman 1972; Isen 1987; Baron 1997), and Doris (2002) has outlined how these studies indicate the need for a more empirically informed ethics. The Good Samaritan experiment, designed and executed by Darley and Batson at Princeton University, provides material for one of the most notable studies on character and circumstances (Darley and Batson, 1973). Theology students were individually told to walk to another part of campus, in order to do a presentation on The Good Samaritan story from the Bible. One third of the students were told that they needed to hurry up to get to the building in time, another third that they were just on time, and the final third that they were early and had plenty of time. On the way to the other building, the students encountered a person lying on the pavement in pain, needing assistance, in parallel with the actual Good Samaritan story. The researches wanted to test whether the differences in the studentsâ hurry to reach the other building would make a difference to their helping behaviour. If character is the most influential factor, then there should be only minor differences. In the experiment, only 10ï of the students in a hurry offered to help, 45ï of students who were on time and 63ï of those who were early made helping initiatives to the person in pain (Darley and Batson, 1973, p. 105). The results indicate that circumstances have a strong influence on conduct, and may have more predictive power than character. DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0012"

They might prefer that the âanalystâ make these tradeoffs and just not discuss them. (We writers have participated in such situations.) Planners, engineers, or analysts are often very willing to make these tradeoffs because they pertain to subject areas in which they often consider themselves expert. However when political tradeoffs are at issue, no one is an expert. No one has the âoptimalâ answer, but professionals should be engaged in and informing and facilitating the process of coming to an acceptable, and often compromise, decision. Through further development and use of practical analytical multiobjective planning techniques, analysts can begin to interact with all participants in the planning and management process and can enlighten any who would argue that water resources policy evaluation and analyses should not be political. Analysts, managers and planners have to work in a political environment. They need to understand the process of decision-making, what information is most useful to that process, and how it can best be presented. Knowledge of these facts in a particular planning situation might dictate substantially the particular approach to objective identiï¬cation and quantiï¬cation and to plan selection that is most appropriate. The method deemed most appropriate for a particular situation will depend not only on the physical scale of the situation itself but also on the decision-makers, the decision-making process, and the responsibilities accepted by the analysts, the participants, and the decision-makers. Finally, a reminder that the decisions being made at the current time are only those in a sequence of decisions that will continue to be made on into the future. No one can predict with certainty what future generations will consider as being important or what they will want to do, but spending some time trying to guess is not an idle exercise. It pays to plan ahead, as best one can, and ask ourselves if the decisions being considered today will be those we think our descendants would have wanted us to make. This kind of thinking gets us into issues of adaptive management and sustainability (ASCE 1999)."

But there is no mistake in expression. I meant both and especially the last possible step. Instead of an error of style it has to do with a hypothesis, which is being described by this lecture. It appears that we have reached, in elementary particle physics a completely new paradigm, a kind of a terminal situation, in which the question about the composition of matter receives an unforeseen and satisfying answer. This is actually surprising, because we still canât overcome the old difficulties. Whenever someone says to me, that he has now found the true atom, the building block of all matter, I always ask him, then what is this thing made from? One can just read Kant, to see in what sort of cul-de-sac that leads. And now I claim that high energy physicsâperhaps!âoffers a final solution to this dilemma? I do not want to be misunderstood: first, I am making a claim, which is not accepted by all of my colleagues, and second, I do not claim that we are about to understand everything about elementary particles.

And new learning builds connections between people and knowledge to create the conditions in which change can begin to be imagined and actioned. The emphasis on the collective and connected quality of active learning is also very helpful and encourages us to see beyond learning as an individualised process."

More than a year after the experiences in the studio, we revisited the films and turned off the audio track, noting down separately what we saw people doing in the physical spaceâwhen and for how long they engaged with each other and with the fixed or semifixed physical aspects of the studio. We then compared our individual observations, jointly checking the film material again when we found we had noticed things differently. It is from this iterative process that we gained fresh insights into the integrated process of constructing social and physical space. In the account that follows we rely as much as possible on these observations and provide visual illustrations from the video recording. Although we disciplined ourselves to base our analysis on the film material, it is difficult to exclude additional knowledge from our analysis completely, for we had jointly designed and experienced all the sessions. We include some details that are not based on the visible evidence when we feel it would be essential for the readerâs understanding."

It also requires staff to have additional skills in the areas of communication and teaching to allow for effective cooperation and the exchange of knowledge, skills and capabilities in the workplace. This is the context within which the development of ethical educational placements is taking place. In the introduction we questioned whether it is possible for students to unproblematically become âculturally awareâ or develop âcultural competenceâ through merely participating in international placements. Practically all of the students mentioned culture, usually in relation to difference, in terms of different systems, ways of working and values. Our survey suggested that 78% and 18% of students respectively believed their placement had a very strong or strong impact on their cultural awareness. Returning to the discussion above about death, some students were able to reï¬ect on their experiences from the perspective of cultural differences rather than concluding simplistically that Ugandans lacked compassion. In the following case, the nursing student recognised the complex relationships between human emotions and outward displays of grief: The women, when they are having babies and in pain, they just get on with it. There was one woman who was basically just smiling at me the whole way through her labour, she looked so beautiful as well and I just thought oh my god! But then there was one baby who was going to die and when the mum was told she didnât show a massive amount of emotion. I donât know if itâs because thatâs so common to them it was just quite strange to see. (Nurse, Uganda)"

However, through a social network I put it [the comment] on and thatâs it. Saying things behind [other peopleâs backs] is much easier. (Interviewee 2) Current research has shown that there is no single proï¬le of a hater or cyberbully who is concealed under the cloak of anonymity. Even though there are organised groups that seek to promote hatred online, in most cases the people that hide behind hateful or discriminatory trolling messages are not linked to openly intolerant ideological movements (cf. Isasi and Juanatey 2016), but are instead users who just do not realise the potential impact of their digital activity, and the effects that it can have in the offline world (cf. Stein 2016): (130) Because on the Internet it seems that the thing is diluted, people feel shielded behind their computer, and I am here in my house in Toledo, no matter who reads this. The one who reads it will be far away, so nothing will happen.

Interviewee 3 Well, I suppose that it is bad. Evidently you wonât like anyone who speaks badly about you. Surely then that, as we are in the society that we are, will affect your private life. I donât know, I imagine, I donât know what measures should be taken: closing Facebook or changing names or changing friends on Facebook.

(Interviewee 17) Hatred towards certain groups, which underlies both online and offline hate speech, can also manifest itself in other modes of expression of violence and intolerance, such as that of (cyber)bullying. Through their personal experiences, some of our interviewees showed that the expression of hate is intimately linked to the experience of (cyber)bullying, and more speciï¬cally, that a personâs identity is often used by perpetrators as a weapon to exercise (cyber)bullying. Keeping in mind that (cyber)bullying is typically tied to the school context and considering at the same time that the educational context should be the primary place where the causes of violence, intolerance and hatred against those who are perceived to be"
78,371,0.994,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"There are circumstances where it is accepted that fooling each other is part of the game: for example, on the April foolâs day. It is also societally acceptable to fool someone to his or her own advantage, for example with a surprise party on his or her birthday, or else to fool someone with his or her consent, for example in artistic performances, where it is particularly appreciated when the scenery and the performance is close to reality so that it is credible. However, beyond these very special circumstances, societies rest on a general consensus that fooling should be avoided, and there are many rules, institutions and infrastructures to outlaw and make life difficult to those trying to fool their peers. Fooling others is indeed breaching plurality. Beyond being inherently unfair, it leads to a âsuspicion of all against allâ, dissolves trust, prevents any form of togetherness and dissolves plurality. Fooling others knowingly and purposefully results de facto in a self-exclusion from the community of peers and from the ideal public space. These considerations hint to the fact that there is a link between trust, literacy and policy. It is part of literacy to distinguish socially acceptable fooling and unacceptable fooling.

175,187,0.994,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","In our opinion the most important aspect of model use today is communication. Unless water resource planners and managers can articulate well their needs for information, it will be difï¬cult for modelers to generate such information. If the modelers cannot communicate effectively their modeling assumptions and results, or how others can use their tools to obtain their own results, little understanding will be gained from such models. Both users and producers of modeling analyses must work together to improve communication. This takes time, patience, and the willingness to understand what each has to say and what is really meant by what is said. To expect everyone to communicate effectively and to fully understand one another may be asking too much. As written in the Bible (Genesis; Chapter 11, Verses 1â9) there was a time when everyone on the earth was together and spoke one language. It seems these people decided to build a tower âwhose top may reach into the heaven.â Apparently this activity got the attention of the Lord, who for some reason did not like this tower building idea. So, according to the Bible, the Lord came down to earth and âconfounded the peoples language so they could not understand one another.â They could no longer work together to build their tower. Is it any wonder we have to work hard to communicate more effectively with one another, even in our single, but multidisciplinary, ï¬eld of water resources planning and management? Let all of us modelers or analysts, planners, and managers work together to build a new tower of understanding. To do this we need to control our jargon and take the time to listen, communicate, and learn from each other and from all of our experiences. Who knows, if we are successful, we may even have another visit from the Lord. Those who are involved in the development of water resource systems modeling methodology know that the use of these models cannot guarantee development of optimal plans for water resources development and management.

209,99,0.994,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"additional information (Goodin & Niemeyer, 2003; Muhlberger & Weber, 2006). This research is the exception however, and most look at the impact of the entire public engagement experience. Much of the research and theory about everyday discussion would suggest that the discussion is essential in helping individuals crystallize what they learn from other sources (Eveland & Hively, 2009; Mansbridge, 1999; Sanders, 1997); however, the research supporting that fact in the presence of readings and discussion is rather scant. There are a host of theories that can help explain why participating in public engagements would lead to an increase in knowledge, but they can generally be tied to two different perspectives. One perspective is simply that providing information will lead to an increase in knowledge, with the caveat that the information is attended to in some fashion. A wrinkle to this perspective in the public engagement literature focuses on how the material is being presented. For example, the National Issues Forum recommends that information be presented in a balanced, nonpartisan fashion. The second perspective instead focuses on cognitive engagement with various aspects of the materials as the reason behind why individuals learn. Put simply, participating in an engagement will motivate you to think (or cognitively engage) with the concepts somehow, which in turn will foster learning. Along these lines, there is evidence that when participants know their input will matter, this increases motivation, and they are more likely to cognitively engage with the materials (Powell & Kleinman, 2008). However, the reasoning behind the âpresentation of materialsâ arguments is directly tied to presenting the material in a way that will foster deeper or more effective cognitive engagement, so the two perspectives are not completely distinct. Over our series of studies, we examine both of these perspectives to try to better understand how best to foster increases in learning."
117,106,0.994,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Hermeneutic Autonomy One way to escape the autonomy dilemma is to look for an understanding of individual will-formation that introduces reason and interindividual reflection as guiding factors in this process, without at the same time assuming a definite set of ethical norms that trump individual choice. Many accounts of the self that have been developed in hermeneutic philosophy can be read in this way. Most notably, Paul Ricoeur sees will-formation as a reason-guided process. Reasons are not just given preferences. They always include a judgement about what is to be regarded as good in an inter-individual sense. If a certain course of action is judged as being good, any person in a similar situation ought to be able to follow this judgement, regardless of whether or not they initially have such a preference. The judgement need not be restricted to instrumental goodness, according to which an action is good if it serves as a means to bring about a desired state of affairs. âGoodâ also covers actions of which one assumes that they can be part of what constitutes a ââgood lifeâ with and for others, in just institutionsâ (Ricoeur 1992, p. 172). Therefore, forming oneâs own will is potentially always an interindividual, communicative relation and contains a âdialogical dimensionâ (Ricoeur 1992, p. 180). Recognising and weighing reasons involves taking up the perspective of others. One does not begin decision-making with a fixed set of preferences that just need to be correctly informed in order to lead to what the individual then can regard as a good decision. On the contrary, decision-making starts as an always in principle open search for reasons which are formed by taking up a number of points of view through which one finds oneâs own perspective. If this is a correct model of what it means to form a will, a debate about what is good is a seamless extension of the internal will-forming process. In such a debate, each standpoint functions as a reason that must be weighed and assessed, just as reasons and standpoints are internally assessed in the will-forming process. Hence, the result of a debate can have an influence on the individual will, regardless of the standpoint and preferences that made up this individual will in the first place. If someone is convinced by such a debate and changes their will accordingly, this is essentially identical to the process by which one forms oneâs will oneself."
244,45,0.994,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","ETS is a nonprofit educational measurement organization with public service principles deeply rooted in its progenitors and in Section 501(c)3. Both its progenitors and the framers of the tax code were interested in the same thing: providing a social benefit. A corollary of this history is that the purpose of a nonprofit measurement organization like ETS is not about making money. Its purpose is not even about making money to support its mission (because that, in itself, would be a nonexempt purpose). Its purpose is about doing its mission, making enough money in the process to continue doing it in better and bigger ways. Third, it is reasonable to argue that, in the twenty-first century, renewed meaning can be brought to ETSâs mission by attacking big challenges in education and measurement, such as using assessment to guide instruction, measuring new constructs to help individuals with educational choices, and using assessment to increase diversity. Interestingly, many of these big challenges are the same ones that motivated the organizationâs progenitors. Those individuals knew these were hard problems but they had faith that those problems could be solved. To solve them, ETS and organizations like it will need to act more responsively and more responsibly than ever before. Make no mistake: If ETS succeeds in being responsive without being responsible, or in being responsible without being responsive, it will have failed. ETS, and kindred organizations, must do both. Doing both is what it means to be a nonprofit educational measurement organization in the twenty-first century.

Note, however, that this may well lead cars to acquire some rather unethical preferences, as it is far from clear that the majority of drivers would set a standard worthy of emulation by the new autonomous cars. If they learn what many people do, smart cars may well speed, tailgate, and engage in road rage. One must also note that people may draw on automatic responses when faced with the kind of choices posed by the Trolley Problem rather than on ethical deliberations and decisionmaking. That is, observing people will not teach these machines what is ethicalâ but what is common. This concern is supported by an experiment conducted by Jean-FranÃ§ois Bonnefon et al. (2016), who tested participantsâ attitudes about whether driverless cars should make utilitarian moral decisions, even when that would mean sacrificing the passengerâs life in order to save a greater number of pedestrians. They found that most respondents want driverless cars to make utilitarian decisions, but they themselves desire cars that will prioritize their own well-being at the cost of others. Philosopher Patrick Lin put it that, âNo one wants a car that looks after the greater good. They want a car that looks after themâ (Metz 2016). This is hardly a way for Google, Tesla, or any other car manufacturer to program ethical cars. Theyâd best not heed the massesâ voice. In short, both the top-down and the bottom-up approaches face very serious difficulties. These difficulties are not of a mechanical sort, but concern the inner structures of ethical philosophies used by humans. Even so, these difficulties pale in comparison to those posed by the question of whether or not smart machines can be turned into moral agents in the first place."

When the conditions for SFAs are satisfied, agents exercise control over their future lives then and there by deciding. Indeed, as argued earlier, they have what I have called âplural voluntary controlâ over their options in the sense that they are able at the moment of choice to bring about whichever of the options they will, when they will to do so, for the reasons they will to do so, and on purpose rather than by mistake or accident. And note that it is the diminishment of antecedent determining control over any one of the options that makes possible such plural voluntary control over each of them. Indeterminism, by being a hindrance to the realization of some of the agentâs purposes, opens up the possibility of pursuing other purposes, of doing otherwise, voluntarily and rationally. To be genuinely self-forming agents (creators of ourselves), to have a free will, there must at times in life be such obstacles and hindrances in our wills that must be overcome. Self-formation, as I like to say, is not a gift, but a struggle. One further remark about control: For an agent to have control generally at a time t over the being or not being (existence or non-existence) of some event (e.g. a choice) is for the agent to have the ability or power at the time t to make that event be at t and the ability or power to make it not be at t. And in an SFA, one exercises just such control over the choice one makes (e.g. the choice of A rather than B) at the time one makes it. For, one not only has the ability or power at that time to make that choice be, one also has the ability or power at that time to make it not be, by making the competing choice (of B rather than A) be. One has both these powers because either of the efforts or endeavorings in which one is engaged might succeed in attaining its goal (choosing A or choosing B) at the time. And if either effort does succeed in attaining its goal, the agent can be said to have brought about the choice thereby made by making that effort to bring it about. A final objection I will consider here is this: Is there not some truth to the oftrepeated charge that undetermined choices of the kinds required by libertarian free will must be arbitrary in a certain sense? A residual arbitrariness seems to remain in all self-forming choices or SFAs since the agents cannot in principle have sufficient or overriding (âconclusiveâ or âdecisiveâ) prior reasons for making one option and one set of reasons prevail over the other. I think there is some truth to this charge, but it is a truth that reveals something important about free will. I have argued elsewhere (Kane 1996, 145â146) that such arbitariness relative to prior reasons tells us that every undetermined self-forming choice or SFA is the creation of novel constraints upon an agentâs pathway into the future, constraints that are not fully explained or determined by the agentâs past, but are consistent with that past. In making such a choice we say, in effect, âI am opting that these purposes and plans (rather than some others) will be a part of my pathway into the future, my future life. Doing so is not required by my past reasons, but is consistent with my past and represents one branching pathway my life can now meaningfully take. Whether it is the right choice, only time will tell. Meanwhile, I am willing to take responsibility for it one way or the other.â"
118,344,0.994,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Developing a framework for a Cultural Risk Analysis, i.e. to carry out a cultural analysis, requires a paradigmatic shift in human consciousness similar to the one that took place in the Enlightenment. And this will be extremely difficult because it is a shift requiring both the rational (cognition) and the emotional (feeling). It will require both risk-as-analysis and risk-as-feelings; it will require both moral reasoning and emotional morals. As any good engineer knows (at least those who have taken my class), a redundant and diverse system has order of magnitude higher reliability if the system is built of âANDâ gates rather than âORâ gates.21 Perhaps Thomas Kuhn [34] said it best, ââ¦that is why a law that cannot even be demonstrated to one group of scientists may occasionally seem intuitive to others. Equally, it is why, before they can hope to communicate fully, one group or the other must experience the conversion we have been calling a paradigm shift.â And, âJust because it (a paradigm shift) is a transition between incommensurables, the transition between competing paradigms cannot be made a step at a time, forced by logic and neutral experience. Like the gestalt switch, it must occur all at once (though not necessarily in an instant) or not at all.â"

Indeed, as will become clear, the Veracruz context was probably the most brutally repressive one we investigated in this project. In our broader project, we also investigated the effect authoritarian rule continues to have on its citizens beyond borders (Glasius 2018; Dalmasso 2018; Del Sordi 2018; Michaelsen 2016), and we occasionally refer to this field of research in Europe too. We also draw on our collective fieldwork experience from previous projects, in the countries mentioned above as well as in the authoritarian or transition contexts of Cameroon, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Tunisia, and the short-lived âTamil Eelamâ controlled by the Tamil Tigers. Hence, we bring together a tremendous amount of fresh, cross-regional experience in the authoritarian field, as well as rich knowledge of the relevant political science and area studies literature. We have devoted frequent group sessions both to preparing for our fieldwork, and to reflecting on our experiences afterwards. We were helped tremendously with this by the three ethical advisors we sought out to think through our dilemmas: Marcel van der Heijden, program manager at HIVOS and an expert on Central Asia and the Middle East; Dirk Kruijt, professor emeritus at the University of Utrecht and an expert on Latin America and the Caribbean; and Malcolm Smart, a human rights professional who has managed various regional and other programs for Amnesty International, Article 19, and Human Rights Watch. We take this opportunity to thank them for their advice and support. These discussions between ourselves and with our advisors, and the realization that in previous projects we had not had the benefit either of written guidance, or of an exchange of experiences and practices, gave rise to this book. Our reflections and recommendations in this book are based on our individual experiences. Where many of us have very similar experiences, not only during the fieldwork for this project but also in previous fieldwork episodes, we have taken the liberty of abstracting from these incidents or practices and formulated more general findings. Wherever possible, we have engaged with the existing literature so as to be on firmer ground in our quest for generalization. In many other instances in this book, where our experiences are more varied, contradictory, or even unique, we just describe what our practice is or what has happened to us as an individual experience. Importantly, we want to emphasize that one should not read the experiences of, for instance, our China or Iran researcher, as âthis is what it is like to do field research in Chinaâ, or âthis has been the experience of political scientists going into Iranâ.

One politician may adopt a particular measure and then he/she leaves and somebody else steps in and no longer wants to implement it. Thus, there is change for the sake of change. There is no consistency and continuity in decision-making. For example, the Baccalaureate exam and admission to the pre ï¬rst grade program. (I9)"

We can no longer continue to talk about patient-centred care without a willingness to engage with all aspects of the person we support and care for including their physical, emotional, social, existential and spiritual needs. It is time to move away from a medical approach only to care in the HSCT setting to one of attending to the person. With nursing leadership and the reality of dying in the HSCT setting, there is no more urgent time to take forward the reality of person-centred care. Often the greatest gift we can give to those who are dying is our attention and presence. Amidst the uncertainty and the painful realities each person has to face, caring is often perceived as occurring when another person carries out a simple act of kindness with a caring attitude, which requires us to be attentive to them."
118,598,0.994,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Where is this question asked? If it is asked in developed countries, such as the U.S. or Japan, with the money and resources that those countries have, and the high level of education of the population, there are a number of choices for electric power supply and the population has the ability to correctly select them. Therefore, we can easily move to the next question. However, if it is asked in developing countries, where rapid energy growth is a requisite condition, and the population does not even know what would be the consequences of their choices, there comes another question very difficult to answer: is it ethically preferable to ensure their rights to select the energy sources? To whom is this question is asked? If it is asked of an individual, and if that individual is an expert, he (or she) might try to quantitatively analyze the risk and the benefit based on the data he has, include some of his personal perceptions, and finally give you the answer. (Perhaps this is also what I am going to do.) If not an expert, he might emotionally give you the answer based on the information he has. But when it comes to a decision of a country or a society, apart from achieving the utility (by quantifying the risks and the benefits and make sure that the benefits are worth the risks), the fairness among the society members must also be taken into account by some means or other. When is the answer needed? In the case of decision on the energy policy of a country, when it has money and resources, which means it has the chance to choose its preferred energy resources, the answer to the question âare the benefits of nuclear power worth the risks?â might not be needed until the next decade or even the next century because its energy production potential is several times the demand. On the other hand, for a country with small potential, it might need the answer within several years or even several months. In that case, the only thing it can do is to try to improve and make use of the tool (risk-benefit analysis) it has, and set up some system to obtain as much as possible the perceptions of its public. Under this circumstance, regarding the results of risk-benefit analysis being done by developed countries, even after including the social impacts (public anxiety or opposition movements) or ethical issues (which came up in the answer to the first question) to be observed, I still personally think that the benefits of nuclear power in Thailand are worth the risks, for the time being. However, this is based on the present information I have. If in the future, the possibility of severe accidents is to become tens or hundreds of times what we see now, and the social and economic impacts are proved to be much larger than what they are now, this evaluation may change. In my personal view, the most important thing is to be able to judge the risks and benefits under the present circumstance with limited information, and take responsibility for the judgment, no matter whether you are an individual, an expert, or a decision maker."

The sentence, FC thinks, also expresses some bafflement that the neuroscientists in the room had been subject to such affectively intense critique, given that they were precisely those who had chosen to engage, in sustained ways, with those from other disciplines in order to interrogate neuroscientific models and evidence. But the affective dynamics of the workshop did not, FC believes, hold open the possibility of recognizing these kinds of âentangledâ cross-disciplinary labours: instead, they lurched towards a bifurcated field of âhatersâ and âplayasâ. This overheard sentence, then, which might well usually have been sloughed off as a casual interjection and one unimportant to the âworkâ of interdisciplinarity, made clear to FC how any attempt to understand that work needs to attend to the fraught and deep affective channels that shape how individual researchers â and the arguments they make â retreat, advance, exchange, and disengage with fields different from their own. The sentence achieved this through a bold and unexpected importation of popular culture â specifically via the use of a term that emerged in African-American hip hop to anatomize the changing economic and social hierarchies of the street and the music industry. We want to stress that, in our experience, it has not been uncommon for this kind of ironic, multi-modal word-play â an informal register that can carry irritation, acuity, grandiosity, and hurt more openly than that of frequently strangulated academic exchange â to be the means through which we ourselves, as well as others we have heard commenting on interdisciplinary scenes, bear witness to some of the most difficult elements of interdisciplinary working. A quick postscript: The term âplaya haterâ began to travel, sometimes invoked by us and by some of the people with whom we collaborate; it become a way to track interdisciplinary power dynamics. One of us (FC) has herself, on a number of occasions, been described, good-naturedly, as a âneuroscience playa haterâ. She certainly didnât easily identify with being one (not least given the unhappy analysis we have just provided above), and she certainly didnât see herself consciously wanting to endorse a bifurcated vision of the world in which there are simply the âplayasâ and the âplaya hatersâ.

315,359,0.994,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"The structure of this discourse shows that this young person has a strong sense of self; he tries to judge objectively the disadvantages that certain national identities could entail but does not adopt a conflictive attitude or present himself as a victim. Indeed, quite the opposite is true; he expects to be valued for his qualities and success. The identity problem this points to does not entail integration difficulties for wanting to hold on to his origins, but centers on the demands which the Moroccan student places on himself to prove his worth as a Spanish citizen, despite any discrimination he might suffer from natives. The second type of discourse is totally different. It is manifested in youth in early adulthood who say that they like to mix with others of their own national origin outside work. Outside work is very important here. In other words, they think about their national identity and identify with it when relaxing or going out socially. However, in less exclusive areas, such as the workplace or standard circulation in public spaces, self-awareness of their foreignness is not a driving force. This is illustrated by the case of an Ecuadorian who had started working at a young age with his father in the familyâs butchery business and says he only mixes socially with Ecuadorians. However, at the same time, this youth is trying to attain his secondary-school certificate (ESO) and is aiming to enlist in the Spanish armed forces. As his goal shows, he is far from being against a Spanish identity. In general, we can observe that the nationalistic self-projection of the second generation in leisure contexts but not in other aspects of their lives occurs particularly among youths who set themselves nationalistically neutral goals in the labor market concerning their future as adults, while enjoying an easy circle of friends of similar national origin. This certainly presents a way of holding on to a sense of national identity that does not hinder progress in terms of social integration."

All these interventions would be based on the assumption that my preference not to plummet ought to be the other personâs preference as well. However, this is clearly not the case, since the observed person is choosing to step on the bridge. As Mill argues, the only mistake I may presume the person walking is making is that he is not correctly informed about the bridgeâs condition. If I have provided him with this information and he keeps on walking anyway, further attempts to prevent him from his course of action must be seen as unwarranted interventions into his individual freedom (Mill 1869, chapter 5, p. 5). The most fundamental way to express these characteristics and implications of the autonomy principle is to say that the autonomy principle does not include a conception of a shared or potentially sharable idea of a good life. Such an idea would justify attempts to understand and discuss reasons for acting one way rather than another. Interests could be understood as preliminary judgements on what ought to be regarded as good, which are then always open to revision. In contrast, following the autonomy principle, one may help others to fulfil their will if one is in a position to do so and if the other person asks for and needs help, regardless of how one assesses these aims oneself. The justification on which this option to help rests is that the end which the other person wants to realise is obviously in their interest and thus promotes what they regard as good for themselves. Conversely, if the person rejects an offer of help, such as a medical treatment, this is what they want, and no further attempts to change the will are called for. Attempts to alter what a person wants are confined to giving factual information. Doing more would have to be seen as unduly influencing the other personâs will, since there is no way to understand this exertion of influence as part of what the other person themselves would do or wants to do. Giving reasons for alternative courses of action becomes an unwarranted act of intrusion as soon as these reasons do not refer to the given interests and preferences of the other person. In other words, according to the autonomy principle, reasons for actions are solely the given interests of the acting person. Inter-individual reasons cannot be part of the individual process of will-formation."

Do you have a path to your audience through any of the established distribution bottlenecks (music publishers, radio stations, concert venues, record labels)? Computer technology has put those criteria into the past. Anyone can now create music, notation or instrumental skills being no longer required due to many new digital interfaces to sound. Anyone can netcast, podcast, stream, or publish music online. The line between professional and amateur, to the extent that it survives at all, is too blurry to be useful. And the same goes for visual art, writing, photography, cinema, leaving perhaps only the most physicality-mired creative professions relatively proficiency class based. This lack of a professional Ã©lite that can be clearly differentiated from non-professional creative workers is part of why the economies of the various arts are in such chaos due to computer tech. Now the most stable economic value seems to reside more so in the tools used for creative work, marketed as intellectual property in themselves, instead of in what is made using them. But the design of tools for creative work is too often no longer being done by their users, and such tools often very much limit both creative conception and output. Too often they require a work to be highly preconceived in advance of even launching software to explore. Often they present a menu of templates for project types and standard formats within a medium, shunting their user into one a prefabricated standard form. And for Tedâs main medium, words, we are still locked into sequential text editors in which it would have been impossible to write Tedâs earlier books. Laziness? Lack of imagination? Conservatism? Fear? Or a market-based, profitbased, tool-building industry that knows its bread is buttered by lowest common denominator non-thinking? Or maybe we are simply expecting things to change more radically, faster than they can, because while technology can speed up and get cheaper very quickly, other changes require profound paradigm shifts in the assumptions of entire social cultures. I always wanted creative control of software and itâs taken me till now to get it. I didnât realize that since the techies thought they could design interactive software no one in the world had any right to tell them otherwise.

From these lecture notes, the reader will not only learn about the Standard Model but also a way to approach physics. They are a faithful portrait of Guido, not only because they cover the field of his vast scientific activity but also because they convey his pragmatic and concrete vision of the world of physics.

50,142,0.994,"Seeing Ourselves Through Technology : How We Use Selfies, Blogs and Wearable Devices To See and Shape Ourselves","This panopticon is also an image of our modern society, Foucault argued. Our government watches us, and in general, we donât commit crimes because we know we could be caught. It is important that we know that we might be watched at any time, but that we can never know for sure whether we are watched now. âPower should be visible and unverifiable,â Foucault wrote, âthe inmate must never know whether he is being looked at at any one moment, but he must be sure that he may always be soâ (201). George Orwellâs novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) describes this kind of intensely surveilled state perfectly. In the decades since Foucault wrote about the panopticon, the nature of surveillance has changed greatly. We are watched to a far greater degree than when Foucault was alive, with surveillance cameras on every street corner and the NSA and many other entities able to access our emails or phone calls. Itâs not clear that todayâs surveillance functions in the regulatory way Foucault described, disciplining us to be well-behaved citizens. Surveillance has become complicated in the digital age. Even the word has been altered. Roger Clarke defined dataveillance (1988) as âthe systematic monitoring of peopleâs actions or communications through the application of information technologyâ. Steve Mann and collaborators coined other variations. Sousveillance plays upon the French word sous, meaning âunderâ, in contrast to sur which means âoverâ, and it refers to ordinary citizens watching authorities, for instance using wearable cameras. Coveillance is peers watching each other (Mann, Nolan, and Wellman 2003). In his book The Googlization of Everything, Siva Vaidhyanathan argues that we need a new term to describe todayâs surveillance, as it is fundamentally different from the panopticon Foucault described. Vaidhyanathan proposes the term cryptopticon. The most important thing about todayâs cryptopticon, Vaidhyanathan (2011) writes, is that âwe donât know all the ways in which we are being watched or profiled â we simply know that we are. And we donât regulate our behavior under the gaze of surveillance. Instead, we donât seem to careâ (112). According to Vaidhyanathan, we donât know all the ways in which we are being watched, but we know that they are extensive, and that we are watched by many different entities: governments, corporations and criminals. In the years after Vaidhyanathan coined the term cryptopticon we have debated the Snowden leaks and had ongoing discussions of how Facebook and other web services track us, and we actually know quite a lot more about how we are being watched.

185,136,0.994,The Essence of Software Engineering,"1 Apologia When the words âsoftwareâ and âengineeringâ were first put together [Naur and Randell 1968] it was not clear exactly what the marriage of the two into the newly minted term really meant. Some people understood that the term would probably come to be defined by what our community did and what the world made of it. Since those days in the late 1960âs a spectrum of research and practice has been collected under the term. Journals, magazines, conferences, and workshops have used it in growing numbers. From time to time some have questioned whether or not the second word of the term, âengineeringâ, is properly applied to what it is that âsoftware engineersâ do (e.g. [Parnas 1997]). The debate has been sporadic, but it has probably been good for the community. It seems odd, however, that there has been hardly any discussion of the first word of the term, namely âsoftwareâ. When, on infrequent occasion, the meaning of this term has been questioned, mostly in informal conversation, the question has been met with visible discomfort, and some attempt to dismiss it. The purpose of this paper is to try to address the question head-on. What is software? If our community feels comfortable in believing that it is engaged in the practice of engineering âsoftwareâ, it seems that the community should show some curiosity about what it is that is the subject of its ministrations. But, when asked to ponder what âsoftwareâ is, computer software engineers seem to assume that the only kind of software is computer software. They provide answers that roughly equate software with code to be executed on a computer. When prodded, most will readily agree that the software they produce consists of more than just the code, but also somehow incorporates specifications of various kinds, designs, and perhaps testing regimes and results as well. But when it is suggested that there might be types of software other than computer software, some computer software engineers have questioned the value of considering the possibility. Here we suggest that considering this possibility might lead to an understanding of what these various kinds of software have in common, and thus what the nature of âsoftwareâ is. Some have suggested that the quintessential nature of âsoftwareâ may be imponderable and unknowable. This may indeed be the case, but it seems worth noting that humans have in the past asked many âunanswerableâ questions, about the nature of such things as love, God, truth, and reality. While the answers often have not been very satisfying, the pondering and discussion of them has typically been interesting, revealing, and sometimes ennobling. For these reasons, and others, it does not seem inappropriate to offer this short essay, hoping that it may help to start a debate that turns out to be, at least, interesting."

Sen has never identified a comprehensive list of functionings and capabilities, either for adults or for children, that could be used as the basis for a theory of justice. On the contrary, he has brought forward some reasons why he is skeptical about such an endeavor (Sen 1993; Sen 2004b). He argues that a predefined list of what is valuable to human life ignores what people actually value and might be overly paternalistic. Furthermore, it goes against the ideal of public deliberation processes that Sen sees as the best and the legitimate way to answer value questions. Finally, he suggests that moral questions are notoriously difficult to answer and that this insight, too, speaks against the definition of a full list. Throughout his works, he frequently refers to some examples of capabilities he believes to be supported by a wide range of moral and political positions, which he terms âbasic capabilitiesâ. However, his remarks on this subject remain only exemplary, and all in all, he refrains from substantial claims when it comes to value questions on an abstract and universal level detached from concrete contexts and socioeconomic circumstances. His version of the capability approach is therefore best understood as an âanalytical deviceâ that can be used for different ends. In particular, Sen reminds us that evaluative"

As soon as you start understanding more about the business, you realize there is so much more to it than you originally thought. Whether it is that they made a big pivot one year into the business (Twitter), had to fire one of the early co-founders (Facebook), or ran out of money and had to sell cereal boxes to make ends meet (Airbnb), every business has so much more to it below the surface. So what I am saying is that it is never just the CEO or co-founders that make the business, it is the whole ecosystem around the business, from the employees to the partners, from the investors to the customers. Especially in the technology sector, the wider community is a hugely important factor to the success of the business, and it is often overlooked because it is one of the parts of the iceberg that remains under the water.

117,104,0.994,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"when one reflects on a possible action from the perspective of autonomy, one applies a test of practical reason, that is an ethical test, to this action, namely the test of universalisability. One is supposed to ask oneself whether what one plans to do could be done by everyone âwithout contradictionâ (Kant 1996, p. 75, BA 57). According to Kant, this is a test which one must necessarily accept, because as a practically deliberating person one is part of the realm of universal practical reason, and in this realm, the only ethical criterion that does not rest on contingent preferences is the test of universalisability. Moreover, this test is not imposed on reason and practical reasoners from somewhere else, but originates within reason itself. It is a law that reason and oneself as a reasoner impose upon concrete cases of reason-guided will-formation and decision-making. For example, refusing to help someone when help could be provided at no great cost to oneself cannot be universalised, according to Kant, since if this preference were a universal law, a situation could arise in which one would need help oneself and not receive it. Hence, Kant concludes that a world in which no one helps others might be thinkable without contradiction, but it cannot be desired without contradiction (Kant 1996, p. 75, BA 56). To take another example, the desire to take oneâs life when oneâs future appears to bring more harm than happiness is, following Kant, contradictory, since if everyone adopted this preference, humankind would extinguish itself and there would be no one left to formulate and pursue preferences at all. Therefore, he claims, this preference contradicts its own condition when universalised (Kant 1996, p. 73f, BA 53). Much has been said for and against these examples and for and against Kantâs approach to autonomy and ethics in general. In the context of the discussion here, namely with regard to the autonomy dilemma, Kantâs approach initially appears to be a promising way to bring ethical content to the principle of autonomy and to understand will-formation as a reason-guided process. After all, autonomy is thought to involve ethical reasoning. Will-formation and decision-making about oneâs own future and well-being can be regarded as ethical reason-guided phenomena, as especially the second example above shows.

One further notes that the theory of revealed preferences, like much of mainstream Western (so called neoclassical) economic theory and related fields (such as law and economics and Public Choice political science), is isometric with liberallibertarian assumptions. They hold liberty to be the prime value, and that the individual should be free to make choices which should be interfered with only if they seriously harm others. (Some would add, harm the common good; others deny that there is such a thing). This idea is of course at the foundation of democratic theory (according to which voters drive public policy) and consumer sovereignty (according to which customers drive the economy by voting with their dollars). The reason I say âisometricâ is because many who base their academic or policy analysis on the preference theory do not personally subscribe to the liberal-libertarian ideology or are even aware that their world draws on its assumption. Nevertheless, these strong normative assumptions are part and parcel of the preference theory, because its core assumption is that what does and should drive a good economy, polity, and society is what people prefer. All this is greatly undermined once one finds out that peopleâs preferences are largely not theirs but implanted. This is the case because if the personal preferences did not reflect the true, inner person but were introduced or implanted by some external agent into the person, then that agent would in effect control their behavior. If this were the case, there would be no reason to treat these preferences as an expression of free will, and one would have to evaluate the values of the particular pursuits that an agent made people prefer. I move next to show, for those who do not take it for granted, that much of what people prefer is implanted. True, most, if not all people, can eke out a measure of freedom and choice, but it is much less than satisfiers and followers of the preference theory assume. There is hence nothing immoral about limiting the pursuit of pleasure (e.g. speeding, driving while drunk) in order to make room for affirming action, especially in periods and societies where it is neglected. The assumption concerning autonomous preferences conflicts with the empirical findings of the study of persuasion through advertising and other forms of manipulation by marketing. This has led defenders of the theory to argue that advertising serves merely an informative function. In reality, advertising often focuses more on influencing its audience subconsciously7 than on providing information (Lee 1997). Advertisements often appeal to emotions, irrational fears, and cognitive biases as a way of âmanufacturing need, (Phillips 2011)â inducing preferences for the goods they seek to market rather than merely producing goods to satisfy existing prefer7"

For instance, when people were cooking in their homes, we would detect a peak in our data, but could not determine precisely what it was. It could have been simple water vapor, since this equipment does not distinguish materials nor does it ï¬rst dry the air before counting. There is always room, therefore, for some speculation, which makes the logging of personal activities and observations very important. When someone is doing jobs in the house, it makes a lot of difference as to when the person is demolishing a wall, dusting or washing the dishes. Simply observing data does not provide the proper insight; it always needs to be cross-referenced with additional reliable information for interpretation within the proper context. The backpack project was extensively covered by the local TV and newspaper media. One reporter had registered himself as volunteer and took part in the exercise, allowing him to report ï¬rst-hand about his experiences. You can watch the TV coverage of the project here (in Dutch): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= M7619Gzbwzw. In general, we can reconï¬rm that both the contribution to air pollution and exposure is very individual and lifestyle-dependent. Lifestyle is not just the voluntary exercise of ï¬lling the day with activities; it also has to do with the involuntary activities imposed by labor commitments and other behavioral aspects that are deï¬ned more by the reigning socio-economic culture and paradigm than self-aware, voluntary choice.

Our grammar constantly turns us into perpetrators.8 Thus we break with and ignore everything to do with passivity, with the pathic, with everything that can and does befall us without warning. The ego is seen not only as the precondition of being able to feel something but also and at the same time as the cause of and reason for those feelings. However, while the ego is the precondition for being able to feel something, feelings do not introduce themselves; rather, we are overcome by them. We are stricken by them. Disappointment hurts, fear lames us, hate distorts us, and we are thrown into chaos. Calamities befall us; happiness is not something we can calculate, not even the happiness of the high card, the greatest number. Theater is incendiary. It can inflame the enlightenment concept of the subject and the pragmatism of analytical abstract thought, which seeks to calm itself with quantifiable criteria. The stage attacks the dominance of such rational, causal thought. The ego is exposed; its sovereignty is assaulted, shaken at its core because of this vulnerable exposition. This is meant as a literal occurrence, not as a figurative image. A painful event that causes discomfort. Offends. The tower of our modern self-assurance begins to crack. Not theoretically, but dramatically, involving all senses. Physically, because on stage the actor has to deliver, with his own body, the tenacious problem of modernityâs collective interpretation of the self. He is forced into facing the experience that the ego is not the master of its own house, that whether or not he succeeds is not a matter of free will. He has no control over it, and no normative structure in the world can give it to him. No talent, no system, no method. Whether or not his acting is felicitous is out of his hands and thus uncertain. It is bestowed upon him."
192,384,0.994,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"(Stapel 2012, p. 102). An important ingredient of theatres in general (and of the social psychology theatre in particular) is deception. Research subjects (usually psychology students) must be naÃ¯ve. As soon as subjects are aware of the (objective of) the experiment, this will affect their responses and ruin the results. Ideally, research subjects believe that they know what the research is about, but this actually proves to be an illusion, a distraction; a lure. Like Claudius in Shakespeareâs Hamlet (Act III, scene 2), they are lured into a mousetrap. According to Hamlet, mousetrap is title of the play performed by the actors in Shakespeareâs drama. While research subjects erroneously believe to know in what kind of situation they are becoming involved, they are suddenly exposed to an unexpected stimulus, while their responses are being meticulously monitored (as happened to Claudius as well, cf. Chap. 3), so that these responses may be considered as an indication of a disavowed flaw (racial prejudice). The experimental set-up of Stapelâs fictitious Science experiment at Utrecht train station is a cunning exemplification of the mousetrap theme. The respondents believe that, by filling in a questionnaire, they are participating in a survey, and that the chair is merely placed there for their convenience (filling in questionnaires while standing upright seems rather impractical). Thus, they are unaware of the fact that the row of chairs is actually a mousetrap. By keeping their distance vis-Ã -vis the black male, they betray their obfuscated prejudices. So, in other words, Stapel is social psychologyâs Hamlet, who masterfully inserts a play into a play (the row of chairs representing the mousetrap scene), while Utrecht station is the theatre of life, where a plethora of prejudices are steering our daily behaviour (in subliminal, unconscious ways). In order to come to terms with them, social psychologists must design a device that captures them. The problem is, of course, that Stapelâs âplayâ has never been performed, that his experiment has never been conducted. Like Shakespeareâs Hamlet, it is fiction. Stapel is actually a playwright and his article a form of drama, parodying the vernacular of fashionable science. The respondents (playing the role of Claudius, but in a contemporary setting) were not really put to the test. But this means, dialectically speaking, that the prejudices attributed to the research subjects (in the Science article) actually reflect the prejudices of the researchers themselves. It is the prejudice if the researchers that their research subjects will prove prejudiced (by keeping their distance to the non-Caucasian male). In other words, the prejudices and stereotypes enacted in this paper are actually the (prejudiced, stereotypical) expectations of the researcher (Stapel) himself, projected onto the research subjects. He wants and expects his research subjects to be prejudiced, to be biased, even if (all too often) this proves not to be the case, for otherwise he could simply have conducted the experiment instead of fabricating it. In Lacanian terms, the hidden prejudice, which must be there, proves so difficult to capture because it is the âobject aâ of social psychology. It is that which somehow must be brought to the fore (with the help of mousetraps), an objective which is considered so important that it even legitimises the use of deception. To paraphrase Gospodin Gregg (Chap. 4), social psychology is bent on exposing the Mr. Hyde in us, the evidence of prejudice, the object a, something which somehow remains hidden (first"
232,340,0.994,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"Ricoeurâs concept of the âjust institutionâ offers another lever for the construction of systems that are better able to manage extreme situations and preserve safety. The âjust institutionâ rests on the fact that it responds to the individualâs sense of justice, and achieves an appropriate balance between the obligations that are imposed on them and the privileges that are granted [11]. Its primary aim is to ensure that individuals are free to act. The concept of the âinstitutionâ refers to a structure with shared interests, or belonging to a speciï¬c community: according to Ricoeur, âthe idea of the institution rests fundamentally on shared customs, not on binding rulesâ [11]. It argues that the individual is free to act and pursue ethical aims. It relates to the way people interact, and how they are brought together and live with one another, as these interactions (reiï¬ed in the form of shared customs) constitute the institutional environment. Finally, it rests on a principle of plurality, which in turn implies diversity and the potential for (potentially contentious) dialogue. This perspective appears to be at odds with current organizations, which rest on engineered methods and designs and therefore primarily seek uniformity and abstraction from individuality. However, it may be possible to translate it into concrete actions that organizations can implement. Such organizations would be called âsafe institutionsâ. At a general level, this means refocusing organizations on people, their sense of justice, their ability to exercise practical reason, and their goal of leading âa good life for oneself as well as othersâ, rather than the design or procedures of organizations themselves. On a more practical level, it suggests actions related to training (i.e. ensuring that people are in a position to maintain safety), and redeï¬ning how careers are built and what success means. Organizations that apply the âsafe institutionsâ philosophy and favor practical reason could be said to enable âpractical safetyâ. We deï¬ne practical safety as âthe ability of individuals to appropriate safety as an internal value, which enables them to decide on a course of action that preserves the safety of others as well as their own, when a situation requires them to do soâ. Such an approach asserts the idea that safety can only be managed by people in organizations, rather than by organizations through people. It also reminds us that safety can only be maintained through concrete actions, rather than predesigned, abstract rules and procedures. More broadly, the concept of the just (safe) institution resonates directly with a number of questions raised during the workshop. For example, the question of consent and self-sacriï¬ce: if an individualâs obligations include the potential need to sacriï¬ce oneself, how is it possible to establish a sense of justice? What should the status of voluntary actions be, from both a moral and legal standpoint, when things âgo back to normalâ? What criteria should be used to judge, both morally and legally, an action that could be nothing but ad hoc and voluntary? Once again, this raises the question of the moral and legal status attributed to an action and the actor by the collectivity once the situation goes back to normal. And, once again, Ricoeurâs philosophy provides a heuristic. He argues that action can be compared to texts, in the sense that once they are achieved, they are out in the world, available for interpretation by third parties who may not share the frame of âreferenceâ for the action, i.e. the situation from which it stems. As action is"
116,82,0.994,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Theories about human beings, then, can actually have an impact on the object of research. Empirical studies show that business school student do indeed tend to live and decide in accordance with the theory that human beings are self-interest maximizers (Ferraro et al., 2005; Gandal et al., 2005; Molinsky et al., 2012). The educational systems need to take this tendency seriously. Ghoshal argues convincingly that adding ethics courses to the curriculum is not sufficient, since faculty keeps the Homo economicus assumption alive in the standards courses in economics. His contribution sparked a debate about the effects of teaching and theory on business school students (Gapper, 2005; Hambrick, 2005; Kanter, 2005). Here we can add that students who learn that it is always rational to prioritize self-interest will be badly equipped to decide and act responsibly in conflict of interest situations. The behavioural psychologist Dan Ariely tells an interesting personal story about conflict of interest in a public talk on honesty (Ariely, 2012ii). When I first saw a photograph of Ariely, I though there had to be something wrong with it, since his face looked odd, with blank skin on the right side of his face, and ordinary skin with beard stubbles on the left side. It turns out that Ariely was badly burnt in an accident many years ago. His story about conflict of interest is about what happens when he goes to the hospital to see a physician who has treated him over a long time. On this visit, the physician introduced him to a fantastic new treatment that he thought would be ideal for Ariely. It consisted in using technology to tattoo artificial stubbles on the blank parts of his facial skin, making him look more symmetrical. The physician showed him pictures of two patients who have taken the treatment already, and demonstrated the likeness between the real stubbles and the artificial ones. After careful consideration, Ariely decided not to go for this treatment. His answer provoked a shocking response from the physician, who verbally attacked him and tried to instil guilt in his patient. âWhatâs wrong with you? Do you get some pleasure from being asymmetrical? Do you enjoy looking different?â Ariely could not understand the fierceness of this response. He asked a hospital deputy about it, who explained that the physician was working on an academic paper about the treatment, and desperately needed a third patient to take it in order to make the paper publishable in a prestigious journal. That was his motivation for putting pressure on his asymmetrical patient. Ariely sees this as an example of how an excellent physician and a wonderful human being can become a prisoner of his own conflict of DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0011"

(Male, Kurdish, 14 years old) So, as a factor, I hypothesize that overall numbers and inclusion/exclusion are complex. 4.3.2.6 Individual differences Human beings are unique in their ability to cope with elements of their environments. Different authorities and researchers have identified characteristics, such as analytic, methodical, reflective, global, relational, and intuitive, to describe individual differences in the way ESL learners make sense of and cope in the world, especially the classroom (for reviews, see Reid, 1987; Scarcella, 1990). It is unclear what individual differences account for as regards the finding that some students are able to achieve way beyond their apparent capacities in schools where the language of instruction is different from their home languages. These are the resilient students, and some believe resilience can be taught (Roesingh, 2004). Individual differences may account for studentsâ inclusion or exclusion, but it is not clear how strong this factor is or whether teachers can, in fact, reliably and validly measure features associated with variables that make up this factor. 4.3.2.7 The multicultural model The purpose of this model is to hypothesize variables that are associated with inclusion in multicultural classrooms where the cultural"
299,408,0.994,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"There is no need to rehash here the significant back and forth among various ethical schools. It suffices to suggest that, given these differences, it is very difficult to program a machine that is able to render moral decisions on its own, whether using one or a combination of these moral philosophies. But one might ask, âIf humans can do it, why not smart machines?â In response, one first notes that humans are able to cope with nuance, deal with fuzzy decisions while computer programmers find such decisions particularly taxing. Moreover, while one can argue that individuals make moral choices on the basis of this or that philosophy, actually humans first acquire moral values from those who raise them, and then modify these values as they are exposed to various inputs from new groups, cultures, and subcultures, gradually developing their own personal moral mix. Moreover, these values are influenced by particular societal principles that are not confined to any one moral philosophy. In short, the top-down approach is highly implausible. In the second approach to machine ethics, the bottom-up approach, machines are expected to learn how to render ethical decisions through observation of human behavior in actual situations, without being taught any formal rules or being equipped with any particular moral philosophy. This approach has been applied to non-ethical aspects of driverless carsâ learning. For example, an early autonomous vehicle created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University was able to navigate on the highway after 2â3 min of training from a human driver; its capacity for generalization allowed it to drive on four-lane roads, even though it was only trained on one- or two-lane roads (Batavia et al. 1996). Machine learning has also been used by several researchers to improve a carâs pedestrian detection ability (See Hsu 2016; Harris 2015). And a team from NVIDIA Corporation recently demonstrated a driverless car that used âend-to-endâ machine learning, which was able to drive on its own after observing only 72 h of human driving data (Bojarski et al. 2016). However, to view these as precedents for learning ethical conduct is to presume that there is no significant difference between learning to respond differently to green, red, and yellow traffic lights and learning to understand and appreciate the imperative to take special care not to hit a bicyclist traveling in the same lane as the car, let alone not to harass or deliberately hit the cyclist out of road rage (McDermott 2011). But this parallel between cognitive and ethical decision-making is far from self-evident. Some AI mavens believe that cars could learn ethics like children do, gradually improving their ability to engage in moral reasoning, along the Kohlberg stages. We shall see that cars may be able to follow specific moral positions, but not necessarily to engage in moral reasoning. Moreover, the kinds of moral questions the cars are asked to addressâwho to kill or injure in a situation where a crash is inevitableâare actually very rare; according to data from the US Department of Transportation, there were only 77 injuries and 1.09 fatalities per 100 million miles driven in 2013 (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2013). And each such challenging situation is different from the next: sometimes it is a kitten that causes the accident, sometimes a school bus, and so on. A driverless car would have to follow a person for several lifetimes to learn ethics in this way. It has hence been suggested that driverless cars could learn from the ethical decisions of millions of human drivers, through some"

The great philosophers â¦ noticed how badly things were going wrong, and made suggestions about how they could be dealt with.â (Midgley 2001). The bad smells, as I perceive them, concern the proliferation of truisms (including about progress, change and innovation), wrong alternatives (âeither/orâ framing when the âboth/andâ would be much more efficient), and fears and delusion when it comes to thinking and speaking about politics and the public space. It would be wrong to say that we are in totalitarian times: fascism and communism have been defeated and democracy is alive, at least in the EU and other parts of the world. However, I feel that we are unconsciously undermining essential elements of the human condition, as set out by Hannah Arendt in her seminal book The human condition (Arendt 1959): the antidotes against the risk of totalitarianism are thereby weakened to a dangerous extent so that it would not take much more than a spark for the public space to collapse, and this even under the cover of the best governance intentions. The digital transition is an opportunity to âfix the pipesâ, as put by Mary Midgley: it brings about a reality by which some key assumptions underlying our worldview, since Plato, lose ground insofar as they simply stop being efficient. The digital transition projects us into a world where nature is pervasively intertwined with sensors, information devices and machines; we thus increasingly experience a reactive and talkative nature, an animated nature, where it becomes more and more difficult"

Now we understand what all the cards mean, we also need to understand at a high level how the whole practice works. The cards themselves give us all the clues we need as to how the elements fit together to provide an end-to-end story â which activities progress and produce which elements, but it is also here useful to tell the joined-up story in terms of end-to-end flow through the different activities. â¢ First we need to Find User Stories. This brings one or more User Stories into existence in the initial Identified state, each documented by a Story Card with just enough information to ensure that the User Story has its Value Expressed. â¢ On a Story-by-Story basis, we will select a User Story that we wish to get done next, and use the Prepare a User Story activity to progress the User Story to be Ready for Development, which involves ensuring that we have the Acceptance Criteria Listed on the Story Card, and during which we may also get any supporting Conversation Captured. As part of this same activity we also fully elaborate the associated Test Cases. â¢ The final activity that this practice describes is how we work to Accept a User Story, the successful completion of which moves the User Story to the Done state. Notice that this âchainingâ of Activities primarily via the state of the things that they progress does not over-constrain the overall flow. It does not, for example, imply a single-pass, strictly sequential flow. We might, for example, iterate around the different activities for different User Stories in different ways. Exactly how may be further constrained as part of adopting other practices. For example, if we use the User Story practice in conjunction with Scrum, as is very common, we may agree the following general rules as a team: â¢ Do the Find User Stories before we start our First Sprint, but also allow this to happen on an ad hoc basis ongoing."

Further studies of the actual justifications offered by NG employees is needed to document the extent to which moral neutralization has occurred in the processes leading up to habitual acceptance of unsustainable dumping of hazardous waste. Studies in a range of disciplines show that our cognitive capacities are flexible, and that we can gradually come to accept and adopt behavior that initially appeared to be morally questionable. Organizational life can place us at the top of slippery slopes, where the first small steps into dishonesty and cheating can lead to major moral deviances later. One final example is from athletics. Tyler Hamilton was one of the cyclists in Lance Armstrongâs team, and for a long period, he was in the midst of the lies and deceptions designed to make systematic doping to take place without detection. When asked about the cheating aspect of the teamâs activities, he responds: Iâve always said that you could have hooked us up to the best lie detectors on the planet and asked us if we were cheating, and weâd have passed.

At the core of our vision was the desire to bring good products out into the world, create even better cars, and bring smiles to the faces of our customers. Based on this, we boosted our management foundations and create new products. Itâs an old turn of phrase, but one of the Five Main Principles of Toyoda called for contributing to the common good. It means being of use to the world through the medium of the automobile industry. This way of thinking is deeply imbued in our workforce. We donât think we are making cars for profits, but rather we want to be of use to the common good by making cars. Around the time we joined the company, the important thing was developing and deliver cars that were highly reliable and offered good cost performance so that everyone could drive a car, and through that make life more convenient. After that, we worked on building the Prius and making fuel-cell powered vehicles in our effort to be of use to everyone through cars that offer excellent environmental performance. At that point, when we thought about what idea should be our next focal point, the one that we of course felt really struck home was the impact of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report on the need to reduce to zero or even shift into the negative range greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the twenty-first century.

124,568,0.994,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"A maximal chain h of moments of time is called a history. It represents a possible course of history of our world. Some histories have a first and a last moment. According to these histories the world has a beginning and an end. As Belnap et al. (2001) pointed out, each possible circumstance is a pair of a moment m and of a history h to which that moment belongs. Thanks to histories temporal logic can analyze important modal notions like settled truth and historic necessity. Certain propositions are true at a moment according to all histories. Their truth is then settled at that moment no matter how the world continues. So are past propositions and propositions attributing propositional attitudes to agents. Whoever desires something at a moment desires that thing at that moment no matter what happens later. Contrary to the past, the future is open. The world can continue in various ways after indeterminist moments. Thus the truth of future propositions is not settled at such moments. It depends on which historical continuation of that moment is under consideration. When there are different possible historic continuations of a moment, its actual future continuation is not then determined. However, as Occam7 pointed out, if the world continues after a moment, it will continue in a unique way. The actual historic continuation of each non final moment will be unique even if it is still undetermined at that very moment. Indeterminism cannot prevent that uniqueness. Human agents who persist in an indeterminist world, have expectations and make plans. According to phenomenology and philosophy of mind, human agents who are directed by virtue of their intentionality towards things and facts of the world, are intrinsically oriented at each moment of their active life towards the real continuation of the world. We all ignore how the world will continue but we are intrinsically oriented at each moment towards the real continuation of that moment. So we always distinguish conceptually that real continuation from other possible continuations whenever we act or think in the world. Whoever attempts at a moment to achieve a future objective, intends to achieve that objective in the real continuation of that moment. Whoever foresees or wishes to have a future grandchild, foresees or wishes that grandchild in the real future. So in my approach both the moment and the historic continuation of the moment are to be considered in order to evaluate our actions and attitudes oriented towards the future. Consequently8 our elementary illocutions and propositional attitudes at each moment have or will have a certain satisfaction value even if that satisfaction value is still then undetermined when they have a future propositional content. In order to keep a present promise and execute a present intention to give things later, an agent must give later these things in the real continuation of the world. Other possible historic continuations do not matter.9 According to my temporal logic every moment m has then a proper history hm in each model. Whenever a moment m is the final moment of a history h, that history h is its proper history hm . All moments that belong to the proper history of an indeterminist moment have of course the same proper history in each 7 See Prior (1967). 8 See my paper âTowards a Formal Pragmatics of Discourseâ (Vanderveken 2013). 9 Belnap N., M.

Programming has elements of both science and art, but itâs really something else. âRather,â wrote physicist Richard Feynman, âcomputer science is like engineeringâit is all about getting something to do something.â Quite often, this is an uphill battle.

Some of our biggest challenges are: â Stability - This is our number one priority. Our tests arenât as stable as we wished they were, and we have some flakiness at times. Our approach to improve this issue has been to tackle the most unstable tests first, disabling and fixing them. We are making some progress but we still have some tests (the ones in worst shape) that show a failure rate of around 13 % which is not that good. â Speed - The entire pipeline, from the first to the last step takes about 19 min. We are always concerned about this, because we donât want our pipeline to become a delivery bottleneck for our User stories, and as we grow our codebase, the number of regression tests keeps increasing. Our latest improvements were to use as much parallelization as possible: our functional test suites (steps 3 to 5) run simultaneously as well as the suites themselves also parallelize their tests, using a selenium grid.

299,415,0.994,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"In many discussions of the ethical challenges posed by driverless cars, and smart machines generally, they are referred to as âautonomous.â To begin with, one must recall that not every scholar is willing to take it for granted that even human beings act autonomously. Some hold that everything that happens is caused by sufficient antecedent conditions which make it impossible for said thing to happen differently (or to not happen); such causal determinism renders it impossible to assign moral responsibility (see for example van Inwagen 2003; Harris 2011). There is no need here to repeat the arguments against this position, and it suffices to note that we file with those who take it for granted that human beings have some measure of free will, though much of their lives may indeed be determined by forces beyond their understanding and control (Frankfurt 1969). However, it does not follow that the same holds for machines, however smart they are. Indeed, a colleague who read a previous draft of this chapter argued that it only seems like smart machines make decisions on their ownâin actuality, changes in how these machines conduct themselves merely reflect external forces. One could say, he pointed out, that a missile diverted from its original course by a strong gush of wind âdecidedâ to change direction, but this would be merely a misperception, an illusion. As we see it, autonomy is a variable that exists along a continuum. Some tools have no autonomy; one can fully account for their behavior by forces external to them. A hammer hitting a nail has no autonomy even when it misses because one can show that the miss was due to the inexperience of the person using it, poor eyesight, or some other such external factor. A rudimentary GPS system may be said to have a very small measure of autonomy, because when asked the best way to get from point a to point b, it compares several options and recommends one, but its"

The problem was as follows. It would seem that one can make assertions about what one knows to be an open future, and in particular about aspects of that open future that are not yet settled by what has transpired thus far. One can assert that the coin will land heads, knowing full well that, as we may now suppose, the coin-tossing process is a fundamentally indeterministic one. But in the absence of a TRL, it is difficult to see how we can provide truth values to such assertoric contents as âThe coin will land headsâ when one history branching out of the moment of utterance contains a moment on which the coin lands head, and another history branching out of the moment of utterance contains a moment on which the coin lands tails. Were we to posit a TRL, then we could think of it as privileging one of these histories as the one that will happen, and thereby give us a state of affairs that settles the truth of the future-directed assertion. Barring that, it is not clear how we might characterize the context of utterance, or the circumstances of evaluation in such a way as to tell us whether the assertion is true. The context of utterance might provide values for indexical expressions, but it is less clear how the context of utterance selects one history from among all those that might be how things go. The intuitive datum seems, then, to be twofold: one can (i) reasonably, and, (ii) felicitously, make an assertion about an aspect of the future that is ontically open and thus not settled by what has gone thus far."

However, it is one thing for you to willingly make that decision of sacriï¬ce yourself, and quite another matter for a machine to make that decision without your consent or foreknowledge that self-sacriï¬ce was even a possibility. That is, there is an astonishing lack of transparency and therefore consent in such a grave decision, one of the most important that can be made about oneâs lifeâperhaps noble if voluntary, but criminal if not. Thus, reasonable ethical principlesâe.g., aiming to save the greatest number of livesâ can be stressed in the context of autonomous driving. An operator of an autonomous vehicle, rightly or not, may very well value his own life over that of everyone elseâs, even that of 29 others; or he may even explicitly reject consequentialism. Even if consequentialism is the best ethical theory and the carâs moral calculations are correct, the problem may not be with the ethics but with a lack of discussion about ethics. Industry, therefore, may do well to have such a discussion and set expectations with the public.

The menâs road to gender equality could initially be said to have been less personal, for instance, more connected to gender equality politics at their jobs. However, their increased presence in childcare and their experience of strong attachments to their children gradually also gave them a personal engagement. This seems to be the most important emotional link to gender equality for men in this generation, but it came later than that for the women. There is a time lag, but also partly a different agenda: for the men, gender equality is a care project, while for the women, it is a project of sharing more equally both care and domestic work. For the radical women, it also entails being involved against the sexualisation and objectification of the female body. For the men, the experience of being more actively participating fathers raises the question of gender equality from the menâs perspective, especially in connection with divorce and child custody. In the account of Egil, we can see how the intensity increases as he moves from talking about womenâs rights at work to menâs rights after divorce: Girls can do a lot of jobs just as well as boys, and I guess I think there should be gender equality in that regard and that there should be equal pay for equal work. I think that. But I donât think one should strive towards becoming the same. I think there should be differences between boys and girls. And if weâre talking about these things, what annoys me the most about the things to do with gender equality: those girls whoâve worked hard to show the places theyâve been treated unfairly, but theyâve probably been aware of places where men have been treated unfairly too. But I donât think many women have fought for that, in the situation of separation and divorce. Itâs clear who the loser is there. I donât think many of those working with gender equality have cared about that.

We should tread lightly, and not overburden first-time researchers with unnecessary expectations of getting traumatized. Most of us are not traumatized by the authoritarian field most of the time. Nonetheless, individually as well as collectively as an academic community, we should recognize that our fieldwork experiences can sometimes have a severe, perhaps even traumatic, emotional impact on us (see Loyle and Simoni 2017 for a more extensive plea for engagement with the possibility of trauma). This has not traditionally been a subject of academic attention, and the difficulty can be compounded by our sense that, compared to the suffering of some of our respondents, our own vicarious feelings are not worth mentioning.

The end result is â based on Georgian example and examples of many countries that have been studied â that none of the existing economic theories are applicable and that a practical approach is needed to every concrete reform in every single country. Copying and pasting does not work â but learning from othersâ experience and innovating to adopt to local realities is the formula for success. Practical Economics was the basis for the Georgian success story â looking at every problem, every reform from many different angles (private sectorâs, citizensâ, international investorsâ, budgetary as well as regulatory angles), analyzing it based on international experience and adopting for local realities, thinking outside of box, innovating, and solving each problem in that particular context. These are the main characteristics of Practical Economics.

82,19,0.994,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"cannot be said to know the proposition q, or the chain must come to a stop, but then it seems we are not justified in claiming that we really can know q, since there is no reason for stopping. Laurence Bonjour called considerations relating to the regress problem âperhaps the most crucial in the entire theory of knowledgeâ, and Robert Audi observes that no epistemologist quite knows how to handle the problem.1 The roots of the regress problem extend far back into epistemological history, and scholars often refer to the Greek philosopher Agrippa. Little is known about Agrippa, apart from the fact that he probably lived in the first century A.D. and might have been among the group of sceptics discussed by Sextus Empiricus, a philosopher and practising physician who allegedly flourished a century later. Sextusâ most famous work, Outlines of Pyrrhonism, contains an explanation and defence of what he takes to be the philosophy of another shadowy figure, namely Pyrrho of Elis (c. 365â270 B.C.), who himself wrote nothing, but became known for his sober life style and his aversion to academic or theoretical reasoning. So-called Pyrrhonian scepticism advocates the attainment of ataraxia, a state of serene calmness in which one is free from moods or other disturbances. An important technique for reaching this state is the practicing of argument strategies known as tropoi or modes, i.e. means to engender suspension of judgement by undermining any claim that conclusive knowledge or justification has been attained. For example, if it were claimed that a particular sound is known to be soft, a Pyrrhonian would point out that to a dog it is loud, and that we cannot judge the loudness or softness independently of the hearer. Typically, a Pyrrhonian will try to thoroughly acquaint himself with the modes, so that reacting in accordance with them becomes as it were a second nature. In this manner he will be able to routinely refrain from assenting to any weighty proposition q or Â¬q, and thus avoid getting caught up in one of those rigid intellectual positions that he loathes so much. In Book 1 of Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Sextus discusses five modes which he attributes to âthe more recent Scepticsâ (to be distinguished from what he calls âthe older Scepticsâ), and which Diogenes Laertius in the third century would identify with âAgrippa and his schoolâ.2 Of these five modes the 1 Bonjour 1985, p.18; Audi 1998, 183â184.

Was it sufficient? Or are there any other roles which we should perform for society? These are questions which we have to think about and find some answers. Iâm still convinced that the conventional role of nuclear professionals, providing information, is essential, since people need reliable, technical information to make decisions on nuclear policy and energy policy. But I also consider we have to be much more sensitive in our attitude towards the general public. Most technical information, such as simulations, calculations, or forecasts, contains some sort of uncertainties and assumptions which do not appear clearly when the outcomes are shown as numbers. Though some people are not accustomed to dealing with uncertainties or assumptions, we have to explain technical information, including uncertainties and assumptions, in a sincere and honest manner. Otherwise, information wonât be truly meaningful and we wonât be trusted in a real sense. In addition to the above conventional role, Iâm wondering if there are other roles which we should play. Since the culture of engineering is utilitarianism, our strongest assets and tools are based on a utilitarian way of thinking. But utilitarianism is not the only philosophy of modern society, especially in current Japan, and there are other major social values. Though Iâm not sure whether it is possible to justify use of nuclear energy without utilitarianism, it might be our role to facilitate discussions among people with different sets of values and to help them to bridge the gaps. At least, we have to understand various social values and gaps among them. The above are my thoughts on our role in society after Fukushima and I havenât yet reached any concrete conclusion. But at least, I have no doubt that we have to play a certain role in society and I consider we have to keep thinking about what our role is, not only with engineering methods but also with social scientific literacy."

116,86,0.994,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"by promoting ideals of authentic leadership (Gardner et al. 2011). One basic assumption in this research field is that great leadership requires great character (Kiel, 2015). On this view, the leaders need consistently to embody virtuous character traits in their everyday dealings with employees and other stakeholders. By doing so they can serve as good role models in their organizations and contribute to making responsible conduct the normal way to behave in the workplace. Kiel (2015) also suggests that leaders of morally strong character generate more income to their companies. However, the causal relation may also go the other way. The study in question documents that companies with leaders who are perceived to be morally strong outperform those with leaders who are perceived to be morally weak, but it may be easier to embody virtuous character traits when you are in charge of a successful company rather than a struggling one where you can have economic incentives to cut corners. The concept of authenticity has ancient roots, and is integral to the Socratic notion of knowing yourself. An authentic person is someone with a high degree of self-awareness, who acts in accordance with his true self by expressing what he genuinely thinks and believes. Aristotle defined self-realization and well-being â eudaimonia â as a state of happiness where the person acts and lives in accordance with who he really is. Crucially constitutive of eudaimonia is the exercise of virtues. Only people who possess virtues like courage, honesty, and loyalty will truly flourish and be happy in the eudaimonian sense. To be a virtuous person is to have a certain kind of mindset, a deeply entrenched set of dispositions to act in a particular manner. A truly honest person does not tell the truth out of blind habit, because it is the best way to make a good impression on others, or out of fear of the consequences of being caught in a lie. Rather, the honest person thinks that âit is the truthâ is a particularly strong â if not always overriding â reason for speaking the truth. Similarly, a virtuous doctor considers âthis is the right treatment for my patientâ to be a particularly strong reason for providing that particular treatment to the patient, overriding self-interest and other considerations. Virtue can come in degrees. Aristotle distinguished between full virtue, where an honest person tells the truth without experiencing any trace of a contrary temptation to lie, and less than full virtue where the person telling the truth has to overcome a desire to do otherwise. The latter is also an honest person, as long as his reasons for telling the truth are not opportunistic, but based on a conviction that telling the truth is DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0012"
117,299,0.994,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"used witnessing characteristics as being more passive and receptive than active, being knowledgeable, being trustable and being a witness because of having been assigned to be a witness to describe midwifery care. Witnessing is not the only mode of action and interaction concerning midwives and women, of course. It has its limits: Witnessing ends if hands-on action leaves no room for passivity, for passive activeness as I called it. Witnessing cannot happen if women do not assume their body: their body-in-labour, their dysappearing body, and want to escape and leave it to the midwife. Witnessing always involves a distance. Even if one and the same person is witnessing herself, which results from and leads to alienating experiences, there is distance involved. Women handle the shaming potential of being witnessed bodily exposedâI called it eye-witnessingâby trusting the midwife not only in advance but also in reaction. Witnessing seems to be easier when there are fewer temporal and structural restraints. In clinical settings, witnessing is a lot more difficult and eye-witnessing is more likely. How to witness if it is impossible to stay nearby the woman because several women at once have to be attended to? How to witness if guidelines and standards impose certain medical interventions? Apparently, midwivesâ scope of action and womenâs scope of action are entangled with each other. It would be helpful to create environments in which midwives-women relationships happen which give opportunity to midwives to have time and space to attend one woman continually, even at the hospital, and which give opportunity to women to be involved in decision-making and action-taking and to be carefully protected against exposure (see also Hodnett et al. 2013; Sandall et al. 2013).

A traditional approach to ethics in organizations is that people of weak moral character are the primary cause of misbehaviour in the workplace. In the category of moral culprits at work, we find the financial advisor who sells products to a client who would have been better off reducing her debt, the dentists who deliberately either over- or undertreat their patients, and the physician who tries to coerce a patient to tattoo stubble on his cheeks. One view, then, is that these people are morally deviant and weak, lacking the personal moral fibre to withstand temptations. In the next chapter we shall see that this character approach comes under pressure from experimental studies in social and moral psychology, which indicate that circumstances have at least as much predictive power as character. The people who are guilty of wrongdoing at work can be ordinary leaders and employees, with ordinary moral standards and convictions. Experiments in this research stream gives us reasons to doubt that weak moral character is the most plausible explanation to moral misbehaviour in organizations. Rather, moral wrongdoing at work is something anyone can become involved in, if they are unfortunate with the circumstances they encounter, and the support, encouragement and critical feedback they get from colleagues in their working environment."

They set themselves apart from many other colectivos in the community by their explicit non-militant style. Also, they were hesitant to tie themselves too closely to the new arenas for popular participation endorsed by the government. Rather, they considered popular struggle as essentially a process of bottom-up emancipation from both cultural and political modes of dominance and power. Consequently, Oscar and his comrades were deeply worried about many of the âvicesâ that continued to thrive within the Bolivarian movement, and the obstacles this posed for continuing political struggle beyond having a sympathetic government in power. He saw ideologies of consumptions as one of the most worrying signs of the limitations to the Bolivarian revolution as a process of deep socio-cultural change: What can we do if there is this constant; the television, the internet, the mobile telephone in fashion.

How exactly we need to respond will be different for each person and each situation. For some, professional counseling is in order, for others, spiritual (self-)help is the best answer. At a minimum, we should talk to friends and colleagues about what has happened and its impact on us. Others too have found that âmaintaining meaningful contact with others (friends, family, professional networks) is one of the best ways to mitigate the potential impacts of traumaâ (Loyle and Simoni 2017, referencing Dickson-Swift et al. 2008). We would argue that this is all the more important in authoritarian contexts, which are already liable to propel us in the direction of paranoia and mental isolation. This is borne out, for instance, by the experience of Begley, who investigated what was behind the apparent popular support for the RPF in Rwanda, and not only encountered constant surveillance but also had to worry, more than we have had to do, about the risk her interviews posed to respondents. She writes how â(t)hese fears added to the increasing feelings of frustration, constant mistrust, feelings of always being watched, and having no one who understood the situation to offer advice or support, essentially imprisoned me, leaving no secure way to communicate anything to anyoneâ (Begley 2013, 82; see also Malekzadeh 2016, 868). It appears to have been this sense of isolation as much as the fear itself that caused her to suffer from post-traumatic stress after fieldwork. Apart from recognizing stress symptoms, and finding our own personal ways of addressing them, we should also consider how stressful incidents, hard stories or traumatic events affect our written work. We should reflect on the possible validity gain, but also the risk of bias or self-censorship, once we ourselves or people we know personally have suffered from forms of repression. The quality of our conversations with colleagues who rely on desk-based work stands to gain from such self-reflection. And we should reconsider, after stressful incidents, hard stories or traumatic events on what fields we are prepared to revisit; what topics we are, and are not, willing to explore; and what methods we want to employ, in future research. Then there is physical impact. While our team had extensively prepared for the specificities of authoritarian fieldwork, and given some attention to potential mental impact, we had neglected to consider the combined physical impact of pollution, temperature changes, change of diet, and hard work.

Let BasicGoal am be the set of all propositions of Goal am that represent the very basic attempts of the agent a at a moment m. Two non empty sets BasicGoal am and BasicGoalsbm are disjoint when their agents a and b are different. All our attempts at a moment are related by the relation of being means to achieve our goals at that very moment. Our few basic attempts at each moment are therefore primary in a double sense. First, they are not effects of other attempts. Second, they all together cause all our other attempts because they are made for that purpose. As philosophers pointed out, human agents act intentionally and especially they form their attitudes and they make their attempts for certain practical reasons, because they have then certain beliefs, desires, intentions and objectives and also because of simultaneous and sometimes anterior actions, illocutions and attitudes. They have cognitive attitudes and believe propositions for theoretical reasons. Their actions and attitudes are often motivated by several reasons. They keep a previous promise not only because they have put themselves under the obligation to keep it but also in order to please the hearer and get a favour. They suppose or believe that a proposition is true because of their previous experience and of background or social knowledge. However they would not make their attempts and they would not have their cognitive attitudes if they had no practical and no theoretical reasons at all. Indeed their practical and theoretical reasons are the very intentional causes of their attempts and cognitive attitudes. For each agent a and moment m let Reasonsam be the set of propositions representing all theoretical and practical reasons of that agent at that moment according to a model. Each agent has of course the same practical reasons to make his or her attempts at each moment compatible with his or her actions. Among the practical causes of any attempt there is the agentâs conscious intention to make that attempt. There are also his or her basic attempts that cause at that moment all his or her other attempts. BasicGoal am â Reasonsam . As I said earlier, agents succeed in performing attempted actions, when they make good attempts in right circumstances. It remains to explicate fully the notion of success. As Davidson and Searle pointed out, in order that an agent succeeds in bringing about a fact, it is not enough that he or she tries and that the fact occurs. The attempted fact must be caused by his or her own attempt. Otherwise, the agent failed. Sometimes the agentâs attempt is the cause why the attempted fact occurs. Often however there is causal overdetermination. This happens when several agents bring about the attempted fact, or when the agent brings about the fact because of several simultaneous attempts. In such cases the agentâs attempt under consideration is just a practical reason among others why the attempted fact occurred. One cannot then assert counterfactually that if the agent had not made that particular attempt, the fact would not have occurred. Like illocutionary logic, the logic of action must consider agentsâ practical reasons in order to explicate intentional causation and satisfaction-conditions of attempts. Attempts like commissive and directive illocutions have the things-to-mind direction of fit. In order that an agent succeeds in achieving an objective, his or her attempt must be a practical reason of his or her success. However the logic of action has to consider other causes than agentsâ practical reasons in order to explicate success. As Goldman pointed out, certain attempt tokens"

One way to do this is by using the following branching time structure, which has been enriched with arrows indicating not only a single designated future, but actually a designated future at every branching point in the system (Fig. 2): The example shows that if the model is taken seriously, then there must be a function TRL, which gives the true future for any moment of time, m. More precisely, TRL(m) yields the linear past as well as the true future of m, extended to a maximal set. In this way, TRL(m) will for any moment of time, m, be a chronicle within the branching time system. It is very likely that William of Ockham would have accepted the points made by Belnap and Green regarding embedded tenses. When analysing the features of the Ockhamistic model, it becomes evident that within the model there must be a true future, not only in every actual situation or instant, but also in every possible situation. This was at least realised by Luis de Molina, who worked some centuries after Ockham, but still very much in the same scholastic tradition. Molinaâs special contribution is the idea of (Godâs) middle knowledge, âby which, in virtue of the most profound and inscrutable comprehension of each free will, He saw in His own essence what each such will would do with its innate freedom were it to be placed in this or that or indeed in infinitely many orders of things â even though it would really be able, if it so willed, to do the oppositeâ (quoted from Craig 1988, p. 175). Craig goes on to explain it as follows: ââ¦ whereas by His natural knowledge God knows that, say, Peter when placed in a certain set of circumstances could either betray Christ or not betray Christ, being free to do either under identical circumstances, by His middle knowledge God knows what Peter would do if placed under those circumstancesâ (Craig 1988, p. 175). Craig has argued that such counterfactuals of freedom can be true even if there is nothing to make it true and no grounding of such truth. On the contrary, the truth of counterfactuals of freedom might be taken as"

The results are however is in line with the ï¬ndings in [22], which underlines this paradox when hiring in the software industry. To answer our ï¬rst research question: What is the trend for soft skills requirements for testers? we compared the result of our analysis with a similar study from 2012 [19]. In the set of ï¬ndings [19], by analysing the trends in requirements for soft skills, we observe that there is a stronger need for team-playing skills, fast-learning skills, independent-work skills and openness and adaptability skills. Agile software development puts an emphasis on teamwork having a central role in software development, therefore, being a team-player is essential. There is little literature on fast-learning skills. However, we can assume that, given the rapidly changing tasks and requirements, testers have to learn fast concepts, tools or even whole new domains, such as accounting or statistics to perform their work. We know that independent-working skills are directly related to how much activity is required of the learner. If one can work independently, then the burden of supervision, control, and feedback for the individual learner or the team is decreased [23]. Therefore, independent-learning is a desirable skill, in order to decrease the burden on the team. Both openness and adaptability are traits that need to be fostered within development teams, and the explanation is it makes it easier for team members to admit their own mistakes, to negotiate, listen and facilitate [6]. Therefore, it is explainable that the request for these skills has increased, as a consequence of the desire of software companies to go overpass mistakes sooner and with fewer consequences. It is unclear why the demand for communication skills has such a signiï¬cant fall. Even the agile manifesto makes communication a central part of software development. Therefore, an explanation for a down-trend in the demand for communication is that has become such a common trait that the job advertisers do not speciï¬cally mention it. Concerning new categories of skills required of testers, the most important is work ethics. Job advertisers speciï¬cally ask for integrity and trustworthiness, in both relations with customers and team members. They ask for a work done with professionalism ï¬rst and foremost. Customer focus is a close second. There are speciï¬c requirements for testers to test through the customersâ perspective and to keep into account customersâ needs. An interpretation of the agile manifesto [24] sets the customer as an integral part of the development team; therefore more customer-focus is not surprising. Testers are speciï¬cally asked to be proactive, in the sense of picking-up and fulï¬lling job tasks, rather than wait and be told what to do. It can be a sign that there is a tendency in the software development to move away from micro-management to autonomous teams [25]. Job advertisers seem to exhibit a trend now in asking for responsibility-related skills; they emphasize the candidate to be able to deliver deï¬nitive work and well-grounded work results. We can translate this requirement by that work half-done is not accepted. One has to ï¬nish their job, and one has to prove that their work results are correct. Other notable new demands are the ability to work under pressure, the ability of critical-thinking, be motivated, committed, detail-oriented and quality-oriented. We consider it to be a positive signal the small number of requests for multitasking (4%), as this practice, especially inter-projects, is often associated with a loss of effectiveness [26]."
223,421,0.994,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"question. As a first step it is important to have an idea of what the social context looks like in this case. Decision-making in a forager group such as the San of Namibia does not follow quasi-legal or rigid procedures. Instead, participants and observers alike can derive decisions only from the continuous discourse that allows them to make decisions based on plausibility. Their conversational and interactional style is a particular one of repetitions, overlaps, and echoing in everyday talk. Consensus is achieved as the interlocutors repeat and echo some opinions or arguments and leave out others. This kind of exchange enables people to make intelligent guesses about what they and others will be doing next. The strategy requires that everyone be allowed to join in the conversation while avoiding prominence (and exposure) as an individual voice of authority. Similar strategies for achieving consensus have been observed elsewhere, as in Aboriginal Australia (Liberman, 1985, p. 104). Taken together, they differ not only from the dominant western-style conversation and interaction but also from the aggressive and self-assertive style found in many societies, including âBig Man societiesâ in Melanesia or segmentary systems in sub-Saharan Africa. The following excerpt is one of the best known examples from the !Kung San, who are neighbors of the Hai//om San with whom I have worked and who have a similar interactional practice of overlapping and echoing talk: ââYesterday,â âeh,â âat Deboragu,â âeh,â âI saw old/Gaishay.â âYou saw old/Gaishay.â âeh, eh.â âHe said that he had seen the great python under the bank.â âEH!â âThe python!â âHe wants us,â âeh, eh, eh,â âto help him catch itââ (Marshall, 1976, p. 290). Among the San, people often talk in parallel, and there is no formal conclusion to this talk. Instead, it is made up largely of âtopographical gossipâ which invokes places and movements but without any formal decisions (Widlok, 1997, p. 321). Apart from this feature of particular conversational forms, the reasoning involved allows for unpredictable events in that nonhuman and apparently nonanimate features of the environment are expected to come in as well, influencing the direction that a decision may take. When people in this community refrain from long-term planning, it is not that they are incapable of doing so but rather that they allow the state of the environment or of other persons to prompt or trigger their decisions at certain stages of the process. Detailed studies on the process of tracking animals have shown that anticipating and predicting the movement of an animal that one is pursuing involves a continuous creation of new hypotheses in the light of new information added to the incomplete picture of tracks and other signs on the ground. This activity also involves a constant dialogue between trackers who are allowed to maintain their diverging views as events unfold (Liebenberg, 1990, p. 108). Making decisions about moving (or indeed any other decision) entails a similar process of encouraging heterodoxy in views, keeping the decision open until very late in the process and ultimately always allowing individuals to maintain their own diverging view. In residential mobility this tolerance of diverging views is facilitated by the fact that packing up oneâs belongings is easy; it allows for fast and flexible reactions either to join a party that leaves or simply stay put. Having briefly described the mode of reasoning ethnographically, one may now ask whether there is a more general model that can help reintegrate these observations"

Building on what was discussed above, the answer to the question âwhat do scientists want?â may seem obvious. They want to secure their claim to priority, and therefore they want to publish (and be the first to do so). But why, then, has scientific publishing evolved into such a complicated card game, involving multiple variations on the prisonerâs dilemma? To successfully address this question, we must take a psychoanalytic stance, because than we will realise that some less obvious meanings, some less praiseworthy associations are obfuscated by the standardised use of this term âto publishâ in university discourse. For instance the connotation that to âmake publishâ etymologically means to confiscate (by the public authorities). In other words, as soon as you publish, your intellectual property is turned into common property, and scientists may therefore be reluctant to give themselves away. As long as some material is unpublished (safely stored in a computer, or kept in a pli cachetÃ©) it is still yours. Another intriguing association, psychoanalytically speaking, is connected with this one, namely the pejorative sense of the Latin term publicare. A publica or publicus is actually a prostitute, someone who is at everyoneâs disposal. So, yes, there certainly are reasons for ambivalence or even reluctance when it comes to publishing your results or your ideas in academic journals. By making"

Although this process leads to more failures than successes, it tent to reveal customersâ current needs (bootcamp bootleg 2015).

Indeed, care workers tried to negotiate with residents if they did not want to do a task the care givers asserted needed to be done. Care workers also often proved flexible in showering residents at another point in time and giving in to residents who, for instance, insisted on wearing certain clothes. I propose to call the practices in which residents and care workers seek to (creatively) align what they both want âsociomaterial will-workâ.13,14 I am indebted to three bodies of work for the concept. First, my choice of the word âsociomaterialâ builds on the material semiotic tradition. Herein, social and material âaspectsâ, previously separated in social sciences, âget mixed up in ethnographic descriptions of the practices in which they are being handledâ (Harbers et al. 2002, p. 208). Second, my choice for the word âworkâ relies on theories of (interpersonal) body work (Gimlin 2007; Twigg et al. 2011; Twigg 2000; Wolkowitz 2002), emotional labour (Hochschild 1979, 1983) and sentimental work (Strauss et al. 1982). This literature emphasises the dual nature of these types of work (largely organised as âwomenâs workâ) as both a loving attitude and a form of (paid) labour. This insight informs the concept of will-work in significant ways: will-work is work; it takes time, effort, and skills, and it is a central aspect of care giving, which requires an attentive caregiver. The types of work described above and will-work can be highly entangled. Acknowledging this adds to a more complex understanding of what giving care to people with dementia entails. Third, the concept of will-work rests on the shoulders of feminist care ethicists (e.g. Gilligan 1982; Tronto 1993), who have advocated for an acknowledgement of peoplesâ dependence and interdependency on one another. Will-work is a deeply relational practice: in doing will-work care workers rely on relational knowledge, acquired in their everyday work with the same people, often for the duration of years. In the unfolding interactions, resident and care worker relate to one another. Care ethics has been critiqued by disability studies for rendering care receivers passive recipients of care (Williams 2001, pp. 478â479).15 While existing power differences in the care encounter should not be disregarded, the concept of will-work is explicitly not applicable to the work of care workers only: care receiverâs wanting may be aligned to having a shower, but the caregiversâ wanting may also be aligned to flexibly adjust to what the care receiver wants. This could take the form of providing"
299,262,0.993,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"I am not arguing that the transgender peopleâs quest for using the facilities they prefer is a trivial one, but ask whether it should be treated as a constitutionally protected right or if there is some other way to address it. Communitarians point to the value of drawing on communal treatments of new issues rather than rushing to involve the courts. Communitarians see an advantage in alternative dispute resolutions (and integrative justice) such as arbitration and mediation over using courts, especially for âlighterâ offenses. Good divorce lawyers urge couples to work out their differences about custody of children and distributions of assets rather than rely on lawyers and courts. These recommendations are based on the realizations that the advocacy model characteristic of American courts tends to increase antagonism between the parties and make amiable, civil community-building outcomes much less likely. In this model there are only two sides, and each side presents its interpretation of the facts in the way that most strongly supports its position. The advocacy model assumes that the clash of two strong one-sided views will lead to a just conclusion, reasonable judgments and sound public policies. This is rarely the case. In the case at hand, various accommodations were proposed to deal with the special bathroom and locker needs of transgender people. For instance in 2015, Illinoisâs largest school district offered a separate room to a transgender student as a place where she could change. This proposal was rejected by the US Department of Education (Eldeib and McCoppin 2015). Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality, noted in response to the proposal, âItâs a very different thing to say âHereâs the facility. Hereâs how everyone else can use the facility, except you. Weâve determined thereâs something wrong with you that you cannot use the facility in the same way that everyone else canââ (Eldeib and McCoppin 2015)."

123,157,0.993,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"At hospitals, one can thus attempt to decrease the social cost of seeking help, by encouraging a teamwork mentality. The doctor student interviewed about his summer job experience at a mental hospital indicated that he was slow to understand the team dimension, and only gradually understood that it was normal to seek help from other team members. In other organizations, the issue can be to find ways to introduce risky activities, much in the same manner as described in chapter three regarding SÃ¸bakken nursing home. What constitutes a reasonable tolerance for risk and harm will always depend on the local circumstances, but a common feature is likely to be that one finds a balance between active and passive mistakes, or between prescriptive and proscriptive dimensions of morality. Another finding from research in this field is that the social cost of seeking help is lower than common perceptions take it to be (Brooks, Gino, & Schweitzer, 2015). The act of contacting another person to ask for help might even have a social gain rather than a cost. The study focused on the specific help seeking activity that consists in asking others for advice. Conventional wisdom and lay beliefs (as documented in two pilot studies for the main study) tend to be that asking for advice decreases perceptions of competence, but the results of the study indicate to the contrary that people tend to interpret acts of seeking advice as signs of high competence. The effect depends on the perceived complexity of the task: âWhen the task is difficult, asking for advice causes advice seekers to appear more competent than when they do when the task is not difficult; when the task is easy, asking for advice confers no benefitâ (Brooks, et al., 2015, p. 547). It also makes a positive difference that the request for an advice is directed to the person who is going to"
117,113,0.993,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"this concept from the perspective of care allows one to focus on the conceptâs ethical content. Following Ricoeur, it is possible to understand autonomy as an internal dialogical process in which reasons and points of view on the good life are taken up and tested, thereby forming oneâs own voice. Engaging with and forming oneâs own will is thus inseparable from taking other perspectives into account. In his further reflection, Ricoeur equates this relation of self and other with the basic evaluational attitude of esteeming oneself and esteeming others. Indeed, one of Ricoeurâs main aims is to show how being concerned with oneâs own will is inextricably intertwined with being concerned with the autonomy of others. When one is concerned with oneâs own good life, one esteems this life, and one does so also from the point of view of others. Conversely, if one cannot esteem oneself from the point of view of others and is not esteemed by others, one will not be able to esteem oneself (Ricoeur 1992, pp. 192â194). This is the reason why supporting autonomous will-formation can actually be regarded as a valuable aim from the point of view of an autonomous will. Esteeming oneself in autonomous will-formation is intimately linked to being esteemed by others and esteeming others, and ascribing to them the same abilities that one ascribes to oneself as an actor: âThis exchange authorizes us to say that I cannot myself have self-esteem unless I esteem others as myself. âAs myself â means that you too are capable of starting something in the world, of acting for a reason, of hierarchizing your priorities, of evaluating the ends of your actions, and, having done this, of holding yourself in esteem as I hold myself in esteemâ (Ricoeur 1992, p. 193). Respecting the autonomy of another thus leads to supporting the social and physical presuppositions of this kind of internal dialogue. This turn does not rest on an ethical demand that is external to what one values in autonomy. Instead, it develops within the autonomy stance itself, since autonomy presupposes esteeming others as one esteems oneself. These presuppositions can be regarded as constituting basic human needs that must be present in order to allow for autonomous will-formation. A hermeneutic conception of care thus resolves the care dilemma by calling for attention to needs. However, these needs cannot be defined independent of the preferences of the other.

This will be recalled in the next section. Before we add another disambiguation to the list of dignity meanings in terms of Kantâs Formula of Humanity (always treat humanity never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end), one loose end needs to be tidied up. The formula was explained in two ways, one formulated positively, the other negatively. 1. Human beings must not instrumentalise (i.e. use or abuse for oneâs own agenda) other human beings without their reasonable consent. 2. Human beings have the right always to command respect for their reasonable sense of purpose and self-worth. What does âreasonable consentâ or âreasonable sense of purposeâ mean in this context, and why is it important? Answering this question will contribute to resolving the ï¬rst dignity riddle, as we will see below."

As shown in the book, individuals are not only exposed to changing political contexts but are also confronted by their personal past and present experiences, which serve as the backdrop against which they rethink the past in the present. By now we have become so sensitive to the idea of the flexibility of the past that we tend to forget that it restsâat least to a certain degreeâon an experiential base (Irwin-Zarecka 1994: 17). Appadurai (1981) argues that the past does not offer an infinite source for interpretation but is always told within certain cultural norms and rules. In this book I have demonstrated that the past is not an unlimited resource by showing how it is genuinely influenced, not only by a predefined discursive space but also by peopleâs personal experiences. By looking at the intersection of memory and generations, both continuities and discontinuities"
46,155,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"One additional important issue is connected to the idea of interest as a ground for attributing responsibilities to agents of justice: adaptive preferences. We have already argued that adaptive preferences are normal during childhood and that development during childhood itself is always an adaption to the environment in which one grows up and lives. No child is in a position to choose these things autonomously, naturally coming to terms with her situation. This is one of the reasons why functionings, not capabilities, are to be preferred as units of justice for children: it is simply unreasonable to emphasize freedom of choice when the agent in question has only very limited knowledge and experience of what she is choosing. Hence, the normative core of adaptive preferences is tricky to catch in the case of children, because it seems as if, from an objective (adult) point of view, children often tend to alter preferences based on what is made available to them by adults. Children sometimes neglect injustices happening to them; in extreme cases they still love and bond with abusive parents and view themselves as responsible for the parentsâ behavior. Adaptive preferences can also affect the parents and other caregivers who directly interact with the child daily. Parents can have adaptive preferences in the sense that they do not want their children to be educated or that they neglect their health issues. Here, the issue of parental autonomy, parental rights and duties and the responsibility of other agents of justice to interfere becomes crucial; we will come back to this later, when we discuss the responsibilities of parents and caregivers. For now, we highlight that the idea to put responsibilities on the poor as agents of justice always faces the difficulty that those who should have the most interest in overcoming an injustice often support its existence. In such cases, it might be justified to neglect the choices of the poor and to enforce certain changes, even if it goes against their will. Expert-driven poverty alleviation is sometimes necessary, and in the case of children, even justified. They certainly cannot be expected to always make the right choices and know what is best for them in order to reach justice. Finally, Young argues that collective abilities are relevant. Fighting structural injustices is usually a matter of joint actions. Individuals have to work in a coordinated way in order to effect change. There are typically networks and groups concerned with questions of social justice â NGOs, trade unions, several faith-based organizations â but universities and other educational institutions also unite many individuals. Consequently, their structures can be used to initiate or maintain movements aimed at undermining structural injustices. Their collective abilities provide a very helpful starting point, and it is reasonable to"

By applying to this teaching the discussion of foucault (1983) on truth and social discourse, we propose to single it out from other kinds of teaching designed for learning about controversial issues (Leone 2012; Leone and Sarrica 2014). we think, in fact, that this kind of history education has to be distinguished from other kinds of difficult teaching on sensitive issues. Many times history teachers may be confronted with classrooms that could be divided by their own idea of what happened in the past. To quote only a couple of examples of this situation, imagine to be a teacher trying to explain Northern Ireland struggles in Dublin or in London (Barton and McCully 2012); or imagine to teach to your pupils the apparently innocent story of native Americans feeding starving newcomers disembarked from the Mayflower, being aware that this episode could be accounted for as an act of generosity or as the first moment of"
247,253,0.993,Humanities World Report 2015,"Translating the humanities In Chapter 4 we looked at the ways in which humanities researchers attempt to bring the results of their work, or even conduct their work, outside the traditional boundaries of academia. What we termed translation (borrowing the word from medical practice) can exist in many different forms: working with museums to reach the public; going out to high schools; broadcasting on TV and radio; working with policy makers; and so on. No one can deny that there is a great deal of translation going on, and we gave examples of different types based on our own interviews and on national reports and other sources. But we also identified various obstacles to crossing the divide between the academic and the non-academic. One lies in academic culture itself. All too often translational activities are actually frowned upon by fellow researchers. We found evidence of such attitudes in countries as far apart as China and the Netherlands. In other countries the opposite is the case; in Russia and some parts of Latin America, the role of the public intellectual is alive and well. Indeed, some academics even wish the boundaries were sharper. But, aside from the attitudes of fellow academics, we found a more systemic problem in academic managers and institutional leaders failing to incentivise such work. It often goes unrewarded and so can inhibit career advancement. Even if it is actually respected, institutions may do little to facilitate the process of translation, and the lone researcher has to act as entrepreneur as well as academic researcher to bring his or her work to a wider audience. We are also aware of the dangers of encouraging translation in inappropriate ways. For example, we are not suggesting that institutional leaders should henceforth require applicants for project funding to build considerations of end use into the very framing of their proposals. Sometimes this may be appropriate, for instance a museum might commission research that will enable it to organise a particular exhibition for the benefit of the public. But it is often discoveries made in the disinterested pursuit of knowledge that result in the most important translation. So the ways of facilitating translation that we wish academic managers to find may typically come once research is well under way. We need to allow for serendipity; let humanists, like researchers in other fields, pursue their research on grounds of intellectual curiosity, without any explicit or conscious regard for what application or social value it may have. Our interest is in what happens when the results of the research turn out to be of immediate public interest or directly relevant to policy making. It needs to be possible for the researcher to cross"
269,196,0.993,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"the phrase âplaya haterâ serves to conjure up. Letâs face it, sheâd felt the envy of the hater. In her potent analysis of âugly feelingsâ, Sianne Ngai argues that âenvy lacks cultural recognition as a valid mode of publicly recognizing or responding to social disparities, even though it remains the only agonistic emotion defined as having a perceived inequality as its objectâ (Ngai 2005, 128). The temptation is always to tell the envious person to âget over itâ â where âitâ is a designator of the inadequacy of that individualâs psyche â rather than to think through the imbrication of the psychological and the social so as to understand what it is that provokes the desire to inhabit (or to crush) the space of the other. It would be fair to say that FC hasnât âgot over itâ; her envy is still strong. But the introduction â and then circulation â of the figure of the playa hater ended up, over time, having a significant effect on how she herself thought about, and indeed entered into, collaborations with those from other disciplines â as well as how she thought about the spatial logics of the interdisciplinary field in which she was a participant. The diagnostic precision of the phrase âplaya haterâ perhaps allowed her, over time, to move from âfeeling fuzzyâ about how such an appellation had ended up being attached to her, to being able to inhabit an interdisciplinary landscape that she was less likely to construe in such agonistic terms."
208,132,0.993,Actors and the Art of Performance,"Affect versus thought We need to return to the idea that thinking is the enemy of performative talent and that affect is the enemy of philosophical or scientific integrity. Why? Because preconceptions are tenacious and hard to exterminate. Borrowing from Nietzsche we can say they are as âineradicable as the flea-beetleâ and âlive longest.â35 Of course, they are always playing games. They like to sneak in wherever they can, excrete their poison, let off steam. The advantage of this is clear. You yourself are not guilty, you have an excuse, a scapegoat. Sigmund Freud and Nietzsche shake hands with one another. They pronounced the correct diagnosis. Ressentiment and transference are the ruling powers, and we can only ever be relatively free of them: âThe spirit of revenge, my friends, has so far been the subject of manâs best reflection; and where there was suffering, one always wanted 33 On the ecstatic unity of temporality and the ordinary (vulgar) concept of time, see section IV of Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, trans.

108,9,0.993,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"This was a young researcher still strictly empirical, creating the foundation for his theories. Just recently his book Algerian Sketches was released post-mortem where he writes about Algeria, the Algerian conflict and his theories. Later on, Bourdieu found that much of the social mechanisms he had found among the Kabyle were present in all manners of other social contexts. Bourdieu was one of the foremost French thinkers of the late 1900s and had great influence on many humanist and social science disciplinesâmainly in Europe. Those who have not read his work consider his thinking to be post-modern, but strictly speaking, he is not of the deconstructive school. He saw himself as post-structuralist, which was partly an acknowledgement of structuralism, but which also showed that it was not as embedded in his thinking with the degree of rigidity normally imposed by structuralism. He has, for example, done extensive research in the fields of art, literature and even studied his peers, the professors in Paris as empirical material. Bourdieu might at times be hard to understand, but his theories are based strictly on empirical material which he then has generalised to theoretical systems. With the passage of time, he introduced new terms, for example the term field, which we will return to later on. For more than a decade, I myself have used and expanded Bourdieuâs theories and found that there is a case to state that they are valid for studies and practice regarding Military Operations as well. This text should be seen as an introduction of the theories into the military field, especially regarding the field of intelligence analysis. In military context, the theories can be used to make social patterns visible. If you have good empirical material and a good analysis, then you will be able to see how actors (collective as well as individual) relate to each other. In the end, one can be both able to predict what will happen (with a certain degree of certainty) and able to make the other part (enemy or not) behave in a certain way, without them knowing that you are manipulating them. I would like to underscore that this text is primarily focused on the theory and not the empirical aspect. It only serves as a way to exemplify the theory and show its usefulness in operational analysis. I recommend the bibliography at the end for those interested in the empirical events briefly explained in this text. It should be stressed that field theory is more of an object than a tool in the text. The text is primarily a tool for training, inspire primarily military officers how to use field analysis. The overall aim of this text is to present an alternative approach to"
223,183,0.993,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"As aptly as these introductory words by SchÃ¼tz and Simmel summarize my own hypothesis on the presumed phenomenon of non-knowledge,1 I note that it is captured still more precisely by economist Joseph Stiglitzâs (2005) formulation about the âinvisible handâ (p. 133) ostensibly operating in the market place. Asked why the invisible hand is invisible, Stiglitz gave a straightforward answer: because it does not exist. Similarly, I ask in this chapter why non-knowledge is difficult to grasp. And my equally analogous response is: because there is no such thing as non-knowledge. Not wishing to capitulate already at this early point, I concentrate in this chapter on scientific discourses in which participants maintain that something like nonknowledge does exist. The knowledge/non-knowledge dichotomy appears in many discussions on the subject as a kind of performative speech act (Sartori, 1968). However, it recommends only one side of that which it designates, namely, knowledge. I cannot quite sustain my doubt about the existence of not-knowing; from time to time I have to deviate from it and maintain that non-knowledge does exist. At the same time, I draw attention to other terms that are empirically and theoretically more productive than the naked assertion that non-knowledge exists. Finally, I will point to a number of intriguing, but rarely studied topics relating to the question of the societal function or societal treatment of apparently insufficient knowledge. My usage of the term non-knowledge follows the convention in the literature that discusses the absence of knowledge. The term is synonymous with not knowing and has a close affinity but not identity with ignorance. In German the term is Nichtwissen."
124,204,0.993,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"on the agents themselves. A non-empty set of agents is postulated, and the choice function indicates what choices each will have at each juncture in branching time. But little else is normally said about the nature of the agents and about what distinguishes one agent from another other than brute non-identity. Belnap has remarked17 that in a branching spacetime system, it is possible to associate each agent with a unique set of point events, the set of those at which the agent is present. This is made possible by the fact that distinct agents cannot occupy the same place at the same time. Unfortunately, if we look merely at branching time, with no basis for discussion of spatial dimensions, no such simple account of the identity of agents is possible. However, the usual constraints imposed on the choice function, including in particular the constraint independence of agents, do make it possible for us to look at agents in new ways. In particular, we can give some formal substance to, and gain some new insight into, the view that an agent is the sum of the choices she makes and thus that an agent is a work in progress, existentially shaping her character and her very identity through her choices. In a Belnapian world, the constraint independence of agents assures that, strictly speaking, no two agents will be presented with the same choices at a given moment in time. Of course at the restaurant both may be choosing between having the scallops and having the mussels, but that is only to say that the choices facing one may be descriptively like those facing the other. For one thing, even if they both choose the scallops, for example, they will not get the same scallops. But more significantly, agent a is choosing what a will order (and, presumably, eat), not what agent b will order. So even confining attention to a single moment, agents are normally18 differentiated from one another by the choices they face. If we shift attention to the choices agents make, not just the choices they face, this becomes even clearer: even at a single moment, provided only that the agents are active, they are differentiated by their activity, which is to say: by the choices they make. Widening our perspective to scan a history within which a moment falls, we find the agent making a succession of choices which cumulatively help define that very history, setting it apart, choice by choice, from others that had been available. The totality of those choices will be absolutely unique to a given agent, no matter whether we focus on the menu of choices the agent faces or on the choices the agent selects from that menu. Seeing this accumulation of choices along the history as uniquely associated with one agent, we can begin to consider it as constituting that agent, in which case as we survey the history we now get a strong sense of what it might mean to say that the agent is creating herself by her choices. In a different history, pursued by making different choices, she would have become a different person. 17 At the Î±EONâ10 Conference, Fiesole, Italy, 2010. 18 There is one kind of exception to this generalization: at a given moment two agents might be"
57,107,0.993,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","triangulation, not Confrontation While we have very different approaches to how we present ourselves and where we meet, we have considerable consensus on what to avoid during an interview: confrontation. Confrontation is a frequently employed style of interviewing in journalism. We do not know to what extent academic researchers in democratic circumstances ever employ confrontation as an interviewing strategy, but we do know that for researchers of authoritarianism, it is not a helpful approach to improving our understanding of how things work. It is not our job to influence the views of our interviewees, let alone change them, but to try and establish how they see things, or at least how they choose to present them. Our approach is markedly different in this respect from the one recommended by Markowitz (2016, 905), who writes that in authoritarian circumstances, interviewers âneed to be prepared to raise hard questions that bring tension into the room, to challenge informants when they are giving the official line and not their own viewpoint, and to identify discrepancies even to the point of calling him/ her out on a false statementâ.

269,154,0.993,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"The familiar register of exhortations to interdisciplinarity â mutuality! reciprocity! exchange! â is one that assumes that differentials of power do not exist. And yet, for many people from the humanities and social sciences â and we are thinking quite beyond our own collaborations here â experiencing oneâs role in a collaboration with life scientists as a relatively powerless one undercuts these kinds of exhortations. Go to the bar at any science and technology studies conference, and it wonât take too many drinks before social scientists start telling you about how their research is often understood as âpublic engagementâ; how they consistently have to justify their expertise to their collaborators; how they have to translate (or sometimes give up on) their conceptual language in a way that is not always reciprocated, and so on. This doesnât mean that life scientists in collaborations are especially power-hungry; or that they behave badly (no doubt most would be surprised and taken aback to learn that their collaborators would narrate their experience in such ways). But it is to say that when a group of people collaborate within institutional structures that end up placing the more highly valued epistemological frameworks, as well as financial resources, largely on one side, then asymmetries result. Even among â and perhaps especially among â the most well-meaning people, such asymmetries can produce some unlovely relations. It is important to note that such relations are rarely, if ever, explicitly endorsed by collaborating life scientists, and life scientists themselves often do not gain from them. Indeed, to the extent that interdisciplinary asymmetries of power can produce silences and absences, there is a significant risk that they reduce the space for the complex collaborative entanglements that motivate many scientific collaborators in the first place. Perhaps more importantly, and this is perhaps not always so visible to collaborators, even if natural scientists in particular collaborations may appear to hold all the power, those scientists themselves are subject to precisely the same asymmetries, when they reenter a larger prestige economy that might mark their collaborations with social scientists or humanities scholars as decidedly low-value contributions. And this is to say nothing of the way that natural scientists may experience a more subtle asymmetry, as they get pinioned by the philosopherâs or literary theoristâs rhetorical monopoly on, and their own explicit exclusion from, what it means to think âcriticallyâ. (Indeed, we have lost track of the number of times we"
186,47,0.993,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"something one can aspire to that could lead to a laurel, as in Goetheâs poem, if achieved. It is not something intrinsic in humankind, as the German constitution, via the earlier riddle, assumes. If somebody from a culture that does not have a word for dignity is learning English, would the above help her understand the concept? In some respects yes. She would probably come to the conclusion that, in most cases, authors use the term as a descriptive property. Among other things, characters can be humble, modest, pleasant, charming, plain, lazy, mean, vicious, aggressive, serene, andâdigniï¬ed. They can demonstrate intelligence, beauty, arrogance, pride, languor, humility andâdignity. In almost all of the quotes above, one learns something about particular human beings that sets them apart from others; some show dignity, others do not. If dignity were an inherent property of all human beings, it would have no useful meaning in ï¬ction. No author would use it to describe their characters, as it would not set them apart from others. The phrase âa digniï¬ed old ladyâ would be identical in meaning to the phrase âan old ladyâ. This is clearly not the case. Bertolt Brechtâs short story âDie unwuerdige Greisinâ,5 about an allegedly undigniï¬ed old lady, would not make sense. Hence, in ï¬ction and poetry, dignity is a useful descriptor precisely because some people display it and others do not. Judged from its use in the above quotes alone, dignity would seem to be a property that is not inherent in all human beings; it can be seen and recognised, but not all humans possess it. Therefore dignity does not seem to be inviolable and intrinsic. Its presentation in the quotations above comes down ï¬rmly on the side of the ï¬rst riddle. Of course, the selection of excerpts might have been highly selective, designed to give that impressionâand besides, these quotations are too few to represent the breadth required for the blanket conclusions to be drawn. But one can say that in ï¬ction, at least sometimes, dignity is used as a descriptive property which sets people apart, as opposed to a property that applies universally to humankind. The following two excerpts show the use of dignity in ï¬ction in a much broader way than in the earlier examples. I found a run-down cafÃ©. â¦ I sat there for an hour. I thought that somewhere in the universe must lie the other world â¦ a sun-golden world, a digniï¬ed world. Where every human found the one meant for them, where every love was true love and where one lived eternally. And, of course, I immediately thought of those who could not live even there; who were not suited for such generous, sumptuous grace. The damned, who would take their own lives even there.

Whether it is a comedy or a tragedy, this fragility of the prescribed is not limited to any particular content or development. It is part of all performative power which, in actuality, becomes the act, the manifestation, the event. Usually, actors do not advocate any explicitly political cause. But are they not nevertheless per se âpoliticalâ insofar as we might consider them to be the subversive disrupters of any behavior that acquiesces with the system? No matter what the performance is about, is not their propensity for a surprise turn, an unpredictable, gratuitous jump, is not their overflowing imagination and everything that continually seduces them to make up their language and inflection, their movements and their acts, is not this their own special form of resistance to all prescribed ways of thinking, to all norm-referenced behavior? In that superfluous skip, are not actors able to use the opportunity for free play that has been granted to them, to indulge in a little distancing dance (Dis-tanz) against the metalanguage of marketization and efficiency that has begun to increasingly pressure and rule over us all?"

At this point, the author would argue that an idea to remedy this problem might be found in the original context of âresilienceâ concept. Needless to say, âresilienceâ is the word originally used in the ï¬eld of psychology and psychiatry to describe, analyze and encourage the human beingsâ ability to adopt and cope with stress and adversity. In those ï¬elds, resilience is considered as an inherent ability of us, but, it is studied that it could be encouraged by appropriate support by relevant people and society, at the same time. Thus, if we extract some implications from this original context of âresilienceâ concept, we should recognize the importance of social healing process to remedy post-disaster emotional trauma of society and individuals. The process must be clinical and call for very intensive and grass-root but sometimes low-proï¬le efforts beside victims. Their damages need to be cured by psychological, bedside and ethical practices, while compensation, assistance funding, town reconstruction program and any other institutional and pragmatic supports are still important and effective in many cases. We need this kind of careful emotional treatments before we talk and do something about engineering resilience under the actual post-disaster situation like post â3.11â Japan. Furthermore, it is even required to apply the similar healing process to encourage the resilience of expert community, as the victimizerâs side. Japanese STS (Science and Technology Studies) researcher Ekou Yagi introduced her own experiences of âjust be there with victimizersâ after serious technological disasters, JR Fukuchiyama line train derail accident in 2005 and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in 2011 [13]. She points out that the members of victimizing companies/organizations of serious accidents also require emotional support to be proactive and to build sound and respectful relationship with victims and their families. She tried to be a supporter, not by doing something actively with them, but by just being beside them and hearing their voices calmly. She reported that the existence of such an escort person with the knowledge on their business (it was the advantage of her as a STS researcher) seemed to be supportive for âvictimizersâ and did encourage the positive signs of their own changes towards the rebuilt of public trust."

The length of leave (5 or 6 months) and the amount of time taken by each parent (one or more months, and when) always require a complex decision-making process in which the couple has to weigh up different factors: the impact of leave on each partnerâs career, employersâ openness to fathersâ leave-taking, the interests of the child (e.g. age for starting daycare) and those of parents (e.g. professional self-fulfillment; parental and gender equality values; reprisals in the workplace). All fathers had been informed of the new âsharing bonusâ contained in the 2009 law, but only some knew about the individual entitlement to the complementary parental leave compensated at 25 % of previous earnings. However, they all discussed the use of sharing bonus with their partner and informed the employer as soon as possible. Although these forerunner fathers began by âtellingâ their employer, as a mother would inform that she was pregnant and going on leave, they also describe having to enter into a process of negotiation, since employers did not readily accept fathersâ leave use as a natural right beyond the 2â4 weeks of paternity leave. As one father put it, contrary to what happens regarding the ânaturalâ inevitability of leave use by the mother, in the case of a man who is going to use parental leave the first reaction is to consider this as a choice or an option, which is often frowned upon by the employer. I think you have to put your foot down. I think that itâs because youâre a man that they say: âthis is not necessary, youâre doing this because you want to, you donât really need to do thisâ. Thatâs their idea of things, âlook, man, you donât need to do this, but if you really think you need toâ¦ well, itâs difficult to do without you here, but itâs your choiceâ. Whereas the mother, everyone accepts that the mother goes on leave, thatâs how it is, but a man there is the question of: âBut what do you think youâre up to? There is work to do (â¦) you donât have to go on leave, so if you donât have to, if you have an alternative, if a person only does this because he wants to, you are doing this and you are harming the company.

In 1935, Martin Buber (1878â1965) published Der NÃ¤chste, a collection of four essays on what it means to relate to other human beings as neighbours by the Marburg philosopher and neo-Kantian Hermann Cohen (1842â1918). In the introduction, Buber discusses when and under what circumstances assistance should be provided to others (1935, p. 7). He defends the need for positive duties against the widely held view in philosophy that restricts ethical duties to the ancient dictum âDo no harmâ. This position generally holds action to be mandatory only in very exceptional cases (Conradi 2016, pp. 54â58). Even a philosopher like Arthur Schopenhauer, who saw compassion as the driving force behind ethical behaviour, believed that the need must be acute and the emergency dire before action is required (2005, p. 101). For contemporary philosophers following Schopenhauerâs lead, the main criteria for performing individual assistance are an expectation of a significant effect, a severe emergency, a limited duration of aid, and a minor effort required for assistance (Mieth 2012, p. 243). Buber focuses on two other aspects of positive duty: whether the recipient is a member of oneâs own collective and whether the recipient is spatially proximate. Buber emphasises that the person at the receiving end could be anyone and therefore no distinction should be made between neighbour, stranger, friend, acquaintance, and enemy. But he believes particular attention should be paid to any person who is within the helperâs immediate sphere: âBe loving to your fellow as to one who is like youâ, is written in the Scripture, and shortly thereafter, as if to avoid any misunderstanding at any time, through special highlighting: âBe loving to a stranger as to one who is like youâ. Rea, the fellow, is someone I am dealing with, whom I met just now, the human being so to speak, for whom I should be âconcernedâ at this moment, whether he is of my own people or a foreigner. I should, literally translated, âlove himâ: turn towards him tenderly, show him love, practice love; namely as someone who is âlike meâ: in need of love such as I, in need of an act of love of a rea like meâas I know it just from my own soul. That this is to be understood in this way arises from the words following the second sentence: âBecause youâve been strangers in the land of Egyptââ or, as it says more clearly elsewhere: âYou know the soul of the stranger,"

Printed output is not a condition, so you canât use any of the useful condition handling tools youâll learn about below. Condition handling tools, like withCallingHandlers(), tryCatch(), and try() allow you to take speciï¬c actions when a condition occurs. For example, if youâre ï¬tting many models, you might want to continue ï¬tting the others even if one fails to converge. R oï¬ers an exceptionally powerful condition handling system based on ideas from Common Lisp, but itâs currently not very well documented or often used.

21,106,0.993,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"achieve this in those days was really very complicated. Dave De Roure managed the technology at our end. I donât know who managed it in the U.S., but it was quite an achievement and it all worked amazingly well. The Web community is a very different community from the hypertext community culturally, and I donât know how much they understood of what Ted said in his keynote. The most memorable thing for me were the words Ted used to close his keynoteâgiven to a hypertext community in Southampton but addressed to the Web community in Santa ClaraââYour future is my past.â That is so very true, but even now most people in the Web community have no idea just how true it is. As I reflect on how the Web has developed over the last 25 years, I see the ideas that Ted had 30, 40, 50 years ago emerging because they have to emerge. But itâs taken a long while, and whilst I love the Web for all itâs given us I also understand exactly how it slowed things down as well. I felt this with the Microcosm project too. There was another major seminal moment for me at WWWâ98, which was in Brisbane. Three things happened at that conference as I recall. Tim started talking about the Semantic Web again in his keynote for the conference. He had talked about it at the first WWW conference in 1994 [1] and the idea of making links on data in the information management proposal he wrote in 1989. As far as he was concerned in 1998, the web of linked documents was beginning to emerge but his vision wasnât complete until it was also a web of linked data, and so he started to re-educate the community about this at the Brisbane conference. Ted was also at the Brisbane conference to pick up a special award. I remember him demoing ZigZag to us in the bar one night at that conference. He was so excited, and we were all mesmerized. So I had heard Tim talk about the Semantic Web and I saw Ted demo ZigZag at the same conference, and I didnât fully appreciate either of them at the time. I understood the principles, but I didnât understand the detail. Itâs taken me a long time to appreciate both the Semantic Web and ZigZag, but as my understanding of both of them has increased I now firmly believe what I suspected all along: there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two ideas, and that you can implement ZigZag in the RDF graph. Someday Iâll find the time to prove that. I need to get Ted involved in making that happen. I really believe that these two amazing peopleâTim and Tedâhave the same idea of how you can make links on data to create an incredibly rich hyperstructure for generating knowledge. Tim will never talk about it like that. His idea with the Semantic Web is that machines can, if you describe the data using a vocabulary like an ontology, make inferences about the information contained in the data that couldnât be made in any other way. This is what Ted said in the paper he sent us about his closing keynote for this event, that actually if you take all these ideas to their extreme we will generate more knowledge. The other thing I remember about the WWW conference in Brisbane is that this is where Sergey Brin and Larry Page published their paper about the algorithm that became the Google search engine. So for me this really was a seminal conference with so many truly ground breaking ideas emerging at the same time, apparently orthogonal to each other but actually all the same thing as time has confirmed, since"
0,30,0.993,Library and Information Sciences : Trends and Research,"Summary While the technology explosion has made information easier to access, the challenge has come in determining what is deemed âgoodâ or authoritative information. There are many organizations that are advocating for increasing the awareness and need for information literacy. In the United States, this need has brought forth a more active teaching role for librarians. Both Dewey and Simmons (2000) predicted this role, though Simmons has had the benefit of being around during the information technology explosion. Information literacy not only applies for the college student but has become a valuable skill sought by employers in the workplace as well. It may be easier to give a student the information he or she needs, but teaching them how to find the information is akin to the old adage, âGive a man a fish and feed him for a day; teach him how to fish and you feed him for lifeâ (Anonymous). The role for academic librarians can be summed up similarly. The task for the student is to understand the importance of becoming or being information literate, to learn the tenets and the tools, and to use them in every aspect of their life."

Various authorities (parents, husbands, pastors, political leaders, etc.) who stress âanti-valeursâ in Kinois society want to limit the âpotentially liberating and revolutionaryâ fantasies that electronic technologies carry with them by voicing concerns about the ârightâ usage of technology. This is not to say that Kinshasaâs Pentecostals have an entirely negative view of technology or only see its asocial consequences. Rather, most Pentecostal Christians will agree that ICT, and the mobile phone, in particular, occupies a central role in communication with friends and relatives elsewhere in the country and in the diaspora, in the transfer of money for living costs and education, and in the maintenance of amicable and romantic relations. In addition, many Pentecostals also read Bible verses on their smartphones and participate in prayer chats. Yet, these approved ways of handling electronic communication technologies are not topics of public debates and moral anxieties as they are expressed in Kinshasaâs (semi-) public spheres. Moral anxieties about ICT-related kindoki dominate public discourse in Kinshasaâs Pentecostal worlds (see Pype fc.). The heterodox Branhamist Christian discourse suggests a unique conception of kindoki and technology in which evil spirits seem to be absent. The following is a condensed version of Fabriceâs explanation of Branhamist Christian principles concerning the dangers of television: Brother Branham has instructed us that the devil put television sets in households, in order to reach viewersâ souls. [â¦] Branham also shows that Christians will suffer with their eyes. People who watch too much television, those who sit in front of the TV set all day, will need glasses. They will not be able to rub their eyes to see better. Rather, the devil has taken television. He knows that the television set will ruin peopleâs eyes, and that they will be looking for drugs to heal their eyes. The Bible says that the [Holy] Spirit will come in a time of corruption; at a time when people will be crazy â¦ we are living this nowâ¦ there is so much destruction in the minds of children. They suffer from a mental deficiency. It is because the devil has put the TV set in your home. But we want to see Jesus. People stay in their houses and watch television. They do not go to church anymore. God has made us long for Him. But the devil has put the TV set in front of them, â¦ the pleasure that the TV set offers forbids people from meeting up with other Christians in the church."

[My University] now has [an] initiative that studies tech and society, for example. You need a human perspective around scientific innovations and their applications. As4: Natural sciences create technologies and social sciences propose various policies, but it is only humanities who can tell us how they can be used wisely. As16: Philosophy helps us foresee the impact of new technologies (or gives us the tools to do so). Challenging social norms Humanities research can often be the source of challenges to widely accepted social values and traditions. In this way it may actually be in tension with social cohesion. This role overlaps with critical thinking, being a specific instance of it, so we shall have more to say below. But for the moment, here is one of our interviewees testifying to the critical value of the humanities in a social context: As2: I would just say that it is only in the humanities and social sciences that we still produce a âcritical discourseâ. Science, technology and even economics have stopped performing that function. The curricula in these areas have no element of criticism per se, making it difficult for them to contribute to the formation of critical citizenship. It has proved more than once in the course of the last century that pure science and economics have failed to produce an understanding of the symbolic life that makes us social and therefore human. This point was also stressed at our Latin American workshop. Institution building Finally, it is worth recording three interview responses (from India, Lebanon and Russia) that linked the humanities to the creation and nurturing of strong institutions: ME3: The humanities are essential for building strong institutions. As6: You need some insight into the relation between the subject and the world in order to make institutions stronger.

299,130,0.993,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"consideration a host of social and psychological variables that influence preference formation. It is additionally beyond the scope of this chapterâand perhaps beyond the scope of human scienceâto present such a comprehensive, consolidated theory. The task of presenting a formal, universal theory is further complicated by the sheer variety of human experience. However, the lesson to be taken from these observations is simple: human preference formation cannot be reduced to a defined set of economic factors. Instead, it must be acknowledged that an indefinite number of environmental, biological, neurological, andâabove all, because how we are socialized determines to a large degree how we respond to the environmental, biological, and neurological conditions of our existenceâsociological variables, through processes that are not yet precisely described, account for vastly more variance in preferences than do economic factors. By taking a step back and considering the big picture rather than remaining wedded to a single disciplineâs assumptions, it becomes possible to sketch out a rough framework for how preferences might be formed and change, and hence the non-economic factors that ultimately affect choice behavior. Developing such a big picture theory would have three main benefits. First, it would go a long way toward helping to organize the sprawling literature on human preference and choice. Once a general framework is established, it will be much easier to understand how each study relates to the others, which, in turn, may help scholars to understand how the thousands of variables they disparately describe interact with each other. Second, it will facilitate a âcrossing of the Rubiconâ between economic and non-economic disciplines that will ultimately yield a stillincomplete but wiser, interdisciplinary approach to preference formation divorced from the âtheory-induced blindnessâ and jockeying for influence that is characteristic of todayâs theories. Third, such a framework would be much better for policymakers, who need a way of thinking about preferences that is universally applicableânot because it is a comprehensive theory of everything with models that are theoretically elegant but clumsy and unwieldy in the real world, but because of its flexibility and the ability to âplug inâ variables in the appropriate location when needed."
223,186,0.993,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"For Freud what followed from these observations was the conclusion that one ought to abandon this method of dream interpretation as lacking any substance. But Freud did not. After all, the knowledge does not really hide from the observer. One has only to search for it persistently. âIt is very probable, then, that the dreamer knows about his dream; the only question is how to make it possible for him to discover his knowledge and communicate it to usâ (p. 104). Hayek, confronted with a similar dilemma, decided, just like Freud, to ignore it. In his essay entitled âThe Creative Powers of a Free Civilizationâ (1960/1978), in which the lack of knowledge is a question of the distribution of knowledge in markets, Hayek first noted that any progress in civilization is the result of an increase of knowledge. In the real world, according to Hayek (1960/1978), it simultaneously holds true that âthe individual benefits from more knowledge than he is aware ofâ"

We can store all our photographs, all our emails and all our text messages. Leaving the personal we also know that Google is trying to digitise all books ever published, that they are pretty close to having indexed all webpages and that they store data about all searches. This is very useful to us. I love being able to use Google Book search to search through old print books, or Google Trends to look at what people searched for in 2006, but it is a huge cultural shift from a very recent time where we had to select what to record, what to save and what to forget or discard. The urge to exhaustively document everything is not new. In the late 1940s, the psychologist Roger Barker led a project attempting to document every moment of ordinary peoplesâ lives, as a counter to the constructed laboratory experiments that dominated psychology research at the time. Roger Barker and Herbert Wrightâs book One Boyâs Day (1951) is a 435 page record of everything that happens to a seven-year-old boy during one fourteen hour day, recorded minute by minute by a team of eight observers. While the book was criticised for its lack of analysis or theory, being nothing but raw data, Barker later published an anthology of studies based on such âbehavior streamsâ as he called them (Barker 1963), coining a term very reminiscent of the streams and feeds of data we create and read today. And yet, even as videotaping made recording simpler, this kind of intense collection of every detail of a personâs life did not become a common methodology until in the last few years, as computers have made it feasible not only to store such detailed logs but also to automatically record the data in the first place and to manipulate and analyse it. The Quantified Self movement with its blogs, conferences and meetups is the personal equivalent to big data: collecting and analysing data about oneself. Barker would have been thrilled to see the detailed streams of information about human behaviour collected by quantified selfers. But despite the promise of âbig dataâ we are still working out what kinds of questions can be answered by the data. Perhaps, as Alessandro Marcengo and Amon Rapp argue, echoing the critics of Barkerâs work half a century ago, Quantified Self âis not something oriented to build DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0006"

This requires people to imagine something with which they have no experience. People ï¬nd it difï¬cult to articulate their real problems. Even if they are aware of the problem, they do not often think of it as a design issue. It is not possible to accurately predict user performance in future situations [91]. People do not react until the situation occurs; it is the context and environmental conditions that trigger their actions. However, even if all the design problems are addressed, success is not guaranteed. In spite of this danger, even if the best-laid plans are suspect, by having put everything in place, the risk of failure has been reduced and there are better prospects of success [82]. In design, as in any other problem-solving process, it pays to analyse the problem before creating the solution. It is better to use 10% of the resources to ï¬nd out how to use the remaining 90% properly than to use 100% of the resources the wrong way [37]. Summary In this chapter, the importance of universal design and human-centred design with a bias towards the consideration of user sociocultural context have been emphasised, to enable designers to better understand and design for their intended users. Regardless of the research method used, the primary objective is to develop products, services, systems and environments for human diversity, social inclusion and equality. It also requires developing an understanding of usersâ values, attitudes and behaviour that can be translated into viable, powerful design concepts. In conclusion, universal design and human-centred design should not only include usability aspects but also it should go beyond and incorporate the cultural background and social situation of the user at the point of using the product, service, system or environment."
247,16,0.993,Humanities World Report 2015,"Outline of the report In the chapters that follow, we pursue what we consider to be some of the most important topics for a humanities report. In Chapter 2, we start with perhaps the best-known issue: the value of the humanities. How do people, especially advocates of the humanities, articulate the value of humanities research in different countries around the world? Are there any patterns that come to light when one compares the answers to this question in different countries? We start with a list of the values most typically attributed to the humanities, such as social cohesion, cultural heritage and critical thinking. We then give an outline account of each, and show which values are most commonly highlighted around the world. Although much of our discussion is descriptive, sketching âthe state of the artâ, we also offer some more critical comments, and warnings, about the risks of espousing certain values. In Chapter 3, we turn to the nature of the humanities and break the chapter into two parts. First, we ask what sorts of themes or approaches are most prevalent in humanities research today and what ones may be emerging. For instance, are phenomena such as digitisation or internationalisation having any effect on the sorts of themes researchers are choosing to work upon? In the second part we broach the question of how humanities scholars conceive of their disciplines. Do they see them as fundamentally different from the sciences (natural or social)? In particular, do they attempt to make advances in knowledge, to attain findings and make breakthroughs? Or do they consider their role to be more one of raising questions than answering them, or of telling narratives and trying out new perspectives? Chapter 4 is devoted to another area where recent developments may or may not be meshing well with humanistsâ attitudes and culture. This is the area of digital humanities (DH). In the first half of the chapter we try to give a snapshot of the sheer scale of activities around the world and the different kinds of digital projects pursued. Based on information available online, we provide a survey of DH centres around the world and give a classification of the kinds of projects they fund and promote. There is no doubting the scale of activity. But what about mainstream humanists? Are they convinced that these new technologies and projects are paying real intellectual dividends? Do they even understand what is going on? In order to answer such questions, we asked our interviewees for their views on the digital humanities."
360,445,0.993,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"The applicability of the A-T view to cognitive science is seen acutely in what we have been discussing throughout this article: property veriï¬cation judgments and subsequent modiï¬cations made to those judgments. To show this applicability, it is perhaps best to begin with a general explanation of how a property veriï¬cation judgment is made (in its strictest sense) on the A-T view (i.e., through what Aristotle and Aquinas call episteme or scientia, respectively), and then present how the same approach might account for the sort of property veriï¬cation results encountered in our experiment. On the A-T view, property veriï¬cation in its strictest sense occurs in virtue of understanding how a given property is explanatorily useful in knowing the nature of the thing in which the property is found. In other words, in the A-T view, to do property veriï¬cation is to verify that a characteristic is, in fact, a property of the thing (i.e., that it is a characteristic that flows from the essence of the thing). To put the matter concretely, we can ask, âHow does one decide whether birds have wings?â but with the understanding that we are actually asking how one decides whether wings is a proper accident (flowing from the essence) of bird. On the A-T view, property veriï¬cation in this strict sense will occur when we understand why the property regularly occurs in the kind of thing of which we are predicating the property. Note that in the A-T view, much of what we âknowâ about the world, even though a reliable guide for action, etc., is not actually known in the strict sense of episteme or scientia. We return to this point below. Now, as we have pointed out above, judgments are not made by looking in the concept to see if there is a property there, but rather through a judgment about the"

Altogether they represent forms of acting and thinking that can be defined first of all in negative termsâbreaking up with the traditions both of what we call âindustrial welfareâ and the more recent wave of managerial and neo-liberal reforms. However, as we will show, these innovations can also be defined in positive terms. Recurring features point to a certain style of doing things, a shared culture and perspective of thinking and acting across national borders that makes a difference to the past. It was a key task of our analysis to deal with the question what can be generalised from these innovations, their approaches and the tools and instruments developed by themânot only in the special local system within which an innovation was taking place but also at the level of an international debate on"
329,103,0.993,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"our jubilee year, we should take the opportunity to engage in giving to the causes that we feel matter to us as Singaporeans.â8 The very context of giving must be seen through an Asian lens. In their book Charitable Giving and Tax Policy, Gabrielle Fack and Camille Landais look at the relationship between philanthropy and tax policies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Denmark.9 They use tax policies as a way to answer three questions: why do people give, what constitutes a public good, and does enforcement of tax policies affect peopleâs behavior or is it enough to have the rules on the books? But these questions carry significant Western assumptions, as the authors note it is difficult to assign a monetary value to the âwarm glowâ generated by a philanthropic contribution. In Asia, while the altruistic aspect of providing a contribution does exist, so does the notion of the benefit of enhancing relationships with business partners and with government, motivations missing from the Fack and Landais calculation. The second question can be seen as tautological in the Asian context; a public good is what the government determines is a public good. This may be explicit, such as the verbiage and directions in Chinaâs new charity law, or it can be implicit. When Narendra Modi championed the need for more toilets in India, there was a flurry of philanthropists building toilets throughout the country. Now some people say that there are not only enough toilets but that many of them are being used as storage facilities, as there was little if any concurrent sanitation education about the use, behavior, and benefits associated with toilets. Lastly, while the question of enforcement is relevant in the Asian context, the signaling aspect of government policy is again very important. Governments use policies to signal what matters and what does not, or what is encouraged and what is discouraged. In countries with weak civil society and strong governments, private individuals and companies become adept at reading between the lines of the actual policy itself. Singapore provides another good example. Fiscal incentives can be helpful, but given Singaporeâs low tax rate, subsidies do as much by providing a powerful message that the government encourages its citizens to give to local causes. These tax breaks are only available when a taxpaying Singaporean gives to certified nonprofit organizations doing work in Singapore, in activities approved by the government. Such a policy would be unthinkable in America, but not in China or the Philippines. Of the 15 economies in the Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Societyâs Doing Good Index survey, only Indonesia does not grant any tax benefit to individuals and all of them provide some sort of tax"
188,97,0.993,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Experiences in the Summer Schools In the years 2010â2012 several workshops on SRL were organised, mainly for Ph. D. students in the TEL area at the JTEL Summer Schools. Three key target groups were considered at these events, namely learners, teachers, and developers. At the workshops the objective was to demonstrate the conceptual and technical solutions for personalised support of SRL. In the introductory part we aimed to explain how psycho-pedagogical theories impact the design of learning environments, considering principles of SRL. We emphasised the role of decision making for the quality of the learning outcome and that it should be supported properly to optimise learning for benefit of the learner. Specific support strategies for SRL were explained taking into account the various SRL concepts. The participants tried out the ROLE software aiming to create a PLE. Experience from these events has shown that Ph.D. students understood the ROLE approach quickly and managed to design their PLEs without bigger problems. In the practical part they elaborated approaches for personal support in small groups. The approaches were made with paper-and-pencil or with respective tools on their laptops. Each group presented their results followed by a discussion with the other participants. The group work was active and creative. However, it also turned out that it was really difficult for the students to find good and innovative solutions. As a conclusion it can be reported that the concept of personalised support for SRL can be explained to Ph.D. students, but it is very difficult that they find new solutions in a 3-h workshop. In 2010 we conducted a survey to test the impact of choice architecture on the responses of people and to find out what Ph.D. students think on some issues in TEL. Our respondents (advanced learners) mostly thought that too much freedom for the learner may be overwhelming and contra productive. Similarly, they agreed that learners needed pedagogical assistance. Finally, almost all of them appreciated availability of a competent tutor. In addition to these findings we could easily see how important it is to find good explanations of SRL concepts in order to achieve a common understanding. Slight changes in wording may dramatically change responses. At the same time this demonstrated that to identify real opinions and preferences of people may be a tricky issue and the concept of choice architecture can influence them essentially."

DelFattore (1992) wrote this about the trial: The protesters, who described themselves as born-again fundamentalist Christians, based their entire understanding of reality on their particular interpretation of the Bible. In their way of looking at life, all decisions should be based solely on the Word of God; using reason or imagination to solve problems is an act of rebellion. Everyone should live in traditional nuclear families structured on stereotyped gender roles. Wives should obey husbands and children their parents, without argument or question. (p. 36) The reading books used by the teachers were filled with imaginary creatures, fantasy, and fairy tales. Parents were upset about the material, but they were as upset about the notion of asking learners to become critical readers. DelFattore (1992) further notes: Imagination, like independent thinking and tolerance for diversity, has no place in the Hawkins County protestersâ world view. They alleged that the process of imagination, regardless of the content, distracts people from the Word of God. Once the mind is open to imagination, all kinds of alien thoughts may enter, and the soul may be lost. Moreover, using imagination to solve problems substitutes a human faculty for the absolute reliance on God that is necessary for salvation. (p. 44) In some cases students are not expected to ask questions of the teachers or of texts, while in other cases, they are. These differences in views are potentially extremely contentious. 4.3.2.3 First and second languages Language differences can impact student interactions in school. What are some specific language features that might make a difference? Vietnamese speakers, for instance, find it difficult to learn English for various reasons (Honey, 1987). Honey notes, âBecause their mother tongue has no inflections, differentiates words by tone, and makes great use of syntax and particles for grammatical purposes, Vietnamese find a language like English, which is so dissimilar to their own, very difficult to learnâ (p. 238). There is a relationship between the degree to which one can communicate in the language of instruction and oneâs inclusion into the culture of the classroom. There is also an overall"

Aspects that are supremely notable and present to outsiders can be invisible to the hard working and deeply concentrated insiders. This chapter argues that moral blindness in organizations can occur when people develop routine ways of looking at things and gradually fail to see moral aspects of their own conduct. Workplace incentives have a significant impact on how employees see reality in their organizations, and can make moral dimensions of the activity become blurred and invisible. Generous bonuses can speed up moral neutralization and make initial misgivings about goals and methods at work disappear from view. Even people with excellent abilities in ethical analysis and with the most dependable and stable character traits are vulnerable in this respect. A crucial element in ethics in organizations should therefore be to establish communication climates that encourage people to speak up when they observe what appears to be morally dubious conduct in their own working environment.

163,34,0.993,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"theory about economic behaviours), I bow to Almâs second proposal that such theories will come mainly from outside mainstream economics. Almâs widely cited article is inspired by the work of George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton (2000) and Akerlof and Robert Shiller (2009), and proposes a view of the economy where âalternative perspectivesâ on human behaviour play a role in explaining economic decision-makingâtax evasionâin the labour arena. Third, the focus ought to shift from the modelling of individual behaviour to the aggregation of individuals. One implication according to Alm is that we should consider other taxes as well as individual income tax, another is the fact of belonging to groups always has implications on individual behaviour, regardless of whether you call these groups culture, society, organizations or whatever. Alm recognizes that the same individual does not always behave in the same way. Just because I am a woman with an academic degree, who lives in an apartment in a large urban environment and bikes to work does not mean I make the same economic decision every time. I however challenge Almâs fourth proposal, of further laboratory experiments, and his fifth proposal, of controlled field experiments, as ways forward to test proposed theories. Instead I suggest that researchers should direct their gaze to peopleâs lived experiences. There is a world out there, filled with ample examples of people living and acting under a multitude of tax regimes around the globe. In addition to clinical experiments where the modelling of experiments and the posing of questions allows us to construe peopleâs behaviour, we have to ask about and observe what people do and engage with in their everyday life. The goal for an economist is, of course, to find tools to measure the level of tax compliance or tax evasion and also to identify and explain factors that have an impact. From these, a proposed control of such factors can be suggested. As an anthropologist, it is my modest contribution to present various notions and definitions of reciprocity, beyond the usage of economic and legal literature, in order to contribute to the ââfull houseâ of strategies to measure, explain, and control the âfull houseâ of behaviors and motivationsâ (Alm 2012: 28). Economists have, for example, tested taxpayersâ willingness to comply applying theories of pro-social behaviour, where the argument is that people are more inclined to do what others do. In this vein of tax compliance research, reciprocity means that if other taxpayers pay their due taxes, other citizens would also feel obliged to pay. And the opposite also applies: in a context where many avoid paying tax, the propensity for the individual"

It represents many of the core elements also found in other approaches to this topic and brings together different fields of discourse. It also fulfills the six criteria we have proposed. All of these functionings and capabilities (according to the childâs maturity and competence) are based on research, are objectively determinable (at least to some extent) and are highly influenced by social arrangements, and many of them are fertile. We believe this list is best understood as a pragmatic and empirically informed selection of the functionings and capabilities that matter for the well-being and well-becoming of children; it is based on broad consensus backed up by a wide range of experts from different fields (academic and nonacademic), giving the selection a high grade of credibility that extends beyond purely philosophical arguments. If it is in fact exhaustive, as Biggeri and his colleagues suggest, the question is certainly a disputed, not easily answered one. However, it does not seem to be necessary to have a clear and final stance on this issue in order to provide a theory of justice for children that is able to give a fundament for the evaluation of a societyâs practices and institutions and to guide its development for the better."

Apart from the type of use, it is important to look at how it is used (ad hoc vs. integrated) and why it is used (reporting, performance improvement or value creation). The overall purpose â or the why question â is related to the corporate sustainability strategy: is it aimed at compliance and reducing risk or is the goal to create shared value. The more it is aimed at value creation, the more LCA should be integrated in the business. Is it more directed at compliance and reporting, LCA probably stays more ad hoc. Reporting and improving performance can be done on a department level, innovation requires a more integrated and holistic approach. To develop these specific applications for LCA it is essential to link up with people from these departments to explore the needs and opportunities â remember the personas we presented earlier. In some companies they recognized this need and created a specific position to liaise between the LCA department and the internal client. In a transition phase this could be a good solution."

This is a pet peeve of Tedâs. But in this animation, they are just objects, and any object can talk to any object. Iâll take a look at the menu of the animation window. We can stop it ticking, and we can single-step the frame we care about. Maybe we want to share this frame with a painting tool. If this was prepared ahead of time, it would already be done. Instead, to paraphrase Thoreau, we need to find out what Texas might have to say to Massachusetts; that is, how did each of the tools characterize their parts and behaviors. Then we can do what Ted loves, shown in Fig. 3.8, which is to draw a line between the two windows. Some of the actions can be pre-defined, but we can also define one later by doing this gesture to create a dynamic link between the two windows. The painterâs picture wants to be linked to the bouncing windowâs current frame, so we just write that in there and do it.

Only after feedback from the leader at the unit did he realize that the normal and expected behavior from newcomers was to seek assistance and be open about oneâs own shortcomings. Opportunities for further work at the hospital would have been greater if he had actively sought help from more experienced and competent colleagues. In the fictitious case of the doctor who refrained from asking more experienced colleagues for help, we can imagine a similar set of reasons why he might have wanted to sort out complications with the patient on his own. He, too, is in a position where he wants to make a good impression and demonstrate that he can cope with complex cases on his own. All three dimensions of social cost are relevant to understand why someone in his position may avoid seeking help, even when the life of a child patient is at stake. Gender differences can affect the threshold for seeking help. In a study conducted at a hospital, Lee (2002) followed the introduction of a new medication-ordering system, introduced in place of a system based on hand-written paper forms, and looked at how often people sought help from various sources when they encountered problems with the new system. She found that women were significantly more likely than men to seek help in such situations. That even held when comparing male and female doctors. Lee interprets these findings to mean that being competent, superior, and independent may be more important to male self-esteem than to female self-esteem. Gilligan (1982) proposed that women are socialized to value relational closeness and interdependence, while men to a stronger degree value independence and being able to look after oneself. There appears to be a gender difference when it comes to help seeking, and it can be important to acknowledge that, regardless of whether we consider that the causes are biological or social. Another interesting finding in Leeâs study is that tasks central to an organizationâs core competence, the ones that directly influence the organizationâs strategic advantage and competitiveness, are precisely the tasks for which the organizational members perceive the social cost of seeking help to be the highest. It appears to be harder and more socially costly, then, to seek help to perform tasks that people in the organization"
13,94,0.993,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"but the social patterns to which they speak that is the target (Roseneil 2006: 848). In my case, the whole-sample analysis does not work on the level of individual psychobiographies, but on the level of shared psychological patterns. It is not the defended subjects I am aiming at, but rather the patterns of defence across individual cases, no matter how varied the individual trajectories to this pattern were. Furthermore, the concept of the unconscious I work with is not only or even primarily understood with reference to the dynamically repressed, but rather as a part of the self that organises experience and informs creativity and agency on an emotional level (see Chap. 2). For this reason I relate to my interview transcripts not as persons, but as texts. I regard the interviews as a corpus of text in which I try to find the emotional meaning as an integrated part of what is said, directly or indirectly. Just as narrative perspectives open up âoutwardsâ to social change, they also open up âinwardsâ through conveying the emotional meanings attached to such change (Rudberg and Nielsen 2011). It is possible to work with a psychoanalytic ontology (Hollway and Jefferson 2000; Roseneil 2006) and to employ a context-sensitive textual analysis and a psychologically sensitive reading that acknowledge that an emotional meaning is always present in what is said, without analysing individual unconscious conflicts. From the way the informants talk and the words they use, it is possible to learn something about their personal images of parents and thus to gain some insight into how also emotional aspects of meanings of gender are part of a personâs biography. I have found the psychoanalytic concepts of identification, disidentification, projection, disavowal, idealisation and ambivalence (see Chap. 2) useful as ways to interpret what the informants say about their relationships with others and their own bodies. They may work as âsmall pockets of feelingsâ in the text. What people say about their feelings is sometimes relatively straightforward, while at other times it may be more hidden or ambiguous. The relation between utterance and textual context is an important cue here. If an informant says âI had a good relationship with my motherâ and then proceeds to describe her relationship with her father with much more enthusiasm and detail, then this textual context lends significance to the claim. Another informant could utter exactly the same phrase, but the context of the interview could give it a different meaning"
329,116,0.993,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"The second important factor in explaining the trust deficit is an extraordinary lack of transparency and disclosure by SDOs, often as a result of an inability to explain and measure results. Most SDOs have been started by and are run by people who are trying to do the right thing. At the same time, many of these individuals lack the skills necessary to keep proper accounting, management, and human resource systems to explain in a transparent manner how they spend the funds they raise and what impact their work is having. In a popular essay on philanthropy, Bill Gates explains, âYou can achieve incredible progress if you set a clear goal and find a measure that will drive progress toward that goal,â before he goes on to note, âit is amazing how often it is not done and how hard it is to get right.â Lack of metrics is not always the fault of SDOs. Government again plays a role: most Asian economies do not require financial transparency by SDOs, or their requirements are confusing. In the Philippines and South Korea, different ministries working in different sectors require different types of reporting from the organizations they are charged with overseeing. In some countries, no regular financial reporting at all is required. As noted earlier, in an attempt to remedy this shortfall, China enacted a new charity law in April of this year outlining financial reporting requirements and the government agencies tasked with oversight. Foundations as well do not always have to be transparent, contributing to the trust deficit. Even venerable organizations such as the Tzu Chi Foundation in Taiwan are at risk of public condemnation when their finances are completely opaque. Some people believe that Taiwanâs Tzu Chi Foundation is the wealthiest foundation in Asia, but it is a hard proposition to prove, or disprove. What is clear is that Tzu Chi, founded in 1966 by a highly respected nun, Chen Yen, is the worldâs largest Buddhist foundation. Tzu Chi, which means âcompassionate relief,â has enormous reach. With staff and volunteers totaling over 1 million people, operating in more than 40 countries, Tzu Chi has grown to be a formidable player in disaster relief and health services. It is also almost completely opaque, as Taiwan does not require religious organizations to provide accounting information. While it is known that Tzu Chi owns more than US$3 billion worth of Taiwanese real estate, there is no public record of how much the foundation is worth and how much it spends on charity. Most people agree that as long as the foundation runs under Chen Yen, now 79, it will stay true to its mission to promote âsincerity, integrity, trust, and honesty.â Once she is gone, the test will be how it continues to operate in an environment without the need to be at all transparent. Scandals are the third factor in explaining a widespread trust deficit. In systems where reporting and oversight is unclear, there can be significant"

Nor do people pay tax simply because they get something in return that is solely for their own personal benefit or because they think that the nation they reside in is utterly fantastic. It is more complicated; our willingness to pay tax depends on combinations of these factors including how tax laws are written, how these laws are interpreted and put into practice when collecting tax, but also on how this revenue is spent. Research about tax compliance thus points to many, many explanatory factors addressing economic, legal and social issues. Some of this research has in various ways used reciprocity as a causal factor, yet in quite different ways. I proposed that there are four types of reciprocity. A tit-for-tat relationship expects something in return for taxes paid. This is not entirely instrumental (although it can be applied as such), but is also a strategy for giving a very clear message that I as a taxpayer expect something in return. The copy-cat relationâs reciprocal content is in doing what others, in a similar position to me, do. If I pay my taxes so will others, and likewise if they pay so will I. Closely related to this is paying my fair share. If we all provide what we owe into the same treasure chest, I trust that its content will be distributed for all providersâ benefit. Finally, it is a question of equalityâof being treated in the same way as all other taxpayers, including the revenue collector. The latter has, as a governmental institute, access to an enormous amount of knowledge, and can also abuse its powerful position. These four categories of reciprocity obviously overlap. That I desire something in return for the taxes I pay does not have to be only for my individual benefit; I might require the revenue to be spent on societal issues that I value and hold dear. Similarly, a tit-for-tat expectation can go hand in hand with all taxpayers being treated equitably and that other citizens get their fair share. What we have seen from the Swedish example is that the everyday exchanges that create reciprocal relations between peopleâtaxpayersâare often forgotten in tax compliance matters. Perhaps researchers are too busy concentrating on taxation from a stateâs perspective.1 Such a perspective omits and forgets what citizens do every day in privateâoutside the realms of the state. Yet such practices also have an impact on tax compliance. It is a sort of tit-for-tat reciprocity where the state is left out of the deal. I call it a quid pro quo reciprocity as it does not have a vestige of a revenge element in it as the tit-for-tat varieties have. People continuously exchange for all sorts of reasons and with various intentions. They engage"

It collapses merely when we admit that causes may be only necessary but not sufficient for at least some events that matter to us in terms of our decision-making some of the time. Moreover, across a wide range of contemporary fields, including mathematics, computer science and physics, as well as economics, it appears increasingly clear that there are also events that just do not really have any cause at all [7, 8]. This ties in very closely with Keynesâ ontological notion of uncertainty."

On the final day of the event, likely collaborators were more-or-less forced â via highly curated groups â into extended interactions with one another, and instructed to return with the outline of a collaborative experiment. Most of these conversations did not produce anything very concrete (and this was fine) â but a fascinating interdisciplinary collaboration, drawing together very different traditions of psychological and neuroscientific experimentation on introspection, did emerge from the conversation between SK, Russ Hurlburt, Charles Fernyhough (CF), and others (KÃ¼hn et al. 2014). For FC and DF, the key mode of interdisciplinary intervention, here, was to use this workshop as a vehicle to ensure that likely collaborators were pushed to work with one another â and, critically, for the two of them to get out of the way once this curatorial work was done, and they were no longer required. Interdisciplinarity, here, was located first in the curatorial labour of bringing SKâs, CFâs, and Russ Hurlburtâs different, psychologically-rooted research traditions together (and we are absolutely committed to the view that the joining of heterogeneous psychological and neuroscientific traditions, rooted in profoundly different epistemological histories, is an intensely interdisciplinary endeavour), and generating the space for an experimental conversation to take place. But there was also a significant interdisciplinary intervention in knowing when to get out of the way: a more traditionally-minded mode would have insisted that, for this to be a truly interdisciplinary effort, it must include some âperspectiveâ from the social sciences and/or humanities. Such a view not only flattens the historical and internal multiplicity of such a capacious discipline as psychology, but also makes invisible the vital interdisciplinary labour of simply bringing things together. We are insistent, by contrast, that the generation of space, the curatorial labour of choreographing encounters, and then the willingness to know when your disciplinary perspective is not necessarily adding anything important, remain crucial, if underappreciated, ways to do interdisciplinary collaboration."
203,13,0.993,Self-Harm As Violence : When Victim and Perpetrator Are One,"we can understand why women who have suffered adversity, trauma and abuse would have, and subject to choice and a degree of control. Consider, in this light, the following first-person report: I needed to kill something in me, this awful feeling like worms tunneling along my nerves. So when I discovered the razor blade, cutting, if youâll believe me, was my gesture of hope. All the chaos, the sound and fury, the confusion and uncertainty and despair â all of it evaporated in an instant and I was for that minute grounded, coherent, whole. Here is the irreducible self. I drew the line in the sand, marked my body as mine, its flesh and its blood under my command.9 It is a harrowing indictment of our society that women suffer such adversity, trauma and abuse, and are possessed of so few genuine or perceived alternative options, that they choose to be violent towards themselves as a way of coping with and expressing their experience. Unlike violence towards others, we do not typically view self-directed violence as morally wrong, nor, since the legalization of suicide, is it criminalized.10 But it does violate a basic tenet of any broadly liberal society, which is that respect and equality are ideally due to all persons, irrespective of who they are.11 The very universality of this tenet means that, from each of our perspectives, it must apply not only to others but also to ourselves. Women who self-harm seem not to treat themselves with the respect and equality that, given this ethical outlook, they along with all other persons are due. Situating self-harm within its psycho-socio-economic context can help explain why women treat themselves and their bodies with such disregard and brutality: part of the explanation is that this may be how they and their bodies have been treated by others. Effectively and ethically addressing self-harm therefore has two interwoven facets. One facet looks to the rational agency of the self-harmer herself, and the need to support and empower her to choose self-care over self-harm. The other facet looks to the context of suffering, adversity and oppression in which women are situated, and the need to change the ways they are treated in wider society and the options available to them."

For several respondents, scholars need to be trained within a well-contained field with its own standards and methodologies. Put simply, their concern was that too much pressure for interdisciplinary research causes scholars to become amateurs. In some responses the solution seemed to be to let scholars master their discipline before they reach out to others. This point was made by 19 respondents, As6, As10, Au4, E2, E9, E14, LA2, LA4, ME3, ME4, NA1, NA3, NA4, NA14, NA16, R5 and: R1: I think that the most important disadvantage of the interdisciplinary research is that there is a risk of remaining an amateur and missing some important nuances of some of the disciplines involved. E8: There is an increasing threat to monodisciplinary research. People need to be deeply trained within a single discipline; there is a need for rigour. In the past rigour was exclusive, e.g. in Celtic studies medievalism was considered top of the tree. But there is a need to have intensive monodisciplinary training and then branch out. 2. Interdisciplinary work can be extremely time-consuming, starting from the basic information exchange needed at the outset, and then involving possibly years of hard work, often for an uncertain outcome. This point was made by 7 respondents, As8, E1, E10, E12, E14, NA8, NA15, R9 and: Af3: [interdisciplinary work] is difficult to carry out because it brings much greater complexity. It also requires that people from different disciplines work together and this isnât always easy. The advantage of monodisciplinary work by contrast is that it is much easier to carry out, involving a single perspective on an issue. It is important to consider these objections in the light of distinctions between different ways of being interdisciplinary. If what is at issue is interdisciplinarity in the strong sense of A3 above, the first criticism has considerable force. But it has much less force against A1 and A2. Multidisciplinarity seems to get round the objection that the whole point is to allow scholars to remain masters in their field while still working with other experts from other fields on a collaborative project.

This trust vis-a-vis the workers alone translates into motivation. Michael Werkle: Rewards for content creation can of course also have negative effects. For example the use of Wikiâs in companies is often very successful when coupled with reward systems . . . but they immediately die as soon as the rewards are taken away. The learning-tube philosophy is successful without any extrinsic rewards. Manuel Schmidt: We think that systems are successful when the intrinsic reward is obvious for the workers. For example, knowledge workers that have to train other workers are much more flexible when they create videos. The can reuse them in seminars or even refer to them during normal meetings. Interviewer: Do you track individual learners, their learning progress, . . .? Michael Werkle: This is not possible due to German privacy protection laws, and company level agreements. Interviewer: Currently the whole approach seems much centred on knowledge workersâworkers who do all their work in front of the computer screenâor at least on the knowledge working part of the job. Is there a planned integration of the factory floor learning processes into the system? For example when a worker explains to other workers how certain systems on the factory floor work, or how to make them work better, it cannot be captured by screen-casts. Michael Werkle: There are several research projects underway for humanmachine interaction. We are not sure yet which direction these projects will take. Manuel Schmidt: For me the question isâhow to integrate the LMS into the work environmentâor maybe not integrate it at all. For example, content could be attached to machines, and a learner equipped with technology like âgoogle glassâ could access this content directly in front of the machine, in a augmented reality setting. The goal will be âintegration into the normal work environmentâ. Interviewer: A very simple step, long before producing content for others is: taking notes for yourself in order to not forget. Learning material is produced for self-consumption. Are there any signs that the learning facilities inside Festo are used like this? To what extent? Manuel Schmidt: Our content creation process (for learning-tube, Ed.) is two-tiered. First the created content is saved locally, and only in a second step it is published. I know that some colleagues are using the system for personal notes. My personal estimation is that the ratio between published videos and local videosâconsisting of videos that the users are not happy with, and videos that the users created for self-consumptionâis about 1:10. Interviewer: In the conclusion of Chap. 7, it is mentioned that the search mechanisms inside videos are not yet thereâspecifically full text search is not working because not automatic translation of the spoken word to text is possible. Are there any new developments in this area? Manuel Schmidt: We tried to set up a project that tackles full-text search for videos with a semi-automatic approach: machine-translation and human lectors."
13,54,0.993,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"object-relations and the interrelational world of real subjects (Winnicott 1971; Benjamin 1995). Thus, the relational world gradually becomes both internally object-relational and interpersonally intersubjective: we may become both âlove objectsâ and âlike subjectsâ to each other, as Benjamin (1995) coins it. This means that whenever two people interact, there are at least two selfâother psyches at play. If the inner objects do not overwhelm and invade us, we may experience a non-narcissistic interaction based on mutual recognition. The more we are able to see the other as a whole and separate subject, the more we can also integrate negative feelings we may have towards the inner object. Coming to terms with the internal and external parents is a major developmental project and a lifelong internal process for most people (Chodorow 2012: 47). Winnicott points out that for the child, it is the intrapsychic aggression towards the object that makes it possible to recognise the other as a like subject, as it gives the child the possibility to experience that the other continues to exist in spite of the childâs aggression. Through this, narcissism or omnipotence is broken: there are others out there with a separate centre of existence and their own agendas. Benjamin states that in this way destruction is âthe Other of recognitionâ (1995: 48). The capacity to deal with both kinds of relationships is developmentally intertwined and therefore the pains of loss and the pleasures of attachment are equally determinant in subject formation (Layton 1998: 18â19). It never becomes a harmony, but implies continuous disruption and repair. In the intrapsychic as well as in the interpersonal space, the sense of self and others is constructed through transference, which includes the universal psychic capabilities of the human mind like positive and negative identifications (I see myself and the other as alike in some respectâand I can like it or not like it), introjections (I see something of the other as part of myself ), projections (I place something of myself in the other), affective ambivalence (I love and hate the other at the same time), disidentifications (this is not me!), splitting (dividing things into only good and only bad and projecting the aspects onto others or myself ), disavowal (refusing to recognise the reality of a traumatic experience) and idealisation (aggrandising and exalting the other and thereby also enlarging myself ).3 These"

Our summer school attendees remarked on their bewilderment: how to chart a course through the thicket of conflicting perspectives and options. To my mind, the most compelling parts of the summer school were not about contentâthe lectures by experts, the formulation of problems to be tackled, or even the conclusions that the student teams articulated on the last day. What was most impressive was the process, how it all unfolded. The organizers and discussion leaders managed to make space for future engineers to speak analytically and non-defensively about the failures that led into the Fukushima Daiichi disaster. It was not out of line to talk about the ânuclear villageââand also to subject that concept to some pretty stringent critique. Some students found a voice to speak from their own experience in ways that I doubt they would have tried in a regular NE classroom. Several said that whatever the caveats attached to formal projections of risk, they had never believed that an accident of this sort could actually happen. And now that it had happened, it could happen again. It also took deliberate social engineering to make room for open-ended discussions. Along with turning off the video camera (documenting for the purpose of Japanese reporting to funders) and a no-powerpoint rule for final presentations, it made a difference that we were in a setting outside the classrooms in Etcheverry, in downtown Berkeley, near several bars. It is tempting to live out of the inspiration of the summer school and to present it in the reporting language of demonstrated success. And yet I do not think of it as a straight-ahead model for future educational programs, at least not in this oneshot form. Asking the students to do little preparation, in a week of lectures and Q&A we could only get so far. When we made our way past the initial technical presentations to take up societal issues, it was not clear that social scientists were seen as having anything different to offer from engineers speaking in the same vein. And in the student discussions, inevitably, the content of âsocial scienceâ"
46,161,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"equipped to step in and support the family. In a rich society, the state typically meets these criteria. If agents A and B cannot do anything to help, then it is up to the mother to try to find a job, leaving her children alone during the day. But if she cannot find anything or finds only jobs she cannot accept for good reasons, she will be in a situation in which she no longer is able to provide a decent living for her children. In these circumstances, another agent comes into play: a person in her neighborhood, who works closely with the fatherâs employer and who has benefited from the fact that A exploits his workers and his profits are high. The neighbor did not intend to do anything wrong and was not aware of the schemes of his business partner, but he surely benefited; if there is no one else to turn to, his responsibilities are strong. The children themselves have the weakest obligation in respect to their own poverty. The two younger ones, aged one and three, obviously cannot do anything. The older one, aged ten, could work for the neighbors and support her mother and siblings, but from a moral point of view, this fact can confer only very weak responsibilities. Three important things should be noted here. Firstly, in many cases more than one reason to be responsible can be applied. The state, for example, is powerful and has some interest in keeping children out of poverty. Then there might be an uncle that is well off and close to the children; he certainly ought to step in and support the mother if the state fails to do so. It is possible that the state might fail but the society has other powerful institutions like charities. Secondly, responsibility rises if more than one reason can be applied. Take a company that has the means to pay fair wages and provide good working conditions but, due to its focus on maximizing profits, exploits women and hence harms both them and their children. This company is more to blame and needs to shoulder more responsibility than an equally powerful company that makes only moderate profit because it pays fair wages but could do more in respect of better work-life-balance programs for its workers. It is again important to keep in mind that the responsibilities individuals have are attached to their positions within an institution. A politician has the responsibility to make the state and its institutions work in such a way that injustices do not occur or are alleviated; this may happen by trying to increase the working conditions and introduce a minimum wage. As a private person, her responsibilities are different and have more to do with paying a fair wage to her cleaner instead of exploiting her, for instance. Finally, it is possible to construct examples in which arguments speak against our weighting or in which the case is less clear. Such an example would be another very rich neighbor who is powerful but did"

She had found leaving her teenage children, as a single parent, very challenging and found it hard to cope with the level of what she saw as negligence on an overwhelmingly busy maternity unit. It is difï¬cult to know whether the practices she refers to concern professional volunteers making some necessary adjustments to their working practices to meet the needs of the resource-constrained local environment and âmake doâ but without any de-skilling taking place as such, or whether they were simply taking the easy option and losing their sense of professionalism. Our observational research would certainly indicate the former and suggest that there is little risk that staff would not adhere to protocols on their return, although many did not relish a return to the level of bureaucracy and form-ï¬lling associated with the NHS. The following doctor explains how he had to âmake doâ but this represented a conscious and necessary response to the situation and not a preference or indication of laziness: In this country weâre highly specialised and we have to learn how to use a lot of equipment. When people go over there thatâs stripped away and youâre just working with the bare bones. Itâs your responsibility to make do with what youâve got, and thatâs an eye opener for people but I donât think people like to work that way. They like the security of working within the NHS and having skilled people around them. Itâs a lot safer."
2,335,0.993,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"In spite of the blunt admission that competition is altering how schools are run, this teacher concluded that the distinctiveness of the school can be preserved: âThat is exactly what we fear, but I doubt it. The big challenge is to follow the development while at the same time not becoming too similar. I do not really think so because there are certain things that make us uniqueâ (Interview, staff member, nonproï¬t school, Denmark). In Norway, competition between public and nonproï¬t schools is an unfamiliar concept. Families choose nonproï¬t schools primarily because they give them services better suited to their preferences. Interestingly, although some parents expressed discontent with public schools, none used the exit option as a tool for obtaining change at their former public schools. Moreover, headmasters at the schools did not regard the threat of exit as a potential instrument for students to obtain changes. One headmaster at a public school pointed out that they tried to keep their students and would accommodate them to avoid changes, but that it was to a certain degree unavoidable. At the same time, more students enter the school than leave it, as the headmaster observes: âIt is not always we get star students, to speak plainly. Often there is âsomethingâ when you change schoolâ (Interview, site manager, public school, Norway). This suggests that often it is the weaker, more demanding students who change schools, especially when the change is between public schools, since these families do not seek distinctiveness or wish to opt out of public school. Since these students demand many resources, it might not be beneï¬cial for schools to attract them in the ï¬rst place. Information is pivotal for parents to make an active choice when choosing schools and making use of the alternatives they have. Differences in this sense reflect the tradition of school types in the"
124,200,0.993,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"There remains the possibility that for some examples, as with external counterfactuals, the relevant degree of similarity between histories within a tree might take some other form than simple distance in time back to their nearest common moment. One notorious example which appears to be of this type arises if I accidentally leave my coat behind in the cloakroom at the close of a conference session, and return the next day to find it still there.14 Knowing that there were dubious characters in the neighborhood when I left, and that many individuals had access to that cloakroom during my absence, I would reject as false the sentence: If my coat had been stolen, it would have been the most recent person to visit the cloakroom who would have stolen it. No doubt the first really dubious character who came by after I left was likely to take my coat, pre-empting any opportunity that the most recent nefarious visitor might have had. For such an example, it is difficult to say what the relevant sense of similarity between histories might be, but it seems clear nonetheless that no comparison with histories from other worlds is particularly apt. For external counterfactuals, we have a choice: we could base our account on a similarity relation between worlds or on a similarity relation between points of evaluation. For a sentence such as If the match were struck, it would light it might be most appropriate to compare moment/history pairs (without regard to what world they were in) and focus on the ones whose factual conditions were most similar to those at the point of evaluation. On the other hand, for Lewisâs example If kangaroos didnâ² t have tails, they would fall over backwards it might be best to refer to similar worlds, particularly since there are probably no suitably similar moment/history pairs in our world at which kangaroos lack tails, and it would take a very different world to include such situations in a coherent way. The moral of all this rumination about supermodels is that they open up considerable new prospects for exploration and exploitation. We now begin to glimpse the plausibility of supposing, for example, that different kinds of counterfactuals call for different accounts, and we see that supermodels might provide an environment friendly to such fine-grained discriminations. Moreover, it is not unreasonable to suppose something similar might be the case with accounts of causation, particularly if we suppose that counterfactuals play a major role in, or are in some other way closely connected with, an account of causation."
315,291,0.993,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"The cumulative, intercultural, intergenerational and dialogic analysis of these discourses, representations and narratives is undertaken through interpretation by the team as a whole. It draws on what Soulet (2012) calls the realistic imagination, a constrained, collective, interpretative activity. The constraints are those of thoroughness, authenticity, relevance and recognition of subjectivities. This analytical activity is implemented both through a conceptually designed interpretative framework and within a grey area, even a margin of discretion, occupied by the different members of the team. Searching for meaning leads to an intergenerational and intercultural reinterpretation of histories, practices and representations. The research team, fueled by the participants they encountered, reveals new configurations of meaning which provide a different take on the intergenerational relations, transmissions, circulations, exchanges, co-constructions and social relations in which they belong. These hypotheses of meaning can thus be applied to texts which give voice to the actors and to the collective imagination of the research team. Each personâs sociological intuition, colored by his or her language and culture of origin, generation, experience and knowledge, and gender, is called upon in a cumulative emic perspective (PaillÃ© 2012); new accounts are redrawn, written and narrated. The examples below illustrate several possible links which give meaning to multistranded discourse and dialogue. Grandmotherâmother dialogue from the same trio through individual interviews. This dialogue demonstrates the intergenerational circularity of the apprenticeships. From my daughter I learned that each one of us can be patient when we want to be. From my granddaughter I learned that the way we behave depends on the environment in which we grew up (YU4SGM). As I have already said, my mother taught me to be patient, and to respect others. My daughter taught me to be brave and to accept those things that I cannot change (YU4SM)."
139,129,0.993,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"We now turn our attention to solving mathematical problems through computer programming. There are many reasons to choose integration as our first application. Integration is well known already from high school mathematics. Most integrals are not tractable by pen and paper, and a computerized solution approach is both very much simpler and much more powerful â you can essentially treat all integrals a f .x/dx in 10 lines of computer code (!). Integration also demonstrates the difference between exact mathematics by pen and paper and numerical mathematics on a computer. The latter approaches the result of the former without any worries about rounding errors due to finite precision arithmetics in computers (in contrast to differentiation, where such errors prevent us from getting a result as accurate as we desire on the computer). Finally, integration is thought of as a somewhat difficult mathematical concept to grasp, and programming integration should greatly help with the understanding of what integration is and how it works. Not only shall we understand how to use the computer to integrate, but we shall also learn a series of good habits to ensure your computer work is of the highest scientific quality. In particular, we have a strong focus on how to write Matlab code that is free of programming mistakes. Calculating an integral is traditionally done by"

According to development manager Viktor (p17, 33 years) âblat is not so relevant for young people. Many of them do not know, cannot imagine what blat means.â The hesitation of still another of our respondents, a director under 30 years of age, lends support to this: Blat â it is a tough word. If you define it formally â¦ how would you define it formally? (director, p10) Varied opinions were expressed about the existence, nature, and specificity of post-Soviet blat. A director-owner of his own company, aged 50 (CEO, p16) â who thus had his own experiences of Soviet blat â compared blat to âprotection.â A technical director under 30 (p11) saw blat as a Russian version of a universal way of acting that is not inherently immoral. Despite these variations, a common view was that blat still exists in the public sector and big state-owned companies. In particular tenders organized by the state-related actors were considered to be impossible to win without blat, bribes, or both. The founder of a young and small company expressed this explicitly: We [respondentâs firm] probably have not yet reached the level where you participate in tenders, but I know that they are indeed won by those who have acquaintances. If, for example, the five leading firms of my field try as hard as they can, the tender will be won by those with connections anyway. (technical director, p20) Another respondent doing business with state structures refused to answer this question (âconfidentialâ), but the third respondent, working in system integration, confirms the quote above: In fact, in some market segments it [blat] definitely exists. This was particularly visible in system integration which is closely related to the state purchases. It is practically impossible to win a tender without corresponding connections, friends, acquaintances, kinfolk. But this is actually no secret. I am not revealing any secret.

Google Glass integrates the public space of the Internet with the public spaces âin real lifeâ. This implies a rearrangement of the boundaries between the public and the private, and the coming about of a new public spaceâas it happened before because of other media like the newspaper, the radio, and the television. Rather than merely resisting and opposing the negative aspects of this development, we will also need to develop new forms of citizenship and citizenship education. Codes of conduct and etiquette will have to develop, just like they exist already now in current public spaces. This requires, thirdly, new policy-making activities. If the main question remains if we should or should not allow technologies like Google Glass to be introduced in our society, we lose the possibility to address the quality of its social implications. At the same time, a blind and unregulated introduction of this technology in society would throw away the possibility of critical reflection and governance. The central question for policy-making activities is how Google Glass can be embedded in society in good ways. Governance and regulation should focus on the quality of this embedding, rather than on the permission for it. This, inevitably, requires experimentation that makes it possible to find the right balance between openness for change and preservation of what we find valuable. We will need to ask questions like: which information should be disclosed and which not? Which aspects of ourselves belong to the private realm and which do not? And who determines that? Should people have the right to adapt the profile that is connected to their visual appearance? How can the design of Google Glass embody the central values in our society? And how can users be equipped optimally to integrate Google Glass in their daily lives in responsible ways? The real information revolution has yet to begin. The boundaries between human beings and information technologies are blurring ever more rapidly. This requires a normative framework that gives up the idea that we need to control technologies from outside, on the basis of a set of pre-given criteria. Rather, we need to develop ever better ways to understand how information technologies affect us, and to get explicitly get involved in that process, by critically designing, embedding and using information technologies from the perspective of their mediating powers in human existence and our technological society.

Utility agents also seem to forfeit a big part of the advantage with inductionbased systems discussed in Sect. 2.2. That is, that the agent can learn what we want from it. Value learning. The idea of value learning [13] is that the agent learns the utility function u by interacting with the environment. For example, the agent might spend the initial part of its life reading the philosophy literature on ethics, to understand what humans what. Formally, the learning must be based on information contained in the history Ã¦<t . The history is therefore used both to learn about the true utility function, and to evaluate how well the world currently satisfies the inferred utility function. Concrete value learning suggestions include inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) [3, 14, 24, 55, 75] and apprenticeship learning [1]. Bostrom [9, 10] also suggests some interesting alternatives for value learning, but they are less concrete than IRL and apprenticeship learning. Concerns have been raised that value learning agents may be incentivised to learn the âwrong thingâ by modifying their percepts. Suggested solutions include indifference [5, 6] and belief consistency [16]."

More than two centuries have passed and one would be barely justified to claim freedom, equality and brotherhood among twenty-first century citizens. The millennium hype that the emergence of information technologies would serve to close economic, educational, democratic, digital, and social gaps on our planet was not confirmed (Laouris and Laouri 2008). Alvin Tofflerâs (Toffler and Toffler 1995) transition to the Information Age, defined as the point when âprogress depends more on the mind than on the muscle,â happened long time ago, but people still work either a lot more than 8 h a day or they remain hopelessly unemployed. Likewise, Marxâs dream for a stateless, classless society he called communism, where everyone can have what he or she needs, disappeared with the Berlin Wall. Our digital futures challenge not only concepts such as human/technology relationships, presence, friendship, responsibility, agency, liability and capability, but also basic concepts of our existence such as freedom, equality, mortality (see next section) and even purpose. What does it mean to be free, or to be equal in the digital era? Achieving true freedom and equality are enormous challenges that unless addressed within the context of the 2020 horizon, our world will have no future.

The professor can be convinced that the student gave her the iPad to express gratitude, and not to cash in any improper advantage later. She would be wise, however, to take into account not only what she takes to be the reality of the case, but also how it may reasonably appear to relevant others. Her reputation amongst students may suffer significantly if the iPad story reaches them, and this gives her a good reason not to keep it. ECONOMY: Is it in accordance with business objectives? The inclusion on economy as one of the dimensions to take into consideration in ethical analysis raises eyebrows. Why is the question concerning business objectives addressed at all, when the topic of the day is moral dilemmas? It seems that economy and ethics belong to different spheres, and that profitability is not an issue to bring up in the ethical training in organizations. Many of the most significant moral dilemmas do involve the balancing of economic considerations with other dimensions of the situation. As noted earlier, the choice under a given set of circumstances can be between going economically bankrupt or bankrupt with regard to identity. There may be legal and profitable options available, which are at odds with the basic values a company traditionally has stood for. By choosing such an option, the company in a significant sense ceases to be the unit it has been. It may keep its name and address, but the break with one or more core values means that the identity is different now. A transformation has taken place. With regard to Ben and his options in the reference dilemma, he can have short term as well as long term economical concerns. In the short term, results may improve if he keeps his lips tight about the employeeâs involvement in social conflicts. The working environment will probably respond with relief, and gain new energy with the removal of the cause of so much frustration. In the long term, however, this risky enterprise may backfire on the unit as a whole, and disrupt its ability to perform profitably. The economic dimension of a moral dilemma, then, warrants a consideration of short term and long terms benefits. ETHICS: Can it be justified? This question invites a consideration of the alternatives in the light of ethical theories and principles from earlier chapters. The decision maker can compare and analyse the available options from a utilitarian or a duty ethics perspective, and by applying the principle of equality and the principle of publicity.

245,1255,0.993,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"Our analysis suggests that the university experience is shaped by multiple layers of interacting context (Palmer and Marra 2008). Within UCCâs setting, it would appear that, on the part of the student, there may be obstacles to happily achieving a new student identity, occasioning entry into âstuck placesâ. There may also be a form of âmimicryâ where thinking and acting are tacit or ritualised. In all cases, discursive, integrative and reconstitutive transitions or âchange of skinsâ characterise the learning process (Nin 1971, p. 26). The university experience is shifting, affective, embodied and emotional. Transforming student epistemologies, liberating students from that in which they were embedded, âmaking what was subject into objectâ so that they can âhave itâ, rather than âbe hadâ by it, is according to Kegan âthe most powerful way I know to conceptualise the growth of mindâ (Kegan 1994). Undergraduate and post graduate students in our study acknowledged that their university experience was discursive, integrative and reconstitutive: âGreat learning experienceâ; âOpened your mindâ; âAllowed them to make more informed decisions about the futureâ; âDifferent person at the end of collegeâ; âIncreased overall conï¬denceâ; âPreparation for the futureâ; âAlways stand to youâ (UCC Student 2009). Here, education is recognised as representing more than academic and professional outcomes. There is an openness to the nature of the student experience and the potential meaning making which weaves epistemological, intrapersonal and interpersonal threads. Further, learning is about âentrance into â¦a community of people who share that way of thinking and practisingâ (Davies, 2006 in Meyer and Land 2006, p. 71). A fourth year female student told us: âThere is a large community of academic people in this university all with the common interest of furthering our learning in our chosen ï¬eld. It is a very reassuring notion that you are surrounded by many like minded people with the same objective as you.â"

Despite its merits, the account has two limitations. On the one hand, what one ought to achieve is often not what she can do in a single choice or action, but in a series of choices or actions. On the other hand, we may take a current choice to dominate another not because the immediate outcomes ensured by the former have higher value than those ensured by the latter. It may be because, when we look further into the future possibilities, the former opens a series of actions leading to future outcomes that have higher values than those to which the latter may lead us. This is what brought Horty to his theory in Horty (2001) of strategic ought with a single agent. There are nevertheless some problems when Horty approaches his notions of strategic acts and strategic oughts, one of which is related to the notion of independence concerning choices for different agents at different moments. The problems are not really in the theories of strategies developed by Belnap and Horty, but in their applications or relations to other theories. We may then proceed safely to expand their theories of strategies, and discuss the problems in some other place. This section and the following two expand Belnapâs theory of strategies to the extent that we can talk about what different groups may do in the same strategy field. In doing so, we restrict ourselves to âprimary strategiesâ, as Belnap calls them, or âirredundant strategiesâ, as Horty calls them. Notions and most terms are inherited"
46,14,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"letâs assume with Brighouse that in such a tragic world there is a reliable correlation between the degree of dreariness in childhood and the level of flourishing in adulthood. Would we really judge parents who impose enormous amounts of dreariness on their children compared to those who allow moments of enjoyment, even knowing that it affects the childâs future negatively, as the better ones? We agree that the answer to this question is not an obvious one; there is the strong intuition that the well-being of children seems to matter for its own sake, independently of its contribution to life as an adult. It is simply a good thing that a child lives a flourishing life, exercising and developing her capacities (Macleod 2010). Accordingly, we assume, in line with most theorists in the field, that childhood is intrinsically valuable and that children as the subjects of moral concern have a right to a good life. Second, the childâs condition, which includes a particular vulnerability, immaturity and dependency on others, makes her well-being an especially salient normative category. Children cannot be held responsible for their life choices as adults can, and therefore any harm to their well-being is particularly problematic from a moral point of view. Hence, a society that does not manage to sustain a certain level of well-being for its children cannot be a just one. This does not mean, of course, that the well-being of children is the only thing that matters for justice. The childâs future as an autonomous and thriving citizen â her becoming â is of importance as well, as is the well-being and well-becoming of all other members of society. However, since it often gets completely neglected in theories of justice, we want to stress clearly the importance that the wellbeing of children, qua children, should have for normative reasoning. Third, a comprehensive understanding of childrenâs lives must include a multitude of information. It just is not enough to know, for example, the economic situation of a child or her family in order to judge if she is indeed well off. There is more to disadvantage than can be expressed in monetary terms. In many approaches to the measurement of child poverty, this insight is well established. There, the well-being of children is judged in different dimensions, which are also set into relation with each other. When looking at the lives of children explicitly from a normative perspective, such a multidimensional approach is also requested. This is the case for the following reasons: First, if philosophy wants to develop an understanding of justice that is applicable in the real world and its non-ideal circumstances, it must work with a realistic picture of well-being. It should reflect our intuitive judgments about the subject and allow plausible assessments of the social position of an individual (Wolff and de-Shalit 2007, 21). It is obvious that different"

378,172,0.993,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"born in 2009, continued economic progress will mean that over the course of their lives, they can expect to consume thirty-eight times more material goods than their grandparentsâ (Asia Society 2012). Since 2010, the WEFâs Global Risk Reports have, however, put water and food supply crises and rising greenhouse gas emissions among the top ten global risks of the next ten years. So while Chinese kids might keep on amassing ï¬nancial capital, they could never transform it into 38 times more material goods. Meanwhile, applying an exchange value or costâbeneï¬t lens in all relations does affect human value judgments and our willingness to help, relate and feel connected to others and nature. One of the ongoing examples here is the cooptation of the idea of a âSharing Economyâ by capitalist players. What started with the idea that people would make their use value items available to others (couchsurï¬ng) has been pulled into the logics of exchange value. The mind-set of âwhat could I give to others to enjoyâor enjoy with them jointlyâ is transformed into a ï¬nancialized mind-set of âwhat can I get money for from others that I did not think of before now.â The enabling technologies might be the same but the intent and purpose behind these social innovations is completely differentâas will be the relations emerging from it. I therefore side with Heyman and Ariely who suggest âthat compensations for employment and effort should be considered separately for social and monetary markets and that the level and type of compensation should be designed to ï¬t the deï¬ned relationshipâ (Heyman/Ariely 2004: 793). In conclusion we see how a blind emphasis on exchange value in mainstream accounting tools and standards has helped a situation to emerge in which the ï¬nancial sector does not serve the real economy anymore, but rules it. It does that at a tremendously high cost to societies and sustainability. Of course, one might argue that people wishing to exert power and undercut societal agreements do so without taking the detour into mainstream economic thinking and models. But when it comes to rationalizing oneâs decisions, arguing them to the public and creating narratives in which particular interests seem compatible with an image of public beneï¬t and good, they have performed a great service. Also, the reflexive ontology presented in Chap. 2 has shown that biasing frames and selective interpretations of situations are an unavoidable aspect of human existence. They can be a conscious act of strategic framing or tactical misrepresentation of information. But when it comes to understanding the effect of paradigms and their shifting we talk about much deeper sociocultural transformations. Elinor Ostrom in her 2009 Nobel Prize lecture highlights how theâof courseâ purely economic Homo economicus saga has impacted the design of institutions across the board: Designing institutions to force entirely self-interested individuals to achieve better outcomes has been the major goal posited by policy analysts for much of the past half century. Extensive empirical research leads me to argue that instead, a core goal of public policy should be to facilitate the development of institutions that bring out the best in humans (Ostrom 2009: 435)."

In academic accounts, this type of thinking is routinely classiï¬ed as technological determinism; overstating technology and understating agency (Croteau and Hoynes 2012, 290). Yet, social and political manifestos like Andersâ and Manderâs are not academic studies, and their most interesting characteristic is not where they can be placed on a simple dichotomy. Instead, it is interesting how they eclectically draw on a variety of concerns and observations in order to explain why media are bad. In addition to his overarching concern that democracy is under threat, Mander sees television to destroy mental and physical health, based on stories about viewers who have turned âsick, crazy, mesmerizedâ (157), he discusses television inability to convey art and culture (272â273) and laments the loss of community: âThe extended family is gone and neighbourhood community gatherings are increasingly the exception to the ruleâ (254). Mander himself was no fan of McLuhan; he felt that McLuhanâs thinking âdid not help us very much,â calling his terminology âtalk show patterâ and âwordplayâ which âbecame the basis of hundreds of conferences and thousands of cocktail party debatesâ (30)."

A vision should be judged by the clarity of its values, not the clarity of its implementation path. Holding to the vision and being flexible about the path is often the only way to find the path. 3. Responsible vision must acknowledge, but not be crushed by, the physical constraints of the real world. 4. It is critical for visions to be shared because only shared visions can be responsible. 5. Vision must be flexible and evolving. This chapter represents a step in the ongoing process of creating a shared vision of the future of science. It lays out a personal vision of the kind of science I would really want to see in the future and why this new vision of science would be an improvement over what we now have. The paper itself is an attempt to share that vision, without getting bogged down in speculation about how the vision might be achieved or impediments to itâs achievement. Hopefully, the ideas presented here will generate a dialogue culminating in a shared vision of the future of science that can motivate movement in the direction of the vision."

This could lead to a masking of still-gendered practices, but it could also contribute to a degendering on a symbolic level when such gendered practices were interpreted as an expression of individual preferences. Yet when work and care are distributed according to individual preferences, they are also often regendered again because of habits, distribution of skills or feelings of gender. Individualistic explanations of gendered choices may be seen both as an unaware reproduction of structures and as producing new understandings that gradually also affect practice. Degendering and regendering may also take place in different areas, such as a regendering of aesthetic imaginaries running in parallel to a degendering of most other areas in life. Across the generations it emerges that positive attitudes to gender equality understood as equal treatment and equal possibilities are for the women in all three generations closely linked to higher education and often also to encouragement from their mothers to get an education, in addition to experiences of injustice in their lives. For the men in our study the link to education is not as clear. Here a positive identification with the mother, the division of work in their own marriages and whether they have daughters seem to be more crucial. Gender equality is not as pressing an issue for men as it is for women; they go along with it if needed or if they see their interests in it. However, as we have seen, practice has in itself a transformative potential: the more men participate in childcare and household tasks, the more skills they gain and the more they tend to enjoy it. Helene Aarsethâs longitudinal study of families sharing a gender-equality project indicates a dynamic process: it may start as a morally driven project about equality and justice, but eventually develops into a project of joint engagement and individual desireâand in this process the different tasks that are undertaken in the family are also increasingly degendered (Aarseth 2009b; see also Plantin et al. 2003). Aarsethâs point is that real change happens only when the project has moved from being an external demand to being an internally driven project that feels emotionally meaningful to the participants. This point echoes Raymond Williamsâ words that âthe absolute test by which revolution can be distinguished, is the change in the form of activity of a society, in its deepest structure of relationships and feelingsâ (Williams 1977: 420). However, it"
385,689,0.993,Advanced R,"To understand Râs performance, it helps to think about R as both a language and as an implementation of that language. The R-language is abstract: it deï¬nes what R code means and how it should work. The implementation is concrete: it reads R code and computes a result. The most popular implementation is the one from r-project.org (http://rproject.org). Iâll call that implementation GNU-R to distinguish it from R-language, and from the other implementations Iâll discuss later in the chapter. The distinction between R-language and GNU-R is a bit murky because the R-language is not formally deï¬ned. While there is the R language deï¬nition (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html), it is informal and incomplete. The R-language is mostly deï¬ned in terms of how GNU-R works. This is in contrast to other languages, like C++ (http://isocpp.org/std/the-standard) and javascript (http: //www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm), that make a clear distinction between language and implementation by laying out formal speciï¬cations that describe in minute detail how every aspect of the language should work. Nevertheless, the distinction between R-language and GNU-R is still useful: poor performance due to the language is hard to ï¬x without breaking existing code; ï¬xing poor performance due to the implementation is easier. In Section 16.3, I discuss some of the ways in which the design of the Rlanguage imposes fundamental constraints on Râs speed. In Section 16.4, I discuss why GNU-R is currently far from the theoretical maximum, and why improvements in performance happen so slowly. While itâs hard to know exactly how much faster a better implementation could be, a >10x improvement in speed seems achievable. In Section 16.5, I discuss some of the promising new implementations of R, and describe one important technique they use to make R code run faster. Beyond performance limitations due to design and implementation, it has to be said that a lot of R code is slow simply because itâs poorly written. Few R users have any formal training in programming or software development. Fewer still write R code for a living. Most people use R to understand data: itâs more important to get an answer quickly than to develop a system that will work in a wide variety of situations. This means that itâs relatively easy to make most R code much faster, as weâll see in the following chapters."
46,55,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"natural primary good and hence not subject to social distribution â are now seen by many political philosophers as highly influenceable by social factors. Health justice is a blooming research field, and we agree that the evidence that great injustices are happening in this regard is overwhelming. These few considerations illustrate that a variety of functionings and capabilities are socially influenceable. Certainly, they are not distributable, as are money and other material goods, and in individual cases people will not be able to achieve them even with good institutions in place. However, a society can still provide the general framework for a just distribution, and it can do its best in order that its institutional design secures, at least to a very high degree, that every child can actually enjoy the functionings in question. (4) The concept of justice demands that the functionings taken as the basis for the respective evaluations are, at least to some extent, objectively determinable and not merely subjective. They should not depend primarily on the assessments, experiences and evaluations of the subjects in question. In other words, what is important is not mainly that someone feels or thinks that she suffers from an injustice but that there are good external and intersubjectively comprehensible reasons that an injustice is happening. This set of criteria is relevant both for children and adults and connects to the arguments capability scholars usually bring forward to criticize subjective metrics of justice as defended, for example, by utilitarians. The subjectâs preferences are malleable and adapt to the circumstances it is used to, introducing distortions in its perception and evaluation of the situation. Claims of justice must therefore be aware of this danger and take these âadaptive preferencesâ seriously. In the case of children, this aspect is of particular relevance and must not get neglected. For such reasons, happiness is not a good guide for justice for children, and it seems more suitable to take mental health as an indicator (Cabezas, Graf and Schweiger 2014). Furthermore, objectively determinable functionings allow comparing the well-being of children in a meaningful way, and they make changes and improvements traceable and perceivable by other members of society. Such information is indispensable for a concept of justice that can guide the design of institutions and policies. It needs âhardâ and accessible criteria for the evaluation of personal advantage. If not, measures for (re)distributing functionings and capabilities cannot be justified toward others, and it is unlikely that they are supported by the public. Objective measurability also limits"

Fieldwork research has in the past sometimes been treated as an art form rather than a method, something that cannot be taught. While we do think it involves a certain amount of learning by doing, we do not want it to be approached as an occult pursuit. We expect this book to be especially useful for junior scholars, such as PhD researchers or researchers exploring the topic of authoritarianism for the first time, but we aspire to speak to senior scholars as well. Even if the recent reflective turn in qualitative methods comes too late for you to be âtrainedâ in them, it is never too late to explicitly reflect on the merits and drawbacks of oneâs approach to field research, and our work can serve as a source of comparison in this respect. The first four chapters of this book will also be valuable to academics who (aim to) spend time in the authoritarian field but whose research does not revolve around authoritarianism. Social scientists who study agricultural or trade policy, forest management, gender, or religion in authoritarian contexts are likely at some point to find themselves confronted with the sensitivities of the authoritarian state. Even beyond the social sciences, scholars of archeology, climate change, or epidemiology who are in the authoritarian field will need to have some engagement with local policymakers, and will profit from having a social awareness of the context in which they find themselves. Researchers may find themselves caught in politics, even though they never intended to investigate the political aspects of a given topic. We can think, for instance, of a linguist studying the Tamazight languages of North Africa, who suddenly finds that her extensive contact with the people who speak it is a source of suspicion to the authorities, or a biologist who is interested in the fish population in the Yangtze river and discovers that the disappearance of certain species due to pollution is a politically sensitive topic. Chapters 5 and 6, which deal with mental impact and with anonymization of sources respectively, will be of interest to other categories of scholars. Academics who work with vulnerable groups in society, such as drug users, sex workers, or undocumented migrants, or with groups that engage in illegal or controversial behaviors, such as criminal gangs or racist movements, may be confronted with the negative mental impact of living through traumatic incidents or hearing hard stories. The same may be true for scholars who investigate the repressive or secretive aspects of democratic states, such as the practices of secret services, anti-terrorist policies, or counterinsurgency training. Scholarship on all these topics also faces"
147,4,0.993,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"This description of bushwhacking is the Australian version of trailblazing, and metaphorically, entrepreneurs can also be trailblazersâmake a path through new or unsettled terrain upon which others may follow. That is, rather than follow the established path created by others, entrepreneurs often challenge the status quo by attempting to chart a new direction through the creation of new products, services, and/ or processes. However, this book is not about trailblazing in coastal reserves or in product markets but about trailblazing in the field of entrepreneurship. We believe that scholars can be trailblazers, and in doing so, they can create new knowledge that others can build on to create additional knowledge and inform practice. Although this trailblazing may not have to deal with the poisonous snakes and spiders of Australia, it certainly has its fair share of obstacles, requires considerable effort, and may also lead to dead ends. Along with the challenges of creating a new trail are the intrinsic rewards from the process and the extrinsic rewards from the outcomes of making substantial contributions to knowledge. For scholars traveling along a well-worn path or a semi-worn path, the research outcomes are replication and incremental research, whereas trailblazing creates new knowledge through more radical ideas. Important in trailblazing is knowing where to start and having some knowledge about the terrain to be covered, the tools to help clear the path, and the potential âgemsâ that might be encountered along the way. The purpose of this book is to provide some insights into where trailblazing may be best directed, how, and with what potential outcomes. Specifically, this book offers a series of frameworks from which or within which we believe important research will emergeâresearch that will have a substantial impact on our understanding of an entrepreneurial phenomenon and, thus, on the way we progress with subsequent entrepreneurship research. We emphasize trailblazing (as opposed to taking existing paths) because we strongly believe that the future of the entrepreneurship field is promising but only if our research itself continues to be entrepreneurial. That being said, continuing to be entrepreneurial in our research may be more difficult than it initially appears. The success we have had thus far may lead us into a competency trap (Levitt & March, 1988) that rewards us in the short term but is detrimental to the field in the long term. That is, entrepreneurship researchers sometimes decide to âplay it safe,â using âacceptedâ theories and methods to answer progressively narrower research questions"
56,196,0.993,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"does not make sense to talk of individual economic decision-making. Rather, it is the new economics of labour migration (NELM) approach which has primacy. In this theoretical paradigm pioneered by Oded Stark and colleagues, retirement implies the end of the migration project and subsequent return home to rejoin children, who take on the responsibility for the household (Stark 1991). For some hostel residents, retirement means that there is less of an obligation to send remittances: Now itâs up to them to get by. (Fouad, 60s, Constantine, Algeria) The other children can manage for themselves. Itâs normal. (Mehdi, 64, Chlef, Algeria) Iâm going to rest and enjoy my retirement: my kids will do the work.

46,157,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"The fact of being close to the child, the fact that the child is attached to her parents, which is essential to the childâs development, constitutes another strong ground for responsibility. Children depend on having caregivers and being parented â whether by their biological parents or a different person â and it has been shown that continuity of care matters heavily. Parents and caregivers have thus a responsibility solely based on the relation they have to these children, a relation that cannot be broken without causing serious harm. So to our existing list of four grounds on which an agent can be held responsible, we add a new one: the relation of a child being attached to this agent and depending on her to continue to care and take on some responsibility. The different grounds for attributing responsibility have produced different variations of understanding responsibility. In the liability model it is closely tied to causing an injustice; the social connection model attributes responsibility on other grounds, but it is unclear what this means exactly. Does responsibility of an agent of justice imply that she is to blame? Does it imply that she has the duty to act, a duty that can be enforced by others (primary agents of justice)? How is responsibility tied to autonomy and choice, hence the ability to do something different, and how is it related to knowledge and the ability to know about the result of oneâs actions, participating in a web of social relations that are structurally unjust? And what do we want to do with these five grounds? Can they help us rank agents of justice and their responsibilities, for instance? Answering these questions is our aim in what follows. An agent of justice is, so we suggest, responsible if any of the five criteria discussed above can be applied, with two refinements. On the one hand we need to consider knowledge; that is, what an agent of justice has known or could have known with reasonable effort about the results of her actions or the structural injustices she helps to create. The grounds presented by Young, which we also endorse, suggest that not knowing does not mean no responsibilities exist, though it can reduce the responsibility one has. On the other hand we need to put more weight on choice and if an agent might have acted differently or did act differently in the future. The ability to act differently in the past, that is, in creation of an injustice, is important. Nevertheless, the possibility on the part of the agent to alter her actions now and in the future, undoing the injustice or at least helping something change for the better, counts as well. It seems that agents are completely free of responsibilities only if two things can be shown: First, if they did not participate in any actions that led to an injustice or helped create or sustain a structurally unjust"
123,164,0.993,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"challenged. Humeâs farmers appear to have stopped dancing, and ended up in a toxic deadlock. In a system of holding back, the situation is initially one where farmer A thinks that âI will not offer to help him get the corn into the barn today, because he is not willing to help me tomorrowâ and farmer B thinks that âI will not seek help from him to get the corn into the barn today, because he will not trust me to help him tomorrowâ. Assumptions about what other people are willing to do may be false. The more cemented relation that Hume describes may be what lies ahead if the system of holding back continues without opposition. Initially, false assumptions about a lack of willingness to help may gradually become true, as the relation deteriorates. We can distinguish between fluid systems of holding back, where it might not take much effort to expose false assumptions about the otherâs lack of readiness to help, and a fixed system of holding back, where it has actually become true that the two individuals are not willing to seek or provide help to each other. It is possible to imagine how Humeâs farmers have been neighbors for a long time, and that there was potential for seeking, asking for, and providing help at the early stage. Thirty or so years later, the lack of initiative from any of them to cancel out the system of holding back has created a standstill where both are losers. Time is also a feature in many instances of coping adequately with fallibility at work. If colleague A has spotted that B colleague has misunderstood a routine or adopted a bad habit, the longer A waits to tell B, the more awkward the situation is likely to become. We can imagine that B has misunderstood a particular written form they are using at work, and fills it in wrongly every time. A or other colleagues have adopted a habit of fixing the mistakes B makes, but nobody has taken an initiative to show him how the form is supposed to be filled in. If A picks a moment two years after these practices have been established to explain to B how it is really done, there are two things he or she will have to convey to B: (i) You have misunderstood the form, and filled it in wrongly, and (ii) I have known for 2 years without interfering and telling you. The thought of how awkward it will be to explain (ii) can contribute to more holding back from A and other colleagues in"
137,124,0.993,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"The third profile reveals fathers who before taking leave were already regularly involved in housework and childcare. Rather than âhelpersâ, they see themselves as âsharersâ of housework and âinvolvedâ fathers. âHome aloneâ leave is therefore tied more closely to core issues of autonomy and innovation. The period of leave brings little in the way of the new learning of basic tasks (âI already knew how to do thatâ, âI didnât need a parachuteâ), but it is experienced as a final step towards becoming an independent caregiver to whom all tasks may be delegated as well as an opportunity to be creative, by building up an individualized profile of fathering. This may explain why the seven men in the innovation and independence profile experienced leave as a period of intense activity in which they engage in a large variety of tasks and become fully involved caregivers. As a couple we are quite egalitarian. It was total sharing with the baby (â¦), I didnât breastfeed thatâs all. During that month everything went well, I already knew how to do everything, even if I was slightly unsure to begin with. In fact, I would have liked to stay longer, because itâs a phase in the childâs development in which interaction makes a difference, it increases and becomes more gratifying every day. Being on leave alone also makes for more complicity with the child, so it gives both parents a chance to develop their special place. In my view, it doesnât take away anything from the mother but it adds to the fatherâs role (Raul, 37, TV journalist, 2 children)."

Each ventriloquizes some of the scientific figures who feature in their analysis of the emergence of the field of resting state fMRI; at times, one completes the slide that the other has started out presenting. Itâs perhaps difficult, if you didnât know either of them, to discern who is the social scientist, and who the neuroscientist. Then itâs time for questions. Someone in the front raises her hand, looks from one to the other with a somewhat baffled expression, and says, âWhich way does it go between you two?â She looks at Felicity. âI mean, do you study him?â She looks at Felicityâs collaborator. âOr ... ?â"

The question âwhen is death?â finds a particularly nuanced response in two of Shakespeareâs plays: Hamlet and King Lear. Both tragedies are invested not only in death, but in the process of becoming dead, and do so through their male protagonists. I have suggested that the phrase âYouâre deadâ seems paradoxical, and we hear an equivalent one on the Renaissance stage: Hamlet, thou art slain. No medâcine in the world can do thee good.

In Pypeâs study on Kinshasa, these hidden forces invade new technologies; Eriksen and Rio show that objects from Africa can suddenly become central to horror stories in Port Vila; for Thomas Strong witches in Papua New Guinea evoke jealousy because of their âordered modernity.â For Koen Stroeken such volatility seems to be a deplorable effect of modern changesâlike the impact of Pentecostal missionary zealâdestroying fine-grained distinctions ordering local society. In my experience, this diffuseness and chameleonic capacities are rather given with basic trends in the discourse on occult powers. The central concern in many âwitchcraftâ discourses with dramatic, nightly confrontations place a premium on novel borrowings that can surprise adversaries. Hence their basically unstable and shifting character and a basic ambiguity on what is good and evil: the nganga as a healer can always be suspected to turn into a witch. The idea that the same power that can heal can also kill, returns in a wide range of settings. Or, to be more concrete, nganga may be healers for their clients, but the witch they attack will claim to be an innocent victim of healers who are themselves witches. Such shifts are also crucial in the interaction of these ideas with Pentecostalism. To these preachers the âtraditional healerâ is, of course, a witchâno doubt about thatâbut this certainty is constantly being undermined by the basic ambiguity of local ideas. As many of the Ghanaian and Nigerian video-films, deeply marked by the Pentecostal message, highlight: the treason may be insideâthe most fervent crusader can turn out to be a source of evil (Meyer 2015). It is the shifting character of these imaginaries, marked by deep ambiguities and uncertainties, that make them so resilient despite deep changes. All this to argue that Knut Myhreâs plea for allowing âvernacular actions to act on our [academic] practices and our representational powersâ is highly sympathetic but raises also serious dilemmas. It certainly raises enticing perspectives: it is vital not to lose touch with peopleâs ways of seeing things or to try to reduce these to another, more ârealâ reality. But it raises also a basic dilemma for us academics. One of the first principles of academia is that we must create clarity, working as much as we can with unequivocal notions. But how to deal then with forms of knowledge that get their power precisely from their un-clarity and their ambiguity? How can we avoid that our efforts to create clarity abscond the very power we are trying to understand? Taussigâs solution"
62,536,0.993,"Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming: 17th International Conference, XP 2016, Edinburgh, UK, May 24-27, 2016, Proceedings (Volume 251.0)","3.2 Stereotype Threat and Unconscious Bias Stereotype threat describes the experience of any group who suï¬er from negative sterâ eotypes. In the case of women in technology (and also men in the caring professions, as just one other example), these negative stereotypes manifest as a general assumption that they will not have the skills they need to succeed. Such damaging ideas put people under threat, because they constantly feel they have to disprove them. There is a large body of research which supports the statements I will make in this section. Several examples are referred to in the excellent book Delusions of Gender by Cordelia Fine [4], and I will quote some of them here. For instance, research shows that womenâs ability to perform is hampered by their anxiety about negative stereotypes. Instead of being able to concentrate on diï¬cult tasks, a signiï¬cant proportion of their mental concentration is taken up by trying to quell their fears about their potential lack of ability [5]. My own experience bears this out. I have described in this paper how, after a few years in the profession, I found myself in a job where my requests to do more interâ esting work were denied. There was always a part of me which believed I was less capable than my male peers, and that it was therefore quite reasonable for those requests to be denied. I decided that I would be better off looking for success in other areas of my life â my family and my hobbies â and that I would accept that my job was simply something whose purpose was to pay the bills, rather than something I could expect to excel at or enjoy. Another problem is that the more successful a woman becomes in a male-dominated profession, the more she will be aï¬ected by stereotype threat. This is for several reasons: The more she moves up the ladder, the more of a minority she will ï¬nd herself in. This will make her more anxious about other peopleâs assumptions, but will also encourage her to believe â by sheer force of statistics â that those assumptions are true. âOne study found that the more men there are taking a mathematics test in the same room as a solo woman, the lower womenâs performance becomesâ [6]. The problem is not that girls are inherently less good at technology, or even that theyâre less interested; it is that people expect less of them. For instance, some men and women were given a diï¬cult mathematics test. Before they started, they were told that it was designed to better understand what makes some people better at mathematics than others. A control group were told the same thing, but were also told that thousands of students had been tested and no gender diï¬erence had ever been found. In all groups, the average score for men was 19 %. In the ï¬rst group, women also averaged 19 %. But in the second group, women averaged 30 %. Even though gender was not explicitly mentioned to the ï¬rst group, it did not need to be. They could make that connection for themselves, and their performance was aï¬ected. But once that stereotype threat was removed, the potential of the women appeared to be unlocked [7]. As well as stereotype threat, another important phenomenon is âunconscious biasâ. This is eï¬ectively the technical term for what I have referred to in this paper as an âinner voiceâ. It refers to the automatic connections that most of us make, for instance between women and the arts, and between men and technology."

In his view it is not the money itself that makes it svart or not, but the amount and the context, which he illustrates by how it is carried around. A wallet belongs to an individual and there is not a lot of space in it. A briefcase, on the other hand, points to a more public environment. The briefcase can contain much more than the wallet and is usually carried around in professional settings. Larger amounts from informal transactions turn the operation into a business, a main activity that provides a livelihood. Anders did not say if the work he did for the pizzerias was with or without an invoice; just that he was paid in cash. Working too much svart professionally is not acceptable to him. As Anders explains, then you have to have a svart lÃ¥da, literally a black box, somewhere in the firm. A black box makes for a separate economy, where informal incomes and informal expenses are kept. In these instances, there can be talk of an informal economy within a firm, which is separate from the public book-keeping and audits (BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2010, 2013). Although he received snuff money, a large box was something Anders did not seem to want. But he knew very well how such a set-up would work. Andersâs latter explanations underscore the importance of taking a holistic view when we try to understand non-compliance. It is important to recall that reciprocal explanations are part of a larger reasoning. Although reciprocity can be borne in mind in oneâs understanding of how tax money is spent, there is also a simultaneous limit on how much can be justified in withholding tax that ought to be paid."

In this case a woodpecker has been trained to whisk eggs using its powerful head movements. Qualitative analysis of the results of this ï¬rst pilot study showed some very interesting principles were involved in combining concepts. First, there was evidence for instantiation of superordinate categories to basic level categoriesâbirds became woodpeckers, fruit bananas, and furniture couches. Second, people would align properties and functions between the two concepts. The example given here shows how the need to ï¬nd a function for a kitchen utensil is met by ï¬nding a behavior of a particular bird that can serve the function of a particular utensil. Third, there was evidence for simulation processes, in line with Barsalouâs suggestions about the role of concepts in achieving goals (Barsalou 1991). Commentary provided by the creator of the woodpecker whisk pointed out that it would not need electrical power (good for camping trips) but would on the other hand be unhygienic. The use of simulation takes the speciï¬cation of the combined concept and develops it in totally non-compositional directions, as the new concept is adapted to real world knowledge. Finally, many solutions identiï¬ed conflicting properties in the newly combined concept, and offered new emergent features to resolve them. For example, when a participant solved âA fruit that is also a kind of furnitureâ by proposing a banana couch, they went on to specify that the banana had been modiï¬ed to grow very large and to ripen very slowly. Extensional accounts of meaning focus on the sets of exemplars in the world. As such they can have nothing to say about concepts which have no members. (The problem of empty and ï¬ctional names is well known, Braun 2005). Thus when we think about counter-factual or hypothetical objects, the extension has to be taken to refer not to the actual world but to a virtual or âpossibleâ world. Computer teacups do not currently exist, but it is possible to imagine an alternative world in which they do, and we can speculate about their properties. In fact this process of conceptual combination may be a key factor in innovation and creativity. In a recent paper (Gibbert et al. 2012) my colleagues and I investigated creativity in the forming of concepts of hybrid productsâartifacts that serve more than one traditional function. In direct agreement with the processes postulated by the Composite Prototype Model we showed how ï¬rst attempts to imagine (say) a pillow that was also a telephone would simply aggregate the features of the two concepts into a composite. However when the two concepts being combined were sufï¬ciently dissimilar, then a second attempt at combining the concepts would generate integrative solutions in which features of one concept would be aligned with those of the other to provide emergent functionality. The telephone could be programmed to provide gentle sounds to help people get to sleep, or the pillow could gently move to alert the user that a phone call was arriving. A less kind proposal was that the pillow would allow one to nap while listening to oneâs mother on the phone. When people were able to generate integrative solutions, these were consistently judged to be more likely to succeed as marketable products."

In response to the beneficiaryâs call for help, the initiator will launch the protest. As a matter of fact, all the protests we studied derive from a social tie between the beneficiary and one or several citizens. The initiator is not chosen randomly â he or she is a person whom the beneficiary can trust and expect help from. We observe that the social tie between the beneficiary and the initiator is âweakâ, rather than âstrongâ (Granovetter 1983). The migrantsâ strong ties, that is, their close and affective relationships, generally prove less helpful in improving their situation since they often lack the knowledge of migration policies or the tools (e.g., influential network) to initiate support activities. Consequently, the beneficiary turns towards acquaintances they feel can help them, making an instrumental use of their weak ties to members of the established civil society. Even though there is no close or affective bond between them at that moment, the beneficiaryâs situation will trigger feelings of compassion and indignation in the initiator (Goodwin et al. 2004, 422) and encourage them to act, as one beneficiary says: [She] was my sonâs teacher. When I explained the situation to her, she got angry. She said: âBut how can that be? How does that work? This isnât true, this isnât possible!â Afterwards it is [she] who helped me a lot. She made things move. (Personal interview, beneficiary CH2_1, Switzerland, July 21, 2015; translation from French by the authors)"

We are not adding skills to context (as the COM-B model implies): context lies at the heart of complex ï¬uid and, oftentimes confounding knowledge combinations. Or, as McCormack puts it: ânothing exists and can be understood in isolation from its contextâ (2015: 3009). On the basis of our research and learning, we would argue that far from a skills deï¬cit we are in a situation of knowledge saturation; clinical skills/ information are not the primary problem and using clinical âexpertsâ as conduits for yet more skills-forcing interventions is neither efï¬cient nor effective. To the contrary, it is both arrogant and wasteful. This arrogance does not derive solely (although this certainly does contribute) to the imposition of âexpert informationâ from the global North: from wellmeaning but narrow thinking foreign clinical experts and âdonorsâ. It is the consequence of a failure to see the bigger picture â of narrowing disciplinary knowledge paradigms. Although the lack of patient management is recognised as an issue by all UK clinicians working in Uganda: it was a visiting Ugandan obstetrician who proposed the initiative to introduce the African Maternal Early Warning Score (AMEWS) into Mulago Hospital. Enthralled by its apparent success in the UK (visiting foreigners are often not exposed to or fail to see the fundamental weaknesses of UK systems) she quite understandably attempted a âpolicy transferâ approach: she âsawâ a clinical solution to a clinical problem and tried to transfer it. And as a project we sought to support her in this without comprehending the localised knowledge that would ultimately render it unsuccessful. Knowledge can be both enabling and disabling; it is not only a deï¬cit of skills/knowledge that hampers progress; narrow siloed knowledge (focused on harvesting facts) can limit our ability to see the social world and the truth that lies behind interventions. Resistance to change may be fuelled by knowledge and often quite entrepreneurial tacit localised knowledge. From an individual perspective â how to make ends meet and sustain your family â or, from a systems perspective â how to organise and funnel the rewards from systemic forms of corruption â requires a level of localised tacit knowledge and rational/entrepreneurial decision making that foreign volunteers may fail to âseeâ. The overall conclusion of this book, based on intense multi-method action-oriented research over a period of 8 years, is that international development initiatives in the form of Health Partnerships and through"

This is a dilemma, of course. The Formula of Humanity could enable criminals to argue that their sense of purpose and self-worth are being violated through, for instance, punishment. However, this is not at all in line with Kantâs spirit. In order to explain Kantâs response to the criminal, Kantâs distinction between the noumenal and the phenomenal world is important.

He/she could appoint a proxy to act in his name, if he becomes incompetent because of the disease. For an action to be autonomous it needs freedom from constraints and ability to comprehend its situation. âPeopleâs actions are rarely, if ever fully autonomousâ [1], however they should have a fairly good knowledge of the modality of treatment or research, its side effects along with its presumed advantages, in order to give an informed consent. The Role of the Family In Asia, Africa, and the Middle East the family plays a major role in medical decisions. The patient whether he is elderly or a young person, has to listen to the opinion of his close family to the mode of treatment he/she is going to accept. In some places in Africa, the elders of the tribe, will decide in serious matter of life and death. The Western attitude of individualism it is not accepted in many societies. In most countries of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East there is no health insurance for the public at large. Usually the family bears the burden of any cost of medical intervention. Similarly there is no welfare state, and hence the breadwinner takes care of the elderly, the children, and ladies. Though females and children may be working at home, and in the ï¬eld, or looking after the cattle and sheep of the family, they are usually not the breadwinners. The role of the family and close friends should be respected in places where they have different philosophies and cultures that differ greatly from Western liberal, individualistic patterns. Even in the West itself, different minorities, e.g., Chinese, Indians, Pakistanis, etc., the role of the family should be respected, as the patients themselves agree to this role, and health providers have to understand that there are different cultures that do not give priority to autonomy, as it is understood in the West. Advice and Waiver Sometimes that patient will say to his doctor: âWhat is your advice in my condition? What would you do if your parent was in my situation? The physician may feel embarrassed, but he/she should be honest and give the sincere advice [5]. The matter may be more complicated when the patient relegates the decision making to the doctor saying: âLook I have trust in you, and whatever you decide I will accept.â The physician should be tactful and try to explain the situation and give information to the patient and/or his family, and reach with them the course to be taken. As far as he can make it, the physician should explain that the decision should be in the hands of the patient (plus his family). He might help by giving all the required data, and even may give his personal advice. In cases where the patient does not want to know the diagnosis, the physician should discuss the condition fully with the family, and let them try to persuade the patient, at least to take part in the decision-making."
139,61,0.993,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"1.5.7 Error Messages and Warnings All programmers experience error messages, and usually to a large extent during the early learning process. Sometimes error messages are understandable, sometimes they are not. Anyway, it is important to get used to them. One idea is to start with a program that initially is working, and then deliberately introduce errors in it, one by one. (But remember to take a copy of the original working code!) For each error, you try to run the program to see what Matlabâs response is. Then you know what the problem is and understand what the error message is about. This will greatly help you when you get a similar error message or warning later. Very often, you will experience that there are errors in the program you have written. This is normal, but frustrating in the beginning. You then have to find the problem, try to fix it, and then run the program again. Typically, you fix one error just to experience that another error is waiting around the corner. However, after some time you start to avoid the most common beginnerâs errors, and things run more smoothly. The process of finding and fixing errors, called debugging, is very important to learn. There are different ways of doing it too. A special program (debugger) may be used to help you check (and do) different things in the program you need to fix. A simpler procedure, that often brings you a long way, is to print information to the screen from different places in the program. First of all, this is something you should do (several times) during program development anyway, so that things get checked as you go along. However, if the final program still ends up with error messages, you may save a copy of it, and do some testing on the copy. Useful testing may then be to remove, e.g., the latter half of the program (by inserting comment signs %), and insert print commands at clever places to see what is the case. When the first half looks ok, insert parts of what was removed and repeat the process with the new code. Using simple numbers and doing this in parallel with hand calculations on a piece of paper (for comparison) is often a very good idea. Matlab also offers means to detect and handle errors by the program itself! The programmer must then foresee (when writing the code) that there is a potential for error at some particular point. If, for example, some user of the program is asked (by the running program) to provide a number, and intends to give the number 5, but instead writes the word five, the program could run into trouble. A try-catch construction may be used by the programmer to check for such errors and act appropriately (see Sect. 6.2 for an example), avoiding a program crash. This procedure of trying an action and then recovering from trouble, if necessary, is referred to as exception handling and is the modern way of dealing with errors in a program. When a program finally runs without error messages, it might be tempting to think that Ah . . . , I am finished!. But no! Then comes program testing, you need to verify that the program does the computations as planned. This is almost an art and may take more time than to develop the program, but the program is useless unless you have much evidence showing that the computations are correct. Also, having a set of (automatic) tests saves huge amounts of time when you further develop the program."

The rare opportunities to acquire resources and funds to make a better living, for example, through work and labor, are limited, and there are very good reasons to ban children from working and laboring, not to speak of such illegal and evidently harmful ways as begging and stealing. In certain cases, it is better for children to leave their families and homes and live on their own (if they are old enough) or in other forms of care arrangements, but in general it is widely acknowledged that this is not good for either their well-being or well-becoming (Lawrence, Carlson and Egeland 2006). The vulnerability and powerlessness of children reflect, thus, two dimensions of the specific moral and political status children can and should have due to the nature of their being. On the one hand, as we have argued so far, powerlessness increases and creates certain vulnerabilities in children; it is also socially created to an extent. On the other hand, to hold children powerless in some areas is not only permissible but an entitlement of justice and morality that children should be granted. It is important to note the crucial difference between children and women and other powerless subjugated social groups in large parts of this world. Being held powerless certainly does not protect women; they are oppressed, and justifications applied to children, like inferior competence and vulnerability, do not apply to women or minority groups (Nussbaum 2000). Most theorists concerned with justice for children acknowledge that these vulnerabilities, together with their potential to develop into autonomous beings, constitute a particular ânatureâ of children that grants them a different moral and political status (Archard and Macleod 2002; Brennan and Noggle 2007). It is also at this point, where the capability approach has been criticized for not being suitable as a normative theory for children. As Colin Macleod argues, the notion of capabilities is closely tied to an âagency assumptionâ, one that presupposes that the subject in question is able to make autonomous decisions. And since children â especially younger ones â miss this feature, the capability approach has problems to integrate them into his conceptual framework (Macleod 2010). We will argue later on that this problem is solvable and that the concepts of evolving capabilities and achieved functionings are of great value here. But before we do this, let us explore more deeply the question of autonomy and development, how children are âspecialâ and that it is very important to distinguish between different groups of them: Children are a very heterogeneous group, more so than a group of adults, when it comes to significant differences.

With one-third of the cases without creative outcomes there seems to be a potential for creativity in more cases, as well as for a higher level of creativity in the cases with very minor or more moderate creative outcomes. To explain and understand these ï¬ndings we need to know more about the process and other factors that affect creativity.

137,126,0.993,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Fathers in the last innovation and deconstruction pattern closely follow the experiences described in the previous profile, but they are more reflexive with regard to the impact of leave on gender roles. The father values becoming a fully independent caregiver and house-person but he also regards the period of leave on his own as a fertile ground for building gender equality. In fact, part of the challenge was to demonstrate to themselves and others that they were capable of expertly combining all these aspects of a âhomeparentâ rather than just caring for a baby during the day. From this perspective the father sees himself as an âegalitarianâ partner who is âat the heart of the familyâ as his wife is. Moving beyond the activities involved in the efficient promotion of work-family balance, the five men in this profile also seek to âtest themselves outâ by embarking on tasks regarded as more difficult, such as having meals ready on schedule, having people in to eat, or planning a heavier task load. They also become more reflexive with regard to gender relations, questioning all differences between men and women which are held to be natural and reflecting on different strategies to build up gender equality in family life. This profile not only strengthens autonomy and bonds but also enables the period of leave to be viewed as a time when parents are able to deal explicitly with âin-builtâ cultural norms. An additional impact underlined by these fathers is the emergence of feelings of competition between fathering and mothering, with the need for some negotiation of when and how each parent spends time with the child and how caregiving is carried I really had to âroll up my sleevesâ. I looked after the baby, but I also did all the housework and made a point of having supper ready on time. So the main advantage of this is that it puts men and women on a par, itâs equates menâs role to the role that was always the womanâs. So itâs a way of understanding the traditional tasks and worries that belonged to women, itâs a new experience from this point of view, it really is! (Samuel, 29, nurse, 1 child). I became more involved in all the daily decisions, for example, giving my opinion on what we should do with the baby. This produced another point of conflict between Sally and me, or rather, something which we have to keep discussing and work out. (Frederico, 35, designer, 1 child)."
163,137,0.993,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"concLusion Following Mary Douglasâs initial concerns about human solidarity being created by exchanging, it is valid to ask whether such solidarity is possible in Sweden with the current tax law in place. If BÃ¶rje is right about that people have always exchanged, to change peopleâs behaviour is not that easy for the state, especially if they have to pay more dearly for it. But as we have seen, the Agency has actually succeeded in implementing a simplified tax system while also concealing issues that are difficult to legitimize. Most importantly they aim to treat people equitably. This increases reciprocity. Like most other people in the world Swedes continuously exchange. Yet direct exchanges between people keep the state outside the deal. Such exchanges are justifiable among the Limningers as long as they are not too organized or happen too often, do not have too much value, are not performed by professionals in their working time or by a complete stranger. When Limningers talk about cash payments for informal purchases, it is the small and almost negligible amounts that are acceptable; aspects of unacceptability appear in the size of the deal, the type of recompense and the organizational form. The Limningers know about the law, but donât pay too much attention to it if certain conditions are in place. The acceptable purchase of svart arbete is private and hidden, but set against a public reference to what constitutes economic activities. For example, bartering, in the sense of keeping money out of the deal, makes the direct exchanges more acceptable. Yet even if money is sometimes used, there are many ways to justify this, for example by invoking a closer relationship. Settling the exchange with money makes the links to market and state more pertinent, and the svart deal becomes more explicitly an act of cheating. Therefore, even cash-settled deals are often referred to as barters in order to create a reverse disentanglement, away from the formal market and closer to the realm of social exchange. The Agency seems to go along with thisâunless provoked, as it was with Svenâs, the employee expert, test of limits before an exchange was recognized as taxable. What he tested was how close the relationship between exchangers can be and how small a value the exchange can amount to. In this case the Agency read the law to the letter, but it mostly let such exchanges pass. As seen above, it knows that there is a myriad of exchanges that ought to be subject to tax assessment according to a strict interpretation of the law. For various reasons these exchanges should not be subject to tax: they are not publicly spoken about, as it would be seen as an intrusion into peopleâs everyday lives; these exchanges create and"

56,141,0.993,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"That this coming-and-going at retirement is motivated at least in part by healthcare provision in France is a narrative upon which everyone I interviewed was in agreement â healthcare professionals, hostel managers, union delegates, immigration lawyers, civil servants, migrantsâ associations, embassy officials, and of course residents themselves. I did not hear one dissenting voice during 2 years of fieldwork. The overarching narrative is that the men are in France when they are sick and in need of treatment, and then when they are well enough they return home to be with their families and to benefit from the emotional support that the family offers. This narrative can be summed up in the chapterâs title â âHome/Sickâ â a formulation which tries to encapsulate this back-and-forth health strategy. Before continuing, two disclaimers are in order. Firstly, as noted, many hostel residents were very ready to talk about general healthcare needs as a rationale in their return and residence decisions. However, there was an overall reticence to discuss specific health problems in detail. This reticence means that the balance of testimony here is slightly weighted towards the voices of healthcare professionals. This applied to all health issues, but particularly mental health. Saleem, the leader of the Residentsâ Committee in his hostel, put it in these words: As for me, I'm going to try in the future to propose to the management that from time to time â and it's not easy â to have someone who comes here, as a psychiatrist, to discuss things with people. But it's not easy (â¦) everyone has a secret, for any person his problems are his secrets, he doesn't want everyone to know that he â¦ he has problems (Saleem, 60, Tiznit, Morocco)."

In this final section we focus on some emerging green shoots of hope that need to be nurtured if we are to make progress in opening more opportunity gates and closing the gaps that emerge along the developmental trajectory. We begin with the prevention of unwanted pregnancies and children who begin life with a parent who is not yet prepared.

To have achieved this, the value-laden issue needs to be deï¬ned, then the context of the technological problem conveyed, then the problem consulted. The results of the consultation can then be analyzed by the researchers and translated back into its implications for discussions of technology use. This process needs to sufï¬ciently convey the context of the discussion, and be appropriately deï¬ned (if the issue is too abstract in terms of value, for example if people were asked to discuss political values each endorses, this would likely not work any better than asking them to talk about the appropriate thickness of waste containers). The method of consultation devised here takes the form of a group interview. During August 2014 to February 2015, 18 people were interviewed in various groups, each session lasting around 90 min. Participants were asked to relax and to discuss freely âwhat you think is a desirable means of âdisposalâ of high level radioactive wasteâ without worrying about present technical limitations. A less than 5 min explanation of what high level radioactive waste is, what it looks like, how much radioactivity it holds and how long that lasts, how much of it Japan has, and its present designation was given at certain timings using the ï¬gures shown (Fig. 1). One important characteristic of these interviews was that the targeted age group of the participants was limited to âyoungâ people, set as being between 16 (a high school freshman) to 34â35. This target was meant as a current attempt of listening to the âfuture generationâ."

Recognition, however, was also given to the technical issues such as: âSome problems with Etherpad on the iGoogle pageâwould be better if it sized down. Also the Binocs brokeâ. The question: âWere you able to find learning resources that relate to your topic (s) of interest during the first workshop activity?â also invited a variety of responses.

Iâm guessing one is API driven, one is custom Google search? could they be combined?â. Remaining responses affirmed that the participants were, generally, happy using the ROLE widgets, for example: âYes, I searched for 6lowpan and found some relevant videos and slidesâ and âI tried one topic relevant to my institution.

There was also overall positive response to the question: âWere you able to find suitable widgets for building your PLE during the second workshop activity?â once again, however, the participants did not hesitate to record their actual experiences of installing widgets or not, for example: âThe ones I did find looked useful but didnât add to iGoogle (there was an error)â. Another participant also remarked: âI think so, but Iâd need to think about how Iâd integrate it with my other tools (like Evernote, Twitter, Google calendar)â demonstrating that as a developer or educational technologist that they were giving some thought to the application as well as implementation of the ROLE widgets."
46,11,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"consider very useful and rich for evaluating child poverty, quite naturally leads to a focus on developed countries with functioning democracies and institutions which, despite all their problems and weaknesses, (still) provide a solid social structure for large parts of their citizenry, especially if they are compared to states where almost no infrastructure and only minimal state support is available. Most philosophers in the field developed their theories in regard to such contexts, and many discussions still relate to nation states and âinternalâ distributions of goods, isolated from relationships between countries. We agree that it is important to extend these theories to the domain of global justice and world poverty, and attempts to do so have substantially enriched the theoretical landscape in the last years. In the last chapter, we will therefore briefly address some of the additional questions arising in relation to evaluating extreme forms of child poverty in the developing world. Our book is located within a certain approach of normative reasoning and thinking about poverty: namely, the capability approach and its most influential representatives, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. The capability approach has many advocates and certainly also many critics, and we neither hope nor aim to defend it against all of them. Our goal in this book is to apply the approach to a specific topic. Therefore, we will not be able to scrutinize it on a general and fundamental level; we leave these intellectual battles to others. Still, we will say much about the capability approach, how it should be applied to children and what additional value it brings for the analysis and critique of child poverty. As a consequence, we will bring forward several arguments that speak in favor of the approach in general and support many of its assumptions. The capability approach seems a good starting point for our examination, not only because it can provide the normative underpinnings for our goals but also because it is widely used in a variety of academic disciplines as well as policymaking. When it comes to academia, it is extensively discussed, developed, applied and criticized not only in philosophy but also in economics, social policy, political science and development studies, which confirms its interdisciplinary usefulness. A no less influential document than the Human Development Report, which is published annually by the United Nations and monitors human development on a global level, explicitly draws on the capability approach, even if some have questioned how accurately the report represents its theoretical and normative background (Pogge 2002). On the national level, too, governments are interested in the approach and apply it for diverse purposes; the reports on poverty and wealth in Germany (Arndt and Volkert 2006) and the reports of the United Kingdomâs National"

As this happens, our wit and creativity in regard to life is once again stimulated, developing a movement for change that has already crossed over the chaos the materialistic focus, allowing us to let go of that while concentrating on life. The human spirit follows natural patterns between relaxation and stress, as we have seen in our medical research into heart rate variability. But our economy only follows the single pattern of relaxation and has no mechanism for stress other than its own collapse. To compensate for this, a dual economic system needs to be put in place, one of both transaction (relaxation) and transformation (stress), representing continuous interaction within a community that can keep it alive and progressive. The next comparison shows how the human body works and how the economy could work in the same manner."

In reality it is somewhere between very hard and impossible. We often do not know what the most responsible moment is until that moment is long gone. That has often happened to me. I defer a decision to a later moment, because I feel that it would be irresponsible to decide now. At that later moment, I realize that I missed the opportune moment. This happens much more often than I care for.

294,74,0.993,Programming For Computations - Python : a Gentle introduction To Numerical Simulations With Python (Volume 15.0),"you try to run the program to see what Pythonâs response is. Then you know what the problem is and understand what the error message is about. This will greatly help you when you get a similar error message or warning later. Very often, you will experience that there are errors in the program you have written. This is normal, but frustrating in the beginning. You then have to find the problem, try to fix it, and then run the program again. Typically, you fix one error just to experience that another error is waiting around the corner. However, after some time you start to avoid the most common beginnerâs errors, and things run more smoothly. The process of finding and fixing errors, called debugging, is very important to learn. There are different ways of doing it too. A special program (debugger) may be used to help you check (and do) different things in the program you need to fix. A simpler procedure, that often brings you a long way, is to print information to the screen from different places in the program. First of all, this is something you should do (several times) during program development anyway, so that things get checked as you go along. However, if the final program still ends up with error messages, you may save a copy of it, and do some testing on the copy. Useful testing may then be to remove, e.g., the latter half of the program (by inserting comment signs #), and insert print commands at clever places to see what is the case. When the first half looks ok, insert parts of what was removed and repeat the process with the new code. Using simple numbers and doing this in parallel with hand calculations on a piece of paper (for comparison) is often a very good idea. Python also offers means to detect and handle errors by the program itself! The programmer must then foresee (when writing the code) that there is a potential for error at some particular point. If, for example, some user of the program is asked (by the running program) to provide a number, and intends to give the number 5, but instead writes the word five, the program could run into trouble. A try-exception construction may be used by the programmer to check for such errors and act appropriately (see Chapter 6.2 for an example), avoiding a program crash. This procedure of trying an action and then recovering from trouble, if necessary, is referred to as exception handling and is the modern way of dealing with errors in a program. When a program finally runs without error messages, it might be tempting to think that Ah. . . , I am finished!. But no! Then comes program testing, you need to verify that the program does the computations as planned. This is almost an art and may take more time than to develop the program, but the program is useless unless you have much evidence showing that the computations are correct. Also, having a set of (automatic) tests saves huge amounts of time when you further develop the program. Verification versus validation"

In âtraditional history teachingâ, teachers will represent the past in a way that is determined by some kind of ideology, usually of nationalist origin, but it could also be MarxistâLeninist as in the case of Soviet history teaching. Maintaining the image of a valuable in-group by way of a celebratory past from the perspective of a certain group does not allow presenting alternative narratives on an equal footing to the self-serving version. This style of teaching is clearly propagandistic: favouring a selfserving version of history at the expense of alternative views with the aims of influencing the studentsâ future action. In contrast, if involved in critical history teaching, the teacher will employ contents that contest national myths and deconstruct celebratory narratives. A critical and multiperspective approach to history motivates students to consider alternatives to their own views, which may have been or are currently dominant with an adversary or even inimical groups or countries. This approach proceeds by offering complementary historical interpretations, weighing their evidence and accepting them as possible alternatives to the studentsâ âindigenousâ perspective. This involves critical self-reflection as well as learning to respect alternatives to oneâs own position. The goal of communication is raising an emancipatory and tolerant consciousness of othersâ life worlds, rights and values. Such communication style does not defend a specific historical interpretation, but offers several side by side. In some respects, this approach reminds of the term of âdiffusionâ.1 âPropagandaâ and âdisseminationâ can be seen as two opposite ends of a continuum. we conceive âpropagationâ as the intermediate space between the two poles (fig. 2). Spanning a range of possible teaching approaches, âpropagationâ can be seen both as a milder form of propaganda and as a more standpoint-based (or âbiasedâ) version of dissemination. It can appear as critical identity work such as when offering support to the student identity building together with critical reflection on narratives traditionally used by the studentsâ in-group. However, it can also appear in a form much closer to propaganda, if an in-group-serving selection is made from academically adequate knowledge. This kind of âpropagationâ would not be pure âpropagandaâ, as the chosen accounts themselves would not be knowingly distorted. But it would be closer to âpropagandaâ than to"

Another area where the framework of FF is helpful is in spelling out the different possible meanings of the much discussed expression âcould have done otherwiseâ in the free will literature (pp. 255â270). Belnap at al. show how certain puzzles in the literature concerning the relation of moral responsibility to the ability to do otherwise can be illuminated by distinguishing these different meanings of the ability to do otherwise. Their framework also helps to clarify and formalize the important distinction between so-called âsoft factsâ and âhard factsâ about the past, a distinction that plays a role in many debates about free will and determinism, but is not always carefully defined (pp. 145â174). In these ways and in others, philosophers who deal with the theory of action and free will in more informal ways have much to learn from the formal framework developed by Belnap at al. in this book."

In relation to the question: âWere you able to find suitable widgets for building your PLE during the second workshop activity?â there was almost unanimous response in the second workshop alluding to the intermittent internet issues that appeared to plague the entire session. One quote, perhaps, sums up the frustration that most participants felt dominated, their experiences: âInternet connection issues did not let us perform this activityâ. Nonetheless, 90 % of the same participants responded positively to the next question: âDid you find the workshop activities useful for your research needs and goals?â which can be summarised by one remark: âI found it an interesting approach to be tested in the futureâ. One respondent did, however, offer a rather more circumspect response: âI do not know. I have to check those pages more when I come homeâ. Opinions from both the workshopsâ attendees about widget-based PLEs were, in general terms, evenly spread. One notable exception, however, was the response from workshop 2: âI would find interacting with a PLE requires a lot of my mental effortâ. Nonetheless, the respondents overwhelmingly recorded that they were neutral in their feelings about this statement for the second workshop. Research students in the first workshop appeared to be more discerning in their learning and, as noted by the ROLE presenter, the majority of the students appeared to focus on the Binocs widget rather than the ObjectSpot widget.

Hood 2006). This seems to range from trying to avoid consequences from evaluations (especially with regard to the ranking exercise) to outright plagiarism in order to meet research requirements (or indeed improve oneâs status). The irony is that the evaluations may reinforce the very gaming behaviour they are meant to address.

This is an experience member of both sides share. Mutually listening to life stories brings about empathy and furthers trust and recognition of the âotherâ. whereas Bar-Onâs approach is influenced by psychoanalytical thinking, experimental social psychological research has also underscored the positive effects of empathy and described perspective taking exactly as what has taken place in Bar-Onâs groups, namely to âincrease the perception that a common humanity and destiny is shared with the other groupâ (Brown and Hewstone 2005:293). Biographical storytelling is just a means to make people ready for what Pettigrew has defined as âself-disclosureâ: to open oneself to others (Pettigrew 1998). Biographical storytelling stands at the beginning of Bar-Onâs projects, accompanies them at each phase and paves the way for the proper historical and pedagogical work on the teaching material. Bar-On has called this approach TRT (= To Reflect and Trust) (Bar-On et al. 2000). The TRT concept is not easily applicable because it presupposes the involvement of psychologically trained moderators, prolongs the groupâs work and claims from the participants to bring in their own personality, to present their personal experiences to persons who are regarded as enemies by the majority of oneâs own society. Usually, its application is restricted to small groups, and it is mostly used by NGO-driven projects. It can hardly be applied in official expert commissions. Besides Bar-Onâs special approach, w. fisher and others have formed a more general theory of narrative communication as a counter-model to binary argumentative logic (fisher 1984). The storiesâ coherence and the sincerity of the narration and the narrator create confidence and allow the listeners to relate themselves to the experiences of the âotherâ. whereas the biographical approach strives to generate empathy and positive feelings within a project from the very beginning and to take out politics as long as possible, J. Rothman (1997) has developed a contrasting model of dialogical identity conflict resolution containing four phases. It starts expressly with a confrontational âantagonism phaseâ during which participants exchange their conflicting political views. when participants come to the conclusion that a continuation of the political debate would not produce any common results, they are asked to rationally define their own positions and interests, to compare them with the ones of the adversary and so develop step by step an understanding of possible common goals and to work on solutions.

A general metarule asserts that for every step , Î± â¢ Î² we have a step , (Ï â Î±) â¢ (Ï â Î²). (This analysis is extraordinarily close to Fregeâs explanation of making and discharging assumptions, though it was given over 800 years before Frege. But as Peter noted at the meeting, Ibn SÄ±ÌnaÌ and Frege had different motivations. In fact Ibn SÄ±ÌnaÌ wanted to understand the real intentions of the person giving the proof, whereas Frege aimed through Begriffsschrift to display the true âlogical weavingâ of informal proofs that begin âLet . . .â [6, pp. 379ff].) Ibn SÄ±ÌnaÌâs position is in effect a claim about what kind of contentful argument is expressed by the natural deduction rules. So itâs directly relevant to how we can read the proof rule of â-introduction as carrying information about the meaning of â. The discussion so far has used only natural deduction proof rules. It would be possible to give a semantics using â¢ as a primitive notion, so that for example we define â§ by (Ï â§ Ï) â¢ Ï, (Ï â§ Ï) â¢ Ï, Ï, Ï â¢ (Ï â§ Ï). (There are well-known variants of this definition.) The difficulty with taking â¢ as primitive is that until we have a definition of â¢, there is going to be no purchase for transfer arguments. In particular we wonât be able even to raise the question whether (8) gives the same information as a truth table for â§, frankly because until â¢ is explained, we donât know what information (8) is giving us. One last point: some kinds of semantics refer to the semantic value of an expression as the âdenotationâ of the expression. This is just a name, no more. It certainly doesnât entail that the semantics treats expressions as proper names of their semantic values. To single out some kinds of semantics as âdenotationalâ is like singling out the semantics that are written in Turkish; the classification is pointless."

46,42,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"For children, however, functioning may be made the goal in many areas. Thus I have defended compulsory education, compulsory health care, and other aspects of compulsory functioning. (For example, I support an age of consent for sexual intercourse, so that childrenâs bodily integrity is protected whether they like it or not.) Compulsory functioning is justified both by the childâs cognitive immaturity and by the importance of such functioning in enabling adult capabilities. (Nussbaum 2006, 172) Where does that leave us in the question of the right currency of justice for children? The restriction of childrenâs autonomy is, as we see, not only a reaction to their limited competencies and skills but also justified by the need to protect them, their development and their future life chances (Noggle 2002; Archard 2003). It is hence a part of justice for children, and giving children too much autonomy over their lives too early would expose them to great risks. It is very likely that these children, once they have grown up, would make serious accusations and blame their parents and the state for having let them down by allowing them to quit school at the age of seven, by not getting healthy food because they preferred junk-food or by not going to the dentist and subsequently having serious health issues. Children cannot use capabilities in the way adults can, and they do not gain the same amount of value from having a choice when they are very young. A toddler does not have an increase in real freedom and does not see the value in being presented with many potentially valuable options â her needs are more focused. The risk of overburdening children by letting them decide is also to be considered. We see good arguments that claim that functionings, instead of capabilities, are to be preferred, but over the course of childhood and as children develop into more and more autonomous beings, capabilities become more important and finally take over. The developmental perspective of Nussbaum is only one important aspect, and the issue of autonomy and being protected as a child matter equally. We"
223,354,0.993,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"As John Dewey (1934/2005) observed âthe first great consideration is that life goes on in an environment; not merely in it but because of it, through interaction with itâ (p. 12, italics in original). It is puzzling that although organizational scholars may agree with him, they have not agreed on how social and physical space interact. Researchers who consider it problematic that âmost previous research assumes that spatial orderings of things and people are merely part of the backgroundâ (Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007, p. 207) have been exploring space in organizations from different angles. Some authors are very critical of the passive role assigned to space: âTo picture space as a âframeâ or container with no other purpose than to preserve what has been put in it is an error displaying traces of Cartesian philosophyâ (Kornberger & Clegg, 2004, p. 1101). However, there is a risk that analysts attempting to redress the balance sometimes attribute such great powers to space as to anthropomorphize it and thereby relegate its inhabitants to the status of pawns of masterbuilders (e.g., Kornberger & Clegg, 2004). Our contention is that a clear conceptualization of the relationship between physical and social space is critical for understanding the actions people undertake in their present setting and envisage for the future.

In the paper we argue that the understanding of an object (physical or non-physical) is greatly enhanced by the ability to measure that object. Indeed, Lord Kelvin suggested, over 100 years ago that : : : when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be."
117,376,0.993,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"an adequate way to address ethical issues including the ones that refer to caring practices. But critical considerations are also expressed. Erlen argues that nurses who only discuss issues with other nurses might be limited in their focus. Perspectives given by other healthcare workers could challenge the analysis of the conflict and broaden the enquiry. âAlthough all nurses do not hold the same exact philosophy of nursing, there is a greater likelihood that there will be less divergence of perspectives and fewer alternatives presented when an ethics committee is comprised almost entirely of nursesâ (Erlen 1997, p. 59). NECs might encourage division rather than collaboration with other disciplines (Fleming 1997, p. 8). The clinical ethicist, Mary Faith Marshall points out, that ânurses can be their best enemies, â¦ a democratic process should be learnt â¦ (and a) change in practices of local multi-disciplinary committees need to be supported by everyoneâ (Kohlen 2009, p. 157). A closer look reveals that the question could be raised whether the functions of Nursing Ethics Committees are often the responsibility of other committees within the healthcare organizations. Moreover, while some nursing concerns are unique to nursing, most raise broader questions about human well-being that might be better addressed by the institution and the healthcare system at large (Taylor 1997, p. 69). A restricted discussion of these concerns to NECs may end up in their becoming trivialized or even marginalized. And, a separate nursing committee might communicate the image to the institution that these concerns are of lesser importance than those addressed by an interdisciplinary committee. What happens if the committee actually serves to make nurses grow stronger in articulating their thoughts and put their issues of concern on the agenda? Haddad tells her piece of the story in an interview: It created problems over the years because they stood up, collectively, you know, so you got now five people on the unit, and they are not only five people, they are five experienced people because usually people that volunteer for this had been there a while. And now we are going through years of running the committee, and learning a language and all that. Then you got five people who were saying, we are not going to put up with this. They started to present problems (and there came a new director). She was"

Today, we see activists campaigning against âkillerâ military robots that donât yet exist, partly on the grounds that machines should never be empowered to make life-and-death decisions [31, 35]. Itâs not outside the realm of possibility to think that the same precautionary backlash wonât happen to the autonomous car industry, if industry doesnât appear to be taking ethics seriously. The larger challenge, though, isnât just about thinking through ethical dilemmas. Itâs also about setting accurate expectations with users and the general public who might ï¬nd themselves surprised in bad ways by autonomous cars; and expectations matter for market acceptance and adoption. Whatever answer to an ethical dilemma that industry might lean towards will not be satisfying to everyone. Ethics and expectations are challenges common to all automotive manufacturers and tier-one suppliers who want to play in this emerging ï¬eld, not just particular companies. Automated cars promise great beneï¬ts and unintended effects that are difï¬cult to predict, and the technology is coming either way. Change is inescapable and not necessarily a bad thing in itself. But major disruptions and new harms should be anticipated and avoided where possible. That is the role of ethics in innovation policy: it can pave the way for a better future while enabling beneï¬cial technologies. Without looking at ethics, we are driving with one eye closed.

A shortcoming of this concept of tolerance, however, is that those who supposedly propose it retain the right to decide who they exercise their tolerance on; they do not lose the power that allows them to be tolerant. As Hage (1998: 85â86) notes, âWhen those who are intolerant are asked to be tolerant, their power to be tolerant is not taken away from them. ... the advocacy of tolerance left people empowered to be intolerantâ. Recognition of the interdependence between the receiving society and the migrants could be a step forward from a temporary self-interested âtoleranceâ. Nonetheless, Costa Rican society is far from being in a condition to recognize how much it depends on those it does not accept. The recognition of interdependence is, in de Sousa Santosâ terms, a structuring gap in the Migration Law. In other words, that which is not there tends to shape the part that is. In this regard, the migratory legislation expresses values rooted in the social imaginary, such that trying to change it is not merely a legal issue, although that dimension is very important, but relates to a plane that is more ideological. The absence of the notion of interdependence also refers to the underdevelopment of the possible narrative or genres from which to represent interdependence. It is symptomatic that in Costa Rica, despite the frequency of references to immigration, only two novels have been published on this theme (Marcenaro 2007; Paniagua 2010), even though novels are possibly the cultural form that best reveals the social reality of a period (Bakhtin 1981; Williams 1977; Mora 2000). Nor is there major participation in the public debate about immigration by the first generation of the children of immigrants. They should be among those best prepared to be aware of the centrality of interdependence. In a context in which the ratio of paid jobs undertaken by women is higher than the proportion of reproductive work done by men at home, a good number of Costa Rican women recognize that without the paid domestic work frequently done by Nicaraguan women, their participation in the job market would be impossible. In a certain way, paid domestic work done by Nicaraguan women has made gender inequalities less explicit in Costa Rican society. However, such recognition does not translate into publicly shared narratives that can frame social imaginaries and policy-making on immigration in terms of interdependence. In such a context, the ways in which Nica-"

One often has an idea of what one would like to achieve on a particular operation, but there has been no theoretical framework to enable a link to the problem at issue. One approach is to create specific theoretical terms to facilitate analysis of military operations. However, it might also be of value to do what is often done in academic circles, to apply a fresh, untested line of thinking to the material under study. This is the approach that will be adopted in this text, albeit only purely tentatively. This shows that it is far from impossible for terms to be given value without even the definitions of the term itself being defined, it is like a casino where the stakes are being thought over and the winner defines the content of what was at stake. A more reasonable approach is, of course, to define what is being discussed before proceeding with a power struggle over the same subject of discussion. A theoretical perspective will now be presented that gives an alternative perspective to military planning, or it will at least provide an understanding of how an operations area can be analysed using theory. It is worth stressing that this does not necessarily mean presenting a theory that will lead to new practices on the field. Rather it so happens that much of what is advocated by the theory actually already occurs on the field. The problem is that the practices being examined here have hitherto lacked any form of explanatory foundation, other than that proven experience has shown that they work well. If the practices are given a theoretical explanation this may illuminate how current practice can be further developed. Therein lies the benefit of a theory that can be applied to the practices under discussion here. I emphasise this point here, but believe it to be so important that you will find it repeated throughout the text: theories are used mainly to generate issues of interest that will be played out empirically. Theories are not primarily used to provide answers to questions. If the latter were the case empirical research would not be necessary, theory alone would suffice to explain reality. This is an unempirical process that should be avoided. Only in exceptional cases where there is a lack of empirical foundation can one generalise using an empirical approach, and assume that a situation will play out in a certain way. Nonetheless, theory is important in empirical research, as it helps us structure the reality which empirical data consists of. Military intervention in an area where armed conflict is taking place is, to say the least, a risky undertaking. There is a mass of information that"

A personal openness is also needed to challenge the status quo, look for viable alternatives, and get community members enmeshed in a dialogue in order to replace old thinking patterns with new ones (Dhanaraj and Khanna 2011). Pushing beyond the status quo requires a deeper understanding of the rationales baked into each worldviewâa form of cultural competence that reads the similarities, differences, and compatibilities in order to craft something ânewâ that will both be of collective value to Kenyaâs international technology sector and benefit the venture. We have found three mindsets that do exactly that. They incubate novelties that have the potential, if widely adopted, to push Kenyaâs tech space to the next levelâa unique Kenyan form of technology entrepreneurship that works and leads to high-level exits that benefit all.

Joyce is frustrated with Ceciliaâs constant reminders take her children to the Netherlands, feeling that Cecilia does not understand the hardship she is going through in the Netherlands. This lack of comprehension between the two women is augmented by the fact that Cecilia does not inform the migrant of the material resources that she puts into the care of the children whereby Joyce does not seem to fully realize the difficulties she is under and the fact that her remittances are not enough. This small, yet very significant difference in the two womenâs care networks helped to identify a discrepancy in how they perceive who is providing the material care for Ama and her four siblings and allowed us to investigate this more deeply, getting at some of the aspects explaining why this TCRA seems to be fraught with incomprehension and tensions on both sides."
378,173,0.993,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"So what could become the major goal instead? Summarizing twenty-ï¬rst century research about human needs and how to align them with natureâs qualities brings us very close to the differentiated framework of sufï¬ciency of Sachs. He suggested it as early as the 1990s, and I did not anticipate this resemblance when I began to write the book. For Sachs, sufï¬ciency goes far beyond simply having less stuff. It tackles several unsustainable trends of the current development paradigm at once. In the framework he differentiates four âEâsâ in German (Entschleunigung, Entflechtung, EntrÃ¼mpelung, and Entkommerzialisierung), which I would translate as four âDâsâ: Deceleration, Deglobalization, Decluttering, and Decommodiï¬cation. In a book on sufï¬ciency policies another translator has called them the âfour Lessensâ because these concepts âexpress the idea that we need to lessen our speed, our distance, the encumbrance of our acquired possessions, and the role of commerce and the market in our livesâ (Schneidewind/Zahrnt 2014: 30). I like the four Dâs and summarize the key stance behind them by drawing on terms that were introduced and discussed in this chapter: â¢ Decelerationâendless efï¬ciency and increasing speed in all areas of production and consumption reduce experienced utility and increase vulnerability of production chains; â¢ Deglobalizationâprice-driven fragmentation of production chains and transnational corporate units across the globe boosts proï¬ts but widely externalizes ecological costs and avoids fair taxation; â¢ Declutteringârunning after ever more stuff in competition with others reduces the ability to really connect and enjoy each one of our items and also overstretches the Earthâs carrying capacity; â¢ Decommercializationâapplying mental models of commodities and ï¬nancial beneï¬ts to all relationships leads to less quality of life, less concern for others or the environment, and keeps governance blind to the physical and psychological realities behind the numbers. We can take more care of what we have, distribute it more sensibly and thoroughly, and innovate our production and consumption systems so they bring us into a safe and just operating space. There clearly is enough to go round. Spending patterns show that there is room for the reorientation of already existing wealth without ruining lives. We do not need ever more output. We need different business models, market patterns, money systems and the courage to let go of the exhausting narrative that we are insatiable egoists trapped in a constant competitive race over accumulation for accumulationâs sake and a fear of falling behind. The good news is that the wider context of what could shape into a Second Enlightenment movement holds this potential: â¢ Emphasis lies on reflexivity that takes circumstances into account when undertaking intellectual and empirical investigations. â¢ Social sciences and the role of spirituality return to the realms of understanding and explaining development patterns of the world."

53,54,0.993,"Healthcare, Frugal innovation, and Professional Voluntarism : a Cost-Benefit Analysis","volunteers, especially doctors, refer immediately to the potential for clinical skills enhancement. And, post placement, professional volunteers report gains in clinical skills achieved through the sheer volume of cases they encounter; their exposure to diseases that are unusual in the UK; conditions that are rarely seen due to early or preventive intervention (the outcomes of delays) or, quite commonly, scenarios that they would have limited direct (hands-on) access to due to their status (in terms of seniority or cadre). One of the most tangible and obvious beneï¬ts of spending time in a low-resource setting concerns the large volume of cases and the access that clinicians are likely to have, even at a relatively junior stage in their careers, to these. The idea that learning is gained through repetition (case volume) is captured by theories of learning focused on âdeliberative practiceâ which suggest that individuals acquire or hone skills through practice (Ericsson et al. 1993). Skills enhancement here relies on an assumption that the learner has been taught the skill in the ï¬rst place, and it is use of that skill that perfects the skill and builds conï¬dence in its utilisation; similarly, lack of practice may result in skills wastage or more likely in waning conï¬dence. This form of learning, through repeated use of pre-existing skills, could arguably happen in the absence of supervision but may be signiï¬cantly enhanced when the learner has access to a âmore knowledgeable personâ (Kolb 1983; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). An experienced midwife volunteer described the gains she feels she made in terms of clinical skills: Some of my clinical examination skills are ten times better than before we came out. In the UK we lose our basic skills and midwifery skills of how to palpate a uterus and to say which position the baby is lying in because if thereâs any doubt we just send for a scan. I had a woman who came and I felt her abdomen and she saw it on my face â she said, âyou think Iâve got two babies donât you?â I said, âI really do think youâve got two babies in thereâ. She laughed, she said she had a scan the week before and it said single baby but there were too many poles and too many limbs for it to be one baby. I said Iâm not happy with that scan result I want you to go to [hospital] and have another scan and ring me. In the evening I got a telephone call. She said âI have twinsâ! How fabulous that?"
310,149,0.993,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"Apart from the identiï¬cation of this repertoire of strategies, which is arguably not exhaustive, we have also attempted in this volume to show that the general publicâs perception of what actually constitutes hate speech and how it should be regulated is far from uniform. So, even though the young people we interviewed are, quite expectedly, ardent supporters of freedom of expression, they still generally feel that hate speech is an issue that needs to be combatted. Yet, many do not seem to be sensitised towards what exactly hate speech is and also justify at times the negative sentiment of the general public towards a particular minority. To our mind, this carries two implications. On the one hand, even though the EU is pushing for the regulation of hate speech at a transnational level, it seems sensible for it to leave space for each member state to target hate speech within its national context, with its own particularities and needs. On the other hand, it seems that while legislation does help, it is not enough on its own to contain the situation, since most participants in our interviews showed ignorance of the relevant laws and repercussions for the expression of hate online. What emerged from the interviews, instead, was that the most effective weapon in the ï¬ght against hate speech is education, broadly construed. Against this background, when it comes to policy-making, the C.O.N.T.A.C.T. consortium can therefore make two recommendations. For one, it is necessary to conduct extensive research on the different forms that hate speech can take, both online and offline, as well as the underlying reasons for the emergence of such speech. It may sound banal to point this out, but it is only through the profound understanding of these reasons in the ï¬rst place, at both the national state and transnational levels, that effective policies of inclusion can be developed; and this is something that seems to be often disregarded by those in charge. Then, it is equally, if not even more important for the general public to develop an awareness on matters of discrimination. This is something that can only be accomplished through wide-reaching awareness-raising events, a responsible approach to the relevant issues by the media, and, of course, the establishment of an agenda that promotes inclusion and tolerance at all levels of education. The latter has also been pointed out in a very recent European Agency for Fundamental Rights press release, according to which, âpromoting inclusion and mutual respect through education and strong positive narratives are essential to prevent incitement to hatred and counter hate speech in the digital ageâ (FRA 2013: 1). In closing, we hope to have shown that linguists have an important role to play in this picture (cf. Olsson and Luchjenbroers 2013). Since it is intention that lies at the very core of most legal deï¬nitions of hate speech, contextualising and qualitatively analysing such speech seems central to not only tackling this complex phenomenon but also to safeguarding freedom of expression on the many platforms that the internet offers. We therefore believe that this is an endeavour that can only be accomplished by encouraging collaboration and constructive dialogue between policy makers, legal practitioners, linguists and computer scientists specialising in the automatic detection of hate speech, as well as involving higher education institutions more directly in the implementation of the relevant EU agency directives."

The why must be answered before we get to any research. The formalization is believed to be a way of abstract modeling of a given problem domain. Anyway, browsing articles upon formalization, there is a lot of lines dealing with concrete formalisms but a few of them tries to answer why they formalize anything. For software architecture, (Allen, 1997) stated: Evidently, what is needed is a more rigorous basis for describing software architectures. At the very least, we should be able to say precisely what is intended meaning of a box-and-line description of some system. More ambitiously, we should be able to check that the overall description is consistent in the sense that the parts fit together appropriately. More ambitiously still, we would like a complete theory of architectural description that allows us to reason about the behavior of a system as a whole. The given quotation provides three points of formalization. Although it is not a definition of formalization, it clearly states three reasons for formalization in software architectures."
96,159,0.993,Networks in the Russian Market Economy,"difficulties, only one out five entrepreneurs responded negatively. Of the respondents, 27 percent would not require any interest, 25 percent would loan money on low interest, and only 3 percent on market interest (25 percent chose the option âdifficult to sayâ). Though the willingness to give discounts to trusted partners was probably partly related to the exceptional circumstances of the 1990s, by referring to the ethics of helping out some of our respondents still recognized the mutual dependence of people â and particularly the dependence between the members of oneâs own personal network. Recognizing and sharing this moral principle means, first, that in Russia it is easier to ask for help and favors than in a context emphasizing competition and self-reliance. Second, it means that a request for help is more difficult to turn down in Russia by saying that âit is not my businessâ. At the risk of exaggeration, one may claim that while asking for help is interpreted in âWesternâ culture as a sign of weakness, in Russia turning down a request for help from oneâs network member is a sign of rude, uncivilized behavior. One of our respondents (development director, p5), for example, having criticized at length the barter logic implied in our question on reciprocity, summarized that the topic of discussion was related, rather than to the professional sphere, âto the worldviewâ (eto skoree vsego otnositsia k mirovospriiatiiu). If this hypothesis is valid, we can better understand the replies of our respondents about the variations and denials of reciprocity as indicative of a context in which âowing favorsâ is common and allowed. Where problems are often solved âwith a little help from my friends,â the pressure to reciprocate may be less stringent than in a context stressing the individualâs capacity to do it âmy wayâ. If we think of the reciprocal expectations as a cohesive force in networks (as a kind of âsocial glueâ), the pressure on self-reliance and immediate reciprocating in fact tries to dissolve this glue by a quick and full return of favor.12 The weaker pressure on reciprocation goes hand in hand with the tendency to help others out, the importance of obshchenie, and the maintenance of network ties. Nevertheless, referring to the ethics of helping out does not mean that it is applied in practice automatically in all circumstances. Instead, its application is likely to depend on the specific situation and person. Rather then describing Russian IT professionals as altruistic actors always ready to sacrifice their own interest, the analysis of this section has tried to illustrate the tensions between the new market-based logic emphasizing independence, competitiveness, and self-reliance, and the"
93,401,0.993,Nordic Mediation Research,"The position of children in the family and in society in the Western world has undergone radical change throughout history. Today, children are to a much greater degree regarded as entitled to give an opinionâand with a right to speak up in cases that concern them. Childrenâs rights to both participation and protection, however, is still a challenge that creates uncertainty in differing sectors about which practices are best able to promote âthe best interests of the childâ. In the mediation model, from which our data are collected, the consideration for childrenâs participation and protection is handled by clarifying the division between the roles and responsibilities of parents and children. This is concretised by deï¬nition and demarcation of conversation topic, and the points in the mediation process when children participate. Children do not participate in decision-making and are, for example, never asked where they want to live. We do see, however, how the dominant discourses in our society are coming through into some of the childrenâs statements concerning âfairnessâ in custody arrangements. In line with norms and policies of equally shared parenting, many children put forward opinions where a 50â50 division of living with each parent is regarded as the most ânaturalâ and fairest solution. The view of children in difï¬cult life situations is often coloured by a one-sided opinion of âthe vulnerable childâ, or the child as âvictimâ of the parentsâ divorce. In line with other age groups, children can be vulnerable and exposed, with additional need for protection, but children are also socially active beings who can inï¬uence both their own situation and their environment (James et al. 1999). Moving on from the rights given to children in the Child Convention and the mediation regulations that are established in Norway, the question is no longer whether children should participate, but how participation can be carried out âin the best interests of the childâ. Childrenâs participation makes them visible as subjects with their own thoughts, feelings and opinions about the divorce process that they are part of. Not all children may feel the need to talk to a mediator, but even children in families where the parents agree may need it, as several of our informants stated. As previously shown by Haugen (2007), childrenâs experiences of a divorce and the establishment of new family constellations may deviate from those of their parents. It is difï¬cult to predict which of the children have no need to have a conversation with an outsider and who may have the greatest need. Children in families with a high conï¬ict level, and, in particular, children with a high degree of problem accumulation, may be the children with the greatest need for, and beneï¬t from, their own conversation with a mediator. At the same time, as mentioned, it is often in such situations that children are not heard in a mediation process (Ask and Kjeldsen 2015). According to Langballe (2011), it is not damaging for children to talk about sensitive subjects; however, it may be unfortunate if the child is not taken seriously or believed or protected or if the child does not see any purpose in talking about sensitive topics to the adult. If information about unacceptable home conditions for children becomes available it is therefore necessary for the mediation authority to provide an adequate response, such as, for example, offering to help individual children and families or taking measures through collaborating agencies."
143,94,0.993,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"How do you see the current state of human capital development in Kenya for the next generation of entrepreneurs? I do not think universities will be the answer; at least, I have not seen them work for technology education. Graduates fresh out of university are, in general, not prepared to work in a technology company. They are not coming out of these institutions with the necessary skills. The people who do are usually the ones that are self-taught. That is quite disappointing. The universities in Kenya are too bureaucratic and not teaching the right stuff in the classes. Not across the board, but generally, students still learn the same computer languages that they were being taught eight years ago, even though current technology has changed. Why are people still learning these things? And why are they not being challenged to learn new things? And why are university professors not the ones leading the charge on this? I like what the Moringa School is doing, and I like what a couple of the finishing schools for software engineers are doing. I think that is an interesting model and where we will see more hiring happen in the future. I love bringing on people into my own company. The young people who have been self-taught and have a raw sense of what they should do. A raw skill set which allows building and growing them in my company. I think on-the-job trainingâwhether it is for the Mike Macharias and Seven Seas of the world, or Safaricom, or Google, or IBM, or M-Kopa, or Intelâis actually one of the benefits of Nairobi. We have enough of those medium and large companies, and this is what sets us apart from Kampala and Kigali and Dar es Salaam. When you come out of university or even without university, you can get a job with Conrad Akunga or myself in our smaller companies. You can get a job with Mike Macharia at his company or with John Waibochi over at Virtual City or with any number of the smaller five-to-ten-person-size startups scattered across the city. There are a number of tech companies from small to large that are accessible to you, whereas they are not accessible in some of these other cities. The offtake of that is amazing. It means that there are more and more people who are being polished into seeing technology as a business opportunity. They develop an important and unique skill set. This does"

As has been suggested by Levitt and Glick-Schiller, âmany migrants gain more social power, in terms of leverage over people, property, and locality, with respect to their homeland than they did before migrating. It is this complex intersection between personal losses and gains that any analysis of power within transnational social fields must grapple withâ (2004: 1013â1014). This imbalance is at the basis of an economics of exchanges that take place between family members, in which migrant men are invested with important responsibilities towards their relatives in Senegal. Remittances cover the everyday basic needs of many Senegalese households (Diagne/Rakotonarivo 2010) and migrants interviewed for this research all confirmed that they regularly send money home:7 âWhen you have a family youâre no longer alone. You canât only think of yourself and your own needs, but you have to think also of them. [...] The way I see it, when you have a family you no longer live for yourself.

We have decided to present our results in the form of lecture notes. There are several reasons for this choice. First, we strongly believe that the theory described above is very useful, and we want to help make it as comprehensible as possible. That is more or less impossible to do in scientific papers because their focus must be on new results and not on careful derivations of established insights. A second reason is that the problem of understanding cell physiology and how drugs affect their function is inherently multidisciplinary, and we therefore write these notes in such a way that we hope readers who are not primarily applied mathematicians can understand. We also hope to give applied mathematicians glimpses of interesting problems of great importance. As mentioned above, these notes aim to explain known theory that we think can be useful to researchers working on a mathematical understanding of living cells. There are also new results. We show in some detail how to derive formulas describing the optimal properties of theoretical drugs. Most of the results are stated for rather simple models, but it is quite clear that the methods can be extended to more intricate cases. The million dollar question when you read these notes is, of course, can these drugs actually be created? Do they exist? We do not know. We know that Markov models have been used to successfully represent the actions of drugs, but is it possible to go the other way and first compute what properties the drug should have and then create it? We have found no clear answers in the literature or through discussions with colleagues, so we decided to just formulate these ideas as precisely as possible in the hopes that someone will find them useful. We have tried to carefully underline in the notes that we are discussing theoretical drugs, and we state in many places that this work is about possible drugs."

And in a companion AHRC report to the one just quoted, we found the following claim:26 Arts and humanities knowledge tends to be more particularistic, more tacit and less easy to communicate formally. This has implications for how this knowledge is created and shared with others. Yet, because they are less amenable to codification, the arts and humanities are better placed to disrupt and challenge standardised practices and conventional wisdoms. ... The arts and humanities add to the overall diversification of knowledge creation. They offer distinctive approaches to the understanding of human experience and activity. If innovation is to thrive, it must exploit the knowledge from the entire spectrum of an integrated research base. We have already mentioned the fact that the different values of the humanities can overlap. It is particularly important to stress this in the context of innovation. For instance, when commentators talk of the humanities promoting innovation, they might well be using this as a way of talking up their economic value as in, the humanities help promote economic value by providing innovative ideas and models to business. In social policy, the humanities may lead policy makers to consider proposals that would otherwise not have occurred to them, to break out of old habits of thinking.27 In the case of cultural heritage, we have already mentioned the way in which the humanities can serve to question and revise preconceived views (or even myths) about national memory. This is yet another form of innovation. In current European Union policy thinking a strong case is often made for the necessity of nurturing social innovation alongside technological innovation and, as we shall see in Chapter 8, this is a point that is often picked up by humanities advocates, who argue that social innovation may be nurtured by research into human motivations, behaviour and entrepreneurship. On the other hand, many humanist scholars mistrust appeals to innovation as a âbuzzwordâ. They may claim that innovation is not an end in itself; that not all innovation is good (e.g. in the arena of cultural heritage, governments can misuse the humanities in order to invent nationalist identities). Looking at our interview responses, it is interesting that few people mentioned innovation unprompted. Perhaps the most articulate"

We have identified two main sources of this information. First source is information acquired from the user and second one is acquired by monitoring user's behavior while she is working with the application. Unfortunately, when the user starts using the application for the first time there is no information about her to provide successful personalization. When the personalization is not satisfactory for the user, it can deter the user from future using the application. We can look at this problem from two points of view â the new-system cold-start and the new-user cold-start problem (Middleton, 2003). The case of the new-system coldstart problem is related to the new system where is no initial information about any user. And the user who uses the application for the first time is the first user since the application has bean launched. In the other case the application has been running for a while and there are records about the other users who have already used this application. Asking the user questions seems to be a solution. But the user who is asked too many questions usually starts feeling bothered and inclines to check whatever answers just to get through it as fast as it gets. Here, we point out how important is to design the clear and unobtrusive question, but we do not discuss it more in details. Partial solution gives stereotypes where the user is assigned to the group (stereotype) after he had answered only a few questions. The stereotype reflects characteristics, which are common for most of the group members. If the stereotype is assigned to the user all these characteristics will appear in her user model even any of them does not reflect particular user. Cold-start problem may be overcome by using default values as well. It is obvious especially in education application.

This can help the participants to concentrate on the substantive matters while nevertheless all cells of the assessment tool get appropriate attention. The governance expert can also help in the interpretation of the consequences of the assessment and will develop experience in how to deal with such situations, creating learning from one case to another. The disadvantage however can be that the participants are less actively involved and feel more like interviewees than like discussants. A good balance between too much and too little guidance is important for a productive process that provides the participants with learning experience. A further way in which the tool can be applied is when not practical learning experiences of practitioners, but scientiï¬c research is the main purpose. In such a project all kind of sources are used to assess the cells and interviews with practitioners are just part of the data gathering. The Governance Assessment Tool will in such studies often be used as a way to âmeasureâ the dependent or independent variable in the study. For this purpose normal approaches to methodology apply. One more way in which the tool can be applied is the elaborate way it is done in the DROP project (multiple analysts from multiple institutions, disciplines and countries, in multiple rounds and various ways of interaction with practitioners). This is a very special situation that requires much resources, but provided both scientiï¬cally and practically a lot of new knowledge. About this ideal methodology (and its risks and pitfalls!) the next subsection will elaborate further."

If there are perceptions of paying too much, there will also be expectations of getting as much back. On the other hand, getting very little from the state also means that the willingness to contribute is even less. It could be put as a question about the chicken and egg, but in terms of a reciprocal relation it is rather about how the Maori proverb was originally translated: âGive as much as you take, all shall be very wellâ (Mauss 2002 [1990]: 91). Mauss pointed out in a footnote that the wording is rather âas much as Maru gives, so much Maru takes and this is good, goodâ (ibid.: 189). Larry further illuminates contributive versus distributive reciprocity. âThey cheat me everywhere, so I take a little bit in return. I minimise the damage.

One is security experts who need to understand the vulnerabilities implied by the vendorâ buyer relationships they are a part of. Another is security researchers who need to understand the limitations of the state of the art, when a system must be defended against different adversaries from those previously considered. An often overlooked but important group of stakeholders for this problem is the decision makers in nation states, public bodies, and large companies. Their need to understand this problem is huge, since they are the ones ultimately making the decisions that establish the type of customerâvendor relationships on which we focus.

117,109,0.993,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Enabling Autonomy From this perspective, making up oneâs mind and acting autonomously does not consist in determining and following contingently given preferences and being equipped with relevant factual knowledge. Rather, forming an autonomous will means taking part in an ongoing dialogue. This dialogue need not be restricted to verbal communication and it need not always take place between co-present interlocutors. Convictions may be expressed nonverbally and affectively, and one may find convincing attitudes and perspectives in books, films or other media. In any case, when forming a will, one is positioning oneself in this dialogue and finding oneâs own standpoint and voice. Respecting autonomy thus initially requires safeguarding the ability to develop and enact autonomy, that is to say granting the other person a place in the debate, listening, revealing oneâs own perspective and taking the time to let the exchange evolve. At some later point, then, respecting autonomy will also entail refraining from intervening if a person has decided themselves that these actions do not harm others. In the medical context, these presuppositions of autonomy can be translated into calls for caution and attention. For example, before following a patientâs request to end life-prolonging or life-saving treatment, one ought to make sure that the patient has had time to think for themselves, the opportunity to talk to others, and, not least, that they are assured that their future existence and well-being matters. The latter entails that once a patient has reached a final decision, this decision must be regarded as authoritative. However, it also entails that the patient be assured that they will not be left alone or be perceived as a burden, should they decide to accept treatment. Respecting autonomy thus incorporates an orientation towards wellbeing. It is directed at physical, psychological, and social presuppositions"
187,290,0.993,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"As described above, for M&S applied to CI it is necessary to identify and manage risk. V&V can be used for that but the question is how should the V&V be approached and how much effort should be spend on it. The second question is difï¬cult to answer because there is no general answer. Doing V&V can be costly and it should be in balance with the M&S Use Risk involved. Another aspect that has to be considered is the risk tolerance, e.g. in the form of insurance, of the user. What is most important is that the cost spent on the V&V effort should be in balance with the possible costs associated with the risk. The cost of doing V&V should also be signiï¬cantly less than the possible saving due to risk reduction. The ï¬rst questionâhow to do V&Vâis easier to answer. In practice it is often observed that those who develop the simulation also perform the V&V activities. Although they often do a good job, the result does leave something to be desired. After the V&V activities it is not clear anymore which tests were performed and why. The documentation is more often than not a bunch of ï¬les on the developerâs computer. If after some time things need to be changed in the M&S system and thus some additional V&V activities have to be performed, it is not clear which of the results from the initial V&V activities are still applicable and which tests need to be redone. In short: there is no traceable path from the userâs goal to the tests to the results, and no re-usable documentation exists. An unstructured approach to doing V&V may be effective, but often this cannot be shown. It may also be efï¬cient at"

In her case, however, the longing she has for not always having to be responsible and in charge may also have interfered here. In all eight cases, feelings of gender from their own families of origin, both class-wise and individually, and the projects they had for their own lives at 30 were partly maintained and partly changed. What changed them in the intermediate decade were material and structural circumstances, the education and the work they undertook, and the partners they chose, in addition to the surprise at the experience of the biological dimensions of motherhood, and in some cases also their own psychological and erotic attraction to gender difference. This also informs the emotional basis for the political stand they take towards gender-equality politics. As a generation they share an emphasis on individuality that does not work well with the idea of a gender battle between two groups. They tend to go for compromises rather than to fight, including the compromise that a divorce may be. They think that people should be allowed to stick to their preferences and that gendered choices in some areas can live well with gender equality in other areas. The issue of the new marketdriven gender separation of childhoodâpink for girls, blue for boysâis not something they find important to engage in. âTheyâve expired, those issuesâ, says Henrik, and it is difficult to find anyone among the eight interviewees at 40 who disagrees with him on this. The equality-minded Pia says that there is a âhigh dress factorâ among her little daughters and that she cannot see this as a problem as long as they can play freely. Tonje says that âsuch things are completely insignificant, itâs not worth fighting the kids on itâ. As a default she buys pink and purple for her two daughters because then she knows everyone is happy. Judged from the eight interviews at 40 and with a glance at the bigger sample interviewed at 30, it seems like that the variations in family models and practices of gender equality can be related to the intervieweesâ parental identifications in combination with their choice of job and partner. The most important precondition for a gender-equal practice among the men seems to be a positive relationship with the mother and a perception of her as having been equal in status with the father. This may indicate that the fatherâs role for positive identification with gender equality is more indirect (see also BjÃ¸rnholt 2014). The menâs engage-"

Accordingly, by Freud, people are struggling between the pulls of their debased self (the id) and the commands of the moral voice (the super ego). Sometimes, and under some conditions, one side prevails, and sometimes the other. Moreover, people construct out of this give and take their own personality (ego). And although the urges of the id can be channeled into pro-social behavior (through sublimation), such conversion is never fully successful. The id gnaws; moral wrestling is never ending (Moreover, the sublimation exacts its own psychological costs, captured in Civilization and its Discontents [Freud 1930]). Clinical psychology has a number of different schools and gurus. By and large, though, they tend to help the person liberate him or herself from the moralistic demands of their society and follow his or her own star. Thus, Philip Cushman (1990) finds that clinical therapeutics see the ideal individual as one who has gained a âmasterful selfâ, who can âfunction in a highly autonomous, isolated way,â and is âself-sufficientâ (p. 604). That is, free from the restraints morality demands society puts on peopleâs desires. Therapy liberates people from the demons of their past and leaves them free to follow whatever they deem good. Jerome Frank (1978) sees psychotherapies as sharing a value system that accords âprimacy to individual self-fulfillment,â such as, âmaximum self-awareness, unlimited access to oneâs own feelings, increased autonomy and creativityâ (p. 6â7). Although Frank recognizes the benefit of self-realization, he warns against modern psychotherapyâs focus on promoting personal happiness as its main focus. Frank points out that the literature of psychotherapy accords little attention to virtues and values such as âthe redemptive power of suffering, acceptance of oneâs lot in life, adherence to tradition, self-restraint and moderationâ (Frank 1978, p. 7). There is much to be said for freeing people from their inner demons, reflecting the defective ways in which they were brought up. However, psychotherapy tends to exorcise at the same time the moral dictates promoted by society. Those do deserve critical examination and reform, but people should not be left in a moral vacuum, especially if one seeks to understand under what conditions we become better moral wrestlers."
46,62,0.993,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"well as public deliberation. The ten capabilities on her list should guide policies in each country, but it is the responsibility of each country to set an adequate threshold. Unfortunately, Nussbaum is rather vague and only arbitrarily discusses certain capabilities and their possible thresholds. In her view, for some capabilities, the threshold should be set in a way that leads to equality so that each human is basically entitled to the same level in that capability (e.g., liberal rights), while for other capabilities the threshold can be set lower and hence allows a certain degree of inequality (e.g., in housing and material living conditions). To her, granting each human each capability above this threshold level is a partial and minimal requirement of what justice demands, admitting that there are various ways a just society can deal with inequalities above the threshold. However, they have to be arranged in a way so that equal respect and concern are guaranteed for all citizens. According to Nussbaum, this implies that each and every capability must be secured up to a certain level and that they should never be assessed from a trade-off perspective: [ ... ] all ten of these plural and diverse ends are minimum requirements of justice, at least up to the threshold level. In other words, the theory does not countenance intuitionistic balancing or trade-offs among them. The constitutional structure (once they are put into a constitution or some other similar set of basic understandings) demands that they all be secured to each and every citizen, up to some appropriate threshold level. In desperate circumstances, it may not be possible for a nation to secure them all up to the threshold level, but then it becomes a purely practical question what to do next, not a question of justice. (Nussbaum 2006, 175) How can we, how should we interpret NussbaumÂ´s rule of sufficiency in regard to children in rich countries? She does not give a clear answer; it often seems as if she views the capability approach as mainly concerned with poverty in poor countries and the severe harm there. We wish to specify some important aspects. (1) In rich countries, a higher level of well-being and well-becoming is obviously achieved for many children; the possibilities to realize a good life are much better than in most other countries in this world. Still, certainly not all children achieve the same level of well-being and well-becoming, and some even fall short of what justice demands in terms of minimal thresholds in these countries.

Clauser [of the ClauserâHorneâShimonyâHolt (CHSH) inequalities [145]], in a noteworthy paper [144], pointed out the dogmatism of âevangelical theoreticians . . . their ecumenical leadership, and especially given Bohrâs strong leadership, the net legacy of their arguments is that the overwhelming majority of the physics community accepted Bohrâs âCopenhagenâ interpretation as gospel, and totally rejected Einsteinâs viewpoint.â At some point Clauser got thrown out of the office by the impatient Feynman (who often liked to market himself as âcoolâ). âA very powerful . . . stigma began to develop within the physics community towards anyone who sacrilegiously was critical of quantum theoryâs fundamentals. . . . The net impact of this stigma was that any physicist who openly criticized or even seriously questioned these foundations (or predictions) was immediately branded as a âquack.â â Clauser continues by noticing, âTo be sure, there remained alive a minority of the theoryâs founders (notably Einstein, SchrÃ¶dinger, and de Broglie) who were still critical of the theoryâs foundations. These men were obviously not quacks. Indeed, they all had Nobel Prizes! Instead, gossip among physicists branded these men âsenile.â â As time passed by, another, more optimistic phase of the perception of quantum foundations followed, which, however, might not have sufficiently and critically reflected the previous evangelical theoreticiansâ orthodoxy. On the contrary, quantum mechanics has been marketed to the public and to policy makers alike as a hocuspocus type capacity [522]. This author believes [504] that interpretation is to the formalism what a scaffolding in architecture and building construction is to the completed building. Very often the scaffolding has to be erected because it is an indispensable part of the building process. Once the completed building is in place, the scaffolding is torn down and the opus stands in its own full glory. No need for auxiliary scaffold any more. But beware of those technicians who claim to be able to erect skyscrapers without any of those poles and planks! In addition, when it comes to claims of applicability of the formalism, and its ontological commitments, the suppression of semantic content in favour of mere syntax makes us vulnerable: in many ways the formalism could be extended to domains in which it cannot be applied safely and properly. Thereby, the resulting certifications, alleged capacities and predictions could be wrong. Hence, if it comes to utilize the formalism, interpretation serves not only as scaffolding, but also provides guiding principles and precautionary methods of evaluation and application."

This has profound implications for publishing. âScaffoldingâ may not appear at first glance to be the right term to describe the support role that publishers provide in a very fluid ecology. However, given the rigidity of the legacy systems of supply and delivery, it may not be a bad metaphor. Physical books that have sustained us so well for centuries were (and are still) served by a host of intermediaries including bookshops, library suppliers, and aggregators. In other words a vast, established supply chain exists that is no longer best suited to deliver the new âbookâ. We are now experiencing a whole host of pressures that will require the dismantling and reconstruction of some kind of scaffolding. We are somewhere inside a fundamental transformation â in a âpupalâ stage of development. What will emerge is as yet unknown. Wherever and however we end up will be in response to changes to the way that academics conduct their work, how knowledge problems will be solved, and how traditional career paths might change. What does all this mean for the âbookâ of the future? Some of the challenges include: newly shaped ecologies of knowledge infrastructures demanding shared data; new forms of publication; interdisciplinarity; facilitated collaborative work; and fast turnaround. Features that are likely to remain are long-form publications, shorter narrative structures within a coherent whole that can stand alone (e.g. edited chapters) as well as collectively (edited volumes), alongside more sophisticated ways of presenting interpretation of data or sources in light of theory. Features of the âbookâ that are likely to be less prevalent are the physical object (which may not be printed unless requested) and therefore âwritingâ will become more influenced by the use and the embeddedness of multimedia. The rigidity of single disciplines will wane â though to what extent is still unknown. Digital affordances not only provide new answers to old questions â they encourage new questions to be asked. For years, there has been tension between subject depth vs subject breadth. Interdisciplinarity too has always been controversial. Now, with new digital affordances, we no longer have silos of discipline-limited knowledge infrastructures.

Of course, the logic of desire and intention is very different from that of belief. Agents can both intend to do something and believe that their intended action will have a certain effect without eo ipso desiring and intending to produce that effect. One can reject an offer and believe that one will irritate the agent of that offer without desiring and intending to provoke such an attitude. There is sometimes a conflict between the intentions and beliefs of an agent at a moment. Certain possible denotation assignments to senses compatible with the execution of the agentâs intentions at a moment are not compatible with the truth of his or her beliefs at that moment. For unwanted effects of the intended action do not occur according to the first assignments. Agents know that some of their beliefs could be false. This can even occur when they believe that it is settled or even inevitable that their action will have a certain unwanted consequence. Bratman and Searle have given a lot of convincing examples. A prior intention to do something P and a belief that it is then necessary that if P then Q do not commit the agent to a prior intention to do Q. We know that we can wrongly believe that certain facts are inevitable. We would then be happier if such facts would not occur. So Kantâs principle: âWhoever intends to achieve an end thereby will the necessary means or effects that he or she knows to be part of the achievement of that endâ does not apply to prior intentions. However because agents are rational they have to minimally coordinate their cognitive and volitive states in trying to act in the world. So a restricted form of Kantâs principle âAny agent who wills the end is committed to willing the necessary meansâ applies to attempts which are intentions in action. In case the agent of an attempt knows that in order to succeed he or she has to do something else, that agent will try to do that other thing. In other words, whoever attempts to achieve an end attempts to use means that he or she knows to be necessary. Such a restricted Kantian principle is valid in my logic of action. When P and Q â ÏPresent Intention (a, m) and the agent a knows at moment m that (P â Q), if P â Goal am then Q â Goal am . Let me give an example. Any agent knows that in order to invite someone one has to make a request. Thus whoever tries to make an invitation eo ipso tries to make a request. His or her attempted request then constitutes his or her attempted invitation. As Goldman pointed out, certain action tokens generate others causally, conventionally, simply and by extension. My logic of action explicates the various forms of action generation. It can also characterize how illocutions which are the primary units of meaning and communication in the use of language relate to other speech-acts (acts of utterance, propositional acts, attempts at performing illocutions, and perlocutionary acts). Attempts at performing illocutions are new fundamental speech-acts in my taxonomy. They are constitutive of meaning. Speakers attempt to publicly perform illocutions by emitting signs. It remains to explicate how and under what conditions they succeed and how successful illocutions generate others (invitations contain requests) and have perlocutionary effects (the hearer is sometimes influenced). At the basis of communication, agents attempt to move parts of their body and this generates in the sense of Goldman in various ways their speech-acts. Generation in communication is first physically causal (we orally utter sentences in producing"
31,83,0.993,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"3. Posthumous pardoning has an important role in forgiveness and reconciliation. It forgives historical actors, as well as those emotionally affected by its decisions. Today, the shot at dawn campaign has been re-evaluated as a symbolic harm to the memory of the dead. This is complicated, not least because we should not conflate what was considered rightly just then, with what might no longer be considered just today. The most compelling reason to re-evaluate the past in the present is when it causes unnecessary and unjust suffering today. The symbolic and narrative redemption of reflexive biography has a way of conserving the fidelity of memory as well as having the redemptive effect of removing the human stain of inherited shame. For example, Harry Farrâs widow, Gertrude, struggled to cope after his death with a young daughter and no army pension. Gertrude and his daughter (also called Gertrude) unsuccessfully tried to clear Harry Farrâs reputation through the courts. The psychological burden of this failure was an intrinsic harmâalbeit of a secondary orderâto the relatives of the dead. Des Browneâs blanket pardonâwhich included Harry Farrâ could not have come any sooner for Harry Farrâs daughter Gertrude, who at the age of 93 lived to see her father forgiven. In her own words: âI am so relieved that this ordeal is over and that I can be content knowing that my fatherâs memory is intactâ (cited in Norton-Taylor 2006 [Authorâs Italics]). 4. It is a way of society understanding itself in relation to its past. By re-evaluating the past in the present we are acknowledging that what was considered wrong then is not something that we can view with the same disdain today. It signals to the world that while we understand why certain individuals were treated in the way they were, we can no longer view these people in the same way given what we know today. To really appreciate this perspective we need to think beyond the rather crude dichotomous reasoning which many historical commentators around this subject fall prey to when articulating a case for and against posthumous pardoning."

But then, differences between STIT and PDL tools may just amount to different legitimate decisions on how one individuates actions.11 The problem of individuating actions has been discussed extensively in philosophy (see footnote 3 on pg. 588 of Horty and Belnap (1995) for a concise explanation), and it also shows in modeling practice in computer science. This brings us to an important philosophical issue which we have thus far swept under the rug. In PDL models, actions are labels of transitions and this basic sorting of transitions by their labels seems to suggest a particular ontology of actions and events. In STIT models, there is no such sorting and, indeed, the only way to characterize an action is by reference to the outcomes. This raises an important question for the philosophical logician: Does adopting PDL as a logic of actions force one to take sides in philosophical debates about the ontology of events and actions? Our response is to bracket this question since we feel that both STIT and PDL models are open to a wide range of philosophical interpretations, regardless of the original intended interpretation of these logical frameworks. However, we certainly admit that this rather mathematical âformal modelingâ view is itself controversial and we welcome (and enjoy) debates on this issue. Nonetheless, we hope that the comparative points we are making in this chapter still make sense."

360,167,0.993,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"tion, except perhaps in the case of finding semantic treatments for attitude reports.52 And the task of a formal semantics is to explain how complex meanings are constructed from simple meanings. For that purpose one needs to start with the simple meanings as a given. Although both of those claims are true, at least as the task is conceived by the Objectivists, they seem also to have forgotten their rationales for finding semantic compositionality attractive in the first place: the arguments from understandability, from productivity, from learnability, and from creativity. Certainly all of these arguments make the claim that the justification of semantic compositionality lies in the way it facilitates mental processing. And thus, even if the picture that âlanguage is about the worldâ is correct, these arguments nevertheless presuppose or require that language also embody features of oneâs mental life. A natural place for the Objectivists to find this missing connection is to claim that the terminal nodes of their meaning structures are given by mental items, such as concepts. And then they can go ahead andâfrom this starting pointâbe entirely compositional. In fact, Iâm sure that most of the philosophers-semanticists who give any thought to the issue probably believe something along those lines. But letâs look at what this would entail. If the psychological results are correctâand they have been replicated over and over, at least in regards to simple binary combinationâthat mental concepts allow both for differences in degree of typicality of the concept and also for differences in degree of membership (Hampton and JÃ¶nsson 2012, pp. 386â87), then this would have to be a feature of the meanings at the terminal nodes of the semantic structure. The lexical item âfurnitureâ, for instance, would have to admit in the world of different degrees of truth (and not merely different degrees of typicality) for âThis chair is furnitureâ and âThis clock is furnitureâ. I think philosophers-semanticists would not countenance this.53 In response to all these competing pressures, I surveyed the prospects for a twotiered semantic theory: one aspect being the Objectivistâs âconnection to the worldâ and the other aspect being the Subjectivistâs account of mental activity. As it turns out, some of the works that claim to provide a two-tier theory actually are within just one of the Subjectivist or Objectivist camp, in that both of their tiers have their foundational starting point, or common nexus, entirely within one camp. I also mentioned a few theories that appear to be genuinely two-tiered, but noted that they require further input, especially from the Subjectivist side of the theory. To agree to anything like the two-tiered theory I outlined, one needs to accept two claims: First, that linguistic utterances are to be judged as to how well they âfitâ the (external) world. One way to put this, and I did, is to say that what is meanto by an utterance concerns the actual world, and not any conceptual representation. The two come apart when 52 Such as John wants to marry a princess, the ambiguity of which (a specific princess versus any"

It is stressed that photographs are introduced in an open manner, such as: Tell me about this house. Tell me who lives with you in this house. To make themes tangible to the child, the interviewer may draw while talking with the childâfor example, the childâs house, parents, siblings, pets, etc. If the child brings up abuse or other relevant topics for the case, the interviewer follows up with questions. The follow-up questions should be open ended, but concrete, and adjusted to the childâs developmental level. For example, You told me your father hits when he gets angry. Tell me more about your father hitting (or being angry). If this question is too open, a more focused question might be: Tell me who your father hits when he gets angry. If the questions are too advanced for the child, they might lose attention and thus their motivation to complete the interview. Difficult questions also increase the potential of incorrect or short answers, such as yes/no and I donât know. As a rule, the interviewer should always follow the childâs lead throughout the whole interview by not ignoring any conversational initiatives the child takes."

Scientific researchers may want to dig into a new research topic; budget travelers may want to make an affordable travel plan; youngsters may want to learn the secrets of career success; and so on and so forth. The information needs involved in these problems cannot be directly translated into appropriate queries, because people are not familiar with the knowledge domain that is related to the search, they do not know the means of achieving their goals, or the goals are not clear in themselves (Nolan 2008). In tackling the above problems, as a matter of fact, people have to define their search goals in the first place. The information they obtain at the beginning of the search process may be of poor relevance. However the more information they absorb, the more thoroughly they understand the problem. In this way people get to distinguish between what they already know and what they should know. The gap in between is the information need. With the need taking shape gradually, people will be more and more able to formulate queries and identify relevant items. At this moment, the power of the search system in automatic matching starts to play its role truly. Whether people can find satisfying solutions to the original problem is further dependent upon their skills of extracting valuable information from search results. Here we see the user-dominated non-linear search, known as âexploratory searchâ. Exploratory search is a special type of information seeking. The 2005 Exploratory Search Interface Workshop was the first milestone in the history of this sub discipline (White et al. 2005). It was followed by a series of influential events, including the 2006 ACM SIGIR Workshop on Evaluating Exploratory Search Systems, the 2007 ACM SIGCHI Workshop on Exploratory Search and HCI, and the 2008 NSF Invitational Workshop on Information Seeking Support Systems. Moreover several academic journals, such as the Communications of the ACM, the International Journal of Information Processing and Management, and Computer, have published special issues on exploratory search."
123,92,0.993,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"Safety in aviation has improved in recent decades because of a shared realization that pilots are fallible beings. There has been a shift in attitude, from seeing pilots as extraordinary, infallible individuals who could be trusted to bring the plane safely to its destination, to understanding air travel as depending on teamwork, where all the individuals involved depend on feedback and support from others. The realization that each individual is fallible and depends upon others to intervene when he or she appears to make a mistake has caused a breakthrough in safety practices (Helmreich & Davies, 2004; Stoop & Kahan, 2005). The development has been noted in healthcare, where the aviation approach has inspired similar practices of coping with fallibility (Kao & Thomas, 2008; Pronovost, et al., 2009; Aviram, Benyamini, Lewenhoff, & Wilf-Miron, 2003). Strategies for learning from mistakes in healthcare is explored further in the next chapter. Personal narratives about mistakes are a rich source for learning (Bister, Bledow, Carette, & KÃ¼hnel, 2017; Gould & Rami, 2016). Jarle Gimmestad shares a range of stories from his own time in the cockpit with his audiences. A story about the aftermath of the brake incident and how it was handled in his organization, generate further learning points. Two aspects stand out, one regarding knowledge, and another regarding perception. First, his bosses were pondering what to do with Gimmestad after the event, and ended up sending him on a three-days course in how brakes function, thus indicating that what he had been lacking on that dramatic day was basic brake knowledge. They reduced the problem to something concrete and tangible that could be fixed by introducing the pilot to new knowledge. From a philosophical perspective, this can be seen as a contemporary version of Socratesâ idea that for a person to do the good, it is enough that he knows the good. As an explanation of Gimmestadâs mistake, it seems rather weak and unconvincing. It is unlikely that he forgot to put off the brakes because he did not know about the functioning of the brakes, and would have acted differently if that knowledge had been in his possession at the time of the event.

147,289,0.993,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"How is self-knowledge built, and what impact does its changes have on subsequent entrepreneurial decisions? Importantly, learning that enhances individualsâ self-knowledge may lead to the conclusion that an entrepreneurial career is not for them. This could have implications for research on entrepreneurship education. Specifically, rather than aspiring to increase studentsâ entrepreneurial knowledge and then motivating them to pursue an entrepreneurial career, as educators, we may need to focus on educational tools that build self-knowledge in the entrepreneurial context that informs and motivates career decisions, which may be careers that are not entrepreneurial. Perhaps ironically, for some students, an entrepreneurship course that builds self-knowledge such that they are deterred from pursuing an entrepreneurial career could be considered successful. We need more research on this topic before we can make such determinations. Entrepreneurial careers as a series of steps. Studies of entrepreneurial careers often have an implicit assumption that an entrepreneurial career is a destination for some individualsâan optimal outcome (e.g., Douglas & Shepherd, 2000; Eisenhauer, 1995; Kolvereid & Isaksen, 2006). Instead of seeing self-employment as a one-time decision, scholars should investigate this career option in the context of a series of career decisions. Viewing self-employment as a series of career decisions, we begin to gain some insight into re-entry (e.g., Carroll & Mosakowski, 1987), including more knowledge on serial entrepreneurs (Westhead & Wright, 1998; Westhead et al., 2005) and multiple exits. How is the âone-timeâ decision perspective different from the focal decision in the context of thinking about careers as a series of decisions? Such research is critical, especially as we consider the changes in people over their life course (Levesque & Minniti, 2006; Levesque, Shepherd, & Douglas, 2002) and especially given the aging population (LÃ©vesque & Minniti, 2011). How are the decision policies for a graduating student different from a mid-career employee or someone nearing retirement? It seems that we know quite a lot about the first, a little bit about the second, and not much about the third. We believe (hope) that this will soon be rectified. Progression along the steps of an entrepreneurial career. Related to the previous point, there is a considerable literature about how competences (Davidsson & Honig, 2003), beliefs (Shaver & Scott, 1991), and motivations (Herron & Sapienza, 1992) influence the decision to start of a new venture, but in many ways, the creation of a new venture involves a series of activities (e.g., Lichtenstein, Dooley, & Lumpkin, 2006) that themselves require a series of decisions (perhaps as a sequence of nested"

Therefore, the closed circuit of material$material production and consumption is accompanied by waste and dissipation (Koran 17:53; 6:121; 4:76). Since it is impossible for everyone to participate in the competition for mass consumption, poverty is constantly increasing, both in human communities and in the natural environment. Hence, we are observing the erosion of human communities, the great majority of them by poverty and a small minority by mass consumption. Certain methods for harmonising material and spiritual needs were recommended at a time when the communities on the Arabian Peninsula were living in poverty. The teachings noted that any consumption which negatively affects the natural balance of the body and deranges the mind is wastefully extravagant and fatal. It taught people that if they do not try to develop and actualise their talents, the energy used for these talents cannot stay unoccupied and hence will be used for domination and transgression (Koran 96:6). However, the question is: how do we know that we are on the path to development and not domination (and fozoon talabi or greed)? There are 14 ways to measure this. 1. Human development should be accompanied by the prosperity of nature. Hence, any development which is accompanied by environmental destruction should not be seen as development but an act of dominance and greed, which eventually will lead both humans and the environment to the valley of death. According to the Koran, the elimination of ethnic groups and cities resulted from their deviation from the path of development.9 There are two approaches to the relationship between human beings and their environment. One perceives nature as an active entity and humans as passive subordinates to nature, and the other sees humans as a dominant entity which has to conquer nature and ferociously exploit its resources for the wholesale consumption of its resources. How is it possible, one can ask, that the Koran provides us with the solution to encroaching environmental disaster, when it was written 1,400 years ago in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula? How is it possible that such a warning should have come from anyone but God? 2. If a right creates a zero-sum relation in which one will reap beneï¬t at the expense of someone elseâs loss, then this cannot be seen as a right. Even if a ârightâ is seen as an entity which one has and the other does not, this also is not ârightâ but falsity. If we can see that human rights are not exercised in their totality in any country, then will it be wrong to assume that the reason for this is that those who are aware of these rights feel themselves to be entitled to them but do not see as their duty the defence of these rights in regard to others? If so, then one can only explain this discrepancy by arguing that the guiding principles of these peopleâs thoughts and actions are based on power relations.

However, patient safety in hospitals hinges on a deep, shared an understanding of this principle, and in meetings with inexperienced professionals, it seems reasonable to err on the side of over-communication rather than risk that they do not grasp the importance of seeking help when in doubt. Also, in the aftermath of critical event, it is possible to look at present routines and practices in order to consider improvements. A person that refrains from seeking help from colleagues or others, even when he or she clearly needs it, is likely to perceive that the act of asking for assistance has some kind of social cost that they are unwilling to pay. Lee (1999, 2002) has proposed that there are three specific categories of social cost associates with seeking help. First, by asking for help one acknowledges incompetence and oneâs own inability to solve problems and find solutions by oneself. Second, a person seeking help acknowledges inferiority to other people in terms of knowledge, skills, and resources. Third, help seekers acknowledge their dependence on other people, and admit that they cannot complete a particular task along, but only through the efforts and contributions of others (Lee, 2002, p. 18). All of these categories of social cost have links to self-esteem. Admitting more or less publicly that you are not sufficiently competent, inferior, and dependent upon other peopleâs contributions can disrupt a personâs feeling of self-efficacy and being able to take care of him or herself. What will other people think of me, now that they have seem how dependent I am of help? These social costs can serve to explain the tendency to refrain from seeking help. The doctor studentâs reluctance to seek help can be understood in the light of these theoretical propositions. He most likely wanted to avoid social costs in all three dimensions. First, he did not want to acknowledge incompetence, but instead had the ambition to make a good impression on colleagues and leaders at the mental hospital. Second, being a student he was already in some sense inferior to the other people in the workplace, and would not want to have the perceived gap in knowledge, skills, and resources widened even further by asking for help. Third, he acknowledges that he came into the organization with a plan to be perceived as an independent and autonomous person, someone who would deserve excellent references and offers of further"

We pay attention, here, to how those wrinkles get rubbed out, how they are sometimes smoothed over, and how, sometimes, they endure within and between the unsuspecting bodies of interdisciplinary researchers themselves. We have tried in this chapter to bring to visibility some of the political, methodological, ontological, and epistemological work that those emotions perform. We hope to have shown: (1) how emotion can be influential in carving out the perimeters of an interdisciplinary space (as well as determining who is inside and outside of it); (2) how researchers can engage in various tactics to ensure that collaboration does not entirely fall apart; (3) how political and ontological differences can be experienced affectively (and vice versa); (4) how the eruption of unexpected â and superficially unimportant â moments of affect can be diagnostic of important lines of conjunction and contestation within interdisciplinary spaces; and (5) how acknowledgement of affective bewilderment while in interdisciplinary spaces is easily misconstrued as either a deliberate or unwitting removal from the terrain of the political. We worry that our inclusion of instances of mostly negatively valenced emotion has been done, at least in part, through some desire to seek sympathy, to settle scores, or to parade, in the interests of exhibitionism, shameful episodes of our own making. But we also want to insist that to decide not to attend to the movements and textures of, and manifold responses (whether regulatory or dysregulatory) to such emotion in interdisciplinary spaces, is to miss much of what is happening in them.

Surveying examples from literature, philosophy, and the history of crime, RÃ©e finds that the evolution of execution narratives has a lot to do with social attitudes about capital punishment and, in particular, an urge to think about our own last moments of life. Finally, in Chap. 10, Thomas Laqueurâs afterword focuses on the possibility of future breathsâdetermined by the apnea test in brain death situationsâas a way to think about the end of life. Brain dead people may subsist for decades attached to ventilators and participate in the same biological milestones as everyone else (puberty, pregnancy, death). Despite the expanding chronologies of the âliving deadâ through science and technology, however, Laqueur argues that the âwhenâ of death starts at the time when it is shown that a person will never breathe again without artificial assistance. This particular death sentence, of course, does not discount the reality that becoming dead also takes time in other, non-biological ways of thinking. In its movement from history and literature, to philosophy and ethics, the contributions in this book attest to a pervasive dynamic between finality and continuance, between death as a concrete biological event and death as a social negotiation. The question we have addressed is inherently interdisciplinary. It will continue to fascinate scholarly and lay audiences alike, because death timings allow us to make sense of who we are as individuals and societies in the midst of time, shorn between long memories and imagined futures on the one hand, and a single irrevocable destiny on the other."

Deconstructing the own nation through reflecting on the conflict. As mentioned above, political conflicts based on historical representations are very often based on two dimensions. This is to say they have at the same time a national and a recent character. The first feature is not a surprise at all because history education has been traditionally considered an essential piece of most of educational systems since nineteenth century, and even before, to build and maintain national identities. Therefore, it is precisely its national character in interaction with its recency the center of the conundrum to be solved. This is to say any attempt to discuss new information contradicting prior representations, based, for example, on new data obtained by historians, will be facing an intense defensive reaction because citizens national identities will be challenged. But if history education does not go in this direction trying to change stereotypical historical representations there is no way to contribute to conflict reduction and reconciliation. what to do then? This is precisely what previous pages about the teaching of historical narratives have tried to answer. This is to say I have analyzed a six dimensions view of historical narratives emphasizing how each one of them could be approached in such a way that they could help the citizens to contextualize their representations about the past and particularly their view about a monological and essentialist view of past events. As these dimensions have been analyzed before in detail, it is not necessary to consider again their possible contribution to reduce social and political conflicts but I think it is convenient to insist on the dramatic importance of establishment of the historical subject. Usually citizens establish this subject basically through a historical view based on an endurable and almost eternal continuity between themselves and diverse subjects of the past. This is to say when citizens along the world use a âweâ as subject of something that happened in the past they represent themselves as the only and genuine descendants of an idealized historical subject which does not exist anymore. In other words, this âweâ consists of an incredible mixture of present and past but probably most of the citizens are not really conscious of such a mystification. As stated before, the establishment of this imaginary historical subject is probably the nucleus of the rest of the narratives dimensions"

Certainly from such a (reductionist) perspective, it is absolutely necessary to remove access to the foodstuffs in question; however a care-giver may manage this. But, the patient is not simply diabetes mellitus, he is not simply this one disease. He is someone who has this disease: he is someone who is also much more than this, namely his entire body, and not only this body inasmuch as diabetes mellitus can be observed within it. He is someone who also has so much more, for example an attitude regarding his own illness. My patient couldâwith good reasonâinsist upon having a short, enjoyable life rather than a long one marked by deprivation It cannot be clearly decided, if I am to remain within this simple dichotomy, whether the shorter or the longer life is objectively preferable. Objectivity cannot be achieved here. One can argue with good reason in favour of the one option, and with equally good reason in favour of the other. In this situation, the care-giver, despite recourse to supervision and the necessary specialist knowledge and so on, is nevertheless faced with a very personal normative challenge. Furthermore, and this fact must be given recognition, he or she must be given leeway for this decision appropriate to the vagueness of the issue: the solution is not to prescribe one course of action or another, to demand either forced withdrawal or an ignoring of the consumption. It must be possible for the care-giver to make a decision as to the course of action, to create, maintain, improve or restore the patientâs well-being. I have stated firstly: nursing is a form of care. This means secondly: nursing is a form of care. It is one particular form of care, or to be more precise: nursing is a particular normative human reaction to the notorious frailty of oneâs neighbour. Nursing does not accept the (actuated) reality, as it is, as the best possible scenario, but rather attemptsâhealing, soothing, assistingâto make the best possible scenario (possibilitas)âI are painfully aware of the darkness surrounding this termâbecome reality (actualitas). This best possible scenario, always in terms of the patientâs needs, can materialise in divergent ways: perhaps in recovery, perhaps in a peaceful death, perhaps in something else."

That, and the ease and inexpense of deleting digital images and taking new ones, allows us to control the way we are represented to a far greater degree than in a photobooth or holding an analogue camera up to a mirror. Writing a diary is also a way of externalising our thoughts and the way we see or think about ourselves. A private, paper diary may be written for a future self who will look back upon the time of writing. Although wearable devices like Fitbits or apps like Moves or Runkeeper generally suggest we share our steps or runs or productivity in social media, many (perhaps most) users prefer to keep their activity data private, or to only share some of it. When we share photos of our children or a new home or a night out with friends our target audience is not just our friends, but also ourselves. Social media is about communication with others, but we should be equally aware of how we use social media to reflect upon ourselves. Creating and sharing a selfie is an act of self-representation â which as Gunn Enli and Nancy Thumin (2012) note, means that it involves the creation of texts which will be read and interpreted. A selfie also exists in a social context, once shared. But just as importantly, creating and sharing a selfie or a stream of selfies is a form of self-reflection and selfcreation. As readers, we encounter other people in social media as texts. From our perspective their self-expression is self-representation. This is particularly true when we are readers more than participants. Until the late 1990s, being on the Internet typically meant communicating with peers, on Usenet discussion forums, IRC, MUDs and MOOs. Early online diarying communities similarly emphasised the community and the social aspects of online diaries. In her study of Internet usersâ experience of being online, Annette Markham (1998) discusses the relationship between our bodies and the virtual online experience. There werenât many photographs on the Internet in the 1990s. Few people had digital cameras or scanners, and download speeds were so slow that images took a long time to load anyway, so our bodies for the most part were hidden. We imagined that the Internet was disembodied, anonymous and virtual. It wasnât until the late 1990s and early 2000s that webcams became popular (Senft 2008), and we began to communicate with each other visually as well as through text. The shift to the visual on the Internet and especially in social media has increased a lot since then.

They must at no time be seen as a reward to the actors on the right side of the field. The maintenance of a strategy of violence on the right side of the field must be met with one of force until the strategy is clearly abandoned in favour of one that fits on the left side of the field. Only using force is the simple coercive approach. True, it is part of the structuring of the social field, but more restructuring of the field must be madeâopen up new attractive avenues of action for both actors who are benevolent but also others. It is important that the opportunity to switch strategy is always available and is actively encouraged.5 Examples of incentives to change strategy: â¢ Positions in public administrationâdependent on competence and interest. Make them dependent. â¢ Consultation with actors on legislationâin line with a stated political agenda. Draw them in. â¢ Building up infrastructureâinvestment, priority, naming of installations (e.g. bridges, road systems and infrastructure for telecommunications). Hearts and minds. â¢ Building and siting of schoolsâfor example specific home areas can be given priority. One can discredit as well as credit with tactical help. â¢ Alternative job opportunitiesâguaranteed employment for former militia. If Maslowâs pyramid of needs is important in the case, then this will have effect. The above are but a few examples of the incentives that might be offered to get actors to change their strategies, it is no way everything that can be done. It is important to read the actors and their priorities correctly; they maybe have no interest at all in job opportunities, but for example may well have an agenda for legislation. For instance, proposed legislation may be submitted to them for their consideration or they may even be 5 The action taken by the USA against Iraqâs Sunni leaders may be seen as a variation on this theme.

The moral wrestler does not need better character education but political reforms, driven by societal changes in the distribution of power and assets, and parallel changes in the values fostered by the collective culture. Sociologists (and social psychologists) added, on the personal level, the study of âsocialization,â the process through which newborn children are turned from animals into social creatures. This is achieved as the newborns bond with their caregivers (often their parents), who in turn draw on these bonds to implant moral values in those in their care. When these children grow older, they are exposed to other sources of valuesâin school, on TV, and in social media, through peer pressure, and in places of worship. In the process, these growing children slowly develop their own value profile. These are then reinforced by what sociologists call âinformal social controls,â the approval and disapproval of others with whom people have meaningful social bonds, mainly their extended families, friends, and other community members. One may wonder what all this has to do with moral wrestling. Sociologists find that children are just as likely to be âsocializedâ into a Nazi culture as into a liberal one, into the values of a KKK community as into a progressive one. Nowhere is the basic moral neutrality of this core sociological conception of human nature more in evidence than in the way sociologists treat the concept of being a deviant. In traditional cultures, people whose conduct differed from the one prescribed by the prevailing social values were labeled deviants. Lumped together in this category were gay people, political dissidents, mental patients, women who smoked or worked outside the home, and criminals. They were all stigmatized and subjected to various correctional efforts and punishments. Sociologists argue that these people were merely committed to a different set of values. Albert Cohen (2008) writes: âIt is commonplace that normative rules vary enormously from one social system to another. It follows that no behavior is deviant in itself but only insofar as it violates the norms of some social system.â Here sociology has made a major contribution to the liberal moral culture, to tolerance; it informs people that one who is considered deviant is actually just different. Andâ that one who was considered deviant yesterday will not be viewed so today or tomorrow. In other words, sociology does embrace moral relativism not only on the societal but also on the personal level. It follows that some people may be more conformist than others but it does not make them better people, morally speaking. Accordingly, one can make people conform more but this does not make them better moral wrestlers, more able to figure out what is right, and more able to live up to their moral obligations."

This view on tax compliance changes our focus from legal explanations and economic quantifications to descriptions of the type of reciprocal relations that taxes and tax collection entail. As John Locke stated centuries ago, taxes open up issues about democracy and reciprocity. Here it is the latter that is in focus, although democracy plays a role as well. In this book I delve into taxation as creating relationships of various sorts, and I focus on the taxpayerâs perspective. Taxation is made possible by many things; the focus here is on the relations it creates between people, and between people and their state. I argue that in order to understand tax compliance and tax cheating, we have to look beyond law, psychological experiments and surveys to include tax collectors and taxpayersâ practices. What do they actually do? What are their views on taxation, in their own words? I explore the view of taxes as citizensâ explicit economic relation to the state and implicit economic relation to all other compatriots. Such a view brings us straight to the core of economic anthropology. I end the book with some thoughts about how to build and increase tax compliance if we are to take the creation of reciprocal relations through taxation seriously. Reciprocity is an old concept and many have advised me to think about other concepts instead. Yet the way I hear Swedes discussing why they pay tax and why they avoid doing so includes varieties of relations and expectations that I cannot find a better word for than reciprocity. This book is thus an amalgamation of several research projects; about the Swedish Tax Agency and about a group of Swedesâ avoidance of paying tax. In particular I draw on Chaps. 6 and 7 of my dissertation Illegal yet Licit: Justifying Informal Purchases of Work in Contemporary Sweden (2010). There are many quotes from the ethnographic interviews I conducted during my dissertation fieldwork, yet they appear in a different light when contrasted with the views and writings of the Swedish Tax Agency as they aim to make Swedes comply. When I write about the Swedish Tax Agency, I use pluralâthem. This is to acknowledge employeesâ voices, opinions and reflections about the society and the citizens they are set to tax. The plural also reflects that there are contrasting views within the Swedish Tax Agency. I am grateful for the encouragement and discussion about various aspects of this subjectâreciprocityâs importance in understanding tax complianceâwith colleagues inside and outside academia. I call them colleagues because of our common interest in tax compliance issues. In"

Leading A.I. developers, neuroscientists, and learning theorists like Ray Kurzweil have argued that peopleâs natural sense of curiosity, creativity, and experimentation drive learning. So rather than teach people to solve problems in a classroom, we will co-build companies with them. We will build to learn. A venture builder is an ideal mechanism for learning. Generally speaking, a venture builder is a company that creates companies. In our approach, we continuously evaluate and share quantitative and qualitative market data to clarify problems entrepreneurs might tackle, then partner with a potential chief executive officer (CEO) and cocreate an idea. Together, we study the market, prototype with customers, and refine our model until we find a fit and potential for scale. We do provide some starting capital, but our CEOs are expected to raise their own funds. Like most accelerators, we have distilled plenty of business-building methods and convened the best resources in the ecosystem. However, rather than run people through a linear, time-bound, task-oriented program where everyone launches a website at the same time, we create an environment where a team can quickly access a wide variety of resources to accelerate toward a broad objective. We create metrics for achieving productâmarket fit or traction or positive cash flow and then convene the right mix of support for that company to achieve its goal. In a way we are an institution of co-founders, multiplying our experience by convening the best of the ecosystem.

(Uehara 1995: 499) Justification theory does not, however, confine various orders of worth to specific cultures, but sees them rather as universal points of reference whose weight may nevertheless differ depending both on cultural context and situation. In Russian society, for example, reciprocal expectations exist in a context where â due to the Soviet heritage and probably the much longer domestic tradition of the Russian village community â people are bound to each other within a system of mutual dependency and thus accustomed to turning to each other for help in various daily life problems. Though this âdomesticâ idea of helping others out is now being challenged by the introduction of market-based principles in post-Soviet Russia, it has not disappeared. More importantly, it can be referred to even in the context of an interview concerning business-related favors, as the following quote from a Russian owner of a successful IT company shows: T: How and why does this [system of mutual favors] work? P1: Because mother was reading us fairy tales in childhood. In the fairy tale Mashenâka is running on a field, where there stands an oven. âTake the pie out, it is burning,â the oven says. Mashenâka takes the pie out of the oven. Then an apple tree asks: âShake me.â Mashenâka shakes the tree. But the bad girl just runs ahead and does not help anyone. And she will end up badly.

Undoubtedly, Robert Davis and others describe a learning process, but their accounts lack Brydenâs metaphorical emphasis on surprise, which further accentuates their desperation. The same is true for Brydenâs afï¬rmation that â[e]ach person with dementia is as worthy and precious as a beautiful newborn baby, a gift for us all to cherishâ (170). This view counters Spohrâs objectifying or Ernauxâs helpless use of the child metaphor; and it brings out how differently Bryden perceives of her situation as compared to Taylor. But it also illustrates how strongly metaphorical language relies on the context in which it develops.22 Brydenâs inferred emphasis on the patient as being the opportunity of growth and development reaches far beyond the perception of McGowinâs, Leeâs or, indeed, Taylorâs âstill being ableâ as counteracting the disabling notions of the child metaphor. Her conceptualisation of growth is necessarily linked to her retrospectively working through the illness experience, with the second chance giving her the opportunity to live out her gratitude. Such a reading adds to a positive reception of her narrative, as gratitude is considered an optimistic coping strategy in the confrontation with age-related decline.23 But Brydenâs linguistically suggested presence is only partially reï¬ected in the dynamics of her narrative that sets out to chronicle her frequent journeys to support DASNI and ADI, but then mutates into a collection of revised talks she had given during these trips. These essays relate â[w]hat it feels like to live with dementiaâ (97) or the âmany ways to helpâ (122), and, thus, excellently lend themselves to teaching good pharmaceutical care. Together with further information-containing appendices, these essays encompass over half of the book. Alluding to Taylorâs formal choices, this arrangement conï¬rms Brydenâs ongoing cognitive challenges, to which she, however, owns up very openly: It has been a tremendous struggle to collect together all my thoughts, talks, speeches, correspondence, notes and so on, for the last six years. Inspiration, rather than memory, has been the thread that enabled me to weave these disjointed fragments into this book. (173)"

Concepts from attribution theory (Harvey, Madison, Martinko, Crook, & Crook, 2014; Heider, 1958) are useful for making sense of the responses from the doctors who denied fallibility and appealed to bad luck in order to explain bad outcomes. People tend to have an innate interest in understanding the causes of their own and othersâ successes and failures. An agentâs self-attributions can be internal, pointing to individual efforts and skills, or external, pointing to factors beyond the agentâs control. As mentioned in Chap. 1, a football coach can explain his teamâs success in a cup final to be a result of âworld class coachingâ, and thus engage in internal attribution, and a loss in a crucial game as down to bad refereeing or injuries to his own players, applying an external attribution strategy. Learning from failure depends on a realistic balance between internal and external attribution. That appeared to be absent in the case of the veteran doctors who refused to participate in a talk about failures. When you say that bad luck was the sole explanation for a negative outcome, you also indicate that you have nothing to learn from carefully studying the case at hand, inviting colleagues to evaluate your work, and to consider whether you could have done things differently. In the case of a successful outcome, the tendency to engage in internal attribution, explaining it primarily to be a result of individual expertise and effort can also hamper learning, in that fortunate dimensions of the situation are ignored. The shift in selfunderstanding in the light of success and failure can also be interpreted as a move from understanding oneself as an agent, to understanding oneself as a mere pawn (NygÃ¥rd, 2007). Attribution error happens when a person over- or underestimates his or her own contribution to a particular outcome (Ross, Amabile, & Steinmetz, 1977). Doctor Westadâs immediate acknowledgement of responsibility appears to have been motivated by a wish to prevent the parents from committing the attribution error of taking part of the blame for the babyâs death. A relevant development in research on attribution has been to move beyond the distinction between internal and external, to include relational attribution in explanations of outcomes (Eberly, Holley, Johnson,"

India officially requires a research visa, but despite being formally democratic, it is very restrictive in giving out visas for any politically sensitive research, such as in our case repression in the context of subnational authoritarianism, but also, for instance, on the Maoist insurgency or other armed groups, or any research on Kashmir. Our first visit to the field was often different from subsequent experiences in terms of our purpose for going. Our Iran researcher came primarily to study the language, our Kazakhstan researcher was working for an international organization, and our India researcher felt that, as a master student, the line between just âhanging outâ as someone who is interested in the country and being there as an academic researcher was still quite fluid. Once we were set on our career course, this kind of convenient ambiguity has tended to dissipate. Even our China researcher, a Chinese national who grew up in the country, now clearly goes as a researcher, not just someone visiting home. So, how do we enter the country nowadays? Sometimes, we go on tourist visa. Tourist-friendly countries like Malaysia, Morocco, or Mexico make it very easy to enter the countryâindeed Europeans can stay in Morocco for three months without even applying for a visa. There is something uneasy about doing research on a tourist visa or without a permit, especially where a research visa or permit does in fact exist. But a tourist visa does not imply that we are treating the purpose of our presence as a secret. We all carry letters from our home universities, signed by a head of department or university official, explaining our research, but we have rarely had occasion to produce them. Our Morocco researcher writes âstudy, work and tourismâ or âwork and tourismâ on her immigration form. Our India and Mexico researcher has conducted interviews with local policemen and magistrates while on a tourist visa. The experience is that state officials are not in the habit of questioning whether one has a research visa or permit: how you came into the country is not really their concern. Nonetheless, the lack of an official stamp of approval can make us vulnerable, or at least make us feel vulnerable. Our Morocco researcher applied for official approval for her research on Salafists after experiencing intrusive surveillance, an experience detailed in Chap. 5. She applied not because she expected to get permission (and indeed she never received a response to the request) but simply in order to signal that she was not doing clandestine research."

Pelletier Language enables us to talk about the world, to convey information to one another about ourselves and our surroundings in a reliable fashion. What properties of language and its uses underlie this remarkable fact? What allows language to serve as a guide to the world and to enable us to learn from what others have perceived (seen, heard, felt, smelled) without having to duplicate their perceptual experience ourselves? Informational significance does not require that language links to the world in ways that are predetermined by the physical structure of our environment. Nor does it require that environmental information is simply registered or received without active input from perceiving and thinking human minds. Yet it does probably require a regular and systematic correspondence between language and the shared environment, what is publicly accessible to many different human minds. If you are skeptical about informational significance, consider the use of language in giving directions, warnings, recipes, planning joint activities, describing events. Things occasionally misfire, but by and large such uses of language are remarkably effective. Language could not work at all in such ways were it not imbued with some kind of informational significance, being about matters in a public world. (pp. 11â12)"

These institutions are total or partial immersive environments where learning is advanced through setting, personnel, facilities, conversation, practice, ritual, and relationships, and they seem to have demonstrated a record of success. To be clear, the educational power of these programs derives not only from the amount of time, but more significantly from their immersiveness, from their capacity to submerge young people in a âtotalâ experience. It suggests that, if we are to do better at achieving the multi-dimensional outcomes of Israel education, we need to more effectively utilize the full immersive capacity of our educational institutions. In that sense, it can be said that Israel education should live in a broad totality of frameworks. It needs to totally permeate the lives of educational institutions: in mission statements, the consciousness of lay and professional leaders, formal and informal curricula, walls, halls, buses, music, holidays, and foods. Goffman believed that the non-verbal, non-cognitive, non-discursive elements of a culture are as important, or more so, for conveying cultural norms as the written word or the âclassroom lesson.â Numerous studies of unique school and other educational institutions across time and place echo this point1 (Bettelheim 1950; A.S. Neill 1970; Redl and Wineman 1957; Peshkin 1986). There is a notion often indigenous to schooling that there are core contents and âsubjectsâ which constitute âcurriculumâ, and there are clubs, sports, hobbies, arts, and culture which are âextracurricularâ or secondary activities that enrich and embellish. In fact, the reality may be just the opposite. Indeed, in Israel education, it is these âextrasâ that very often are the educational essence. Sometimes a song, a story, a person, a fable, a recipe, or a picture connected to Israel touches those thousands of neurons in the mind, which lead to feeling, thinking, and doing. The immersive approach to Israel education argues that the distinction between âextraâ and âcoreâ is not compelling, since people learn and are affected in diverse ways. Donât regard the fluff as extra trim; for some, it may be the entryway into the heart of the matter. Essentially, what is being suggested is that educators must learn to âthink immersivelyâ. Thinking immersively involves a sophisticated approach to education, which calls upon educators to co-opt a totality of senses, foci, and resources. Educators need to be cognizant of the conditions that constitute the given framework (ideological or denominational affiliation, size of institution, architecture of the institution, staff), and they should"

We wanted a compensation package that reflects that, and we wanted everyone to be aligned toward the same outcome. Every employee has a stake in the companyâs futureâengineers, sales personnel, drivers, janitors, everyone. The way it works is that every new employee signs an Employee Stock Option Agreement that entitles them to purchase shares at a strike price in the event of an acquisition or IPO. We also pay competitive salaries, so there arenât any real trade-offs. Itâs the best of both worlds. Some time back I heard you talk about the âPayPal Maï¬a of East Africa.â What makes it so valuable? Silicon Valley is both ecosystem and mindset. The ecosystem is a function of mature capital markets, supportive institutions, and experienced entrepreneurs. Itâs common to see successful entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley become investors, and for good reason: They offer capital and, more importantly, empathy and expertise. Look for example at all of the consumer Internet companies you know today, the big ones, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc. Most of them have PayPal employees invested in them. So when PayPal IPOed, it made a huge number of millionaires, and now those employees are seeding entire generations of investment and starting new companies. You see it in 500 Startups, too. I mean, itâs all over the placeâPeter Thiel with Palantir, Elon Musk with SpaceX and Tesla. These are all PayPal people. We want to see that same ecosystem develop in East Africa. Specifically, we talk about building the âPayPal Mafia of East Africaâ because we want our team to become the first batch of entrepreneurinvestors in the region. Their experience building a company and withstanding the ebbs and flows of entrepreneurship are a real and lasting asset. Whatâs happened here so far is that different parts of the ecosystem are developing parallel to one another. You have the incubators like iHub,"

78,313,0.992,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"Much has been written about the shrinking of the private, the blurring of the public/ private divide and, for instance, the loss of privacy in public (notably Nissenbaum 1997). Such shrinking, loss and blurring have been attributed to either the lure of self-publication in web 2.0 (Cohen 2012), or to the secretive trading with and spying on our behavioural data in the course of pervasive computing (Cohen 2012; Hildebrandt 2012). Maybe we should return to Arendt (1958), when she spoke of the private as a sphere of necessity (the household), the public as the space for freedom (political action) and âthe socialâ as the emergence of mass society (bureaucracy, individual self-interest and conformity). Her understanding of âthe socialâ or what she called âsocietyâ is not altogether positive, to put it mildly. Is the rise of web 2.0 antithetical to âthe socialâ, because it concerns communication of one-2one, one-2-many as well as many-2-many, rather than many-2-one? Or does the processing of Big Data present us with âthe socialâ come true, where âthe socialâ is constituted by machine-readable bits and pieces that allow for the ultimate version of what Heidegger (1996) called âdas rechnende Denkenâ (calculative thinking)? I am not sure, and I believe the jury is still out. The answer will depend on empirical evidence of how âthe socialâ continues to evolve in smart environments. I do think that Arendtâs understanding of the private and the public might save us from dichotomous thinking, as well as from the glorification of âprivate lifeâ as a sphere of uncontroversial freedom. Simultaneously, we must come to terms with the fact that her glorification of the public sphere has little connection with present day politics, which rather fall within the scope of her depiction of âthe socialâ. We should also note that her glorification of politics as a âtheatre of debateâ (other than the realm of household economics) is rooted in an appreciation of privacy as âsome darker ground which must remain hidden if it is not to lose its depth in a very real, non-subjective senseâ (Arendt 1958, S. 71). To speak and act âin publicâ one must leave the security of oneâs home. But to distinguish oneself and to take the risk of being refuted, requires courage, daring and a place to hide. To recuperate from the tyranny of public opinion (Mill 1859) we need a measure of opacity to re-constitute the self, far from the social pressures that could turn us into obedient self-disciplined subjects (Hutton et al. 1988). In fact I would agree with Butler (2005), where"

In other words, if we would encourage discussions of norm-clariï¬cation, we have to create awareness of these powerful cultural discourses and narratives that guide us to repetition and reproduction. Whatever we do, we cannot wash the human brain clean of language and history (which would indeed create yet other problems); but that said, being more observant of our automatic ways of positioning others and ourselves could be a way forward towards creating more space for fruitful discussion, including the discussions of norm-clariï¬cation that Christie called for."
78,343,0.992,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In âthe Vita activa and the Modern Ageâ section of The Human Condition (Arendt 1959) , Arendt explains how the invention of the telescope changed the relationship between truth and appearance. âTruth was no longer supposed to appearâ¦to the mental eye of a beholderâ (Arendt 1959, p. 263). Indeed, as the telescope has demonstrated that we are fooled by our senses, ânothing could be less trustworthy for acquiring knowledge and approaching truth than passive observation or mere contemplation. In order to be certain, one had to make sure, and in order to know, one had to doâ (Arendt 1959, p. 263). The telescope has undermined deeply and for centuries our epistemological confidence in what we perceive without instruments, either by our senses or by mere thinking and contemplation. As a result, âin modern philosophy and thought, doubt occupies much the same central position as that occupied for all the centuries before by the Greek thaumazein, the wonder at everything that is as it isâ (Arendt 1959, p. 249). This has had a great effectiveness in the relationship with nature and the universe. Without the Cartesian âde omnibus dubitandum estâ (âeverything should be doubtedâ), we would not have taken the same technological path nor landed on the moon. The Cartesian doubt has shaped the relationship of men to nature in terms of questions to be answered through"
233,61,0.992,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Human Emotional Responses to the Natural World It is also claimed that biodiversity is valuable because the psychological makeup of human beings causes them to feel an intimate connection with the natural world which might be expressed variously in emotions such as love of, or respect for, nature. The idea that such emotional responses are a result of our evolved psychology was promoted by Wilson (1984) and Kellert and Wilson (1993). We note that the so-called Biophilia Hypothesis has received limited support in the literature (Simaika and Samways 2010 p. 903), but let us assume for the moment that we do share a common innate love of nature. There are two important problems with grounding conservation in common emotional responses. Firstly, such responses are not always reliable guides to rational action. There is after all some fundamental fact about human beings that also causes them to see cigarettes as valuable. We donât think that this implies that we should âconserveâ cigarettes, because we donât think that this common emotional response is adaptive. Human beings feel positively disposed toward all sorts of things that are not actually good for us. But if we must then judge the adaptiveness of our feelings toward biodiversity, it seems that conservation justiï¬ed thereby would not be a consequence of our feelings towards biodiversity, but rather of the utility of biodiversity to human populations (to which we turn shortly). Secondly, people clearly differ a great deal in the extent to which they feel positive emotions toward biodiversity (Einarsson 1993). If a general measure of biodiversity is to be inferred from emotional responses to biodiversity, then it seems that we will either have to discount the responses of outliers or average across a relatively large range of responses. Finally, this style of justiï¬cation for conservation suffers from the same problems as conservation based on intrinsic value. Even if it were true that almost everyone attached the same equally strong positive emotion to the conservation of the biosphere, it is hard to see how we could turn universal love of nature into a practically applicable general measure of biodiversity. For these reasons, we think it"
155,367,0.992,New Vision 2050 : a Platinum Society,"because the productivity per unit area is not high, private enterprises cannot easily undertake such ventures. It may be that there is a necessity to reorganize the delineation with respect to how far the state should be involved and from where private enterprises should be left to their own devices. Yoshikawa It varies from industry to industry, but I would like to see the government doing everything it should. Komiyama Renewable energy has seen growth because the government created a system whereby they buy renewables at a fixed price. Yoshikawa There are some people who claim that it created a bubble, but if you look at it holistically, I believe this is just a part of the ups and downs. I think that there is a great role to be played by the country and the government. Komiyama I also think so. Yoshikawa The government must, I believe, play a role as a coordinator. That is to say, responding to the problems related to the environment and energy, and the aging society is certainly necessary for humanity in the twenty-first century. It seems to me that, as opposed to having a single industry solve a given problem, such as the aging society, for example, that the entire system will need to be revamped. It seems that everything, like buildings, transportation, and distribution â almost everything as we know it â will change. Konishi Yes, the industrial structure changing to that of the Platinum Society. Yoshikawa The technology developed in each specialized field has to be bundled together and integrated horizontally, so that what are essential should be produced at the end. Komiyama I believe that we are entering an era where that will be possible. If we can appropriately combine technologies and knowledge we already have, it can be done. Thatâs why the horizontal axis becomes important. Yoshikawa For example, the vehicles used in the emergency medical field will probably become smart cars, but that means that the departments that become the destination points for those emergency vehicles will also have to incorporate new technology and change. This is where it becomes necessary that there be a coordinator for facilitating the horizontal integration. Komiyama If an attempt were made to configure the emergency medical system by new technology such as drones, GPSs, smart cars, etc., it would run up against the vertical hierarchy of the government bureaucracy. So, I believe that this is the type of problem that needs to be solved by the government."

She questioned the ânaturalâ when she examined working conditions in different global regions. Boserup led the way in contextualising the division of labour as socially and culturally constructed, although she used different terminology at that time. I will return in the next section to the way she perceived the âstatus of womenâ. In the livelihood approach, we must consider all the work that is required within a community and its household units to organise daily survival strategies. Thus, we need a more holistic view that bears in mind that the activities for peopleâs livelihoods include more than the productive sphere, which is the focus of some narrow economic approaches. Therefore, I believe that Boserup has offered us an inspiring and multidimensional concept."
75,181,0.992,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","various realms of modern societies. Therefore, one could argue that Facebook has not just reached the critical mass to survive, but a hyper-critical mass, overpowering its competitors. While the concentration of users in principle serves the functionality of a SNS and thereby also its users, the power which is accumulated in this way has to be critically observed. On a general level, this has been already a subject of intensive public as well as academic debates which we cannot discuss here in detail. The main concern seems to be privacy-related: Facebook gathers vast amount of data about personal lives and gives its users only very opaque options to control what can be seen by others, including external companies which may have access to this data. This is also a major obstacle for the academic usage of Facebook. On the one hand, the technical hurdle for the academic usage of Facebook is very low for users who already apply the platform for their private lives on a daily basis. On the other hand, this may be exactly what holds them back if they do not wish to blend their professional and their private lives in this way. At the same time, some researchers are reluctant to disseminate work in progress as they feel it is imperfect or because they fear competitiveness (Harley et al. 2010, p. 13). Although this is a general issue of academic social media usage, it is particularly pressing when a companyâs business model depends on the exploitation of user data as in the case of Facebook or Google. Moreover, once a SNS has reached a hyper-critical mass, it creates new dependencies, as it works like a black hole: The bigger it gets, the more people are drawn to it, the more content is produced, and so on. Therefore, it becomes increasingly difficult to separate from it. A lot of time has been invested in learning to operate the platform, building networks, discussing issues, editing profiles, creating publication lists, tagging items, etc. Most of this data and effort cannot easily be extracted and imported into another platform, so the hurdle to leave it becomes higher and higher, especially if it is still frequently used by other relevant communication partners. Then it may be (perceived as a) significant part of an individualâs or organizationâs social capital, leading to low mobility of users from social network sites with a hyper-critical mass, creating a self-stabilizing force in turn. This partially explains the ââseductive powerââ (Oosthuyzen 2012) of such sites, making users stay even if they do not agree with its policies or are unsatisfied with its services. At the same time, it is very difficult for alternative SNS providers to compete with this accumulated power which also attracts third-party services like apps. So, although the functionality of a SNS is increased when it concentrates a vast number of users, such a monopoly-like market situation comes at a price. In the academic context, this is particularly troubling when the SNS is outside the influence of the academic realm. Commercial providers like Facebook do not only have a questionable privacy policy, they also hardly let users participate in the platform designâespecially when it comes to such specific needs as scientific ones. Science-specific SNS are more likely to take this into account but they are still mostly in the hand of companies who ultimately decide about the platformâs design, policy, and existence. The worst case scenario is, of course, that a service is shut down because it is not profitable or does not fit anymore to a companyâs"
214,25,0.992,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"In order to describe climate modeling and the climate system, it is necessary to have a common conception of exactly what we are trying to simulate, and what a model actually is. What is climate? What is a model? How do we measure the uncertainty in a model? This chapter introduces some key terms and concepts. We start with some basic deï¬nitions of climate and weather. Everyone will come to this book with a preconceived deï¬nition of what climate and weather are, but separating these concepts is important for understanding how modeling of climate and weather are similar and why they are different. It also makes sense to discuss what a model is. Even if we do not realize it, we use models all the time. So we describe a few different conceptual types of models and put climate models in context. Finally we introduce the concept of uncertainty. As we discuss later in the book, models may have errors and still be useful, but this requires understanding the errors (the uncertainties) and understanding where they come from. Most of these concepts are common to many types of modeling, and we provide examples throughout the text."

One Tool Is Not Enough: We found that using one SAST tool is not enough to cover the whole range of security weaknesses at the implementation phase. This is synonymous with the findings by Austin and Williams [3] that compares different techniques across implementation and verification stages. It becomes obvious that developers have to tradeoff on some of their requirements. For instance, full language support might not be covered by one single tool and a single tool that covers many languages might suffer from low performances in many of them. Future research should focus on how to harmonize results from different tools for maximum performance. Toolsâ Capability Is Low: The capability of the tools is generally low with regards to detecting security weaknesses in the Juliet Java code. The commercial tool, although highly rated in the market is not an exception. This is very challenging for developers, as they need to focus on important security warnings and disregard the noise. One helpful way we found is to filter the results by using the CWE tag provided by some of the tools. For example, FindSecBugs, SonarQube and the Commercial tool provide support for this feature. Static Analysis Results Are Non-functional Requirements: Developers have hidden bias when it comes to fixing issues reported by static analysis tools. Statements such as: â. . . if you are just looking for functionality and spend a lot of time on making your system secure or safe and doing things that you are not getting paid for or the customers are not willing to pay for. . . â and â. . . And of course in itself is not productive, nobody gives you a hug after fixing SonarQube reports,. . . â demonstrate the challenges and need for making security as part of the development process and in a seamless manner. It shows a need for a top down approach where product owners (POs) are able to prioritize security and include it in the developersâ workflow. Since static analysis reports are nonfunctional requirements and not features, they never become user story in many cases in agile settings. However, it is possible to adopt the approach in Rindell et al. [22] by moving relevant toolâs report into the product backlog. Do Not Underestimate Integration Effort: Developers are wary of tools that take lots of effort to integrate. This is understandable, as it has cost implication both at the present and in the future. For instance, it would require increased effort to upgrade such tool if something breaks in it. An approach taken by Telenor Digital is to dedicate a resource person as responsible for toolsâ implementations, configurations, and maintenance. This is beneficial as it prevents the âhassle-factorâ and allows the agile team to focus squarely on business delivery."
48,36,0.992,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"In spite of the same time prediction instructions and the same prediction task, the meanings of the predictions differed greatly (see Table 3.2). In addition, a large proportion of the software developers, all of whom regularly produced and communicated time predictions, openly admitted that they did not really know what they meant by their time predictions. We have conducted several studies of this type in various contexts and they all show great variety in what is meant by a time prediction. This was the case even within a homogeneous context, such as within a single company. The studies also confirm that the meaning is usually not communicated by those producing the time prediction and that those receiving the predictions rarely requested such information. Requesting a time prediction without stating precisely what is wanted could lead to time predictions representing anything from best-case to risk-averse thinking. Much of what seem to be time prediction errors and unrealistic plans may simply be the consequences of poor communication of the meaning of the predictions. Sometimes people try to explain what their time prediction means by including verbal probabilities or qualifiers, such as âvery likely to take less than four hoursâ, âpossible to be completed in two daysâ, âwill take about three hoursâ, and âcan take 10 hoursâ. Such phrases are not only vague with a strongly context-dependent meaning [5], but also frequently misunderstood. The time prediction âit can be finished in five daysâ is, for example, likely to be understood differently by the person communicating it and the person receiving it. The person communicating it tends to think that five days is an extreme outcome, in this case, perhaps the best-case outcome. The person who receives the time prediction will, on the other hand, tend to interpret it as a likely outcome [6]. While using the word can ensures that you are never wrong (you never claimed that it was certain or even likely that the job would be finished in five days), it is certainly not a precise way of communicating time predictions. Similar interpretation challenges accompany the use of more than and less than. A task predicted to take more than 10 hours may, for example, be interpreted as larger than one predicted to take less than 20 hours [7]. The use of verbal probabilities and qualifiers, in spite of their frequent use in professional and daily life, turns out not to be very helpful when communicating time predictions. In some cases, we can make a good guess, perhaps based on the context and previous experience, of what is meant by a time prediction. If someone says, âIâll be there in 5 minutesâ, our previous experience with that person may tell us that this is a best-case time prediction. If nothing goes wrong, the person will be there in five to 15 minutes; otherwise, it may take much more time. In cases in which we have"
223,426,0.992,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"natural objects are treated as persons, although such anthropomorphization occurs as well. In many Australian examples, Aborigines do not just talk about the land and its features but may address it directly, as when expressing their respect or even their pity when the land has not been cared for properly. In Aboriginal Australia, a typical indication of a country1 that has not been cared for is that no one has set fire to it and that it should be visited (see Rose, 1995). Cases differ as to what is subject to personalization. It could be animals, various supernatural beings, sacred places orâmost commonlyâa combination thereof (as in the Australian case of totemic Dreaming beings that involve animals, superhuman creative beings, and places). The main and more general point is not that a certain set of beings (animate or inanimate) can feature as personalized subjects, as partners with whom one may reason. Rather, it seems that anything can become personalized if it is treated as a person, by which I mean that this some-thing is taken not as a thing, an instance of a category, but rather as a unique subject with which one interacts. By contrast, many phases of decision making in present day economics, for instance, entail processes of depersonalization and isolation. The procedures of reasoning are regarded not as a dialogue between persons but either as the interaction between users and computational systems or as abstract systemic processes devoid of personal relations, aspirations, and apprehensions. Therefore, both the style of the dialogue and the partners in the dialogue may be much more variable than is apparent. Beyond this case of foragers on the move, it may be wise to consider procedural rationality broadly enough to allow inclusion of variations in how procedures unfold as particular forms of dialogue and how partners in this dialogue are personalized or depersonalized. Rationality would thereby cease to be a purely mental phenomenon. Instead, it would reside partially in forms of social communication and interaction as well as in features of the environment that western philosophy and science tend to discount as irrelevant but that can be important triggers or partners in the procedure of reasoning. Why does abductive reasoning describe my ethnographic cases so aptly? I do not think its capacity to do so is coincidental. Rather, it is because this mode of inference is not a stand-alone mode but one that is tied closely to the interacting, corporeal, and relational social beings that we humans are."

To help with the answer we now turn to our interview results. Our main concerns are how much scholars know about these DH developments, how engaged they feel with them and, more generally, what attitudes they hold towards the DH. It is important to stress at the outset that almost none of our respondents had been specifically selected for their interest in the DH. We asked: Is the development of digitisation changing the nature of research practice in your field? Do researchers in your field have the necessary skills to make the most out of the digital resources available to them? Lack of engagement? The first point to make is that few of the respondents gave detailed answers and discussed the DH with reference to specific projects that had affected their own research or at least impacted their field. In fact, only seven respondents gave any detailed kind of unprompted answer. All the rest answered the question in very general terms."

In nature, we see that a heartbeat elevates out of control, up to the level of a heart attack, if not compensated with rest through respiration and recovery. Death is then a serious possibility. Analogously, the economy will not survive if not oxygenized with fundamental innovation for change. In certain cultures, the executive and the population become partners in seeking sustainable progress together. That is what occurred in Eindhoven with AiREAS. AiREAS created a new Kondratiev energy, a new social economic resonance. This compensates for the old, singular one. Such events have everything to do with the people involved. In some cultures, the hierarchy of power is so demanding that a sustainocratic partnership is out of the question. In others, like in Eindhoven, both those at the executive level and the academically-educated population related more to shared authority and responsibility than to a systemic blockage maintained out of accumulated self-interest and manipulated directives. In our ï¬rst publication, we already explained at great length the process of moving from individual to collective awareness and the complex process of letting go of old formats for the sake of sustainable progress. In practical reality, this means that regional development must also undergo a transformation. But essentially, it evolves.

We know this is not possible, even though there are many instances of representations of the Natural Numbers in perishable material media. Part of the reason for the more enduring nature of symbolic entities like the Natural Numbers is the very fact that they do not refer directly to speciï¬c objects in the physical or cultural world.

With advances in virtual reality, high bandwidth communications, wearable devices with various sensors and interaction modes, robotic telepresence, and collaborative systems, the notion of being there, without being there, will become an increasing possibility.

The increasing number of online courses is only a beginning of a shift in learning, when on-demand or on-the-fly learning might be part of work. Having the desired background and related skills will help, but a question remains as to how far rapid learning technologies can go to helping people get equipped on-the-fly. Changes in career pathways accompanied by uptake of new skills will become easier, perhaps only to be slowed down by the need for experience. â¢ Customising work will be an interesting possibility in the future. A job that needs to be done by someone can be decomposed in a number of different ways. The same job can be done in many different ways and by varying numbers of people, depending on how it is conï¬gured. Future technology in coordinating work might accommodate greater flexibility in this matter."

Here of course we ï¬nd a strong link with the emphasis on mind-sets in this book, and my call to integrate political economy stems from what I ï¬nd to be a slightly naÃ¯ve conception of the origin and roles that ideas and paradigms play in political processes and their relation with power. While hardly anyone would explicitly argue against values like the protection of future generations or our environment, the devil lies instead in the detailâin this case the worldviews held. The same value set might lead to very different proposed solutions, given differing worldviews and their focuses. Mainstream economic mind-sets tend not to support the regulation of markets precisely because this would hamper individual freedom, happiness, creativity and meritocracyâvalues to which most people would subscribe. In one paragraph, the report mentions that Karl Polanyiâs interpretation of the industrial revolution, The Great Transformation (1944), describes how âattitudes and considerations inspired by personal beneï¬t maximisation have established themselvesâ and that with mass production, âthe âgood lifeâ has increasingly become synonymous with material wealthâ (WBGU 2011a: 67). The proposals for change in the report, however, leave this deep cultural wiring and its mental path dependencies unchallenged. Hence, it does not say how the observed value shifts can be implemented if there is no discussion of the paradigm behind the evidence and narratives used to argue which policies are suitable to embed the shift."

From a Lacanian-Bachtinian perspective, it is clear that the âweâ functions as a grammatical operationalisation of S2: the replaceable, un-subjective, decidedly impersonal subject of science. But it also covers up the exploitation and expropriation of the servant by the Master (âWe, the Master, did thisâ). And Leahâs therapeutic intervention proves effective, for from now on, Stafford begins to pay attention to Cantorâs use of the term âweâ (or âourâ), which suddenly may give way to âIâ or âmineâ. For instance, he now notices that Cantor informs him that the Krauss team is having troubles repeating âyourâ experiment, and that there may be something the matter with âyourâ notebooks, while he consistently speaks about âourâ Nature article. In the latter case, there is âno ambiguity about ourâ (p. 89). In other words, Cantor uses the âweâ in such a way that he may safeguard his intellectual property rights, while attributing any experimental flaws to his assistant. From now on, Stafford begins to pay attention to (and even count) Cantorâs uses of the signifier âweâ (p. 83). Indeed, the use of the signifier âweâ proves highly symptomatic and, from the point of view of critical discourse analysis, a fascinating object of research. In response to Leahâs intervention, Celestineâs supervisor makes a telling confession. At a certain point in her career, she decided to change her name from Yardley to Ardley, in view of the importance of alphabetic order in the listing of author names: Let me confess something to you â¦ but promise not to spread it around â¦ When I was a senior at Brown [University] â and a very ambitious one, almost unpleasantly so â I paid very much attention to where my name would ultimately appearâ¦ To my fatherâs shock, I announced one day that I would change my name from Jean Yardly to Jean Ardleyâ¦ Yes.

Generally, we think thatâs exciting and a good thing, but it also means that itâs a challenge for universities and departments when it comes to evaluation and promotion. This is increasingly problematic and becoming more acute. ... My conception of interdisciplinarity is that it is one person whose work is addressed to multiple communities. When that is the case, it may be hard for those communities to feel like the person is fully theirs. Sometimes the closest fields have the most difficulty agreeing on standards of excellence and what is authorship. That can be dangerous for junior faculty. [It] requires that junior faculty must be very proactive, making sure they are communicating with their groups [and] must have a disciplinary home, a core discipline. If you veer too far from home, that can be dangerous. E5: On the one hand, the interdisciplinary trend is, in some parts of the competitive stream, encouraged; thatâs the ERC trend, the European Science Foundation trend (essentially the ERC trend) and also in some parts of national funding. For example, our government in Denmark strongly encourages interdisciplinary research and, in a recent evaluation of the research council system that was published a few years ago, it was one of the major recommendations. So thatâs one trend. You have goals that prioritise interdisciplinary research and on the other hand you have very strong gearing of governing publications that have a very good track record, have a very high gate impact factor, and so forth. And that sort of pushes research towards overspecialisation. E14: Some will promote interdisciplinary research. ... But research is mainly monodisciplinary in our humanities faculty although politics and the rectorat tend to encourage interdisciplinary research. The basic issue is that the institutional incentives may be working in contradictory directions. When it comes to individual hiring and promotion, publishing monodisciplinary books and journals is paramount. But, at the same time, some funding bodies and senior academic administrators are promoting interdisciplinary research. This tension can manifest itself in a number of ways.

When we had seen each other several times, they sometimes asked me what my research will be about, even though I had told them when we met first. What I was actually doing seemed less important than the fact that I am a midwife. A midwifeâs presence nearby a pregnant or childbearing woman seems to be selfevident. Secondly, trust is intensified in bodily interaction and in relation to the degree of intimacy. Thirdly, trust is a strategy to handle potentially shaming and even molesting situations.16 Helma had been attended by the same midwife during both of her pregnancies, births and postpartum stages. She told me about the âbasic trustâ she would have for her midwife and the midwife would have for her. So I asked her what the midwife did that lets her, Helma, be this confident. Apparently it is more important what Helma herself does in order to establish and maintain a trustful relationship: âI open up completely. But I didnât have any problems with it from the beginning on. You lay down and you are examined [vaginally]. Somehow this is the most normal thing in the world. And that, I think, is so niceâ. Helma describes trust and her capacity to abandonment relating to the midwife in the context of intimate physical interventions. Being examined vaginally out of an explicitly sexual context in agreement with all interactors is just not âthe most normal thing in the worldâ. It seems to be the intimate intervention which âopens up Helma completelyâ. Helma legitimizes the vaginal examination by trusting and by perceiving it as being âthe most normal thing in the worldâ. Samia described it very similarly: âI would say the head was turned off, one simply did what was said, because then one had confidence, too, and one knew that one was in good hands and at the end comes the childâ. Being trustful is also a legitimizing consequence of handing over responsibility to the midwife. Samia is following advice in order to achieve a purpose, which is giving birth to her child. Being trustful seems to be without any alternative. Finally, women expect to have an intensive and trustful relationship with the midwife as DÃ¶rte explained: And that I know somehow for this period I can build up a very intensive relationship. Not only in prenatal and postnatal care but also that in the middle so to speak. That self-indulgence and intimacy somehow. And"

In this chapter, we show what is missing from this analysis, which is any account of power. The chapter thus takes up an analysis of how power works in an interdisciplinary space â setting out, in particular, some of the different financial, epistemic, and cultural resources that belong to different disciplines. But if the chapter sets itself against one fantasy (fair exchange), it also wants to dispel another â and this is the fantasy of power confronted by the frankly-spoken truth. The chapter argues instead for what it might mean to think interdisciplinary collaboration as a practice of subjugation, which different collaborators may just have to learn to live with."

You only need to watch the stage closely. This is not a moral judgment. Luckily, it takes all kinds. The question remains of the concept of thinking that is inimical to actors. What do actors, and by no means only actors, mean by thinking when this prejudice takes hold of their heads and hearts? Theater and thinking have long had an ambivalent relationship involving a conflict, the roots of which go back to antiquity. On the one hand, ancient philosophers considered the act of thinking, in analogy to theater, as the practice of contemplation (theoria), in which the person philosophizing could, in a state of amazement (thaumÃ¡zeo) apprehend the actual truth (Ã³ntos on theÃ³s). On the other hand, Plato in particular believed theater was the adversary of thinking because, due to its intimacy with the realm of the emotions, it is closest to that part of being human which is furthest removed from the best in us â the noetic realm of reason.4"

But such a capability is meaningless if the inconvenience of finding and collecting candidates, for repeated side-by-side comparison, is too high. As the saying goes, âIn theory, theory is sufficient; in practice it isnât.â Thus, the efficiency of every step of the transclusion ecosystem is critical to the degree transcludable material will be used. Factors such as how well collections of material are organized will likely dramatically affect what actually happens, no matter the richness of the possibilities. Indeed, building on the well-known expression: If it isnât written, it doesnât exist. We might add: If itâs not in the library, it doesnât exist. (and) If itâs in the library, but is too hard to find, it doesnât exist. But in addition to accessibility is the issue of just what can be done with transcludable material. Since the purpose of most knowledge artifacts is to contribute something original, simply reusing existing material, as is, may not provide value sufficient for the task at hand. Thus expanding the set of transformations that can be performed on the transcluded material beyond exact copyingâis a way of expanding the design space for transclusion. This in turn admits for higher âvalueâ peaks that greatly increase the ROI of effort invested."

Notwithstanding, it also serves as a problem to always insist that there are two sides to everything and that they are necessarily equally compelling. Fifty/fifty journalism may be based on a misperception of the ideals of balance and objectivity (Korsgaard 2017). An extreme case would be to confront a flat Earth believer with a scientist presenting the idea that the sun is at the center of things and treat the two as bona fide equal, cosmological positions. The fact that people have a right to their opinion does not mean that all opinions are equally cogent. Besides, although you have a right to your own opinions, you donât have a right to your own facts Daniel Moynihan once instructed us. When the angle is exaggerated or the framing extreme, the result may be sins of omission. If you insist on focusing on the approximately 9% of youth in Denmark that have been sentenced at least for violating the criminal code, then you might leave undone the bulk of youth being law-abiding citizens. Or if the majority of stories published about Muslims focus exclusively on the small minority committing crimes and/or supporting a radical or version of Islam, it generates a misleading and nonrepresentative picture of the real world and its risks. It may generate lots of clicks but also a great deal of indignation, fear, and polarization. Akin to sharpening the frames is cherry picking: You pick exactly the cherries from the tree suiting the case in point but ignore or suppress others. In politics, it means omitting the facts not fitting the program, perspective, or point of view. Facts become something to use or ignore according to needs. It undermines the conditions for evidence-informed politics. Doctoring of statements may also occur by dint of misrepresentation. Only about an hour after Nigel Farage, the leader of the British campaign for leaving the European Union, had proclaimed victory in the Brexit vote, he had to admit to the TV cameras that a crucial number his campaign had been based on was incorrect.

But, and this is whatâs fantastic about theater, on the next night, the next performance date, it can be repeated and new life can be breathed into it at each repetition. It can be repotentialized. What does that mean? Each individual performance is saved in the actorâs memory as a result of the rehearsal process â all directions, all the right and wrong turns, thoughts, feelings, texts, contexts, appearances, entrances, exits â the entire fabric of scenes and dialogues. They have been inscribed within him and memorized. He can draw from them and play them again and again, and each performance lays down another memory pathway, so that his archive continually becomes fuller and richer. But only if the actor risks what has been before and frees it can he again electrify it. Only if he time and again and once more risks opening his acting to the uncertainty of his movements does a performance take off. This act of creative repetition is what makes acting so electrifying. It is its aesthetic desire, for the actors and for the audience. It opens all involved to a temporal piece of art that defies common sense, the reason of the everyday. Or perhaps it opens them to the gift of the muses that allows the dawning of an era in which the law of chronology no longer holds. The actor looks to the remembered past. He brings it into the present word for word, situation for situation and at the same time sends it into the future word for word, situation for situation by taking all that has happened and again exposing it to the openness of the present. In this way, he secures the future of his acting. There is no closure, because it is reopened in every performance. The actor may be chained to the chronology of the plot and to a certain setting, but in the kairos of time â in the present, past, and future â he can again find, recognize, develop, and remember new and ever more complex meanings in the play and its performative form. He can make good on something he maybe owes the play. He can go back to what has been in time and make up for lapses after the fact. For this reason the difference in each repeated performance is always also an act of freedom and of liberation, an act of regeneration.51 He overturns the past and present because the future acts within him â always unique, always singular. For this reason it is not the same performance that is given each evening in each show with the same name, but each 51 Arno BÃ¶hler, âNietzsche â Vom regenerativen Charakter des GemÃ¼ts,â psycho-logik 2, Existenz und GefÃ¼hl (2007)."

The following is a possible template: Who (stakeholder A) needs what (requirement) to do what (task) to fulï¬l what (motive). For instance, Peter needs a calm place with electricity supply and place for his laptop to work in the train to reduce his workload to gain time (motive) to feel that the time has used meaningfully (latent motive). This POV has once again to be validated by the chosen stakeholder group. Especially the reaction of the stakeholders by confronting them with the latent motive might lead once again to new insights. One example, what else besides work brings a feeling of use time meaningfully in train? Hint: Technique to reveal latent motives are also called and described as âjob to be doneâ (Silverstein et al. 2012). Another technique is âpersonaâ that describes ab archetype of a stakeholder group. In principle, the deï¬ne phase ceases when an accurate deï¬nition of a POV exists. However, it might be that new insights emerge during the remaining three phases which require the POV to be reformulated and re-explored. Since this is possible, the speed by which the remaining three phases are executed becomes crucial. It is feasible to have a full-fledged POV within three or four days, when the team has expertise about the design scope. By formulating the POV the working mode of design team changes from formulating customerâs needs to ï¬nding solution for those needs. For our example: How might we support Peter in working efï¬ciently while he is travelling home from workplace during rush hour? The POV forces the team to focus.

What does this mean? It means that to distinguish a moral action from an amoral or immoral one, one cannot rely on judging outcomes, but has to focus on intentions and motives instead. For example, a person gives a substantial sum to charity. Common moral sense would make a clear distinction between the following motives for the donation: 1. The donor intends to conquer the heart of a loved one with this generous gesture. 2. The donor hopes that her contribution will secure a position for her nephew in the administration of the charity. 3. The donor was moved to tears by a TV advertisement asking for donations and immediately transferred money into the charityâs account. 4. The donor wanted to play her part in redressing injustice in the world. 5. The donor misread the instructions for an e-banking transaction and transferred money into the charityâs account by mistake. These actions seem to fall naturally into a moral hierarchy. Action 5, transfer by mistake, is morally neutral. Actions 1 and 2, with their hidden agendas, are morally deï¬cient, action 2 probably more so than action 1. Actions 3 and 4 are both morally praiseworthy, but oneâs upbringing and moral judgements would determine which one a person would deem more worthy.7 For instance, those who believe that empathy and compassion are the essence of morality, like David Hume (1711â 1776) and Arthur Schopenhauer (1788â1860), would rate action 3 more highly. Kant himself would favour action 4. How do human beings judge between good and bad actions? They require the human faculty of reason. Only because human beings are rational is it possible for them to be moral, to decide between right and wrong. This human ability to be rational and to make decisions is the basis for their dignity, according to Kant. Human beings have an âunconditional and incomparable worth that unlike a price admits of no equivalenceâ; they have dignity (Hill 1992: 202â203). Or as Kant says: [A] human being regarded as a person, that is, as the subject of a morally practical reason, is exalted above any price; for as a person â¦ he is not to be valued merely as a means to the ends of others or even to his own ends, but as an end in himself, that is, he possesses a dignity (an absolute inner worth) by which he exacts respect for himself from all other beings in the world. He can measure himself with every other being of this kind and value himself on a footing equal to them. â¦ Humanity in his person is the object of the respect which he can demand from every other human being (Kant 1996, 6:434 ff)."
245,1205,0.992,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"7 Concluding Remarks In the last few years, Romanian policymakers have done a lot to improve the universities in their country. They used evaluations to achieve this goal. The idea was that people in the universities would follow the guidance of external inspectors, in the form of state ofï¬cials, foreign evaluators or colleagues from other universities. But do professors change because inspectors tell them to? In the Romanian case, this is clearly not the case. Nearly everyone in the system is constantly engaged in one form of evaluation or another. And once one round of evaluation has ï¬nished, a new one begins immediately. Instead of having the time to change, the academic community is stuck on a âmerry-go-roundâ of evaluations. Many people in Romanian universities ï¬nd it difï¬cult to imagine that the evaluation system will be reformed. Some may even be sceptical of any new change of the legislative environment. But perhaps it is important to remember that evaluations are still a relatively new instrument in Romanian higher education. The quality assurance agency ARACIS was created in 2006, while the classiï¬cation, rankings and other evaluations were introduced only in 2011. Put differently, these instruments are not old enough to have become institutionalized, but they exist for long enough to be judged on their effectiveness. And we can be optimistic: many national level policy-makers indicate that they are willing to change the system, and recognize the problems mentioned in this paper. The recommendations in this chapter are based on the views of people who are stuck on this merry-go-round. The advantage of this type of analysis is that we are fairly certain that the people who are supposed to implement these"

By framing the issue in this way, we consider fragmentation as a negative and, as a corollary, consider unity as superior to fragmentation. Similarly, in our framing of relations with others, we often speak in binary terms: barriers (to be lifted), or walls (to be erected), for example. Thereby, we fail to pay proper attention to the quality and healthiness of interactions and relations between entities. We are too often inclined to think that the solution to our problems lies in greater leadership, or in upscaling power or control. In fact, sustainability rhetoric points to the need to rebalance the relationship to the self (focus on identity) with the relationship to the other (focus on interactions). Achieving both more integration and more diversity can only be done with a relaxed approach to identity and a constructive approach to otherness6. With the digital transition, the importance of interfaces and interoperability is central. The primacy of interactions becomes a matter of fact, and identity is to be seen as the result of all interactions, instead of as a control variable. One of the practical implications of this mental shift is to pay less attention to size, to minimise narcissist concerns, to go beyond the fragmentation diagnostic and to analyse instead how the quality and efficiency of interactions can be improved to serve the overall purpose."

We can place the preparation for, the experience of, and responses to critical events in a threefold temporal frame of what happens before, during, and after it takes place (Table 2). Childhood research indicates that overprotective parents and authorities pose an obstacle to healthy developments when they put restrictions on the childrenâs scope of action. The intention may be to put the childrenâs safety first, but one unintended outcome appears to be that their mental and physical development suffers. Risky play can crucially make the children aware of their own fallibility, and provides them with opportunities to learn to cope with their own and other peopleâs tendencies to make mistakes. When dramatic slips and blunders happen at work, they may not be overwhelmed and pacified by it, since they are used to such events from childhood. Initiatives to develop free-range kids should be encouraged from organizations, since, in the long-term, those are the people who are likely to be best prepared for the challenges of adult working life, through a growth mindset and through resilience. It is also through this kind of upbringing that children can learn to see themselves primarily as autonomous and responsible agents, and not as pawns that are moved around by forces beyond their own control."

As the epigraph to Chap. 3 eloquently evoked, having oneâs âpapersâ in order is fundamental to upholding these rights. Papers also need to be in order when contemplating international migration itself: for many of my respondents, the realisation that they needed proofs of identity in order to travel was the prompting factor in registering (i.e., registering their identity, their personhood) with the authorities. Many of my respondents did not procure birth certificates, let alone passports, until the time when, as young men, they thought about emigrating. This underlines the initial transition the men had to make from a society of origin where such modern proofs of identity were unnecessary for day-to-day living, to a new society where such documents of personhood are essential and everyday tools of inclusion. In Luhmannian terms, this individual act of migrating to Western Europe represents the transition to a functionally-differentiated society in microcosm. The men had spent the first twenty-five years of their lives quite happily without a piece of paper stating who they were. This changed abruptly when they began to be confronted by state officials demanding certain documents in exchange for certain rights being recognised. These demands have only grown stronger as the men make the transition to retirement, a testament of their life-long struggle to achieve social inclusion and uphold their rights. In summary, home can be about belonging to a territory, a localisable space, just as it can be about belonging to a social collective (household, community, nation). But I have argued that to be âat homeâ can also mean upholding oneâs claims to domicile and personhood in order to achieve inclusion in different social systems. To repeat, this is not to deny the importance of place-belonging and group-belonging as constitutive of home. Instead, it is to recognise the growing complexity of social relations. If Luhmannâs claim that society has become more complex and differentiated is accepted, then it becomes interesting to explore the implications of his theory for our thinking about home. Luhmannâs insights about societal inclusion are particularly relevant in light of a recent piece of legislation which uniquely targets older hostel residents and their relationship to home. The final section of the book considers the prospects for this legislation and the people it is addressed to."

When pondering about the benefits of technology we need to first and foremost address the concept of âuniversal valuesâ. It is just too often assumed that policing a given community is subject to a set of universal values and all it takes to improve police-community relations is to improve the communication process between these two entities, and when it comes to technology simply provide both parties with more efficient tools to report misconduct and respond to the call for service in a speedy manner. In reality, things are just much more complicated. While many of us would agree that killing a person, in a premeditated manner, or physically abusing a child should constitute some examples of these universal values, the truth is that in many communities, practices of genital mutilation, honour killings or child abandonments are not considered as horrific as many of us might think and, on the contrary, members of these communities would find such behaviours as acceptable and certainly not subject to report to the local law enforcement.

In comparison to the discourse of the hysteric, however, rather than simply allowing the craving/deflecting subject to take the floor so as to challenge and provoke the establishment (as happens in The Fiction Factory for instance), the craving subjects are questioned, and the question basically is: what is their desire, what is the object a (the object of desire) that is driving, haunting and addressing them, what is it that they want?

82,391,0.992,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"There are now two ways in which we could extend our investigation and go beyond one-dimensional chains. The first is to keep the one-dimensionality, but to look at loops rather than chains: this would take us to the second horn of Sellarsâs dilemma, where knowledge is pictured as Kundalini swallowing its own tail. The other way is to give up one-dimensionality altogether and to study multi-dimensional networks. This would take us to the coherentist caucus in epistemology, or rather to an infinitist version of it, in which ultimately the network stretches out indefinitely in infinitely many directions. It might seem that such a version will be especially vulnerable to the standard objection to coherentism, according to which coherentist networks of knowledge hang in the air without making contact with the world. Indeed, as Richard Fumerton noted, if we worry about âthe possibility of completing one infinitely long chain of reasoning, [we] should be downright depressed about the possibility of completing an infinite number of infinitely long chains of reasoningâ.2 Remarkably enough however, the opposite is the case. Since the connections between the propositions in the network are probabilistic in character, we are dealing with conditional probabilities. As we explained in Section 4.4, the conditional probabilities together carry the empirical thrust, and this is even more so in a multi-dimensional system than in a structure of only one dimension, for the simple reason that now there are more conditional probabilities that may be linked to the world. Extending the chains to networks thus enables us to catch it all: to develop a form of coherentism which not only is infinitist, but also acknowledges the foundationalist maxim that a body of knowledge worthy of the name must somehow make contact with the world.3 We start in Section 8.2 by discussing one-dimensional loops. We will see that, if justification is interpreted probabilistically, then it is in general un2 Fumerton 1995, 57. 3 Thus we do not have many quibbles with William Roche when he argues that"
395,137,0.992,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"The starting point for this chapter is that for lessons of past accidents to be learned, i.e. taken into account in future decision-making, experts must maintain a âsafety imaginationâ(Pidgeon and OâLeary 2000). A lack of safety imagination is linked to a psychological rigidity that restricts decision makers in their ability to link their work to the possible consequences. The question is therefore how a safety imagination can best be fostered. Researchers in the ï¬eld of naturalistic decision-making (e.g. Klein 1998) have identiï¬ed stories as an effective knowledge source for decision-making in critical contexts, because they are a powerful tool in pattern matching and mental simulation. Stories convert experiences into memorable, meaningful lessons (Klein 1998; Polkinghorne 1988). As Schank (1990) puts it, We need to tell someone else a story that describes our experience, because the process of creating the story also creates the memory structure that will contain the gist of the story for the rest of our lives."

Since people are perceived of as psychosocial beings, the interviewees did not want to separate these elements in their prayer, which is understood as a divine assignment. They often took illness and pain as somatization of unsolved emotional difficulties connected to a nonfunctional spiritual life, âbeing away from God.â Bodily disorders as well as mental and spiritual troubles were seen as being so tightly interwoven that the prayer team members found it difficult to distinguish between them. The most analytical account was given by an active prayer team member who was a neurologist by profession: Well, we hope, of course, soul. And I wouldnât even like to care for the mind there. I think mental care belongs to the psychiatrists. But naturally, we can pray for it and for healing, but we do not care for the mind at the prayer clinic. And the body â¦ we donât actually cure anything else either, we just pray, we give prayer service. But perhaps â¦ we donât really treat the soul either, it doesnât belong to us.

But the objective of this chapter is not to solve the (unsolvable?) replication problem (apparently more challenging even in social psychology than in science in general) about which so many books and papers have already been written. The question rather is what a dialectical-psychoanalytical view can contribute to our understanding of Stapelâs misconduct in response to the challenges emerging in his âimpossible professionâ. Was his misconduct perhaps a (misguided) response to the replication crisis and other embarrassing problems occurring in this type of university discourse? There may be more continuity between âfabricationâ (in the non-normative sense) of social psychological facts âbackstageâ, and the âfabricationâ (now in a pejorative sense) of fraudulent data published in Stapelâs papers than the committees (in their persistent use of metaphors such as âcleansing operationâ) seem able or willing to acknowledge. What I find remarkable is that the three committees, while claiming to have âscrutinizedâ a whole body of work, fail to address the methodological discussions that are part of this work (discussions which increasingly reflect a sense of despair on the part of the author). As if âscrutinizingâ an oeuvre means something else than reading and addressing its content, but I will return to this issue below. Interestingly, Stapelâs fraud has been regarded as an experiment in itself. Question: how often and to what extent can an established scientist commit fraud before it is detected? Abma cites a colleague who argued that we should seriously consider the possibility that Stapelâs fraud is actually a research trial, involving his peers and colleagues as research subjects, and that we should not be surprised if he (Stapel) at a certain point decides to publish an analysis of his results (2013, p. 157). What is pointed out here is that the technique of deception of research subjects (which is accepted practice in social psychology) is applied by Stapel to the research community as such. What is the crucial normative difference between these two instances of deception?"
46,156,0.992,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"suggest that this particular characteristic puts them in a position where special obligations arise. In summary, it is crucial for both the liability model and the social connection model of responsibilities to identify specific agents of justice. The liability model puts the focus on the intended causation of harm (or the knowing omission of an act causing harm); it is predominantly backward looking and suitable to circumstances where the causal relationships are clear and where agents who deliberately and knowingly bring about and keep up morally untenable outcomes can be located. The social connection model, in contrast, starts from the assumption that many injustices cannot be grasped in this way, because causal relationships are blurry and those contributing to and upholding unjust social structures have no bad intentions. It suggests, however, that there are different grounds for attributing different agents with different kinds and degrees of responsibilities, depending on their social positions. According to Young, primarily the categories of power, privilege, interests and collective abilities can be used to decide who actually has which responsibilities to act. We think Youngâs model provides a very helpful way of looking at responsibilities for justice. However, making it fit the special issues we are concerned with in this book requires some additional considerations. The model has to be extended and refined in some parts for our purpose of identifying grounds relevant to assigning responsibilities for acting against child poverty. Let us start by adding another ground, one Young touches on only superficially, one rooted in every childâs dependency on love, care and respectively close relationships. We separate the interest of someone that child poverty should be alleviated and overcome from the relation to the child and the particular responsibility that stems from being a parent or close caregiver, having the duty and right of parenting. Young seems less concerned with close relations and how they influence the kind of responsibilities we have. We have argued that her grounds can and should also guide attribution of responsibilities in contexts where the connection between an agent of justice and those who benefit is less blurred. Child poverty, as we have often said, is almost always family poverty, and parents have a major influence on their children. Parents, however, do not only have such an influence, their poverty does not only cause their children to be poor as well; they have different kinds of relations, which are constituted by being a family. Parents have some rights but certainly also responsibilities towards their children; some of them can be caught by using the grounds discussed before. This does not, however, apply to all of them."

Ariel was answering in academic terms, and she kept answering, âIt is the probability of the patient having sight-threatening diabetic retinopathyâ and âNo, the probabilities are not objective; they are subjective estimation or guess made by AIâ. The problem with the first answer is that patients do not generally use probabilities to make decisions; they use natural frequencies. The problem with the second answer is that the clinician and the cybernetics expert did hope for an objective answer; they were not ready to accept a subjective answer; they felt AI âought to be objectiveâ. Ariel felt that AI is âsubjectiveâ since it learns from certain data. (As she found later, her logic was wrong.) The long discussion ended with the collaborators telling the risk analyst she was âbiased in her knowledge of probabilityâ. At that point, the risk analyst was annoyed. After all, she has trained all her life not to be biased. This example shows how even a seemingly simple case can turn into confusion. Without understanding the estimated risk, a patient and clinician would not know how to make a decision. Another non-medical example of miscommunication can be found in [9] (see their Chapter 7)."

It proved yet again a very pleasant exercise for everyone involved. IRAS, at the same time, got a car with measurement equipment to travel through town in order to get additional environmental data, but at the time of this publication, we had not received the input and hence could not take it into account in our analysis. It took TNO over three months to analyze and interpret the data. The analysts acknowledged back that they were surprised that such a relatively small group of participants had generated such a gigantic mountain of data. Cross-referencing between questionnaires, activity logs, GPS and air quality data, all related to time, geographic position and characteristics of such location, made the interpretation very laborious and impossible to automate. Every backpack participant received their own private report about the TNO ï¬ndings. Additionally, TNO and AiREAS gave a workshop together in October 2015 with all of the participants.

78,322,0.992,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In his Die AufklÃ¤rung in the Age of Philosophical Engineering Stiegler (2013) accepts the challenge introduced by Tim Berners-Lee, who argued that âwe are not analysing a world, we are building it. We are not experimental philosophers; we are philosophical engineersâ (Halpin 2008). Berners-Lee was not merely describing the activities of the architects of the World Wide Web he invented. He was calling them to account for the impact of their engineering on the constitution of mind and society. He was inviting them to build a new res publica. Stiegler is more careful. He suggests that digital technology is a pharmakon: âit can lead either to the destruction of the mind, or to its rebirth (ib.).â Referring to Wolf (2008) he notes that the transition from the reading mind to the digitally extended mind entails substantive changes to the composition and behaviour of our brains. Though these changes may be cause for celebration, they also threaten the constitution of the self. In the course of his text Stiegler reiterates the crucial question of what we need to preserve as a valuable heritage of the era of the âreading brainâ (Wolf 2008). I want to connect this with the need to reconstruct the social contract, recognizing its modern roots and its contingency on the ICT infrastructure of the printing press. A new social contract would have to align with the novel technological landscape, co-opting current ICTs to incorporate checks & balances. In that sense we will need a hybrid social contract that testifies to the agency-characteristics of smart environments.3 Though we might wish to declare âGame over for modernityâ, this may require us to give up on the social contract that protects against immoderate government. Let us remind ourselves that the end of modernity would not necessarily be the end of totalitarian governance. The hidden complexity of computational layers in fact affords refined and invisible manipulations that may be closer to the totalitarian nightmares of Kafkaâs Trial (Solove 2004) and Forster Machine (Forster 2009) then to the dictatorial schemes of Big Brother watching you. Stiegler (2013) notes that the spread of traceability seems to be used primarily to increase the heteronomy of individuals through behaviour-profiling rather than their autonomy."
90,103,0.992,"Informatics in the Future : Proceedings of the 11th European Computer Science Summit (ECSS 2015), Vienna, October 2015","We start our review of the five principles by one that limits the use of ethics. The Principle of Restraint states that we should only apply ethical criteria to issues of a demonstrably ethical nature, defined as issues of deciding between good and evil. Ethics is about serious, often difficult cases of such decisions. It is inappropriateâand may occasionally be unethicalâto appeal to ethical considerations in cases that do not justify it. Sometimes such overreach is harmless. Many professional organizations have âcodes of ethicsâ which are really rules of serious professional behavior, only some of which have an ethical character. In the IFIP codes of conduct for authors and referees,6 the injunction not to submit a scientific paper simultaneously to two different conferences or journals is not a matter of good and evil, simply a way to make the publication system efficient. Purely rational considerations suffice here; we do not need to devalue ethics by invoking ethical principles unnecessarily. More harmful effects arise when people artificially bring ethics into a discussion to make their side look good and the other side look bad. We saw an example in the case of prostitution. Another one, from information technology, is the attempt to position open-source software as a moral crusade. As illustrated in my 2000 article The Ethics of Free Software,7 the leaders of the movement, self-proclaimed saviors of humankind, switch to savage attack mode the minute they feel one of their colleagues is taking undue credit for their contributions. (For a while, the creator of GNU, unhappy that Linux, which used many GNU tools, was getting all the credit, lobbied to have the system renamed âLignuxâ.) This observation removes nothing from the value of open-source softwareâit simply shows that these brilliant programmers are also normal humansâbut does suggest staying away from ethical considerations when discussing such matters as the respective merits of commercial versus open-source software. The articleâs conclusion was that open source is not an ethical stance but a business model. Pretending otherwise is hypocrisy. A similar confusion, with worse consequences, has now arisen in the world of scientific publication. Riding on the popularity of open-source software, many publishing companies have embraced open-access publishing. Open-source software is, at least, âfreeâ in the economic sense: you can get it at no cost (paying only for associated services). While some open-access journals (such as the Journal of Object Technology, jot.fm) are indeed free to both authors and readers, the more common âgoldâ model of open access simply means that authors pay to publish, rather than readers to read. Not only is the move to such a model based on economic rather than ethical considerations, but the ethical implications are actually onerous, since a number of disreputable publishers have taken advantage of the new fashion"
46,164,0.992,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"help increase the health of many poor children. Some agents may be able to do much about the poverty status of the child while not directly influencing other dimensions of its well-being and well-becoming. The employer of the father or mother, for instance, who decides to pay a higher wage and improve working conditions, aiming at more familyfriendly working hours, certainly influences what a child is able to do and be. Eventually such changes can move her and her family out of poverty, but the employer still can influence the health and education of the child only indirectly. Since the relation between poverty and the deprivations discussed in Chapter 2 suggests that poverty is a very important cause for them, we argue that poverty should be targeted directly if possible. Alleviating the effects of poverty is like fighting the symptoms and not the disease. This in no way implies that one should not care about alleviating the effects of child poverty. Setting up more inclusive health care systems that directly target poor children is definitely a good thing. We know that they are a particularly vulnerable group and in need of support. In situations where it is unlikely that poverty can be directly tackled or in which it is foreseeable that progress on that front is coming very slowly, it is necessary to use all means available to counter what poverty does to children, even if they cannot be moved out of poverty. One must not forget, however, that the fundamental normative problem is that children grow up in poverty and that there is a need for a systematic change to this. Identifying agents of justice for child poverty is a task that should be informed by empirical evidence. The relations between different agents in the childâs environment and the way they actually influence her well-being and well-becoming is complex, and we have already indicated that a focus on state and family is too narrow. A very influential theory that guides our specification is the ecological model proposed by Urie Bronfenbrenner, a psychologist who worked on child development (Bronfenbrenner 1979; Bronfenbrenner and Morris 2007). His bioecological model aims to conceptualize child development based on an understanding that development is the change and continuity of biopsychological characteristics of humans over the life course, a development shaped by direct and indirect interactions between the developing human being and her environments. Bronfenbrennerâs model, used in empirical work for more than three decades, is also applied in research that aims to understand the effects of child poverty and in social work (Eamon 2001; Jack 1997). Such ecological approaches are especially fruitful in concepts of child well-being and well-becoming, which follow"

But over time, I realized we had a better chance of solving the issue for ourselves right here in Africa, because the technology ecosystem was young and in its formative stages. If we tackled the problem before it became as institutionalized as it is in Silicon Valley, then we had a better chance of success. I came to see that we are operating at the best time to address this problem. Our hope is that, 20 years from now, women will account for more than 40 % of the workforce in the field of technology. In order to achieve this vision, we want to scale to five training centers in towns and cities all over Africa. We also want to expand to the major urban centres within Kenya. And in order to reach more African women technologists, we plan to partner with hubs and co-working spaces all over the continent to support their initiatives of having more women represented in technology. We are currently developing the Akirachix model that we can share with interested people and organizations. This is the best way and time for us to write the story of African women in technology. How did you create a community for women? We started by having monthly meet-ups for women in technology. Over time, we realized that we were sharing a lot of information and knowledge among ourselves that other women could benefit from. We therefore decided to start a training program that targeted young women from low-income areas. We wanted to target young women who did not have an opportunity to be in the technology industry. Over time, we also started a high school program so that we could expose girls in secondary schools to careers in the technology industry. We had realized that many girls did not consider careers in technology, because they did not know about them, and if they did they did not see women whom they could identify with. As we continue to grow our community of women in technology, we have also realized that we need to work with men in the industry as our partners. This is because the women we work with do not exist in a vacuum. They work and study with men in school or on the job. One of the"

356,353,0.992,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"There needs to be systemic changes and/or incentives if the iTEC approach is to be widely adopted. Within school contexts, a risk-taking culture in relation to the adoption of digital pedagogy should be encouraged (Niemi et al. 2013). There is also a need to develop teacher education such that effective integration of ICT can be modelled and teachers can be encouraged to become agents of change (Twining et al. 2013; BreÄko et al. 2014). In common with the literature, the evaluation has provided evidence that an incremental approach to innovation, such as that facilitated through iTEC, can be successful (OECD 2008; Kampylis et al. 2013). Key finding 11: Awareness of the iTEC approach is growing in educational systems, and there are signs of widespread uptake. In cycle 5, nine out of ten teachers (n = 244) said that they intended to use the iTEC approach again in the future (91 %) and would recommend it to other teachers (92 %). While 81 % of teachers (n = 244) agreed that the iTEC approach could become part of their own routine practice, only half of them (52 %) agreed that such methods could become part of the routine practice of other teachers in their school. They were particularly cautious about the potential for upscaling at national level with only 43 % agreeing that the iTEC process could become part of routine practice for the majority of teachers in their country.

252,87,0.992,The Ethics of Vaccination,"authors who define coercion in psychological terms, that is in terms of influence of a certain proposal (or policy) on a personâs will (e.g., Frankfurt 1973; Feinberg 1989). More specifically, coercion can be conceived as a condition in which someone is forced to do X, for example, vaccinating oneâs children, in the sense that she is left with âno reasonable choiceâ or âno acceptable alternativeâ (Wertheimer 1989, pp. 30, 36â37) but to do X when she would otherwise not choose to do X. In other words, in cases of coercion a personâs autonomy is infringed upon in a certain specific way, i.e. by making certain choices unreasonable or unacceptable, and by subjecting her will to the will of another (Frankfurt 1973, p. 80), where this âotherâ might be a state. Coercive interventions thwart autonomyâas I have defined it aboveâto the extent that they render unreasonable those choices that individuals would otherwise make on the basis of their own evaluation. Importantly, on the account of coercion I endorse, someone could be coerced into doing X not only by a proposal that attaches penalties to not doing Xâthat is, a threat, for example, excluding unvaccinated children from schoolâbut also by a proposal that attaches significant enough benefits to doing Xâthat is, an offer (Held 1972; Feinberg 1989; Frankfurt 1973), for example, giving very large financial incentives for vaccinating oneâs children. Thus, the definition of coercion I have provided differs from âbaseline accountsâ of coercion. According to these, what is relevant for the definition of âcoercionâ is the distinction between threats and offers, as defined by prospected changes with regard to a certain baseline. The idea behind baseline accounts is that coercion necessarily involves a threat, and offers can never be coercive (e.g., Nozick 1969; OâNeill 1991; Wertheimer 1989; Beauchamp and Childress 2001, p. 95). According to Nozick, one difference between threats and offers is that only the latter preserve freedom; that is, âwhen someone does something because of offers it is his own choice, whereas when he does something because of threats it is not his own choice but someone elseâsâ (Nozick 1969, p. 459). This view, however, overlooks the influence on individual decision-making that very appealing offers can have. The account I endorse takes instead such influence into consideration. In some cases, for example, when the recipient desperately needs money, offers can leave the recipient with no reasonable choice but to accept what is offered, for example, a financial incentive, and to comply with the conditions of the offer, for example, vaccinate their children. In this sense, we cannot exclude that a certain offer might constitute a form of seduction (Held 1972) to which it is difficult or impos-"

It is likely that the meaning people give to important events and periods in their biography changes during the course of life. Here it is important to state, as Gardner has, that âthe life course is of course not culturally neutral, nor is it unaffected by particular geographical locations, for these involve very real material conditions and power relationsâ (Gardner 2002: 221). In this book, the power relations concerning the transmission of memories (or the failure of the same) between generations in particular are carved out. The generations I refer to evolved from my interlocutorsâ narratives. These generations are understood as sharing a historical experience that generates a âcommunity of perceptionâ (Olick 1999: 339). A shared past is crucial for a generationâs constitution. Equally important are âcertain interpretative principlesâ and âdiscursive practicesâ (Nugin 2010: 355â356). The narrator takes a central role; individuals are not passive consumers of experiences, but rather play an active role in generating meaning from their experiences. Even if in most cases the generations outlined here correlate with the age of my interlocutors, we need to keep in mind that the boundaries drawn between the generations are not clear-cut and age alone is not always decisive. Consequently the generations should not be considered as homogeneous cohorts, but rather as trends based on generational identification. The notion of âgenerationâ used in this book should thus be understood as a heuristic device (see Borneman 1992). Regardless of shared âdiscursive tacticsâ identified, I did not encounter one âstandardâ narrative representative for each generation,"

380,422,0.992,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"Oscarâs words are representative of how many people would conceptualize the paradox between the powerful template of consumption within the popular sectors and the simultaneous drive toward fomenting a new consciousness that was taking place in a variety of arenas. He found it puzzling and disturbing that many poor people seemed to prioritize buying consumer goods, at any cost, and that children were being pushed into a consumer culture through all media channels, supported by parents who failed to gain consciousness themselves. Indeed, a major concern of many activists was, above all, for young people, who were continuously induced into believing that âanything foreignâ was way better than anything Venezuelan. All the brands that children and youthsâ culture revolved around were foreign: McDonalds, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, Disney, Hello Kitty, Monster High, Hollywood blockbusters, Blackberry, Apple, Nike, Ralph Lauren, the list is endless. The subject was also brought up in a conversation with Marta, a woman in her 30s originally of humble origins but now an accomplished singer. Over a cup of coffee by her motherâs dining table in one of the low-rise apartment blocks in 23 de Enero, she spelled it out like this: What is the most problematic about it? Ideologically we are still, we could say that the revolution is still in between the Fourth and the Fifth Republic â¦ the masses, el pueblo has really not imprinted, formed, what is socialism, this is why we are still living in the midst of capitalism. Chavismo, one of its principal traits I would say, is this love for the patria, the need for justice, that is why eight millions and something have voted for ChÃ¡vez, because of this sense of nationalism that we had completely lost â¦ before the February 4, 1992,3 there wasnât this sense of patria, of nation â¦. Chavismo has this element which is what the esqualidos donât have, it doesnât interest them â¦ but what happens? I am talking about the ideological element, the fight against consumerism, because certainly we have been able to break through these things and created a sense of patria, of national identification, of pride of being Venezuelan, of recognition, about what it means to be Bolivarian, where are we coming from, where are our roots, but still there are elements that are"

Does one have to treat others in accordance with their own purposes, determined by their own hopes, dreams, fears, and desires (Neumann 2000: 286)? After all, prominent philosophers such as Charles Taylor interpret Kant to mean that âhuman dignity â¦ consist[s] largely in autonomy, that is, in the ability of each person to determine for himself or herself a view of the good lifeâ (Taylor 1995: 245). This would mean that everybodyâs individual view of the good life is worthy of respect. In the words of BjÃ¸rn Hofmann, who interprets Kant similarly, individuals have to be taken into account as whole persons, and their particular conception of the good life and individual way of prospering and flourishing in it has to be acknowledged. That is, one has to attend to and respect the dignity (Hofmann 2002: 89)."
116,46,0.992,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"towards yourself, then you should be helpful towards them. Presumably, if helpfulness is not something you particularly treasure in others, you have no moral obligation to be helpful towards others. Kant meant the categorical imperative to be stricter than a hypothetical one in that it is universally binding for all rational beings, and not contingent upon individual or cultural differences. It seems that he considered the Categorical Imperative to be an improvement on the Golden Rule in the sense that it avoided subjectivity and added universality as a requirement of moral considerations. The principle of equality puts demands on the justification of choices. It requires that a decision-maker can back up a difference in treatment of two cases with an identification of a morally relevant difference between them, but does not single out one particular moral outlook or ethical foundation to be uniquely right. It does not favour duty ethics over utilitarianism, or vice versa, but remains neutral regarding the tension between them. As we saw in the discussion of the trolley problem, duty ethics considers the fact that a person is used as mere means to indicate that it is a morally unacceptable option, even though this option maximizes utility. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, considers consequences as the only morally relevant features of the situation, and thus comes to different conclusions about what to do. Both traditions acknowledge the principle of equality, but part company on the issue of what constitutes a morally relevant difference. Looking back on previous examples from this book through the lens of the principle of equality, we can see how the justifications can take the form of finding reasons to make exceptions in the application of ordinary moral norms. In the blackmail case, Anne can claim that she does not give in to blackmail or other kinds of pressure that can occur in a corrupt economy, but that she makes an exception in this case, due to the colossal economic stakes that are involved. In the reference case, Ben can argue that he normally is truthful towards others, but that he is making an exception in this case, since he needs to restore harmony in his unit, and can do so effectively by hiding truths about the employeeâs quarrelsome behaviour. In the second trolley case, a person can argue that he or she would normally not kill an innocent person, but that the current situation warrants an exception, since it is thereby possible to save five lives. Whether we accept these appeals to morally relevant differences depends on how well they fit with our moral convictions and beliefs. DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0007"

This major problem is the lack of Information Literacy, and even more important, professional information leadership in the business world. I quite often hear from people that a business man like me should not worry about information management and let the IT folks handle IT. The problem is that IT departments have lost focus on the information side of the profession and are just technology professionals. Todayâs IT people are only the âTâ in IT and we need to find the âIâ in order to complete the organization. I currently manage a factory for a fortune 500 company. When I came to this multi-billion dollar Hi-Tech company I did not think that information would ever be an issue. The sad truth is that I see a lack of information literacy and professional information leadership on a daily basis. Today we need people that are information literate in order to drive the company to make proper decisions in the most efficient manner. In todayâs world of globalization, companies more than ever need timely, accurate and relevant information in all aspects of business.

381,794,0.992,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"All-American: Equal Opportunity as Egalitarian Individualism The volume in your hands (or perhaps, more likely on your screen) is one of thousands with the word âopportunityâ in its title. Especially in America, opportunity is a term redolent of optimism, progress, and freedom. It is, in short, impossible to be against. The danger is that opportunity becomes a protean term, meaning almost anything, or something different to different people in different contexts. Some specificity is therefore required in order to move beyond rhetoric and into action. I will shortly argue for a specific concept of opportunity, namely relative intergenerational income mobility. But first I will attempt to define equal opportunity as a distinctly American kind of fairness. In his second inaugural address in 2013, Obama declared: âWe are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.â So: the âsame chance to succeed,â even though âborn into the bleakest poverty.â This is the utopian ideal of American fairness, in which the inequalities of birth do not dictate the inequalities of life. While Obama, like most politicians, focused on upward mobility out of poverty, the equal opportunity ideal reaches all the way up the distribution. It is about the chance for a middle class kid to join the elite, as well as for a poor kid to join the middle class. The ideal also goes deeper than political rhetoric. Equality of opportunity is in Americaâs DNA. The moral claim that each individual has the right to succeed is even implicit in the proclamation of Declaration of Independence that âAll men are created equal.â In his first draft of that historic document, Thomas Jefferson in fact wrote that all were created âequal and independent.â This is the distinctly American formulaâequality plus independence adds up to the promise of upward mobility. Equal opportunity reconciles individual libertyâ the freedom to get ahead and âmake something of yourselfââwith societal equality. It is how the ideal of natural equalityââborn equalâ is fused with the ideal of individualismââborn independent.â It is a philosophy of egalitarian individualism.1"
46,180,0.992,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"not born at all. Under these circumstances â and we think they more or less accurately reflect what is possible in all modern welfare states â the state is allowed to enable and responsible for enabling all people, adolescents in particular, with a real choice if and when they want to become parents. It is thus responsible for providing knowledge about reproductive health and helping them plan their parenthood. Again, we are confronted here with a very sensitive issue about which many different opinions exist (e.g., religious groups that argue that family planning is always wrong and the state should never provide mandatory sexual education). Adaptive preferences, or to put it more moderately, unreflecting choices of younger adults and adolescents are an issue here. The reasons why young women get pregnant are multifold and can include gender roles, carelessness, lack of knowledge and the hope of stabilizing a relationship with a baby. Considering this, there is a fine line between education, helping people make good choices for themselves â this is the ideal of the capability approach â and manipulating or pushing them to make a choice that is good for the state. Under the circumstances described above, all adults and, to a lesser extent, adolescents are entitled to become parents if they wish, and the state has the responsibility to support them in making that decision freely and with respect to their own life plans. The state has the further responsibility to support the parents on their way to parenthood, providing prenatal health care and social services in cases where there is an indication that problems exist, as for parents-to-be in poverty. Furthermore, the state certainly has the responsibility to support the parents after birth and in their efforts to be good parents; it is not allowed to compel poor persons to not become parents in the first place for the sake of merely sparing some funds. Reproduction and the capability of becoming a parent and acting as a parent â on the condition that one provides for that child sufficiently, with the help of the state, if needed â are part of what constitutes justice for adults. Our arguments so far have been concerned with the claim that the state is not allowed to take children away from poor parents solely because they are poor or to hinder them from becoming parents. We have said little about the responsibilities the state has subsequently in regard to children born into poor families or living in families that become poor while the children are young; we also have not explored the responsibilities poor parents have in respect to their children, besides having to care for them sufficiently â for which Brighouse and Adams used the term âinterestsâ and Archard used âa minimal decent livingâ.

Perhaps, at some point there will be an insightful genius like Bell who can show that the different interpretations lead to different conclusions that can be experimentally differentiated, and that experiments will then give us some reason for choosing one interpretation over another. But at this point, most physicists subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation. There is no convincing reason not to use this interpretation, so we shall use it without further comment from now on. The final topic of this chapter shows that Bellâs theorem is not just of academic interest. It can actually be used to give a secure way of sharing a key to be used in cryptography. The Ekert Protocol for Quantum Key Distribution In 1991, Artur Ekert proposed a method based on entangled qubits used in Bellâs test. There are many slight variations. We will present a version that uses our presentation of Bellâs result. Alice and Bob receive a stream of qubits. For each pair, Alice receives one and Bob receives the other.

211,257,0.992,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"dedication to projects is likely to make work an important part of such entrepreneursâ identities. Entrepreneurs experiencing obsessive passion are generally not able to balance their work, family, and additional roles during identity formation well. This is because entrepreneurial activities take up an overly large part of their overall identity, which can lead to conflict with other roles and activities they pursue in their lives (see Vallerand et al. 2003). Unlike harmonious passion, obsessive passion does not drive people to act based on positive affective experiences; rather, obsessively passionate individuals have an âinternal compulsionâ to pursue activities (Vallerand et al. 2003: 757). This felt obligation to work can also lead entrepreneurs to go after new additional opportunities. For instance, entrepreneurs who do not experience obsessive passion about their work may feel that exploiting a certain opportunity would take too much of the ventureâs resources or would be too risky, thus making them decide not to pursue the opportunity further. However, entrepreneurs high in obsessive passion will think less about resources and risk. Instead, they will consider whether exploiting the opportunity would lead to acceptance within the venture, among stakeholders (e.g., financiers), and/or in the entrepreneurial community. Furthermore, acting on new opportunities may also enable the obsessively passionate entrepreneur to uphold his or her self-image as âbeing so entrepreneurial that not opportunity is missed,â which in turn will help maintain self-esteem. Studies have supported these arguments by demonstrating that in environments in which difficult and distant goals (such as developing a new product opportunity to market) are the norm, people often have trouble resisting the urge to concentrate on a proximal reward (e.g., acceptance in the entrepreneurial community) at the expense of ignoring goals that are more distal (Metcalfe and Mischel 1999). Obsessively passionate entrepreneurs often experience negative emotions outside work (Vallerand et al. 2003). Because of the obligations related to their business and the necessity they perceive to perform businessrelated activities, it is frequently challenging or even impossible for these individuals to concentrate on activities outside work (cf. Vallerand et al. 2003). For instance, when spending time with friends and family, entrepreneurs who feel obsessive passion are likely to continually think of and discuss business issues and try to identify novel innovation opportunities. Such entrepreneurs may even pick up hobbies associated with the generation of novel ideas. Entrepreneurs in the information technology (IT) sector, for instance, may visit meetings of computer hobbyists in their free"

You have angel investors starting to come from other markets. And this is all happening at the same time. What hasnât happened yet is there havenât been many successful exits from the technology community because itâs so young. And because of that, you donât have many first-generation tech entrepreneurs that are wealthy enough to invest in the next generation. So we need a big exit, and then we need the members of that community to become the PayPal Mafia. Thatâs the missing element. Five years from now, Iâd love to see our earliest employees behind the biggest startups on the continent. Thatâs my personal vision of success. How essential are investors from Africa to realize that vision? I donât think itâs about creating African investors or Silicon Valley investors or European investors.

329,120,0.992,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"Compassion also plays a role when determining the types of issues to support. David Wei of Shanghai built hospitals for Tibetan medicine in Tibet and Shanghai after witnessing the poor health-care infrastructure in Tibet. Laurel and George Tahija established a foundation focused on cultivating all childrenâs learning potential in Indonesia, after finding these resources lacking when raising their own children. There is also a strong paternalistic urge among Asians who have amassed wealth. It is not uncommon to hear those with wealth âhelping the peopleâ or âproviding for the poor.â There is a cultural affinity with taking care of those less fortunate in very much a paternalistic manner. Those receiving this assistance also buy into the notion of being taken care of. In his book Blood and Silk, writer Michael Vatikiotis quotes Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathirâs daughter Marina Mahathir: âWe are accustomed to tolerating the extraordinary wealth of our leaders. That is because we consider they deserve riches in return for looking out for us.â5 While this quote is referring to political leaders, it is also very much the case when it comes to business leaders. Communities expect those with wealth to provide for them. Those with wealth historically and still much in practice today feel it is their role to be the patriarch and take care of their extended family, relatives or not. The cultivation and strengthening of relationships is another reason to give. People give when a friend or business associate asks for support of a cause or an organization that they have also been supporting. We will discuss this motivation in detail in the next section. For many in business, a business imperative is reason to give. Many seek training and increased educational opportunities to raise the quality of employees. Others augment existing educational systems with their own training programs and courses. And lastly, there is face, always a motivation in Asia. A philanthropist chooses to give so as to receive recognition for largesse. Of course, discerning cause and effect is a chicken-and-egg phenomenon. Does one give in order to get recognition or is recognition the reasonable and justifiable response to a generous act? In any case, the social imperative for giving is growing in Asia. While some wealthy people resist the trend, most acknowledge the trend itself, one that affects not only the wealthy but also the middle class. Later on in this book, we will talk about the rise of crowdfunding throughout the region and its support among those with average incomes. Here we will address several key strategies employed by well-off philanthropists."
299,96,0.992,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Economics is considered by academics as the queen of the social sciences, the most prestigious of the lot. It carries more weight in the public and private spheres than all the other social sciences combined. It is not an accident that the White House has a Council of Economic Advisers, but all suggestions to create a Council of Social Advisers have been rebuffed. Of the 19 public policy schools in the US, at least 18 are dominated by economists. In the private sector, MBAsâwhose training is more based on economics than on other disciplinesâoutrank other social scientists. Economists (to reiterate, many but by no means all or even most) draw on a metaconception of human nature, often referred to as homo economicus. People are assumed to seek to maximize their self-interest, which at least initially was equated with satisfaction drawn from the consumption of goods and services. It is a view that can be referred to as materialistic hedonism. This thesis is often expressed by the use of the term âutility.â The original concept of utility, as developed late in the eighteenth century by Jeremy Bentham (1789), is narrow: All actions are directed toward gaining pleasure or avoiding pain.1 Happiness, satisfaction, and pleasure are treated as synonyms (Gottheil 2013, p. 121). Utilitarian philosophy views pain and pleasure not only as sources of motivation, but also of ethical guides: âIt is for them [pain and pleasure] alone to point out what we ought to doâ and determine the âstandard of right and wrongâ (Bentham 1789). Along similar lines, John Stuart Mill (1863) wrote that âactions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness,â with happiness defined as âpleasure and the absence of pain.â When British philosopher Thomas Hobbes was asked why he gave a coin to a beggar, Hobbes replied that âhe made his donation with the sole intent of relieving his own misery at the sight of the beggarâ (Aubrey 1898, p. 352). Adam Smith (1776) famously argued in The Wealth of Nations that the market as a system relies on each actor pursuing his self-interest: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. (p. 14)"
266,19,0.992,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"We use the x-axis of Fig. 1.1 to illustrate the range of analytic rigour that may be applied to the analytic reasoning process. At the start of an inquiry there is usually very little known about a case. It is therefore of little use to treat information and inferences rigorously as the analyst is still trying to understand what the data means and whether it is sensible to create an argument. The type of thinking and reasoning employed by the analyst at this stage may be characterised as being creative, having to deal with high uncertainty as there are many unknowns and missing data. The need at this stage is to gain traction and to get the investigation started. Analysts engage in the tentative and playful generation of plausible stories and hypotheses that may account for their observations. They tend not to commit to a single explanation and are likely to explore alternatives. At the high rigour end of the spectrum, the type of thinking and reasoning required may be characterised as âcritical thinkingâ, evaluative, deliberate, and final. As an investigation approaches the closing stages, most of the data required will be known. It is then possible to rigorously structure, organise, or analyse the data, and to make sure that every conceivable logical discussion can be evaluated. By this stage, analysts would have employed a variety of structured analytic techniques (see for example, Heuer and Pherson 2014) to establish strong and rigorous arguments. Then usually having done all the analyses and checks â would be committed to an explanation."
299,407,0.992,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Two overarching approaches have been suggested as a means of enabling driverless cars and other smart machines to render moral choices on their own: top-down and bottom-up. In the top-down approach, ethical principles are programmed into the carâs guidance system. These could be Asimovâs Three Laws of Robotics, the Ten Commandments, or other religious preceptsâor a general moral philosophy, such as Kantâs categorical imperative, utilitarianism, or another form of consequentialism. The main point is that rather than a programmer instructing the car to proceed under specific conditions in the most ethical way, the car will be able to make such ethical choices based on the moral philosophy that it was granted or acquired (Wallach and Allen 2009, p. 16). Critics of the top-down approach (as well as some proponents) recognize the inherent difficulties in adhering to any particular moral philosophy, given that any one of them will, at some point or another, lead to actions and outcomes that some will find morally unacceptable. To take but two familiar examples: Benjamin Constant points out that the categorical imperative would obligate someone to tell a murderer the location of his prey, because of the prohibition on lying under any circumstances (Constant 1797). As for consequentialism, if a carâs instruction is to minimize the amount of damage it causes in a situation where damage is inevitable, it may calculate that it would be preferable to crash into the less expensive of two cars in the adjacent lanes, which would raise obvious concerns about discrimination (Goodall 2014). True, these (and other) moral philosophies have developed variants that attempt to address such âflaws.â Still, among and within these schools of ethics, there are significant debates that highlight the difficulties faced in drawing on particular philosophies to serve as moral guidance systems for machines. For instance, there is well-known and significant disagreement over whether and how âutilityâ can be quantified, with Bentham and Mill disagreeing over whether there are different levels of utility (Millâs âhigherâ and âlowerâ pleasures). Consequentialists continue to face these challenges; for example, estimating long-term consequences and determining for whom consequences should be taken into account. Most of the Trolley Problem thought experiments assume that a body is a body, and hence killing five is obviously worse than one. However, people do not attach the same value to terminally ill senior citizens as to children in kindergarten, or to Mother Teresa as to a convicted felon."

Ex Memoria makes us painfully aware of what it must feel like to be spoken about.

The relationship between the surrogate and the parents-to-be is the third relationship of special importance in surrogacy arrangements. Little attention is paid to this topic in scientific discourse, but for this analysis it is crucial to show that the surrogate and the commissioning parents are not just contract partners, but also interrelated in an ethical manner. Levinasâ concept of âthe thirdâ offers an interesting insight for the analysis of this special relationship, as it shatters the private relationship between the self and the Other and introduces a different, although still ethical, quality. As StÃ©phane MosÃ¨s points out, the third is different from the Other in the sense of proximity, quantity and its selection: The third is further afar than the Other, it is numerous instead of unique, and it is the only one in an ethical relationship that is freely chosen (MosÃ¨s 1993). The surrogates meet the criteria: they are usually miles away from the commissioning parents, it does not matter to them exactly which surrogate carries their child to term, and it is they who choose to enter a surrogacy arrangement and involve a third party in their family planning. However, for Levinas, the third does not need to be conceived as a visible empirical human being. Instead, it is best interpreted as reminder that other people who are not part of a personal relationship and differ from the self in terms of ethnicity, sex, status or religion must be considered as well. The third interferes with the relationship of the self and the Other and thereby challenges the privileged position of the Other. Thus, it opens up the frontiers of thinking. The relationship to the third is not personal anymore, but refers to the sphere of justice and equality.9 Therefore, the third is also allied with institutions and universal laws instead of the particularity and context-sensitivity that is part of personal relationships. Levinas comments on the difference between the Other and the third as being a difference in thinking: [â¦] what seems to me very important, is that there are not only two of us in the world. But I think that everything begins as if we were only two. It is important to recognize that the idea of justice always supposes that there is a third. But, initially, in principle, I am concerned about justice because the other has a face. (Levinas et al. 2005, p. 170)"

In what follows you will visit many coffee shops, workplaces and homes to have fika (coffee and cake) with informants,8 as well as following me through the corridors of the headquarters of the Agency to attend meetings and interviews. Through these visits, my aim is to illuminate how taxation is made possible in one of the nations with the highest tax âburdenâ in the world; albeit one where there does not seem to be so much questioning of taxation. The data for this book comes from two anthropological studies. In the following I describe the fieldwork but also contextualize the acquired information in time and space. The first study addressed how informal purchases of workâsvart arbete/black workâin Sweden are justified among a group of middle-aged Swedes (BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2010). These purchases, which look like any other bought work, are said to make up a substantial part of the economy in contemporary society, but are strictly legally speaking tax cheating exchanges. Such exchanges are hidden and subject to ethical, moral, economic and practical considerations, and although politically challenged they seem to exist everywhere. The societal phenomenon I studied was one that Swedes are constantly exposed to and come into contact with in everyday lifeâthrough the media and peopleâs constant engagement with the question. Recurring indignation in headlines caught my attention and a never-ending stream of examples of svart arbete in known and new guises was overheardâ fragments of conversations at the supermarket, when watching childrenâs soccer games and even when listening to discussions about how to keep within the legal framework at the Scout corps when the youngsters wanted to earn extra income for a trip to a Jamboree in England. There are even humorous advertisements about buying svart in newspapers, relating to stylish leather sofas, or the tip cup at a coffee-shop counter that says svarta pengar. This study was done in 2003â4 and society around us has changed; the everyday, and justifiable, purchases of svart arbete seem less frequent today. What we hear about now instead are examples of despicable abuses of svart arbete: of immigrants without working permits working for less than"

It also connected to a broader recreational philosophy of peer 4 regional development, connecting urban and rural infrastructures in such a way so as to stimulate sport, recreation and physical exercise. In this study, we have already concluded that modern people spend about 90 % of their time indoors while sitting down. Even outdoors, we spend most of the time sitting in or on vehicles. Sitting is now being called the ânew smokingâ, the next major health hazard that our lifestyle has developed. When we realize that we consume 30 kg of air every day, the context of sitting down indoors versus physical exercise outdoors provides interesting research opportunities and insight into the development of our health and lifestyles in general. The Province is working now with the Health Deal, but in essence, 9 out of 10 executive decisions still result in health reduction and pollution. This has already been referred to as the perverse reality of an era in transition, but it is certainly one to be taken into account. Resonating with health is a learning process in which many variables interact. Our AiREAS participation in the Marathon was our ï¬rst chance to take a look at a totally new world and was a potential eye-opener for policy makers, citizens and entrepreneurs. Enthusiasm grew within the AiREAS team, and our proactive âcan doâ attitude confused the commercially-oriented marathon organization more and more. AiREAS relates to the higher purpose of health, which leads us, and treats all partners, including the Marathon organization, as equals. As our ideas became more concrete, so did the demands on the organization for facilitation. Whatever we were given as support was gratefully integrated into our own evolution.

Although a small minority, these percentages represent millions of Muslims around the world who support ISIS at least to some extent. The US lacks a compelling normative response to ISISâ appeal in the Muslim world. Charlie Winter (2015) writes âThis war [against ISIS] cannot be won through military and political means alone; it is as much a war of information and propaganda as anything else and, currently, it is fatally imbalanced to the advantage of Islamic State.â Christina Schori Liang, a senior fellow at the Geneva Center for Security Policy, put it more simply: âWe need a compelling story that makes our story better than theirs, and so far their story is trumping oursâ (Geller 2016). The challenge posed by ISISâ normative positions is part of a much greater challenge concerning how the West should speak to and with the Muslim world, a world in which, it is generally agreed, the US has not found an effective way to âwin hearts and minds.â2 The Chicago Council on Global Affairs noted in a 2010 report that ongoing theological debates within several religions, including Islam, will have profound foreign policy consequences, but warned that âthe United States often lacks the capacity to understand even the broad contours of such debates, much less the subtleties and nuances of religious history, theological argument, and cultural contextâ (Appleby et al. 2010). Amr and Singer (2007) of the Brookings Institute pointed out: By any measure, Americaâs efforts at communicating with Muslim-majority nations since 9/11 have not been successful. The efforts have lacked energy, focus, and an overarching, integrated strategy. Instead, the efforts have relied on informational programming that has lacked priority or been misdirected, lacked nuance in dealing with diverse and sensitive issues, and not reached out to the key âswingâ audiences necessary to marginalize and root out violent extremists.3"
125,371,0.992,"Charismatic Christianity in Finland, Norway, and Sweden : Case Studies in Historical and Contemporary Developments","The rapid alteration of religious expressions such as classical Pentecostal church services can be attributed to several factors. First, individualism has spread rapidly in Sweden during the last few decades. People do not bother as much about what others think. The predominantly rural and collectivist culture of Sweden has been replaced by an urban and individualist one. Furthermore, people increasingly vote with their feet. Whereas old-time Pentecostals were most faithful to their congregations, Jessica Moberg (2013) has shown that todayâs members are mobile and choose a congregation according to what they consider the best for that moment. This has led to a nervous adaptation to new circumstances in many churches. This whole rapid transformation of churches and church culture opens up a new field to actors like Claesson, and media enterprises like Channel 10. Alienated Pentecostals are looking for a new homeâbut wish to do so without having to do what was once considered almost a sin, that is, to abandon their congregation. This is where Claessonâs TV channel comes in. In the programs from Channel 10, they recognize âa tone of revivalâ and more. They feel at home again. At the same time, another process is going on in Swedish society: mediatization, i.e., the influence of mass media on Swedish culture in a broad sense: âIn all fields of culture, the presence of the media changes the rules of aesthetic creation, dissemination and the use of sound, images, and texts. To a high degree, mediatization affects reading and listening, education and the book industry, theater and the music, film and visual culture in both fine arts and popular cultureâ (FornÃ¤s 2011, 5). It goes without saying that the author also should have included church services. In line with the transformation of Swedish TV media from sober information services to âcommercial populismâ in the 1980s (Furhammar 2006), or the more recent trend of âdigital storytelling,â Channel 10 has produced a popular form of revival, maybe not of the heart, but definitely of the culture of bygone days in Pentecostalism. And, just like in the old days, people are happy to open their wallets and donate money to something that is to their likingâand especially to a TV channel that claims that it is going to bring old time revival to Scandinavia! Through his work on identity, Paul Ricoeur (1992) has taught us that we are dependent on narratives to create and maintain a personal identity. By telling and retelling stories of our lives, we integrate a reconstructed past and an imagined future, and we mediate discrepancies to produce a more coherent version of continuity. In the same way, we opt to provide life with some type of purpose. Stuart Hall speaks of the âproduction of"

We may still put anonymity on the table as an option, especially if we do not know in advance exactly how the interview is going to go, but we do not usually expect them to take it up. These are public figures who are used to media exposure (albeit in the constrained circumstances of their authoritarian context), and in some cases, they may have already spoken of the same topics on public occasions. They will know exactly what they want to say to us, and how to say it. Moreover, their quotes are only meaningful in the context of who they are. What they say to us is interesting not because they give us insight into their thought process, or into the inner workings of the bureaucracy or the political process, but because they are the head of the Islamist Party or the president of the biggest womenâs rights association. These kinds of interviewees will often give their consent to be quoted by name in our published work as a matter of course, although they may also give us some off-the-record information at the same time. Even if they only give us their official views, this can be of interest, because they give us insight into authoritarian legitimation strategies. But they typically only give us one face of authoritarian political processes: the public face.

10,109,0.992,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The structure of the Governance Assessment Tool and the guiding questions it poses in each cell, enables any individual stakeholder (e.g. a project leader, or policy advisor, or policy makers) who understands the dimensions and criteria to assess the governance context s/he is working in. All it requires is a few hours to assess the situation for each cell, on the basis of knowledge held by heart. Obviously such assessment is limited by the degree of correctness of such estimates. But that is no reason to be negative about it. Such an individual thought experiment at least turns implicit knowledge and perceptions into explicit ones that can later be shared with others in a systematic way. It also serves the purpose that the individual stakeholder becomes more aware of the issues on which there is uncertainty or even lack of knowledge. Lastly, assuming that the perceptions of such âinsiderâ make some sense indeed (as often will be the case), it provides an assessment of oneâs own working circumstances that can be practical in ï¬nding ways to improve them or otherwise deal with them. A next step in elaborated use of the tool is when a group of practitioners interactively uses it for a systematic brainstorm on the governance context of their common policy or project. This could take for instance the form of a half day workshop. Compared with the previous approach there are more people that can contribute knowledge and that can counter one-sided bias in perceptions, creating a degree of âinter-subjectivityâ. The joint effort is also an important aspect in itself, as it provides a basis for sharing information and sharing perceptions, that can later be of utmost value for productive collaboration (HarmoniCOP 2005). The session can be concluded by brainstorming on how to deal with the governance context about which by then a joint understanding has evolved. In as far as differences of opinion occur and persist, the session has probably pinpointed more precisely than before where the disagreement is all about. A variant of the above is the situation in which an experienced analyst, for instance a scientist that worked with the tool more often, leads the session, turning it into a guided workshop. An obvious advantage is that the governance expert has a good understanding of the precise meaning of the concepts and the reasons why they are included in a model explaining the degree to which the context is"

This decision would likely be different if, instead of a school bus, your robot car were about to collide with another passenger car carrying only one person. Given the same average odds of death, one in three, the expected number of deaths in a collision would only be 0.67, while the expected number of deaths in driving off a cliff remains at one. In that case, the right consequentialist decision would be to allow the accident to occur, as long as the average odds of death are less than one in two. If, instead of another vehicle, your car were about to collide with a deer, then the decision to stay on the road, despite an ensuing accident, would be even more obvious insofar as we value a deerâs life less than a human life. Back to the school-bus scenario, programming an autonomous car with a consequentialist framework for ethics would seem to imply your sacrifice. But what is most striking about this case might not even be your death or the moral mathematics: if you were in a manually driven car today, driving off the cliff might still be the most ethical choice you could make, so perhaps you would choose certain death anyway, had you the time to consider the options. However, it is one thing for you to willingly make that decision of sacrifice yourself, and quite another matter for a machine to make that decision without your consent or foreknowledge that self-sacrifice was even a possibility. That is, there is an astonishing lack of transparency and therefore consent in such a grave decision, one of the most important that can be made about oneâs life â perhaps noble if voluntary, but criminal if not. Thus, reasonable ethical principles â e.g., aiming to save the greatest number of lives â can be stressed in the context of autonomous driving. An operator of an autonomous vehicle, rightly or not, may very well value his own life over that of everyone elseâs, even that of 29 others; or he may even explicitly reject consequentialism. Even if consequentialism is the best ethical theory and the carâs moral calculations are correct, the problem may not be with the ethics but with a lack of discussion about ethics. Industry, therefore, may do well to have such a discussion and set expectations with the public. Users â and news headlines â may likely be more forgiving if it is explained in advance that self-sacrifice may be a justified feature, not a bug."

It is as if knowledge of desire and sex has replaced the sensation itself, in just the same way as knowledge about texts and about reading had replaced the pleasure of the actual experience. Their dependence upon a scientific vocabulary and mode of knowledge to understand desire has squeezed out the feeling associated with it. Desire is the subversive element that cannot be contained by intellectualising scientific constructions of it. As Roland observes, âI think all the looking-into has some very odd effects on desireâ (267).13 He and Maud are left with an absence of desire, or, more accurately, a desire for absence. Their identical wish is âto have nothing. An empty clean bed. I have this image of a clean empty bed in a clean empty room, where nothing is asked or to be askedâ (267). Roland and Maudâs romance develops in silence, as if their vocabulary, so loquacious for dealing with matters of sex and sexuality, cannot find the words to express their feeling for each other: âthey took to silence. They touched each other without comment and without progression. A hand on a hand, a clothed arm, resting on an arm. An ankle overlapping an ankle, as they sat on a beach, and not removedâ (423). The language they use to describe sex and sexuality, and the ideological construct that stands for love, is characterised by what is almost violence. Roland, and especially Maud, guard their solitude, their autonomous selves, jealously, and do not wish to sacrifice this to the other. They associate love with sex, and sex with being a possession. It is this that they resist: it was important to both of them that the touching should not proceed to any kind of fierceness or deliberate embrace. They felt that in some way this stately peacefulness of unacknowledged contact gave back their sense of their separate lives inside their separate skins. Speech, the kind of speech they knew, would have undone it â¦ (424) Unable to speak their love, their gradual willingness to relinquish selfpossession and open themselves to the other is signified by the scene in which Roland convinces Maud to let down her hair. Maudâs long, blonde hair, worn tightly wound up and concealed beneath a scarf, is symbolic of her autonomy and independence. The passage in which she unravels it is figured as a kind of answer to the feminist poem that LaMotte had written a hundred or more years earlier. Angered by Ash, LaMotte rewrites the Rapunzel fairytale, replacing the prince who climbs to Rapunzel with a hairy ogre whose âblack claws go clutching / Hand over Hand / What Pain goes thrilling/ Through every strand!â (35)."

It was also around this time that many began to sense that the material civilization that had supported the dramatic growth of the twentieth century had reached an impasse. People conscious of these matters began taking action in an effort to avoid the difficult state of affairs that the exhaustion of energy resources, global warming, the generation of large amounts of waste, and similar developments present. However, the data and information that provide the grounds for action were lacking, and discussion likewise had not yet reached a state of maturity. For people to take action requires them being able to believe that the actions they are attempting are correct and are being done for the worldâs sake.

46,8,0.992,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"knowledge between the poverty researcher and the poor person; this has to be dealt with. The third issue is fighting poverty and the question of moral responsibilities of researchers. Poverty research is done not only to gather more knowledge about the poor, to count them and to describe their lives, but because this knowledge should be also used to a large extent to change something and to help end poverty. Many poverty researchers claim with Else Ãyen that helping the poor is one of the major drivers to engage in research in the first place (Ãyen 2009), but it is highly unclear what kind of obligation is triggered by describing and defining a person as being poor and towards what persons it is directed. Some sort of obligation is almost always implicitly inherent, and so many studies about poverty conclude with some sort of policy advice or name institutions that could make a difference. In the case of national or international poverty surveys that count and monitor the poor, those who are obliged to change the situation are often directly named: the particular state whose official offices track poverty, the European Union or the World Bank and its member states. Poverty research is therefore not only needed to guide policymaking; the definitions and measures employed have power (Ruggeri Laderchi, Saith and Stewart 2006) â if one is not counted as being poor, it can mean that one does not receive benefits or other forms of support by the state. Alice OâConnor has described this issue from a different perspective and argued that poverty research that focuses too much on counting the poor and on refining methods to âintrudeâ in their lives and to monitor them is in danger of losing its connection to economic and political issues. Rather, it is necessary to combine poverty research with inquiry and criticism of the economic, social and political environment in which poverty is produced and reproduced and how the national and international institutions have to change to get down to the roots of the problem. Although liberal in origins, poverty knowledge rests on an ethos of political and ideological neutrality that has sustained it through a period of vast political change. Very much for this reason, it can also be distinguished by what it is not: contemporary poverty knowledge does not define itself as an inquiry into the political economy and culture of late twentieth-century capitalism; it is knowledge about the characteristics and behaviour and, especially in recent years, about the welfare status of the poor. (OâConnor 2001, 4) The fourth issue is the inclusion of the poor themselves in theorizing poverty. This raises deep questions related to power: Who decides or"

So, â¦ less people would be inclined to defend immigrants who are calling for these changes.

And everythingâ¦â They takeâ¦ (P3, FG3) (106) Yeah, yeah, yeah, thatâs what they do all the time. Weâre not against muslims, weâre against Islam as a religion or whateverâ¦ (P2, FG3) Overall, collectively looking at these points raised by our interviewees, what seems to be the underlying cause for the notably different perception ofâand attitude towardsâthe LGBTIQ and migrant minorities is a strong and rather homogeneous sense of social identity that the Maltese appear to have; a social identity that ï¬lters migrants (or to put it more aptly, some particular groups of migrants) out and retains the LGBTIQ community as part of the Maltese in-group. Given that âoneâs social identity is a product of the social relations one is embedded inâ (van Houtum and van Naerssen 2002: 132), this is not entirely surprising, if one takes into account the extremely small size of the country and the additional premise that âin Malta there has been a historical fear of invasion by non-Europeans and non-Christian people that has lasted throughout the centuriesâ (van Hooren 2015: 91). That said, not all is lost on this front, since, by deï¬nition, social identities are âprocesses of continuous âre-writingâ of the self and of social collectivesâ (van Houtum and van Naerssen 2002: 132). Thus, it seems that the more the Maltese are exposed to multiculturalism, as they have increasingly been in recent years, the harder it will become for them to tolerate xenophobic speech altogether."

388,216,0.992,The European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Textbook For Nurses : Under The Auspices of Ebmt,"Cancer invokes strong feelings and passions, and it is not infrequent to find a conflict of interest between members of the family, members of the health-care team and even members of the public as to whether to proceed with treatment or not. Emmanuel Kantâs theory cited in Kemp Smith (1973) states that to act morally always treat other human beings as âends in themselvesâ and never merely as âmeansâ; by this Kant means that it is unethical to treat people as if they are objects. According to Kant it is fundamentally immoral to exploit a person without considering them an end in their own right. In transplantation where the side effects initially are extremely difficult and debilitating to the patient, it is sometimes difficult to justify such moral behaviour especially when nurses are striving not to inflict harm and to promote good. What is often lacking, especially in nursing, is the courage and confidence to go through with a moral decision, which is basically an issue of personal moral development and personal integrity (Brykczynska 1997). It is the personal integrity of a particular nurse that will effect a change for the better or worse for an individual patient (Corner 1997)."

Our Iran expert by contrast, who has also interviewed activists, has taught himself to routinely use encryption. When he first started doing research in 2008, he had concerns about his transcripts getting physically impounded. However, he did not know much about Internet surveillance at the time, and he would simply e-mail his transcripts to his partner back home before erasing them. In 2015, he erased all data from his laptop before traveling to Iran. Less sensitive interviews he kept on his laptop, a bit hidden away with nondescript file names, more sensitive ones he would encrypt. Some of us never record interviews but rely exclusively on extensive notes. Notes, they say, can have the advantage of making respondents more comfortable but also of making the interviewer more attentive to what she is hearing. Others do use recordings, but not for the most sensitive issues. All of us make copious notes, often in a mix of languages and even scripts, which are not readily intelligible to others. In case of extremely sensitive confidential information, we sometimes write nothing down at all but try to commit it to memory. There is an obvious tension here, which we will revisit in Chap. 6, between accuracy and transparency on the one hand, and protecting ourselves and our respondents on the other hand. We went through a learning curve, from having little awareness of data security issues to assuming that rigorous measures like the use of offline laptops and encryption provide the most safety to thinking in terms of trade-offs between greater digital security on the one hand and the risks of arousing suspicion, physical theft, or becoming caught up in paranoia on the other hand. Our general experience has been that it is worthwhile to learn and practice a range of digital security routines before going into the field, so that we know how to use them if we find that the context requires it. If we then find that the routines we had envisaged are unnecessary or even inappropriate, we can relax or abandon them. The other way around, ratcheting up oneâs digital security routines once in the field, could be technically and practically much more difficult."

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"This incident taught me to be much more patient in my approach to hostel residents and to explain more fully what I was doing. I also learned that getting consent was not a one-time event to be crossed off a checklist, but rather a task to be repeated throughout the research stages. This is what Cutcliffe and Ramcharan (2002) mean when they use the term âethics as processâ (cited in Liamputtong 2007: 43-4). Their insight is that ethical issues evolve as research progresses and greater depth of experience and involvement is achieved. In such situations, consent needs to be renegotiated every so often. The difficulty in securing informed consent also had a bearing in who participated in my study. A number of the older men in the hostel with whom I established some rapport appeared to suffer from mental health problems. Securing informed consent would have been highly problematic and dubious in these cases. Other individuals were in a state of physical ill health that led them to decline my invitation to participate. And of course, there was also the issue of language proficiency. Some residents did not have a sufficient command of French to understand some of my more abstract questions. By making it a rule that every"

Some advocates of moral causes believe that if the president would make a powerful speech or conduct âfireside chatsâ as President Roosevelt did, this would lead to a new SMU and change the direction of the nation. President Kennedyâs speech that urged Americans not to ask what their country can do for them but what they can do for their country is credited with engendering a historical change; however, although the speech is often quoted, there is precious little evidence that, by itself, it had much of an effect. President Carter tried to make Americans treat the saving of energy as a test of their moral fortitude in his famous malaise speechâwith mainly negative effects. President Obama spoke eloquently for many causes, especially for finding common ground, but the nation became more polarized. Such speeches can serve as sociological dialogue starters, but they must be followed by dialogues for them to have the sought-after societal effects. People who adhere to a moral value do not change their position because of just one speech, however eloquent. Instead, when a topic takes off, or âgets hot,â it becomes the subject of extensive discussion in personal settings (over dinner, in bars, firehouses) and in local meetings of voluntary associations and clubs (Rotary, PTA, places of worship). These, in turn, are amplified and linked through national organizations during their meetings (such as AIPAC, League of Women Voters, NAACP, Sierra Club, Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Council of Churches, etc.), and through the media (callin shows, commentaries, and debates on TV and radio) and social media. To illustrate, in 2015â2016 a subject that was only sporadically discussed in previous years became a focus of a nationwide moral dialogue in the US, namely the rights of transgender people. Google Trends data shows that the relative popularity of the search term âtransgender bathroomsâ in the United States was low for over a decade and then experienced a sharp increase after 2015."

In some ways our methods of developing software have dramatically changed over time, in other ways they have stayed much the same. As an industry we have followed a zig-zag path moving from paradigm to paradigm and from method to method, changing very much like the fashion industry inspires wardrobe changes. Every new method adoption is generally a very expensive, demoralizing affair. It is expensive because it means retraining the software developers, the teams and their leaders. In some cases existing software may even have to be rewritten in order to work more efficiently with new software. It is demoralizing because the more experienced developers feel they have to relearn what they already know. Companies, especially larger ones, realize that having a great method provides a competitive advantage â even if it is not the only thing you need to have. They also realize that their method must be explained and explicit so that it can be applied consistently across the organization. And, they realize that one size doesnât fit for all they do â they need a multitude of methods."
306,63,0.992,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Many geometric activities can take place without words and without symbolism. Visual language is very rich in content so it is possible to use it at very early educational levels. The act of constructing patterns and making tessellation requires a long sequence of elementary acts: observation, ordering, copying, and repeating. Swoboda (2005) showed that drawing a pattern is not merely perceptual copying, but is a deep thinking process, which involves the body and gestures (Marchini and Vighi 2005). Of the domains of knowledge where children must enter, geometry is the one that needs the fullest cognitive activity, as it requires gestures, language, and seeing. It requires the child to construct, reason, and see; each activity is indissoluble from the others (Duval 2005). Arzarello (2004) emphasized the role of body movements and gestures in learning. Gestural expressiveness can be considered a sort of language useful to understand pupilsâ thoughts, taking into account the poor language competencies of children of those ages. Geometry as rhythms and patterns gives a chance to code and de-code rules and formulas at a very low level. The passage from perception through geometrical symbolic representation to verbal mathematical description is very long and often strange for children. Engagement in activities creates a good opportunity to create a space for discussion. Children start to transform these relations into words. By talking, these relations gain the status of existence. They emerge gradually from experience and start to be facts related to the mathematical world. a.

Children were then asked to say what colour this stone was and give the reason why their opinion was correct.1 Children could use general, abstract argumentation to see âa general in particularâ (Fig. 36) Ola (5), Wiktoria (5), and MichaÅ (4) T: Who knows which colour the covered stone is?

310,118,0.992,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"Turning to how participants responded to the four differing deï¬nitions of hate speech they were presented with, including the issue of whether such speech should be legislated against, it should be noted that all deï¬nitions speciï¬ed the same protected grounds (nationality, skin colour, ethnic origins, religion, gender and sexual orientation). Deï¬nitions 1 and 2 described hate speech in terms of, respectively, making negative, prejudiced remarks, and offending/insulting (Danish verb âfornÃ¦rmeâ). The reactions to these two deï¬nitions were very similar. The majority felt that they both captured the idea of hate speech, but one participant did not consider prejudiced remarks to come under the hate speech umbrella. Everyone agreed that both deï¬nitions should not be subject to any form of legislation for ideological reasons concerning freedom of speech and practical reasons in relation to the wording and enforcement of any such laws: (66) Again, one is moving into a dangerous zone. Okay what can one say and what can one not say. So itâll become a totalitarian state. (P3, FG2) (67) I mean I think it would be really, really difï¬cult to formulate some kind of proposed law against this type (prejudiced remarks) (P1, FG2) Interestingly, however, in relation to deï¬nition 2 (insulting/offending), there was a sense in one focus group that this was more of a grey area in relation to legislation: (68) This is a bit more serious you know because it is, it when you consciouslyâ¦ (P4, FG2) (69) Yeah so you almost attack. (P3, FG2) Insulting/offending then is perceived as more serious than making prejudiced comments as this involves a deliberate attack on someone. Context is also seen as important when it comes to regulating this form of hate speech; it all depends on who initiates the hate speech and why (e.g. Is it individuals or hate groups? Is it due to emotion or ideology?) (70) When you are upset with someone, so you can also say some hate speech things, canât you? But I mean there is again this limit because there are these, like, for example, gangs, like, for example, White Pride and things like that, which are practically an organisation based on hate. Where again, where is the limit? (P4, FG2) The third deï¬nition encompassed the notion of threat, which was rarely mentioned explicitly by participants when giving their own deï¬nitions of hate speech. Part of the reason for this may be that threats seem to be viewed as possible criminal actions."

Moreover, after realizing the communication gap between our academic approach and the FOSS communities, we had to learn to speak a new language, and engage the community on their own ground. Researchers often focus exclusively on the effectiveness and correctness on their approach, while forgetting the cost in terms of integration time and learning curve. The FOSS community is large and diverse. And while everybody has some technical knowledge, adopting a lingo that is too complex to understand can be counter productive. Hackers are more concerned about the results than the mathematics behind a tool, they are concerned about the ease of use, more than the expressive power of a new language. Providing something the community can readily understand, use and modify, in terms of programming language used, development tools, following de-facto standards, can greatly speed up the time of adoption of a new solution. In our experience, bridging the academia-community gap has been possible only by actively engaging with the community. This involved, on one side, a significant effort to participate in online forums and live conferences: during the years covered in this article, we presented our work in a major European Developer conference (FOSDEM), and invited lead developers to work with us. We greatly benefit from having few members of our research team personally involved in the Community. While this is not always possible and largely dependent on the personal motivation of each team member, having deep ties within Debian helped us greatly to gain trust and respect. We also hosted hacking sprints and provide support for several events. By meeting the community, we tried to reduce this gap and to engage a fruitful and long-standing collaboration."
253,1087,0.992,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Foreword Autonomous driving not only poses a challenge in terms of further technological development, but also for how the new technical possibilities are received. While media reports on autonomous driving have increased markedly in recent times, public debate on the resultant expectationsâand fearsâis still in its infancy. This chapter examines the questions and issues preoccupying people in connection with autonomous driving, and also the experience of introducing new technologies in the pastâexperience which must be borne in mind when bringing in autonomous driving. That this book closes with these questions is not by chance. Technologies are always embedded in a framework that determines how people use them, what signiï¬cance they ascribe to them, and also what social functions they fulï¬ll. This is also the underlying motivation for beginning this book with the topic of Human and Machine and ending it with that of Acceptance. Societal and Individual Acceptance of Autonomous Driving is the subject of Eva Fraedrich and Barbara Lenzâs article. The authors outline and discuss the multifaceted nature of acceptance, and attempt to furnish this frequently inflationary and sometimes imprecisely used term with better-founded understanding. What does it actually mean when people âacceptâ a new technology? Based on the analysis of reader comments in German and American media, they demonstrate what topics are currently driving discussion. This leads them to some striking ï¬ndings. Is the introduction of autonomous driving really comparable with introducing any major technology? And how do we then deal with the risks that stem, or appear to stem, from it? In his paper Societal Risk Constellations for Autonomous Driving. Analysis, Historical Context and Assessment, Armin Grunwald examines what risks combine in autonomous driving and what can be learned from previous experience in risk debates on technological progress when developing and using autonomous driving. Grunwald develops a series of recommendations relevant to autonomous drivingâs implementation, and at the same time stresses the necessity of an open and transparent exchange with the new technologyâs potential users and road users as a whole."

Public events such as book presentations and discussion rounds plus media representations are also included in the analysis. The focus is thus on oral (and to a lesser extent written) narratives. I took âlisteningâ as a research method very seriously, and during the first months of my fieldwork I did not conduct formal interviews but decided to first see what material came from my interlocutors. Only at a later stage (if at all) did I ask about the âmissing partsâ in their narratives. This was a highly sensitive endeavour in which I always had to keep in mind not to push too hard when my interlocutors signalled that they were reluctant to elaborate on a certain topic. These initial unstructured conversations with a loose agenda helped me to identify silences, the periods or events my interlocutors opted to leave out in their narratives. Though most authors agree that memory cannot be studied without its counterpart forgetting, few studies explicitly deal with forgetting, gaps and silences. Dealing with gaps and silences confronts the researcher with methodological difficulties. It is not only hard to interpret silences but even harder to locate them. Passerini quite rightly asks: âHow can we find traces of forgetting and silence since they are not themselves observable? We know that certain silences are observable only when they are broken or interrupted, but we want nonetheless to find themâ (Passerini 2003: 239; see also Connerton 2008; Fabian 2007). It is true that the ability of researchers to identify and interpret silences is restricted, but longterm fieldwork is a way of meeting this methodological challenge since relationships of trust often are achieved only after months or even years. Although I tried to avoid leading conversations along a clearly defined agenda, my interlocutors sometimes pursued such an agenda themselves. In such cases, their narratives were ready-made and presumably had been told several times before. I gained the impression that during their narration they were not so much remembering the event they were telling me about, but rather the last occasion they had told the story (see Bloch 1998). In such encounters my interlocutors clearly had an interest in sharing the âtruth about the pastâ and these discourses were hard to ignore. But narrative abilities are not equally distributed, so it was particularly important"

These issues are not peculiar to Sweden, but are seemingly a common feeling throughout the world: that people feel they are paying more than they get for it (cf. Laurin 1986). The amount of tax on work as part of gross national product (GNP) has a high correlation with svart arbete (Skatteverket 2006a: 222). Viktoria, who runs her own business, says: Of course you connect the tax-rate level with svart money. That is, it is clear to a five-year-old, a teenagerâin any case a young grown-up personâthat there is some sort of balancing going on.

Returning to Mauss, at the end of The Gift he moved the analysis from historical accounts and âarchaicâ societies and indicated implications about what the gift would mean for the then contemporary society (about 100 years ago), when discussions and political initiatives had started to shape at least the contours of a welfare state. His concerns were about what (economic) exchanges do to menâs morale, and maybe shared morals (Hart 2007: 481), and thus ultimately how society is politically shaped.14 Reciprocal exchanges provide the normative foundation on which the welfare state is based as it âimplies a moral regulation of dependencies in a system of rights and responsibilitiesâ (Jacobsson 2006: 21, my translation). But â[t]axes are not a giftâ, states Jacques Godbout. He disagrees with Mauss in that a state and the gift âsystemâ are complementary. The state fulfils its distributive role in two very different ways: first, through complete anonymous indirect or direct monetary transfers; second, as a dispenser of various services: for example, social, health, support, schools. âThe state system tends to make decisions independent of personal relations and characteristics, on the basis of abstract criteria derived from rightsâ (Godbout and Caille 1998: 61). It is the democratic law that decides who should receive âgiftsâ from the state, not by market selection but by a political decision about what the collectivity of citizens should acquire. As we know, this varies greatly between nation-states. From the stateâs perspective, citizens are both âtaxpayersâ, providers of revenue, and âclientsâ, recipients of governmental services. Godbout argues that the phenomenon of the gift is subjective and a potential source of [great] inequality, which is something a state should deter. I partly agree with Godbout if we take the stateâs perspective. However, turning to the perspective of the taxpayersâthe citizensâand looking at the entire system of taxes and what they provide, taxes can certainly be seen as at least containing reciprocal relations. Taxes have been givenâ taken is perhaps more appropriate as most taxpayers do not have a choiceâ but there is clearly an expectation of receiving something in return, of"

Dialectics of sight and sociality, display and domination, exhibition and egalitarianism, are key qualities of the happening of social life in Melanesia. Yet this ethnographic literature on the social effects of tactics of concealment and display has focused largely on the motivations and intentions of social actors, on their personal and political purposes. The problem of witchcraft, however, involves dynamics of the concealed or unseen in contexts where people might wish to see but cannot. In the discourse of witchcraft, we find ideas about those who deceive without being perceived, and people who feel watched but cannot witness. Witchcraft in an important sense is about the disruption of the interpersonal economy of sight. During my interviews with lawyers, police, and legal experts in Port Moresby and Goroka in 2013 and 2014, witchcraft was often said to be a âspiritual problem.â When asked to describe what they mean by âthe spiritual,â people refer to things which cannot be seenâthe invisible (cf. Blanes, this volume). Witchcraft is believed to be an especially troubling phenomenon because it is both everywhere and unseen. For those in PNGâs law and justice sector, then, it is a problem precisely because it cannot leave evidence in its wake, making it impossible to prosecute, and contributing to the sense that witchcraft is increasing. A further connotation of what is meant by âspiritualâ refers to the spirits or souls of persons and the corruption therein. Law and justice sector discourse characterizing witchcraft as a âspiritual problem,â then, is also a discourse that locates the best means of addressing witchcraft in those institutions that address the souls of persons: churches. Most PNG police, scholars and others with whom I have worked would agree that the solution to PNGâs problem of witchcraft is ministry. Ministry alone is thought to be capable of redeeming the community. But the irony of âPentecostal witchcraftâ reemerges, for the ministry that might solve the social problem of witchcraft can only do so by finding it over and again in its congregations."

He poses that a subject to be examined by teachers and researchers âis whether, by drawing studentsâ attention to the reformulating process and given them practice in it, we can improve their problem solving performanceâ (p. 130). He also points out that problems may be a mathematical formulation as a result of exploring a situation and, in that sense, âschool exercises in constructing mathematical models of a situation presented by the teacher are intended to provide students with experiences in formulating problems.â (p. 131). Another important section of Kilpatrickâs work (1987) is Processes of Problem Formulating, in which he considers association, analogy, generalization and contradiction. He believes the use of concept maps to represent concept organization, as cognitive scientists Novak and Gowin suggest, might help to comprehend such concepts, stimulate creative thinking about them, and complement the ideas Brown and Walter (1983) give for problem posing by association. Further, in the section âUnderstanding and developing problem formulating abilitiesâ, he poses several questions, which have not been completely answered yet, like âPerhaps the central issue from the point of view of cognitive science is what happens when someone formulates the problem? (â¦) What is the relation between problem formulating, problem solving and structured knowledge base? How rich a knowledge base is needed for problem formulating? (â¦) How does experience in problem formulating add to knowledge base? (â¦) What metacognitive processes are needed for problem formulating?â It is interesting to realize that some of these questions are among the unanswered questions proposed and analyzed by Cai et al. (2015) in Chap. 1 of the book Mathematical Problem Posing (Singer et al. 2015). It is worth stressing the emphasis on the need to know the cognitive processes in problem posing, an aspect that Kilpatrick had already posed in 1987, as we just saw."

Finally, the pragmatic perspective argues that while people search for truth, they can never truly find it. Thus, what the community of inquiry deems is truth is merely the current best opinion and is itself only temporary (Haskel, 1984; Seixas, 1993). This perspective has implications for entrepreneurship. Namely, research on opportunities has often taken the view that opportunities are discovered or created and that creation dominates discovery in certain contexts and vice versa in other contexts (Alvarez & Barney, 2007). An interaction perspective of opportunity, however, provides an alternative path for future studies (consistent with Deweyâs [1939] characterization of mindâworld dualism). Under this perspective, potential opportunities do not belong exclusively to the domain of the mind or of the world; rather, they involve the inter-relationship (i.e., mutual adjustment) of both. Indeed, as Gergen (1994, p. 129) pointed out, a vexing problem can arise when there is division and isolation between the mind and the world: âWhen a real world is to be reflected by a mental world and the only means of determining the match is via the mental world, the real world will always remain opaque and the relationship between the two inexplicable.â Scholars can make future contributions to our understanding of opportunity by viewing potential opportunities as a conceivable means to think about and discuss the world that proves useful (through action) while simultaneously recognizing that opportunities are only tentatively held and are subject to modification as they enter and re-enter the environment. Research Opportunities from a More Interactive Perspective of Entrepreneurial Opportunity Community contributions to potential opportunity refinement. Following this line of thinking (i.e., viewing opportunity detection and refinement in an interactive manner), the notion of a potential opportunity should not only be considered as part of the initial creatorâs mind but also grounded in a community. For example, a potential opportunity that is not fully formed is likely to change after being presented to a community of inquiry as a result of that communityâs social forces, feedback, and criticism. In this context, many questions surrounding the community arise. What comprises a community member for a specific potential opportunity,"
186,196,0.992,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"4. When a transparent intellect has transparent goals and methods, it is a âfree intellectâ. However, when power becomes the goal, then the intellect will become immersed in ambiguity. As a result of immersion in this increasing darkness, humans become neglectful of their rights and dignity, and those of other created beings. That is why the Koran states that evil will plunge people into darkness and that to turn to God is to come out of this darkness towards the light (Koran 2:257). The Koran is generous in part because it is transparent and free from ambiguity. Furthermore, it is a method for escaping the ambiguity of worshipping power and for entering the lightness of gaining dignity. It is impossible to be transparent when one neglects dignity, freedom and other rights, and when thought, speech and action are based on force. Hence, the only way to realise freedom and human dignity is for thought, speech and action to be entirely clear and transparent. Since this principle is based on de-violentisation and opening the closed circuit of force into an open circuit characterised by the absence of force and freedom, the Koran says that peace is a blessing. The way to achieve peace is to come out of darkness and into light. Peace increases dignity (Koran 11:52, 53; 4:128; 5:165; 33:44; 25:25, 26). Virtue is achieved by removing all forms of compulsion. Dignity will be realised when virtue is achieved. 5. According to the Koran, Satan was originally an angel who began to discriminate and, as a result, became neglectful of his/her destiny. Any discrimination creates demarcation; each demarcation despises and becomes despised, and hence to demarcate is to lose dignity. To be free from discrimination is to gain dignity. To see oneself as superior or inferior to others comes from losing dignity; however, if you see yourself as superior your dignity suffers less than that of someone who sees him/herself as inferior. This is why forgetting oneâs abilities is to neglect oneâs dignity and to become addicted to feeling inferior, which is a greater tyranny (Koran 2:61; 23:27; 30:29, 54; 4:148, 149; 35:10). 6. It has already been mentioned that to honour all created beings absolutely is to add to oneâs own dignity. The moment of creativity is the moment at which we become one with life. This is when a person will feel the full meaning of authentic freedom. Hence, if people become one with life in their activities and talents and feel that freedom, they live in God, as Godâs vicegerents, and help others to develop as well as themselves. It is dignity to honour both creator and created (Koran 2:186, 256; 11:97; 72:14). 7. When this occurs, all social institutions, including religious and educational institutions, will have been founded on human dignity and rights. At present, most social institutions and systems are instead based on honouring the structures of power. That is why in our societies there is a constant conflict between dignity, human rights and power, and in this struggle power always wins over human dignity. It is in this context that aggressive wars and torture, which humiliate humans to an unimaginable level and even lead to their death, are regarded as justiï¬ed. We"

In Islam, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) taught that acts will in accord be with the intention of God. If the motive is good and the act is good, the person will be rewarded by God; however, if the act is good and the motive is bad, the person will be punished for it. There are many traditions to this effect. âDeeds and acts will be judged by the intention and motiveâ [9]. In another tradition the Prophet is reported to have said that the one who taught the Qurâan and religion would be dragged to Hell. He would exclaim and say: âO God I have taught people your book and your religion, for your sake.â God will say: âNay you did it to be called a scholar (alim) and they did call you so.â The other example is of a wealthy person, who donated a lot of money to the poor and needy, but his intention was not for the sake of God, but to be called generous and benevolent by the people, and it was said."

This certainly has implications for social policy: benefits alone will not be enough to solve the problem of social exclusion. The fact that social exclusion is a relational concept poses another issue and shows that social relations are of utmost importance. Inclusion and exclusion are processes that unfold through the interactions within certain social environments and contexts and reshape the opportunities persons have. There is a link between the main assumption of the capability approach, namely that capabilities and functionings are dependent on different conversion factors, and this relational dimension of social inclusion/exclusion. Being excluded means to be cut off from important conversion factors other people have access to as well. Social inclusion/exclusion is also more of a process than a static concept (Millar 2007). One is included through activities, doing certain things on a regularly basis and being part of social groups. Social inclusion is therefore not a functioning one can acquire at a certain point in time and keep without putting constant effort into it. Social inclusion has also a spatial dimension; where children live and how their neighborhood and environment look have a great influence on what they can do and have and on what kind of relations they can have to other people (MacDonald and Marsh 2005). Social inclusion has two sides, an internal and an external one. The external side can be evaluated by looking at what children in poverty are actually doing and having; the internal side, on the other hand, has an emotional aspect and refers to the actual feeling and knowing that one is included and accepted. The concept of respect and the functioning of being respected as a human of equal worth, which we will discuss later in this chapter, also comes into play here. Both the internal and external dimension of social inclusion are fertile: the internal dimension is closely related to self-efficacy and other positive self-relations of selftrust and self-esteem, which in turn are fertile for the development and achievement of other capabilities and functionings â children that have them are more likely to explore their potentials and try to succeed. The external dimension of social inclusion is fertile because having social relations and being accepted and recognized by others and in the social world one lives in gives a child much more valuable options and makes it easier to realize them. Social inclusion is important if a child needs help; for example, if she struggles at school or if she has problems with her parents; it is important in later life because it can provide networks and is a form of social capital that has been shown to be beneficial especially for economic status (Pichler and Wallace 2008). Hence, social inclusion in capability terms refers to the ability to achieve functionings and capabilities as a child that are viewed as"
125,156,0.992,"Charismatic Christianity in Finland, Norway, and Sweden : Case Studies in Historical and Contemporary Developments","Paulaâs impression was that of an increased openness for people to share Words of Knowledge, which she reports as especially frequent with one congregant. Previously, the senior pastor was in charge of the service, and acted as mediator of the messages given. Today, Words of Knowledge are enacted by ordinary congregants, who are allowed to proclaim them at the discretion of the pastors. We may appreciate that Paula does not refer to current pastors as being involved in giving Words of Knowledge, although they maintain control of their enactment. This was also congruent with my observations at Sunday services, where one congregant came forward during a post-service intercession meeting and shared a Word of Knowledge through the microphone. I asked Paula whether practicing gifts of grace is now more evenly spread throughout the congregation. âYes,â she responded, â[but] during the services, not a lot of people are given the chance [to practice] gifts of grace at the moment.â Paula also expressed regret that gifts of grace were not used more frequently at the church, but also added that they are practiced in small groups, which constitute âplaces for training and trying out the gifts of grace in safe environments. Itâs not easy,â she said, explaining that the gifts are related to each individualâs walk with God and the processes of maturing oneâs personal faith. Walking up to stand in front of several hundred people, proclaiming to have a message from God, can be a terrifying affair. âIt is something that requires trust. You need to have the nerve for it and have a yearning for it,â Paula elaborated. From her description, we understand that enacting gifts of grace puts a person in a vulnerable position. The need for training becomes clearer if we understand the element of self-doubt involved, an example for which we will find in one of Matthewâs experiences. Matthew was reminded of Words of Knowledge when discussing prophecy. The former is a gift thought to bring mental and bodily challenges to light, âthat somebody is struggling with [certain] thoughts,â and physical ills, such as âsomebody having a painful shoulder.â Matthew stated that God can provide comfort through Words of Knowledge which, he said, âhappens sometimesâ at the Credo Church. Words of Knowledge can be enacted in two ways, he explained: Either the message is given straight to the receiving person, or they can come forward for intercession. However, he also included"
185,229,0.992,The Essence of Software Engineering,"Unlike participatory design [19], in which the users actively participate in the development of the solution, the actual generation of ideas takes place without direct user involvement. Representatives of design thinking assume that users themselves often have no access to their real needs. Asking them directly about ideas will hardly yield any revolutionary, new solutions. For example, the following quote has been ascribed to Henry Ford: âIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.â At the same time, though, design thinking does not mean that the user is kept out of ideas development. Instead, the developed solutions are evaluated step-by-step with users and thus systematically refined and further improved upon. Users are not asked directly for solutions, though. Principle 2: Deep Understanding Rather Than Large Numbers of Cases In contrast to other methods, design thinking does not rely on large-scale qualitative user surveys or questioning focus groups. These have little use in design thinking, as this approach is not about identifying aspects that are equally common to most users. Instead, design thinking aims to discover interesting, surprising, astonishing, or even irritating things and to take these as starting points for developing innovative ideas. The process is similar to a gold digger digging for small gold lumps (nuggets); design thinking involves searching for nuggets that can act as starting points for creative solutions. This is why the term ânuggetingâ is used in this context. In order to find these âinnovation nuggets,â persons from extreme groups are often surveyed or observed. Extreme groups consist of persons who either do something extremely often or intensively or take a position of extreme denial. The idea behind observing these groups rests on the assumption that these persons"

Still, despite the high complexity of the model, relations are described linguistically at various stages. However, although the idea of FIBs seems to be quite suitable for the linguistic modeling of complex relations, some problems may arise. The classical methods for fuzzy models often produce fuzzy answer sets, which are quite fragmented, not normal, and not convex. Such results are formally still fuzzy sets, but their forward processing without defuzzification could be questionable. Such problems do not occur if we use the OFN model. Its important advantage here is that we get a kind of fuzzy number at each stage of data processing. Thus the further use of such a result is easy and smooth without the need for defuzzification and then fuzzification again."

Therefore, we are interested in the views that citizensâtaxpayersâhave of the authorities, and the views that authorities have of taxpayers. Ultimately, the latter has to be persuaded to comply with taxation; thus they make the state possible (if the state does not have other income). âA strong inner feeling of being morally obliged to return the gift is the quintessence of real-life reciprocityâ (Komter 2014: 162).

At the first contact by email or telephone, when we introduced the survey, we explained that we were interested in the participantsâ life story, that we wanted the participants to tell their story and that every single story is unique and interesting for us. When we met the participants again, we reminded them that we wanted them to share their experience with us. At the beginning and during the filling out the calendar, we encouraged the participants to speak about what they were writing (for example, âPlease donât hesitate to tell me things about the events you mention on the calendarâ) and asked questions during the fulfillment to invite the interviewees to speak (for example, the interviewer would look at the calendar and say: âSo, I see that you travelled for one year between high school and university.â The interviewee may reply: âYes, I wanted to have a break because â¦â). Finally, the main purpose of the in-depth biographical interview was to produce the life story, so we encouraged the participants to tell their story by asking open-ended questions (for example, âCan you tell me your memories of your educational path, from the first day until the end/today?) and using relaunch questions to obtain more precise information on a specific event or period (for example, âYou told me you chose to do a tinsmith apprenticeship. What made you go down this road?â). The use of this strategy was effective in about 6 cases out of 10. Thus, while recording, we obtained first some comments and narrative development during the filling out of the calendar and then a life story constructed by the interviewee and stimulated by the questions relaunched by the interviewer. In some cases (3 of 10 participants), the interviewees did not speak much during the fulfillment of the calendar, despite the discursive incentives of the first strategy. They answered with short sentences and did not go into details. In this case, we set up a second strategy, which was to clearly distinguish the two parts of the participation: the calendar and the in-depth biographical interview. When we finished the calendar, we provided a break and explained that we were beginning a new part of the study. We helped the participants to clearly see the difference between the two dynamics (writing and commenting during the fulfillment of the calendar and talking freely during the in-depth interview) by stating, âYou completed the calendar. You can leave it on the table so you can look at it if you need to and eventually complete or correct it. Now, we will begin another part of the survey, I would like you to tell me your story, your path, your life experience. To begin, I have one question â¦â This strategy helped the participants to speak freely but it was not guaranteed. In fact, some of the participants did not speak easily, as they were shy or did not like to share their experience. In another cases, participants began to tell their life story during the filling out of the calendar. Generally, the participants began speaking about one dimension of their life related to the column they were filling out. In this case, our third strategy was to maintain and encourage the narration. We did not stop the story; on the contrary, we supported it with follow-up questions and then continued onto other topics. In short, we reversed the procedure and took full advantage of the voluntary development of the life story to go back later to the fulfillment of the calendar. Such cases were rare but advantageous for the interviewer, who only needed to orient the narrative toward the topics of interest."

While the interest in medical training set Uganda apart from Kenya, it should be remembered that Africans did not receive equal status as doctors until 1951, being, as John Iliffe has stressed, âmerely assistants, embittered by subordinate status and unrewarding conditions of workâ.7 Colonial officials also frequently justified the extending of training to Africans on the basis of notions of cultural difference. W. H. Kauntze, Director of Medical Services (DMS), noted on the training of sanitation officers in 1937 that âA European can never quite look at matters from the African point of viewâ¦.Hence the prime essential is to build up an enlightened body of Africans who can be taught to appreciate the scientific reasons lying behind sanitary law, and who will have such an intimate knowledge of the African mind that the cogent arguments which can be brought forward in favour of sanitary ideals can be so framed as to find favour in spite of inherited beliefsâ.8 As African doctors started to come together as a professional group in the run-up to Independence in 1962, these ideas did not disappear, but were reworked as political claims to knowledge and status. Opening an article on African patients, Eria M. Babumba noted that he âwas brought up among his own people and knows what his fellow Africans are likely to think, their old beliefs and superstitions, and their usual fearsâ.9 The Makerere Medical Graduatesâ Association, too, argued that African doctors, by right of birth, had âmore direct communication with our fellow African than any other peopleâ¦.Patients trust us moreâ.10 Such sentiments were supported by contemporary medical thinking about the importance of psychology in doctorâpatient relationships. Addressing the Uganda branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) in 1955, H. C. Trowell described how with his own African patients, âI seldom feel really at home and I feel sorry for my students that they see this travesty of a physician, one who cannot really talk fluently with his patients"
275,51,0.992,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"The difference to AIÎ¼ defined in (2.2) is that the true environment Î¼ has been replaced with the universal distribution M in (2.3). A full expansion can be found in [28] (p. 143). While AIÎ¼ is optimal when knowing the true environment Î¼, AIXI is able to learn essentially any environment through interaction. Due to Solomonoffâs result (Theorem 1) the distribution M will converge to the true environment Î¼ almost regardless of what the true environment Î¼ is. And once M has converged to Î¼, the behaviour of AIXI will converge to the behaviour of the optimal agent AIÎ¼ which perfectly knows the environment. Formal results on AIXIâs performance can be found in [28, 38, 46]. Put a different way, AIXI arrives to the world with essentially no knowledge or preconception of what it is going to encounter. However, AIXI quickly makes up for its lack of knowledge with a powerful learning ability, which means that it will soon figure out how the environment works. From the beginning and throughout its âlifeâ, AIXI acts optimally according to its growing knowledge, and as soon as this knowledge state is sufficiently complete, AIXI acts as well as any agent that knew everything about the environment from the start. Based on these observations (described in much greater technical detail by [28]), we would like to make the claim that AIXI defines the optimal behaviour in any computable, unknown environment. Trusting AIXI. The AIXI formula is a precise description of the optimal behaviour in an unknown world. It thus offers designers of practical agents a target to aim for (Sect. 2.4). Meanwhile, it also enables safety researchers to engage in formal investigations of the consequences of this behaviour (Sects. 2.5 and 2.6). Having a good understanding of the behaviour and consequences an autonomous system strives towards, is essential for us being able to trust the system."
329,185,0.992,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"Western companies tend to work in this fashion as well. They identify a need they want to address and then find the SDO partner that has the capability and experience to deliver that good. For the SDO, corporate support can be a tremendous boon. Oftentimes, however, the relationship between the two entities encounters difficulties. Companies and SDOs might have different approaches and necessarily have different aims. In a 1999 book Corporate-NGO Partnership in Asia-Pacific, editor Tadashi Yamamoto writes of the numerous challenges that face ongoing corporate-NGO partnerships. During our work, we have found two innovative programs that seek to address these challenges and improve the relationships between companies and SDOs. CCPHI is an Indonesian nonprofit that promotes partnerships among companies, NGOs, and local governments to encourage sustainable communities. CCPHI acts as a sort of marriage counselor to the corporate-SDO partners. Every relationship needs a third party from time to time. CCPHI acts as that third party, offering training, counseling, and tools for effective and sustainable corporateâSDO partnerships. Singapore Management University (SMU) has also developed a program to address the disconnect that often occurs between companies, SDOs, and the government. In the new Master of Tri-Sector Collaboration degree program now offered, students learn skills to traverse the barriers between these three parts of society. Center Director Martin Tan says, âAs societal issues in the world become more complex, we need to recognize that there isnât a one-size-fits-all approach to solving these issues nor will there be one single entity that will have all the answers. Not the government, businesses, or civil society on its own. However, we could if we collaborate across all sectors and leverage on each otherâs strengths and expertise to address some of society's greatest challenges collectively.â This course, now in its second year, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both SMUâs program and CCPHI offer innovative means to bring about more effective partnerships. Both recognize that the need to work together to solve complex problems, while still relatively untested in Asia, will be critical going forward. 2.

232,304,0.992,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The word âdecisionâ typically refers to the âend of the deliberation in a voluntary act that results in the choice of an actionâ.1 The meaning given to each of these terms varies according to different schools of thought. In Aristotleâs Nicomachean Ethics, the decision relates to the available resources needed to reach a given, desirable, conclusion, while Cartesians (e.g. RenÃ© Descartes in his Metaphysical Meditations, 1641) would argue that without Circeâs advice, Odysseus was taking a decision that was beyond his ability to understand and he therefore did not choose. Leibniz argues in his Theodicy (1710) that understanding is not a necessityâit only provides a guideâand that the decision exists only through the effort of action. In terms of expected utility theory [1], Odysseus rationally opted for the path that minimized the maximum damage. Beyond these considerations, if the sacriï¬ce of companions can be made acceptable, it must be integrated into a social and symbolic universe that gives it meaning. It is the will of the gods that allows Odysseus to return to his kingdom, which places him above other men. Of course, nowadays Man tends to be emancipated from the gods and can think for himself. He decides after careful reflection on causes, which âmust always be mixed with chance in order to form a basis for reasoningâ.2 However, despite this distancing that is at the heart of Technology, the human being must still ï¬nd meaning in their actions. In his testimony [2], the Director of the Fukushima Daiichi power plant shows how operators, who were obliged to decide between the survival of some and the sacriï¬ce of others, gave meaning to such decisions. Some of their critical decisions are set out below (Sect. 2). The inability of current theories to account for the magnitude of such decisions (Sect. 3) leads us to introduce the concept of âprojected timeâ (Sect. 4), and to explore mechanisms for the development of meaning in extreme situations (Sect. 5)."
3,30,0.992,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"Scaffolding was contingent, meaning that scaffolding encompassed two key events that were at once iterative and interconnectedâdynamic assessment of the childâs current performance characteristics and provision of just the right support (Collins et al., 1989; Tzuriel, 2000; van de Pol, Volman, & Beishuizen, 2011; Wood, 2003). That is, determination of just the right support to be provided to students was always based on dynamic assessment. As dynamic assessment indicated that students were gaining skill and were on the path to being able to perform the task independently, support could be reduced (faded; Collins et al., 1989; Pea, 2004; Wood et al., 1976). If dynamic assessment indicated that students were struggling to participate meaningfully, support could be increased (added; Anderson, Matessa, & Lebiere, 1997; Koedinger & Aleven, 2007). Scaffolding also required intersubjectivityâan understanding of what successful performance of the target task would look like that was shared between the scaffolder and the scaffoldee (Wertsch & Kazak, 2005; Wood et al., 1976). This was considered necessary so that the students would themselves know when the task had been accomplished successfully, which is crucial to independent performance in the future (Mortimer & Wertsch, 2003; Wertsch & Kazak, 2005; Wood et al., 1976). In short, scaffolded performance leads to skill gain that can only lead to independent performance when a student also exhibits interdependence. Before proceeding further, it is important to acknowledge the lack of precision that has emerged in the term scaffolding as researchers used the term to describe a wide swath of instructional methods. This has been an often-lamented phenomenon (Pea, 2004; Puntambekar & HÃ¼bscher, 2005; Stone, 1998). I did not set out to resolve this debate, as that is beyond the scope of this book. Still, it is important to outline what the term scaffolding means for the purposes of this book. The first key feature that distinguishes scaffolding from other forms of instructional support is that it is temporary support that is provided as students are engaging with problems (Belland, 2014; Collins et al., 1989; Wood et al., 1976). As a corollary, support that is not provided as students engage with problems (e.g., it is provided before students engage with problems or it is provided as students listen to a lecture) is not scaffolding. According to this definition, one cannot give instruction to students, then have them engage in practice problems, and call the instructional intervention scaffolding. Support that continues indefinitely does not meet the scaffolding definition either, as this would not require that students gain skill so as to be able to perform the target task independently in the future (Collins et al., 1989; Wood et al., 1976). Next, scaffolding needs to lead to skill gain such that students can function independently in the future (Belland, 2014; Pea, 2004; Wood et al., 1976). Hence, tools such as a calculator cannot be considered scaffolds because they are not meant to lead to learning. Rather, such tools are meant to continue to be used whenever users encounter a situation in which the tools are of use (e.g., finding square roots, dividing large numbers). To the contrary, scaffolding needs to simultaneously help students enhance skills and participate meaningfully in the performance of the target skill (Belland, 2014; Wood et al., 1976)."
117,80,0.992,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Responsiveness In the light of the above, the distinguishing feature of care ethics is that it is defined less by initiative than by responsiveness. It responds or reacts to the needs of the person who is dependent on help. Care ethics is primarily response-focused. It is the other who calls for care. Thus care ethics is linked to the attitude and gestures of âturning toâ somebody and necessitates the capacity to approach the other. This requires an attitude of listening, of receptiveness, of understanding, essentially of close attention. Here, too, we can see a similarity with hermeneutic ethics, although care ethics involves more than just understanding; it contains the impulse to change, to realise care (Maio 2015). This impulse to realise care can be understood as the impulse to implement the response we are urged to give by the urgent situation of the other. In this context, Emmanuel Levinas defined care as âbeing called onâ by the other."

In sum, this review of how young adults identify and see themselves after leaving school shows that the majority do not fit badly â in identity terms â into adult environments in Spain. However, it is clear that, thus far, this has not depended solely on them nor will it remain that way if Spanish society were to reject this group in the future. To conclude, we should now reconsider what the option of privileging negotiations of identity has contributed to the study in its search for an empirical substantiation to its conclusions on the effects of national self-identities for the integration of children of immigrants. This question was addressed earlier, when we highlighted that the contextual dependence of children of immigrantsâ answers on their identity is what raises the most doubts about the value of what they say when asked how they identify themselves. In fact, however, these doubts disappear when the questions focus on negotiations of identity, because these latter provide us with the contexts in which identity is experienced, thus allowing us to gauge the weight which these experiences have in the different behavioral sequences. Together with the inspiration provided by CÃ´tÃ© (1996, 2005), we can qualify these insights by adapting them to the different types of social context and situation of personal development in which the negotiations of identity take place. This focus has, in this way, also allowed us to see how the weight of national self-identities evolves over time â which is particularly interesting in connection with the transition from adolescence to adulthood of the second generation, a time which is particularly susceptible to changes. In truth, it was possible to consider all this because the study was qualitative. However, it is also true that, because of this, no quantitative figures can be given and it is not possible to argue for any degree of representativeness. The reformulation in terms of quantified relations has not even begun. Nevertheless, the questions related to national self-identification and to identity as social capital appear to have sufficient weight for us to continue seeking new avenues of enquiry such as the one referred to in the study.

Should any problems arise, he will take a practical approach, hiring someone to do the cleaning, for instance. In this case the division of work resembles the previous generation, but with some adaptation to the fact that the partner works and to the dominant discourse of work-life balance. In other cases there is more reverence of the discourse of gender equality in the family, but without the subjective conviction and desire of the men who themselves had fathers who had participated more in childcare and housework. At 30 Rune thinks that he had actually been doing most of the housework in his previous relationship, but he also adds âbut I wasnât pussy whipped!â Paul also had a relationship that included cohabitation behind him when he was interviewed at 30. He had appreciated that his girlfriend had clear ideas about what constituted menâs work and what constituted womenâs work because this meant that both could do what they liked the best. But in the long run he felt suffocated by her nesting. He anticipates problems with combining work and children: if he has a child in a new relationship, he imagines that he cannot continue in such a creative job as he has now. He says he feels split between not wanting to have a family and not wanting to be socially isolated. The connection between attitudes to gender equality and the division of work in the families in which they grew up is less clear-cut for the women. A traditional division of work may rather boost the young womenâs critique of their parents, and spur them on to wanting something different for themselves.13 Anja made it clear that she did not want to marry someone like her own father, who is always busy at work: âif I ever get a husband and have children, I certainly hope that he too will take care of those childrenâ. Tonje also expected her future husband to be participating more because âtimes changeâ. Thus, it seems that the general discourse about gender equality has had a more independent impact on the girls, while the boys to a greater degree need a model in their own family of upbringing to get the point.

There were two further insights that told me this was the right problem to solve. First, during an interview with a Red Cross ambulance driver, she told me that she was so lost trying to find someoneâs house that when she arrived it was too late, and the person was already dead. This made me realize that the problem of physical addressing was so much bigger than just the logistics and supply chain industry. The second insight was from a United Nation (UN) spokesman, who said there were four billion people in the world without a physical address today and that this number would double to eight billion by 2050. That was when I realized quite how big this problem is for the world and that finding the right solution for it would be a mission that I wanted to dedicate the next decade or more of my life to. The last step was to turn the problem into a single mission statement that inspired not only the team but also anyone who touched OkHi, from friends to journalists, family members to prospective employees. It actually took us 18 months to come up with our current statement. At our first offsite retreat, we spent time trying to answer why OkHi needs to exist and why it is so important to solve the physical addressing problem. We settled on an initial statement that was to âphysically connect the world with a global address system.â Over time, though, it became clear that the statement was not inspiring enough, or emotional enough, so recently, we worked hard to revise it to something more human and aspirational. And that is what our mission statement is today, to âBe included.â What do we mean by that? Well when someone gains a physical address, their life changes; they can now get access to emergency and finance services that they could not otherwise get access to. They are now part of society.

A big learning from building OkHi is that it is much better to make a quick decision that is 80 % right than to worry about the last 20 % and potentially never make the decision at all."

My only two objectives throughout the year were that the children learn to code and have fun. Whether they wanted to work solo, in pairs or in a mob, was entirely up to them. Throughout that year, I observed most organic transitions of my studentsâ learning through various techniques. All children started the year in the classroom learning style. They had a computer and a project sheet each and worked solo, raising their hand as they needed my help. As projects became increasingly complex, many children chose to pair up with their friends in a grown-up XP world we call this âpair-programming by associationâ. In their pairs, the children conversed freely, exchanging jokes and clearly enjoying each othersâ company. However, as the difï¬culty of learning the material continued to increase, some children gravitated towards pairing with their more able classmates who were not necessarily their buddies outside of the classroom. Their conversations became more focused on the task, but the dialogue kept flowing at all times. In each pair there was a leader and an adopter, and both remained engaged throughout. Finally and very importantly, two of my students chose to work solo throughout the whole year. They did not object to helping their peers when prompted, but they clearly performed better and seemed more content having their own space. All children made amazing progress and many of them have taken their learning further. Reflecting on our experience, it is clear to me that the children loved the social aspect of our club just as much as they loved problem-solving. Another observation I made that year is that not everyone is happy in the role of leader despite displaying excellent technical aptitude. And that is a personal choice everyone should be entitled to. Unless these individuals want to step out of their comfort zone and take a leadership role, forcing them into pairing with a less experienced partner will never lead to a good experience. The children gracefully demonstrated the signiï¬cance of emotional intelligence in pair-programming. In comparison, as adults, we seem to have a harder time to effectively apply the practice in the workplace"

They experienced the âslow timeâ meaning that they concentrated on the child and did not try to combine this with other tasks. The second phase was very different because the new flat needed to be renovated. In this period he tried to combine doing care work with renovation tasks, and he describes this period as âawfulâ because of the stress of trying to combine care and renovation work. â¦youâre chasing breaks from the kid to get things done, and every time youâre like doing something and just need to get finished, then you hear her quack and start crying, and then youâre working with a totally different sense of stress. Youâre not only working with the stress of having to hurry to mind the baby, but youâre also full of guilt because you arenât there already. And then you canât let go of whatever youâre doing, because then water will leak or whatever you were busy with. It really sucks, in other words."

The Gestalt method of problem solving, then, is at the same time very different and very similar to the process of design. Gestalt psychology has not fared well during the evolution of cognitive psychology. Although it honours the work of the unconscious mind it does so at the expense of practicality. If learning is, indeed, entirely based on insight then there is little point in continuing to study learning. âWhen one begins by assuming that the most important cognitive phenomena are inaccessible, there really is not much left to talk aboutâ (Schoenfeld 1985, p. 273). However, of interest here is the Gestalt psychologistsâ claim that focus on problem solving methods creates functional ï¬xedness (Ashcraft 1989). Mason et al. (1982), as well as Perkins (2000) deal with this in their work on getting unstuck."

A âphallicâ, telescopic instrument (Ï) would perhaps have allowed him to emancipate himself from traditional Gerede and palace intrigue, focussed on the intricacies of match-making, but this instrument is missing (âÏ). Hamlet remains a scholar, who reads, talks and writes, but practices with a sword rather than a telescope. Indeed, optical instruments are decidedly absent in his scholarly practice. Science becomes real science to the extent that technicity dominates the subject-object relationship, so that the object a is not only observed and analysed, but also (to a considerable extent) produced by research contraptions. But I will resume my analysis in Chap. 11 to indicate that Hamlet (as an experimental drama) continues to be relevant for understanding research practices up to today."
332,11,0.992,"Media Resistance : Protest, Dislike, Abstention","Also resistance to communication technology tends to be explained in psychological terms. Bauer (1995b) shows how a conï¬ned body of literature in the 1980s and 1990s âemploys âanxietyâ and âphobiaâ as core concepts for understanding resistance to computers at school, at work and at homeâ (97). Resistance is seen âas a structural and personal deï¬cit,â it is âirrational, morally bad, or at best, understandable but futileâ (Bauer 1995a, 2, see also Selwyn 2003, 103). I will show examples of positions that both ï¬t and do not ï¬t the popular image of a Luddite, but will not attempt to determine whether protesters really are Luddites. Instead, the discussion will show how accusations of Luddism inï¬uence the way writers and activists frame their arguments and how they try to distance themselves from assumptions that they are simplistic and anti-technology. While it is of course, legitimate to discuss whether an argument is technologically determinist or anti-technology, this might not be the most interesting aspect of a text expressing media resistance. In this book, I attempt instead to understand such texts as sense-making efforts, drawing on an eclectic mix of perspectives and ideas in order to warn about, or explain, potential damage resulting from mediaâs presence. The label of âlaggardâ is also used about those who resist the media (see Selwyn 2003, 105). The theoretical deï¬nition of laggards comes from diffusion theory and the classical work Diffusion of innovation from 1962 (1995), which divides adopters into ï¬ve ideal types (263â266). While the ï¬rst three: innovators, early adopters and early majority, are described in positive terms, the two last: late majority and laggards, are described in negative terms. Laggards are described as backward looking: Laggards are the last in a social system to adopt an innovation. They possess almost no opinion leadership. . . . The point of reference for the laggard is the past . . . . Laggards tend to be suspicious of innovations and of change agents (265)."

As so often before, the answer lies in the word itself, for the English term inter-esting stems from the Latin inter esse, literally in-between-being. To be interesting is, consequently, to dwell in the razor-sharp limit between categories, to explore the trenches of the no-manâs land of the excluded middle. Now, if I am courageous enough to enter that crater-strewn wasteland, and if I am curious enough to keep my eyes and ears open, then I will eventually encounter a troupe of traveling magicians who to great applause are performing their magic tricks of ontological transformations, an antiphony of voices, some divine some other human.

The possible effects of the Common Core on equity and disparate impact is not receiving as much attention as these other concerns, but it is crucial to the subject of this chapter: How functional for equal opportunity is the coming realignment of authority under the Common Core? Will children from low-income families and children of color be negatively impacted by the new, high demands of the Common Core? Will their teachers be as ready to teach to the Common Core standards as the teachers of more affluent children? Will our underperforming schools be able to teach effectively to these more demanding standards, with less experienced faculty and many children under the stresses of poverty and racial bias? In any case, the kaleidoscope of federalist governance seems to be turning to a new pattern. It will be fascinating to see what kind of a picture we get in five or six years, when the pieces come into clearer focus at the federal, state, and local levels. In particular, we will be interested in how the new alignment of initiative and authority will serve efforts to broaden educational opportunity and reduce gaps in academic achievement."
13,254,0.992,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Although the life project of the middle generation is less defined than that of the previous generation, it does have a clear direction, especially for the women but also to some degree for the men, in the respect that it moved towards combining work and care within and outside of the family. This life project met the increasing need for female labour in the expanding welfare state in the 1970s and 1980s, and, as a consequence, gradually also the need for menâs presence in the home. Thus, also in this generation we can see an historical moment where the biographically formed subjectivities, including a specific way to feel about gender, and the structural and cultural conditions reinforced each other to create social change in gender relations. The political structures in the form of kindergartens and family policies adjusted to the dual-career family came as a result of this change during the 1980s and 1990s.6 This generation started their own families in a political and personal âvoidââthey knew what they did not want, but not exactly what they wanted or what this would imply in practice. Lacking clear alternative family models or new family politics, many of the young couples of this generation soon drifted into a relatively traditional gender practiceâalbeit with the important change that the women did work on a more steady basis outside the family than their mothers had done and the men did engage more in the daily life of their children than their fathers had done. There are very few men in this generation who do not know how to change a nappy or cook a simple dinner; a huge change from their parentsâ generation. Still, the insufficiency of this arrangement, especially when it came to the womenâs orientation towards combining work and care and the fact that women, through their paid work, became less financially dependent on the men contributed to a high number of divorces in this generation. In our sample more than a third of the 33 parents were divorced when we met them in 1991."
51,265,0.992,How Generations Remember,"ideal future looks like, she would say it would be like Mostar before the war. Aida is aware of the fact that her longing has no chance of being satisfied. Her mourning over the loss (of her home) at times is so overwhelming that she does not feel strong enough to change anything for the better. While Aida expresses a strong nostalgia for pre-war Mostar, there is little she does to re-enact pre-war Mostar life in her daily practices, for example by making use of the entire city rather than restricting herself to the Bosniak-dominated part of it. Instead, she prefers to remain and to meet with people on the east side. Each time we met, and we met many times in the three years of my stay, she always proposed to do so somewhere on the east side. Only once did we cross sides because I had my children with me and suggested we visit the only proper playground in Mostar, located just across the Bulevar. When we arrived there, Aida immediately called one of her friends and told her that she was in the park for the first time after the war. Aidaâs case demonstrates that political loyalties do not necessarily make a difference in the way people move around Mostar and the motivations for not crossing are very diverse. For some it is a matter of insecurity or a lack of trust or even fear, others are restricted by their aim to conform and for yet others it is first and foremost an ideological decision (see Palmberger 2013). In Aidaâs case I suggest that her reluctance to visit places in West Mostar primarily has to do with the painful experience of loss of her pre-war home (which was located on that side of the city) and only to a lesser degree with conformity and with making a political statement."
192,389,0.992,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"When it comes to lessons learned, the results seem fairly disappointing. Abmaâs most concrete remedy is to enforce a maximum number of academic publications (2013, p. 162), which probably would result in a proliferation of pseudonyms, but the real problem of course is not the number of publications but rather the quality of many of these publications, the ways in which the data are procured, etc. The proposal would result in (yet another) top-down rule, but fails to explain or address what really drives this issue: the cupido scribendi â the academic will (desire, urgency, Trieb, etc.) to publish (a drive which also applies to Abma himself no doubt, as author of his book)."
360,142,0.992,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"The one aspect I find missing from this otherwise compelling story is that there is no room here for individual variation of meanings. In particular, the mental realmâ as captured by the TYPE dimension of the dual-aspect lexical items and carried along via the proof-theoretic semantics to full sentence-thoughts is the same for all people, and it furthermore (appears to) contain exactly the objectively true features of the encyclopedic facts in the word-TYPEs when these are manipulated so as to give the meanings for the sentence-thought. It thus cannot deal with issues of false beliefs about items in the world; it will not give any account of why different subjects give individually different results on the many tasks about meaning that have been administered over the decades in cognitive psychology. Although Asherâs theory is not described this way, perhaps the alteration I would advise is to make his theory be a theory for an individual agent, allowing this agent to have his/her own set of encyclopedic âfactsâ for every lexical sense.43 Presumably there would also be individual differences in the underlying inference mechanisms of the proof-theoretic semantics also, another topic not envisaged in Asherâs picture. But this now would leave us without any way to accommodate âreal communicationâ, where the two conversationalists are âreallyâ talking about the same (mental) things. While there can always be some check against âthe objective factsâ due to the objective portion of meaning in Asherâs theory, this will not help conversation that relies on having some mutual understanding of the TYPE-portion of meaningâthe meanings . I leave this problem hanging, as a very important topic still to be solved by any two-tiered theory. And I turn instead to other aspects that need to be dealt with in the subjective, TYPE portion of the theory."
78,104,0.992,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"There can be no doubt that the information and communication technologies (ICT) deeply impact the human society. The difficulty in appraising their effect and anticipating the concomitant changes lies in the depth of that impact. In an attempt to understand the present evolutions, we propose to uncover the underlying structure of this new world by revisiting its dependencies on the hyper-connectivity on which it is grounded, and the consequences of this hyper-connectivity, in modifying profoundly the network of inter-individual relations. Where we used to have ten to fifty close friends living near us, with whom we shared convivial relations, we may now have hundreds of acquaintances living on other continents, with whom we currently exchange specialized information about our main fields of interest that can be professional, artistic or related to any kind of hobby. It naturally follows from these major changes in the scale and nature of individual relationships, that the social fabric is dramatically evolving. Therefore, to quote Aristotle, since âman is by nature a social animal,â humanity is changing because society is changing. But, how are humans and society changing? And, what does it mean to be human, in this new society? These are the questions we would like to address. Besides, the hyper-connected world is also a world of hyper-memorisability, where all the information is stored in huge databases and accessible anytime from anywhere, without any oblivion. And, it is a world of hyper-reproducibility and hyper-diffusibility, where all the knowledge, and more generally, all the works of the mind, i.e. all the music, all the paintings, all the movies, etc. can be freely and massively reproduced and diffused. So, both the way in which individuals access knowledge and their internal memories are deeply modified, which transforms human cognitive abilities."
271,40,0.992,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"technologically based media of communication, which are all becoming digital. Deep mediatization is by no means homogeneous or linear. It is highly complicated, contradictory and a conflict-driven process. Nevertheless, in the Western hemisphere, deep mediatization takes place across societies as a whole. Yet even when we strive to escape from this all-encompassing contemporary mediatizationâfor example, individuals who refuse to use certain (digital) media in an attempt at âcopingâ (Schimank 2011: 459â462) with being reachable at all times of the day and night, or organizations that introduce email-free holidaysâsuch behaviour merely constitutes what we can call temporary âoases of demediatizationâ, in loose reference to Hartmut Rosa (2013: 87). In this sense, popular self-help literature on âmindfulnessââthe practice of bringing oneâs attention to things occurring in the present moment, beyond any mediated communicationâis less about any durable containment of mediatization: it is rather an expression that deep mediatization includes spaces of self-reflection and controlled escape in order to remain manageable for us as human beings. With respect to these arguments, the concept of deep mediatization is neither an attempt at a closed theory nor a limited theoretical approach. There are various traditions of mediatization research, and such a range is needed because of the complexity of the field.3 However, across these different traditions, we can at a first level understand mediatization as a âsensitising conceptâ (Jensen 2013: 213â217; StrÃ¶mbÃ¤ck and Esser 2014: 4; Lunt and Livingstone 2016: 464); that is, a concept that âgives the user a general sense of reference and guidance in approaching empirical instancesâ and that âmerely suggests directions along which to lookâ (Blumer 1954: 7). This means to look at the overall spread of different media and the related changes in various social domains (Schulz 2014: 58â62). Using the term deep mediatization makes us âsensitiveâ to how far mediatization nowadays progresses into what has been called âmediatized worldsâ (Hepp and Krotz 2014: 6) and a âmediatized way of lifeâ (Vorderer et al. 2015: 259). At a second level, and departing from this, we need further concepts and approaches to describe in detail how the transformation that we relate to the term mediatization actually takes place. While we have a rough estimate of the processes and practices that constitute deep mediatization, we still lack thorough empirical investigations."
315,230,0.992,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"constitution of a cohort have allowed me to demonstrate this. The interest lies, on the one hand, in better understanding the singular difficulties which these young people face and, on the other, in demonstrating the complexity of social dynamics and their long-term effects (for example concerning the two stages of their schooling and their working life â the way in which the transition from one to the other takes place, and the difficulties they encountered on the labor market are probably as much the result of inequalities during the first phase and the discrimination to which they are subjected in the second). The combination of interview and questionnaire surveys enabled me to shed light on these processes. Implementation of them allowed me both to quantify the phenomena and the jobs held, and to deepen my personal knowledge of the lives of these young people, their uncomfortable identities and their hopes and dreams â in other words, how they would wish to live in our society and be completely accepted as citizens there. From this perspective, study of the transitions to adulthood of young people of immigrant descent is vital; it will allow us to understand their social mobility â in fine the place they hold in their respective societies. What is more, it is necessary if we wish to understand what it is which specifically sets them apart from other young people. The issue of inequalities is crucial here as, apart from the differences which they can explain, inequalities play a much broadly a role on conditions of individualization. The cohort study allowed me to highlight such inequalities by showing the many differences between these suburban youngsters.

They started crying and I asked them âWhy do you blame me? Why only me? If itâs about putting on blame, then it should be fair and include mom and dad, but why only me? Why donât you have a go at your father?â âBecause he is not here and the only one here is youâ they say. Well, if the only one here is me, then you should understand me because all the responsibility of dad is mine. I have the full responsibility, and if I work, I donât work for me, itâs for you and I am so very tiredâ¦ Why are you so unfair with me? Complain when I donât fulfil my duties, then complainâ. Linked to this, in the absence of the head of the household, children frequently assume parental responsibilities. Boys take on roles of authority (especially older boys) and girls assume caring duties regardless of their age. JosÃ© exercises his fatherhood through the phone. He calls three times per week, sometimes every day. Cristina says that unlike many other migrants in Tilcajete JosÃ© is an exemplary father. âHe has always looked after his children. He sends them so many things and gifts, I even tell him to stop spoiling them ... I have no complaints with him as a fatherâ. Technology has been fundamental in enabling closer relations between migrants and their families in the community of origin, though unfortunately not all households have access to a telephone as there are only a limited number of phone lines available and these date only from the year 2005. Mobile phones are more common although they are much more expensive and have very bad reception in the valley. Since 2008 computers have become an increasingly valued asset and investment, linked with migrants and with the importance of education. Nevertheless, internet access is also limited and of very poor quality. There is also a generational gap in terms of technology use. Youngsters are much better prepared to use technology. Thus, phones (in homes, with relatives, or at local phone booths) remain the preferred option. Videos and photographs are also crucial. When children do not know their fathers, they become acquainted with them through photographs, videos, and phone calls. Money is a central topic in families with migrants and it is usually one of the main reasons causing emigration, although it is not the only one.

56,82,0.992,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"events in respondentsâ lives â connected to work, family, health, migration etc. â in a chronological order. In addition to the important details of life history which I hoped it would reveal, the life grid was a means of building rapport with individuals, since it required an element of team-working to reconstruct respondentsâ timelines. My hope was that doing life grids would lead naturally enough to longer life story interviews with respondents, but my invitations to âtalk about their life in migrationâ were always met with polite refusal. In my fieldnotes I recorded that respondents âfelt this [request] was too vast, not specific enough. Theyâre not going to want to be that open so early onâ (Fieldnotes 17 May 2009). In time I began to realise that these refusals to be formally interviewed were in themselves revealing of the wider dilemma the hostel residents faced at retirement, and for that reason I have included some of this rich testimony in the Appendix for those readers who are interested. Understanding this reticence to participate was also sometimes a question of interpreting silences and pauses, to read between the lines of my conversations with residents. Although return migration does not appear at first view to be a particularly sensitive topic, this is to forget that the vow to return âone dayâ â and at the latest by retirement â was a collective promise made to thousands of wives and children âleft behindâ in places of origin. Such expectations of return were also part of collective consciousness in the home and host societies, among policymakers and the general public alike. Furthermore, as a corollary of the socio-spatial marginalisation blighting the hostels, I encountered deep suspicion among residents towards the AdomaSonacotra company, and its supervisory stakeholders in the French state. Such suspicion logically extended to research projects facilitated by the company, such as my own. The hostel residentsâ attitudes, bordering on a siege mentality, suggested to me that the accommodation itself had an institutionalising effect on those living there. Indeed research on migrant hostels in both France (Ginesy-Galano 1984; Hmed 2006; Sayad 2006) and South Africa (Ramphele 1993) has made a strong case that such forms of accommodation represent a type of âtotalising institutionâ (Goffman 1968). I began to realise that in order to understand and break down the above barriers to participation, I would need to submit myself in some way to these institutional forces. In short, I realised that I would need to move into a hostel and reside there for an extended period of time. This led me to spend 3 months living in a hostel in a north-western suburb of Paris. Figures 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 provide a photographic glimpse of life there. Ethnographic participant observation is a privileged method to study the effects of such institutionalisation when working with âmarginalâ groups. Indeed, some would argue that ethnography may be more or less obliged when âpoverty, lack of infrastructure, illiteracy, or political violence impede [other forms of] research"" tainty over a sequence of events in one domain, cross-referencing with an event in another domain, for example the birth of a son or daughter, can aid memory for distant events. It is also a flexible tool, allowing respondents to switch to different domains, start, stop or continue at different places, and cross-reference events in different domains (Parry et al. 1999)."

Cf. too Slote: âordinary moral thinking seems to involve an asymmetry regarding what an agent is permitted to do to himself and what he is permitted to do to others. If one can easily prevent someone elseâs pain, it is typically thought wrong not to do so, but not to avoid similar pain in oneself ( ... or indeed, to inflict it we might add ... ) is only lazy, crazy, or senseless, not wrongâ (1984, 181). Note that, in addition to denying the immorality of self-harm, both these philosophers also characterize it â in keeping with its conception as pathological or sick â as foolish, crazy, and senseless. 11. For the classic statement of this liberal position, see Dworkin 1977 and 1985. 12. For a classic discussion of the principles of working effectively with selfharm, see Tantum and Whittaker 1993. Lawday 2009 and Grocutt 2009 are excellent discussions of self-harm cessation in secure settings, applicable to non-secure settings too. The NICE Guidelines 2004 and 2011 as well as Wood et al. 2014 also offer invaluable resources. 13. For discussion of the role of narrative in effective therapeutic processes, see Pickard 2014. 14. For further discussion of the distinction between responsibility and blame, in theory and in practice, alongside other themes of this section see Pickard 2011 and 2013b, and Lacey and Pickard 2013. The importance of psychosocio-economic context is also emphasized by feminist theories of relational autonomy, which argue that in such conditions, autonomy is impaired. Stoljar 2014 offers an excellent survey of the extensive literature; see Benson 1994 and Govier 1993 for discussions particularly relevant to issues arising in relation to self-harm, because of their focus on how oppression impacts on selfworth and self-trust, understood as a precondition of autonomy. However, to grant that such conditions impair autonomy does not change the fact that, from a pragmatic perspective, effective means of addressing self-harm need to work with the self-harmerâs own rational agency as well as acknowledging and addressing psycho-socio-economic context. For irrespective of the impact of these conditions on autonomy, they do not nullify rational agency, which"

Jessica: Our idea is not to stay in Nairobi. We see our longer-term task as connecting the dots on a pan-African scale. Once the first two companies are up and running, we will move to other cities across the continent, directed by market dynamics and our networkâs strength. Right now, the destination for our next set of companies would be Ghana, Nigeria, or South Africa. Ibanga, what are the crucial ingredients needed to build a venture that can advance society? Ibanga: There are two parts of a new venture to consider, broadly speaking. First, solve a problem for people with an innovative model, experience, and/or technology. How innovative you need to be really depends on the problem. Second, organize people in an institution to execute. Every business is a structure for a group of people to work together. You might think of our role in the second part as similar to how US insurance companies manage care networks. Using a combination of real-time data and frequent contact with members, they evaluate performance and negotiate rates with the best mix of services required to quickly address a particular disease. When successful, in addition to reducing prices for patients, they can streamline a care pathway and boost the overall quality of treatment. At Brave, we work to evaluate and convene new-business ecosystems, including lawyers, accountants, and subject-matter experts, to stand up, operate, and grow companiesâfaster, smarter, and at lower costs. Creative problem solving is also systematic in a sense but should be seen more as a continuous-learning model than as a linear flow of activities. On some level, the analogy for us here is the scientific method. We attempt to understand the world, create hypotheses, conduct experiments,"

Today these subsidized service deductions are already in place on the prepopulated yearly tax return form (for more about the annual tax return, see Chap. 2). Such automatization and simplification of what was once an unwieldy administrative task makes for increased acceptance of such services. At the time of my fieldwork about how informal purchases of work were made and justified, I had certain concerns (for more detail about this, see BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2010, Chap. 2). First, it seemed that trust between the informant and me was a necessary ingredient for the interviews to be successful as just posing a question of why and how a person buys services informally could imply accusing this person of illegal actions. This could obviously provide all sorts of repliesâanger, contempt, shame but mainly silence. The informant and I have to have some sort of relation in order to address such questions. Second, more or less every Swede seemed to be involved. Whatever questions you asked regarding informal purchases of work, the answers all seemed to confirm that you could always find what you were looking for (e.g. Portes et al. 1989: 298, Williams and Windebank 1998: 83). Research has also shown that svart arbete is exchanged amongst people of all social categories, ages and political opinions (e.g. Svallfors 1995). Amongst the Limningers, some buy a lot of svart, most take the occasional opportunity to do so and a few refrain from it as much as possible. Thus, looking for an ethnographic field I wanted a group of people who had something in common yet lived and acted in different realms of society. Inspired by Sherry Ortnerâs fieldwork on class in the USA (cf. Ortner 2003), I contacted the group of people with whom I graduated from school in 1976 in a place I call Limninge. This is a small town in the west of Sweden; hence this group of former classmates is thus collectively referred to as Limningers. As we will see, they provide many different views on what ought to be subject to tax and what should not. They represent diverse social categories and live and work in many different ways in cities, townships, and the countryside throughout the south of Sweden. In the midst of life, they share a long experience of work and life and the memory of our teenage years at the same school I attended. This shared memory provided a platform for trust where illegal yet licit purchases were revealed in ethnographic interviews (Davies 1999: 95â6). Although, these interviews are more than ten years old, I hear the same arguments repeated in contemporary Sweden, although less frequently now. The second study derives from three years of fieldwork at the Agency where I followed a risk assessment project taking place in its analysis"

(P2, FG3) and then, due to the fact that such hate speech is widely accessible to various types of audiences, for whom it may act as a trigger for the already active prejudice and hatred. (41) If we look at the statement that âeach Paki and Nigger trash should get a 9 mm bullet in between the eyesââ¦there are different people and masses of people on the Internet. [â¦] Some, like us will just laugh at it, while someone else after reading it will reach for a gun with 9 mm bullets, go to the street, and seeing the ï¬rst person with Middle Eastern or African origin, will literally take out this gun and ï¬reâ¦ (P3, FG3) Accordingly, as pointed out by several individuals, the existence of Facebook groups inciting to violence, like for example âStop islamizacji Europyâ [Stop the Islamisation of Europe] may become motivation and pretext for fanatics. While it is generally assumed that more âdistanceâ, in the sense of critical thinking, is expected in the case of interactions within the virtual public sphere, it is also acknowledged that this type of environment, which blurs the boundaries between fact and ï¬ction, is conducive to possible prejudice and discriminatory behaviour. Still, on a positive note, the Internet is also perceived as (42) the only medium within public sphere that is free of restrictions (P1, FG1) and a place where one can get information that is unavailable (censored) via other channels, such as what one of the participants referred to as âthe truthâ concerning refugee violence against women in Germany or Sweden (P1, FG1). Hence, a balance should be struck between âuncivil discourse and selectivity-inducing political correctnessâ (P1, FG4). Opinions concerning reactions to hate speech in both the physical and virtual public sphere seem to be divided. On the one hand, penalising online hate speech is viewed as something that should be commonly accepted and obvious: (43) just as one can be ï¬ned for vulgar speech in the street and it is not perceived as restriction on the freedom of speech. (P2, FG4) But on the other hand, when it comes to how âordinaryâ citizens should react to hate speech incidents, reactions to hate-motivated verbal or physical violence seems to be more desirable in the physical world, while in the networked public sphere, inaction is more likely to be perceived as the right attitude, as it does not contribute to the escalation of hate. As one of the interviewees puts it, reacting to online hate speech amounts to âfeeding the trollâ (P2, FG1), since many haters simply want to be noticed and engage in an endless debate."
163,136,0.992,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"The inherent properties of how services are exchanged are one challenge for the Agency. Participation in the sharing economy increases tax errors (Skatteverket 2016: 4). It is both more difficult to declare income from âsharing somethingâ as the rules are complicated, and when income is difficult to account for there are obviously problems in controlling and auditing such activities. The Agency is cautious regarding the sharing economy. It does not advocate for changing legislation, but raises concerns about the erosion of traditional roles: customerâprovider; investorâ project owner; employerâemployee; lenderâborrower. Who reports what to the Agency is not as clear cut in the sharing economy. The implication is that the sharing economy challenges the Agencyâs strategy; that on the one hand it should be easy to report, and pay, the right tax, and on the other hand it should be difficult to err. The Agency does not have the right tools and administrative routines to handle the sharing economy. Tax matters here direct the limelight away from the law itself and onto the application and practice of the law at the Agency as regards these new exchange practices. The problems with correct tax in the sharing economy that the Agency points to are not new. It is in the new forms of bartering; the explosive increase of such exchanges being helped by the new digital platforms.10 From an Agency perspective, it is when the calculative and organizational element in bartering kicks in that such exchanges become taxable. The Agency cannot overlook such exchanges any more in the way it could when they were less organized, scattered and performed through informal networks (yet not barter rings; see above). Such services are performed for a variety of reasons, yet their public organization makes all of them subject to tax. It is a fair nation we live in, is it notâwhere all are treated equitably? The sharing economy illustrates that the way in which exchanges are performed between private persons will not necessarily make relations better. However, the feedback offered for a certain service makes who the provider is more explicit. The ratings demanded by participants that are so essential for digital platforms provide a constant negotiation of relations between exchangers. Someone with good ratings is a person you inherently trust and will use for a service. The proliferation of good exchanges makes for successful participation in the sharing economy. Yet shared things can also be socially attractive as they sustain social cohesion in neighbourhoods. We share with and thereby care for our community, while also brokering a good deal (BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2013b)."
247,127,0.992,Humanities World Report 2015,"some comments to this effect (from India, the Netherlands, Thailand and the UK): As2: Researchers in many cases do not have the skills to fully exploit the new facilities. But that comes mainly from the inability to break out of the old moulds of scholarship and embrace the new possibilities of digital humanities. E4: Conservative ... humanities scholars have been very concerned about digitisation. They and their students live in quite different worlds. E13: At present there is something of a gulf between humanities scholars and those who understand the technology (the techies). They live in different silos. As13: Generally speaking, there are three groups of researchers in view of their use of digitisation: the aliens, the immigrants, the natives. Many of the older generation researchers do not access digital databases on regular basis, the immigrants access them on some occasions, while the natives depend heavily on digital access. Picking up on the reference to concern in the second extract, note those respondents who saw training as a means to overcome apprehension of or lack of engagement with DH: LA2: Researchers donât have the skills; weâre not adequately trained, not even in archaeology. Weâre trained to be scholars in the traditional sense, but thereâs a fear of engaging with technology. NA7: Thereâs an ideological resistance to [digitisation] in the humanities, out of fear that itâs going to replace the humanities, but itâs just a tool. It can be embraced or rejected as it is useful. Thereâs nothing more fearful about it than that. There seem to be two different kinds of anxiety being discussed. The first might stem from the fact that traditionalists do not understand the technology involved in the DH, and treat it as a âblack boxâ; and what they donât understand, they fear. The second might be described as follows. If some of the more extravagant claims of the DH enthusiasts are right, whole swathes of humanities scholarship might have to be revised. The traditionalists fear that their expertise will be devalued."
211,334,0.992,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"identity is to build an identity foundation. An identity foundation requires the individual to rebuild fundamental assumptions about the world, humanity, and the self. Without this foundation, identity work will likely fail. Importantly, these individuals (i.e., those who have lost their identity due to a traumatic event) can develop a motivation for an entrepreneurial career (through both pull and push motivations) and can think creatively about how their past career competencies apply to new possible entrepreneurial careers (Haynie and Shepherd 2011). At the same time, these insights open up various future research opportunities. For example, how does the nature of the traumatic event impact the individualâs motivation to pursue an entrepreneurial career and the type of venture founded? Also, how does the type and strength of the identity lost by the traumatic event impact entrepreneurial motivation? Perhaps the individualâs personality influences to what extent entrepreneurial motivation impacts his or her recovery from trauma through the pursuit of an entrepreneurial career. Understanding these boundary conditions of entrepreneurial motivation as a response to trauma is important not only for building a new theory of entrepreneurial motivation but also for helping traumatized individuals decide whether an entrepreneurial career is an appropriate way to move on in their lives. We continued this discussion of creating a new identity by exploring the situation of people hitting rock bottom. Rock bottom provides a context for escape. While some escape through identity play, which provides a basis for exploring a range of potential careers and a pathway to recovery, there is a dark side. The dark side involves escape through cognitive deconstruction, which hinders any progress in creating a new identity and stalls recovery (or worse). Individuals who hit rock bottom after losing a career can be helped if they think about the boundary between fantasy and reality, immersed in the present, and engage identity play (Shepherd and Williams 2018). Again, we expect future research to provide valuable insights for both scholars and those who hit rock bottom by building on our work. For example, there are different antecedents and obstacles to engaging in identity play. For example, those who hit rock bottom have a different âpsychological spaceâ for identity play (see also Petriglieri and Petriglieri 2010). It would be interesting to study under what conditions entrepreneurs who hit rock bottom have more or less psychological space for identity play and when they are more likely to use this psychological space for identity play as a basis for recovery from hitting rock bottom. In addition, we know little about what tools help people recover with identity"
198,142,0.992,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Requests by funding agencies for a move towards outcome-oriented research programs are having considerable impact on the way in which research is conceived, planned, implemented and evaluated. A key requirement for such work is flexibility â the flexibility to adjust so that the outcome orientation works as a support mechanism and enabler rather than a one-size-fits-all straitjacket without any space for innovation, serendipity and creativity. The shift to a R4D approach based on TOC is fostering massive change, much of it for the better, in our view. However, it also comes with considerable challenges. Defining the necessary changes, and developing new processes and mechanisms, need time and resources, which are often grossly underestimated and inadequately planned for. Some of these challenges arise because of the nature of research: the results are not known from the start, unlike in engineering where the outcomes are generally much less uncertain. Another challenge is that CGIAR is a R4D organization, not a development organization, and it is still in the process of sorting out how to balance the need to do great science with the need for impact. We need to avoid the resultsbased focus being to the disadvantage of the science, and development being seen to be in competition with the science. Rather, they need to be seen as complementary, enabling, and liberating."
269,41,0.992,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"(Dussauge and Kaiser 2012), the people and publications assembled around âcritical neuroscienceâ (e.g. Choudhury, Nagel, and Slaby 2009; Choudhury and Slaby 2012; Critical Neuroscience n.d.), the field of neuropsychoanalysis (Solms and Turnbull 2011; Fotopoulou, Pfaff and Conway 2012), the Association of Neuroesthetics (Association of Neuroesthetics 2015), the BIOS centre at the London School of Economics (BIOS 2015), as well as various âNeurohumanitiesâ programmes in prestigious universities (Hagouel 2012). We conjecture that that moment is no longer alive in quite the same way. It is certainly not that the avenues for interdisciplinary research have suddenly narrowed, but rather that the horizon of interdisciplinary possibility, in 2015â2016, is not quite the same as it was in, say, 2008â 2009. Our hunch is that the sense of possibility that we witnessed has moved to other, currently âsexierâ, biosocial fields. We think here, for example, of epigenetics (Landecker and Panofsky 2013) or metabolomics (Levin 2014). It is noteworthy that neither the ENSN nor the European Platform exists any longer (although a group of junior researchers, based primarily at Kingâs College London, is attempting to resuscitate a âNeuroscience and Society Networkâ â see Mahfoud and Maclean 2015). In our particular neck of the woods, it is noticeable that there now appear to be more large, grant-funded interdisciplinary projects that address the terrain of the brain and the mind (e.g. Hearing the Voice and Hubbub), and fewer specially designed âplatformsâ or programmes to train cohorts of researchers competent in at least two disciplines (though note graduate programmes, such as the Berlin School of Mind and Brain, committed to training interdisciplinary researchers). None of which is at all to say that such opportunities are now entirely foreclosed â or that nothing remains for the would-be junior collaborator save the unenviable labour of shaving the rough edges from an earlier, open, precarious moment, now sadly passed. But there is a temporality, as well as a momentum, of openness and closure around specific interdisciplinary fields. For those interested in collaboration around the brain and mind, itâs worth asking the question: What kind of moment are we actually in now in the relationship between the neurosciences and the social sciences? How might the specific dynamics and constellations of that moment shape how interdisciplinarity is imagined and practised?"

395,196,0.992,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"and practitioners. Communication and, more precisely, discussions and debates about safety appear to be the locus of âprofessionalizationâ. Such discussions are not always spontaneous and need to be engineered and conducted by managers (Detchessahar and JournÃ© 2011). This implies sharing knowledge, power and legitimacy inside and outside the organization. In that perspective, the notion of expertise cannot be reduced to simply an ability to know all the formal rules and to comply with them. A less bureaucratic approach of expertise and professionalism would include the ability to take some distance from the formal procedures and to discuss that. This raises the question of the collective dimension of the expertise as well as the social and political status of the âprofessionalsâ in high-risk industries. Finally, we argue that the management of the tension between the managerial/ bureaucratic approach and the professional/trade approach to safety professionalism does not imply having to âchooseâ between these two opposite representations. But rather, it means they should be combined in a way that strengthens the legitimacy of both of them. We assume that such a combination can be reached through discussions about safety practices that in turn question general safety principles and formal rules. The aim of the discussion is not to weaken the position of managers to the beneï¬t of professionals. The outcome of the discussion should be the mutual empowerment of both managers and professionals. Discussion is a fuel for the professional development of both âprofessionalsâ and managers. In that sense, risky industries need strong (powerful and legitimate) professionals as well as strong (powerful and legitimate) managers to feed discussions about safety that arenât purely cognitively-based on the rational exchange of information, knowledge and opinionsâbut that are also based on organizational and political issues. This creates the responsibility for every participant to speak up, to listen and to draw the pragmatic consequences of the discussion. That is the reason why it is so difï¬cult to organize such discussions. That is the reason why risky industries need to design and manage âwork discussion spacesâ. And, that is the reason why training programs should be considered as privileged moments and areas for âdiscussionâ."

198,4,0.992,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Climate change is among the most difficult challenges facing the world. Its global nature, intergenerational impact, and the massive risks and uncertainty associated with it combine to create an unparalleled need for global collective action. It is also significant in that addressing it will go a very long way toward addressing other environmental problems â air pollution, water risks, soil degradation, and the loss of forests, natural habitats, and biodiversity. At the same time, the world continues to grapple with eradicating poverty and inequalities and spurring economic growth. Going full circle, it is primarily the poor who suffer from climate change and environmental degradation. Monitoring and evaluating the efforts to address these concerns are particularly important. The stakes are high, and we have an incredibly short window to do things right. And in a time when public financing is decreasing and investment decisions are made without considering overall global environmental and development costs, evaluation is essential for us to understand how we can best make use of these limited resources. Evaluators are in a position to present evidence about how we can make a difference in promoting development that is both environmentally sound and equitable. Using relatively small resources, what can be done to help decision-makers achieve the revolution needed to address our challenges? Those who have the privilege to manage precious resources have an obligation to help decision-makers get to the right place. Using evidence, evaluators can speak truth to power. It is not only about how money is being used and whether it has a decent return. It is about measuring the results of our action, knowing why and how things are working, or not working. It is about learning. The book Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development is a collaborative venture. The chapters provide an interdisciplinary perspective and document emerging and innovative evaluation knowledge and practice of climate change and its links to sustainable development.

224,475,0.992,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Finally, Ringhofer et al. demonstrate very clearly that the Boserupian mechanism of increasing yields at the expense of labour input holds only for subsistence agriculture. As soon as fossil fuels come into play, it is necessary to resort to a more generalized concept of energy inputs in order to arrive at consistent explanatory models. In effect, it seems that Boserupâs gradualist model of development does not hold when it comes to the transition to fossil fuel based industrial society in which land is no more the key resource. This shift in energy regime (as described in Chap. 3) seems to be more relevant and powerful than Boserup would admit. It is not so clear whether similar limitations to her model hold as far as gender relations are concerned. All the chapters dealing with the role of gender relations recognize their often underestimated importance in development. Empirical confirmations arise mainly in those chapters that deal with early stages of development, such as in Chap. 10 for the Himalaya region in India, or in Chap. 11 for sub-Saharan Africa. In cases dealing with more advanced industrial situations, such as Chap. 12 about contemporary large scale land deals, or Chap. 13 about contemporary Mexican communities, the storyline appears to be more mixed: It is not so clear that females tend to be disadvantaged by development over their previous traditional roles, but sometimes it seems to work the other way round. Many of the contributions to this volume reflect that it seems more difficult for contemporary human-environmental scientists to share Boserupâs in principle positive and optimistic outlook into the future. Several environmental pressures appear to have evolved in a way that demonstrate a Malthusian rather than in a Boserupian pathway: more people on earth imply an accelerating rise in the exploitation of natural resources. In particular it has been noted that, if not so much land, so many other resource uses rise over proportionally to population (see Chap. 3). Today, it is much more apparent than at the time of Boserupâs writing that development has not been following the transition pathway she propagated, but in much of the world rather resembled a âgold rushâ leaving barren land behind. The âlimits to growthâ notion that Boserup would not take into consideration (although she was aware of Meadowsâ et al. 1972 publication) seems to deserve more attention nowadays. For several reasonsâsuch as her insistence in gradualism, her deep rooted trust in positive outcomes, and her neglect of energy sources as marking qualitative breaks in societal developmentâit is difficult to learn a lesson from her concerning a next transition to a more sustainable society. It seems she believed the society she inhabited made mistakes but was ok (or the only option) after all.

It can also bring to light that which might otherwise have remained hidden and untouched in the dark, because it is confrontational, painful, and threatening. The power of the gaze can cause calamities. It can objectify others, betray, curse, and cut. As the saying goes, a look can even kill. One involuntary gaze into the eyes of Medusa can turn you to stone, and fear of the evil eye is found in almost all cultures reaching back to the beginning of history. Another momentary gaze is needed for interplay on stage. This is another desire altogether. Perhaps it has its roots in the âpenetrating eyesâ related to Dionysus,29 which inspire and are the source of the bottomless reservoir of creativity. It is a gaze meant to challenge, not harm, others, not even by the distortions of idealizing. It is open to and unafraid of the future, and is therefore not a slave to the prejudices that dazzle and delude us and judge Others without seeing what they can do. Instead, it is fundamentally welcoming to the Other and wants to open all options for him, make all avenues possible. Such a gaze is fundamentally generous and passionate, willing to risk a love-gaze and trusting that it will be able to distinguish strange from stranger, so that it does not expose itself naively to the destructive Other. And if Medusa does stare back â something that has been known to happen even in the most beauteous temples of the muses â the gaze is averted in time or lets itself come to the test. For who, in the kairos of time, has exhibited more potency â Eros the matchmaker or the demon Negativity? When the interplay goes well, Eros has a good chance. In the kairos of the moment, the gazes of homo ludens lock on stage in the shared eros of the creativity of the muses. And what kind of coupling would it be if one cut the other off in the name of his own pleasure and advantage? That would be a poor showing and not a felicitous act, even if one of the two, much acclaimed, believed himself to be the winner. Victorious moments, gazed upon in theater and smiled upon by the muses, have another look to them. They are not self-centered nor do they know self-denial. Rather they are fed by the understanding that 29 Walter Otto, Dionysus Myth and Cult, trans. Walter Palmer (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1965), 90."
375,43,0.992,Musical Haptics,"2.5 Implications of a Coupled Dynamics Perspective on Learning to Play an Instrument At the outset of this chapter, we proposed that successful acoustic instruments are those which are well matched, in terms of their mechanical impedance, to the capabilities of our bodies. In other words, for an experienced musician, the amount of work they need to do to produce a desired sound is within a range that will not exhaust their muscles on the one hand but which will provide sufficient push-back to support control on the other. But what about the case for someone learning an instrument? What role does the dynamic behavior of the instrument play in the process of learning? Even if we do not play an instrument ourselves, we are probably all familiar with the torturous sound of someone learning to bow a violin, or with our own exhausting attempts to get a note out of a garden hose. This is what it sounds and feels like to struggle with the coupled dynamics of our bodies and an instrument whose dynamical behavior we have not yet mastered. And yet violins can be played, and hoses can produce notes, so the question is how does someone learn to master these behaviors? Musical instruments represent a very special class of objects. They are designed to be manipulated and to respond, through sound, to the finest nuances of movement. As examples of tools that require fine motor control, they are hard to beat. And, as with any tool requiring fine motor control, a musician must be sensitive to how the instrument responds to an alteration in applied action with the tiniest changes in sound and the tiniest changes in haptic feedback. Indeed, a large part of acquiring skill as a musician is being able to predict, for a given set of movements and responses, the sound that the instrument will make and to adjust movements, in anticipation or in real time, when these expectations are not met. The issue, as Bernstein points out, is that there are often many ways of achieving the same movement goal [20]. In terms of biomechanics, joints and muscles can be organized to achieve an infinite number of angles, velocities, and movement trajectories, while at the neurophysiological level, many motorneurons can synapse onto a single muscle and, conversely, many muscle fibers can be controlled by one motor unit (see Sect. 3.2 for more details concerning the hand).

In contrast, others in the West view Islam as an inherently violent religion. This view has proven particularly popular among Republican presidential candidates. Mike Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and two-time Republican presidential candidate, said, âThe Muslims will go to the mosque, and they will have their day of prayer, and they come out of there like uncorked animalsâthrowing rocks and burning carsâ (Wing 2013). Our extensive study shows that both views ignore that the Qurâan and Hadithâ like Christian and Jewish textsâcontain passages that justify violence and others that reject it (Etzioni 2007). Both are part of Islam. The Qurâan does include an exhortation to âSlay the idolaters wherever you find them,â (Q 9:5) and says, âI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of themâ (Q 8:12). In the Hadith, one reads âI have been commanded to fight against people so long as they do not declare that there is no god but Allahâ (Sahih Muslim 1.9.30) and, âKilling Unbelievers is a small matter to usâ (Tabari 9:69). One may call them warriors11; âjihadistsâ seems closer to the common parlance. One finds in the same texts, âAnd do not take any human beingâs lifeâthat God willed to be sacredâother than in [the pursuit of] justiceâ (Q 17:33), and again, âThe taking of one innocent life is like taking all of Mankindâ¦ and the saving of one life is like saving all of Mankindâ (Q 5:33). There are also exhortations to peace and compassion in the Hadith: âSomeone urged the Messenger of God, âCall down a curse upon the idol-worshippers!â whereupon he said: âI have not been sent to curse. I have been sent as compassion.ââ (Muslim 6284). And again: âA strong person is not the person who throws his adversaries to the ground. A strong person is the one who contains himself when he is angryâ (Al-Muwatta 47.12). These are the texts on which non-violent, moderate Islam draws. It should be noted here that the opposite of our definition of âmoderateâ Islam is not necessarily âconservativeâ or even âfundamentalistâ Islam, but specifically violent Islam. Thus, the objective should not be to try to rebut entire branches or schools of Islam, but rather to specifically counter violent teachings. This is significant because most of the moderates we discuss below are still illiberal; that is, they abhor violence but do not necessarily embrace human rights, in particular womenâs rights and free speech. And when they state that they favor âdemocracy,â they use the term rather differently than Americans do; for instance, one Tunisian leader explained that he favored democracy because it provides full employment. A very telling example of the two iterations of Islam is the two views of âjihad,â a term which literally means âstruggle.â It is interpreted by those who view Islam as"

To give something creates a relationship, and the focus in this book is on the relations that taxes and taxation, as a process of collecting revenue, create. In this book I argue that in order to understand why we pay taxâthat is, why we accept tax complianceâas well as why we avoid doing so, we have to look beyond legal changes, psychological experiments, economic results, the organization of revenue collection and all actorsâ practices in societyâs tax arena and study the type of relations, and expectations, that taxpaying is seen to create in society. In this quest, returning to Marcel Mauss and his analysis of the gift and its resulting relations will help us understand this. I want to direct our gaze onto the concept of reciprocity, which is often proposed as an explanation in tax compliance research, and explore its diverse meanings and implications. First, taking reciprocity seriously means that we have to expand the view of reciprocity as a dyadic relation between two exchangers to include other citizens/members of society which in matters of taxation is often synonymous with the state. I shall argue that similar types of expectation to those that exist between exchangers reside in the relationship that citizens as taxpayers have with the state. Although exchanges between inhabitants and state are vast even from a daily perspective, impossible to quantify or account for, and immensely complicated in a welfare state, we will see that there is a residual sense of a reciprocal relationship. From a residentâs perspective does thinking about taxes in reciprocal terms also make for demands on the state? Indeed, does paying taxes have an impact on oneâs expectations of what society should provide? Second, thinking about taxation as giving something draws our attention to the balancing that goes on in society. Paying tax means creating and maintaining different types of societal relationship and acquiring an identity in such relationships; giving too muchâor receiving too much for that matterâhas, according to Mauss, implications for the status that one has in society. What is the impact of a given tax system, its redistributive effect and the resulting reciprocal relations it creates on oneâs societal status, oneâs group in society, and oneâs society vis-Ã -vis other societies? Third, I will direct your attention to the actual giving and takingâand the order in which this comesâto explain how cheating by taxpayers can be justified and thus made legitimate (at least in their own eyes). Viewing taxes as a citizenâs explicit economic relation to the state and implicit relation to all other citizens brings us straight to the core of economic anthropology. Our focus thus changes from legal explanations and"
356,3,0.992,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Digital technologies are transforming all sectors of our societies, including education. Technology has the potential to make the learning process more transparent, more personal, and motivating. It connects teachers and learners to each other and beyond the classroom walls to the world around us in a way that has not been possible before. Technology can make learning accessible 24/7âand help transform the way we acquire knowledge and skills in the twenty-first century. However, digital technologies are not a magic wand that makes learning happen without effort from teachers and students. We need to understand how and when to put it to best use in the classroomâand in so doing we can make sure the classroom is a place of discovery, passion, and joy. Just as technology helps to connect people, it helps each individual learner to find individual learning paths and to be master of her and his own learning. The iTEC project was a flagship project of the European Commission which brought these new methods and experiments in teaching and learning to over 2500 classrooms across Europe. It was supported by a large number of Ministries of Education and has pushed forward the change agenda towards twenty-first century classrooms in Europe. We are confident that the effects of this change will multiply and cascade widely, and that todayâs future classroom will become a reality for all our classrooms in the not-too-distant future.

The inventor of the Perl programming language, Larry Wall, tried to explain the difference between script and program in a humorous way (from perl.com1 ): Suppose you went back to Ada Lovelace2 and asked her the difference between a script and a program. Sheâd probably look at you funny, then say something like: Well, a script is what you give the actors, but a program is what you give the audience. That Ada was one sharp lady . . . Since her time, we seem to have gotten a bit more confused about what we mean when we say scripting. It confuses even me, and Iâm supposed to be one of the experts. There are many other widely used computer science terms to pick up. Writing a program (or script or code) is often expressed as implementing the program. Executing a program means running the program. An algorithm is a recipe for how to construct a program. A bug is an error in a program, and the art of tracking down and removing bugs is called debugging (see, e.g., Wikipedia3 ). Simulating or simulation refers to using a program to mimic processes in the real world, often through solving differential equations that govern the physics of the processes."

Political and practical ability to address and solve social and global challenges diminish. Not only that, some 5 years after establishing digital misinformation as a global risk, the World Economic Forum now concludes that democratic governance itself is threatened by misinformation.7 This book provides the nuts and bolts of an explanatory framework for the devolving of democracy to a post-factual state. The first five chapters cover the building blocks, conceptual scaffold and conditions for emergence of a postfactual state, while the last chapter explains what post-factual democracy is and why ending there is to be prevented. In the digital age, there is no shortage of information. Consuming information comes at a priceâwe pay with our attention. Our attention is the portal to our consciousness, which makes our attention valuable to anyone with a message, a news story, or a product to sell. When we bestow our attention on something specific (such as following a Facebook debate on the supposed threat posed by immigration; catching yet another tweet from Donald J. Trump on Barack Obamaâs supposed bugging of Trump Tower and the FBI undercover involvement during campaign; watching a rumor claiming that Chancellor Angela Merkel runs the German media house ZDF and endorses child brides; or that Anthony Bourdain of CNN was killed by Clinton operatives while Chelsea Clinton admits that #Pizzagate was real), it deflects our attention away from other matters. There are only so many hours in the day; our attention is a scarce resource. That is why everyone is fighting so hard to get a piece of it.

For example, with our previous example of four heights collected in an array h, writing h[1] instead of h(1) gives an error, even if you and I know perfectly well what you mean! Remember that it is not a human that runs your code, it is a machine. Therefore, even if the meaning of your code looks fine to a human eye, it still has to comply in detail to the rules of the programming language. If not, you get warnings and error messages.

And then I realizeâand this was an aspect you also mentioned at the beginning: digital world. I believe everything we accelerate: transcribing, typing with the computer and so on. All this always returns as a problem in the form of this flood of possibilities. (P3: 1712â1721) Possibly, the interviewee would have mentioned this irritation in her conduct of life irrespective of the impulse to reflect upon a changing media environment and her own media repertoire. However, there are indicators that the implicitly stated research interest stimulated the consideration of this. The reference to the impulse given in the introduction to the interview implies that this inspired the respondent to make the connection between her reflections and the changing media environment. At the same time, the implicitly set stimulus did not overshadow her own relevance structure, which is supported by the fact that the topic came up in the course of her statement and was not triggered by a direct enquiry. Consequently, the implicit naming of the media-related research interest can produce an adequate balance. With this third interviewing strategy, we further observed that the enquiry about media-related topics only at the end of the interview came as a surprise for the interviewees, who were attuned to the announced five sets of questions, and tended to be tired by the end of the interview. Thus, it is likely that they answered the respective questions in a less elaborate and committed way than previous ones. Moreover, it can be assumed that at the end, the respondents were no longer aware of, or were not able to recollect, all aspects of the previously discussed life spheres and, hence, responded in a way that does not allow for separate conclusions for the different life spheres under study. Consequently, the interviewees might neglect crucial aspects, meaning that the retrospective questions yield less detail. Interviewing strategy 4 implicitly stating the media-related research interest plus enquiries after each set of questions dealing with one of the life spheres Applying the fourth interviewing strategy, we stated our interest in the role of changing media environments and repertoires for the respondentsâ conduct of life only implicitly using the same formulation as in strategy 3 (see above)."
46,151,0.992,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"can be made more complicated if certain background information is added: For instance, the house owner who profits from the wrongdoing of the company planned to do the same and already established a sham firm but was just a few days late. Or the company is owned by the house ownerâs brother, who wanted to help raise the houseâs market value without telling him. In these two cases, most would agree that the house owner is in some sort of way responsible for trying to undo the wrong that happened, even though it is highly unclear how he can succeed in doing that. Similar examples, on a smaller scale and involving the loss or benefit of no more than US$1,000, have been discussed by Daniel Butt, who concludes that the beneficiary principle should not be legally enforceable on the individual level but can play an important role on the level of institutions or collectives, helping these types of agents determine responsibilities based on an evaluation of how much they benefited (Butt 2014). The beneficiary principle of case (3) responds to a certain moral intuition to owe something to those from whose suffering one benefits but whose extent is still to be determined. Obviously the house owner is neither obliged to sell his house at the higher market price nor give the funds to his wronged neighbors. He might, however, be responsible for helping them sue the company. Thus, we deal here with a responsibility that should not be legally enforceable but still has moral weight. We have discussed the beneficiary principle in relation to concrete injustices or wrongs that happen to other persons. But as Young suggests, its moral force also applies to cases of structural injustices, where it is very difficult to disentangle who benefits and who does something wrong. The case of Anne and Sabrina, presented as an illustration of structural injustice, makes this clear. We can think of an employer, for example, who will give Sabrina a job in the future. He pays her a very low salary because of her bad education, and she has to work in precarious conditions. The employer thus profits from an injustice that happened long before he takes advantage of poor Sabrina. He might not even intend to exploit her but is pressured by shareholders interested in high profit. He might sincerely think that giving her a low-wage job is better than no job at all, since she will at least be able to pay her bills and keep her apartment. Still, he benefits from the mere existence of people in vulnerable positions in the labor market, forced to take any job they get. Consumers who buy low-priced products because of the exploitation of Sabrinaâs labor benefit as well. Assuming that they do not know that she works under harsh conditions, what responsibilities should be given them? This small example illustrates how child poverty is, in fact,"

The partnership this generation had experienced in their childhood families moved the gender battles towards a more principal norm of fairness where doing what one is best at or likes the best seems more important than sharing everything completely evenly. The tension between women and men in this generation is the concealed re-emergence of gendered structures within the framework of a partnership. The arrival of children was also a challenge in this generation, in addition to tougher conditions in the labour market in the new millennium. The problems were mostly interpreted in terms of their own ambivalencesâwanting a career, to be a good parent, to keep fit and spend time with friendsârather than formulated as a critique of their partner. The general picture among the informants we meet at 40 is that men and women negotiate the outer demands as well as their inner splits in a more peaceful atmosphere with each other than was the case in the previous generation. They either divorce or try to find a way together where gender is not relevant as an argument for different contributions, but sometimes seen as a fact of their current life or even as an attractive difference when it comes to personal relations. The emotional links had a different gender profile in different generations and they also led to new dilemmas of gender. The choice of the male provider/female carer family made most emotional sense for the men, and the gender dilemma that emerged in its wake raised the following question: what is a woman when she is not participating in the economy anymore? The choice of the dual-earner family made most emotional sense for the women and the dilemmas that now arose were: what is a man when he is doing domestic work and care work? What is a woman if she is not caring and kind? These new dilemmas established emotional tensions not only between women and men in these generations, but, as we saw, also within the individuals. In the youngest generation the choice of the dual-earner/dual-carer family seems to make emotional sense for both women and men, but not in exactly the same way, since their psychological point of departure and the cultural interpretation of their behaviours are different. The dilemmas that arose now are: what does individuality mean for personal gender and for gender structures? Can you be equal, yet different? Also here, life choices introduced new problems: old gender"

Sayaka, Tomoko, and Makoto argued that teaching all EFL classes in English would only be effective in helping students to improve their listening skills, and that the policy implementation would likely lower the quality of English education. Such negative attitudes toward the policy implementation were possibly born out of teachersâ negative feelings (i.e. disappointment and frustration) about the descrepancy between what was pledged and what was done by the politicians. Furthermore, Tomoko stated: I didnât tell you this last time [in the previous interview session]. I took a teacher employment exam this year, and I passed it â¦ My dream was to become a senior high school [English] teacher. I think I told you that. But, I took an exam for [prospective] junior high school [English] teachers â¦ Thatâs right! I gave up! Even though Tomokoâs initial intention was to become a senior high school English teacher, she changed her mind because of the new policy: âI couldnât imagine myself using English fluently to teach [English] classes, so I intentionally avoided aiming for a senior high school position.â Yet another type of resistance was observed. Sayaka, for instance, reported that she made a firm decision to continue using Japanese in her EFL classes. Sayaka also confessed that she had never even thought about using English to teach EFL classes, and that the percentage of time spent using her spoken English in class was âprobably close to zero.â 6.3.3 Teachersâ practical knowledge and lack of information-sharing Sayaka, Yuji, Tomoko, and Makoto demonstrated, though in different ways, their perception of the necessity to change their pedagogical approaches and teaching practices in senior high school settings. What they did not demonstrate was a consistent explanation of MEXTâs expectations for change. The need to incorporate communicative activities into EFL classes is clearly mentioned in the recent versions of The Course of Study, and the necessity to enrich the quality of communicative activities is similarly articulated in the latest version. Moreover, it is clear that MEXT is trying to generate a shift from traditional approaches (e.g. the teacher-centered, textbook-based grammar translation method) to student-centered, communicative approaches (cf. Stewart, 2009). As Nishino (2012) argues, this attempt appears to conflict with"

This likely stems from the reality that nationwide English language abilities are still not where the Japanese government would like them to be. In international TOEFL rankings in Asia, Japan is 27th out of 30 nations, and scores for other tests are not much different. Consequently, the global jinzai discussion comes at a crucial time for Japan, with other debates pertaining to English (i.e. foreign language) education in elementary schools, teacher licensing, and so forth also coming to the fore. In other words, global jinzai provides a useful smokescreen behind which discussions and even changes, particularly related to English language, can be ushered in under a sense of imperative. In a recent concrete proposal, MEXT has announced that it plans to develop 100 âSuper Global High Schoolsâ from spring 2014, which will represent a new type of high school tasked with fostering global leaders who can deal with the world (Oka, 2013). These schools will place greater emphasis on English and other foreign languages while at the same time stressing problem analysis and problem-solving abilities as well as educating about culture and history. Perhaps the most striking feature of the proposal is that they will be classed as âexceptional schoolsâ in terms of the national curriculum guidelines, and thus when necessary will not be bound by traditionally rigid rules. Yet what such a policy proposal reveals in reality is, firstly, MEXTâs lack of imagination (Super English Language High Schools [SELHis]"

This perceived preference by employers contributes in turn to generating a sort of âreflectedâ anti-immigrant prejudice among Roma which feeds itself with economic arguments. Honestly, I do not really like the way foreigners anchor themselves in the district as residents. The time will come when they will look at the people living here â the rooted ones â as if they were nothing. Thatâs why ignoring the Roma workforce is a huge mistake. The Roma should be counted as a really important inside reserve of workforce. Because if you do not invest now in developing the human capital of the Roma people, you will regret it seriously.

78,318,0.992,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"2.4 A Plurality of Publics, a Choice of Exposure, a Place to Hide In 1927 Dewey wrote The public and its problems. The book is an extended reply to Lippmanâs (1997) analysis of democratic government in the age of mass media, high tech instrumentation and societal complexity. I find his analysis and the normative position he takes on democratic practice highly relevant for our current enterprise. As Marres (2005) has demonstrated Dewey agrees with Lippmanâs diagnosis, but not with his cure. Whereas Lippman believes the only solution is technocratic government, Dewey argues for a new understanding of democracy. For a start, he reminds us that representative democracy (voting) is a matter of delegation, relieving people from the burden of governing themselves. Second, he believes that once people discover that their delegates are not doing a good job with regard to a specific issue, they will seek out their fellows and form a public around this issue. Interestingly, the formation of publics and issues is a matter of co-constitution: no issue, no public [and vice versa]. This leads Dewey to understand democracy as the process of simultaneously constructing publics and issues, whereby people regain a measure of control over issues their delegates forsake. Publics and issues are thus performed, constructed, fabricatedânot given. Their articulation and their assemblage require hard work. There is not oneâgivenâPublic, but a multiplicity of publics that changes shape in relation to the issues they frame. And also, in relation to each other. Deweyâs publics differ from Arendtâs public sphere. His publics are more empirical and contingent and they have less continuity. In fact a successful public will resolve its issue and cease to exist as such. However, both Dewey and Arendtâs publics require individuals who take the risk of raising their voice, contesting common sense andâmore importantlyâinitiating the construction of a new common sense around what they present as an issue. Dewey seems less interested in opposing âthe socialâ with âthe publicâ. His definition of democracy demonstrates a fundamental trust in the wisdom of crowds (to be distinguished from a naÃ¯ve wisdom of âthe Crowdâ). Like Mouffe (2000) in political theory and Rip (2003) in constructive Technology Assessment, Dewey trusts the outcome of agonistic decision-making processes. His publics are always under constructionâthey thrive on, contest and challenge whatever pretends to represent âthe socialâ. They ground a natality in the midst of âthe socialâ, a possibility for radical reinvention of what is taken for granted. What interests me here is how weâa public constituted around the issue of ONLIFEâcan contribute to the design, the engineering, the construction of an"

Establish an understanding of the logic of practice in the operations area This is the structural approach, which deals with making out what is considered of value on this social field, what is generating capital, both symbolic and economical capital, perhaps even social capital. 2b. Establish the agendas of key actors This applies in particular to those who perpetrate violence: Which of them have political goals which can be achieved by means other than violence? Those that have this type of goal are potentially able to change their approach to a political agenda without violence. In addition, those actors who have a political agenda but who do not use violent means must be identified. All of these actors must be accessible for dialogue and qualitative intelligence work. 3. Work on what are considered the critical points of the logic of practice This is most likely a heuristic process, where the targets and goals change during the process as new learnings most likely will submerge the more you deal with the social field of the operational field. One example of what one can target is the way religion is used as a means of mobilisation of violence. Another example can be the informal economy of the social field, how to tweak it to get the actors into perceiving other (more benevolent) strategies as âthe bestâ strategies, or at least better than the strategies their own forces regard as unwanted. Furthermore, the symbolic capital of social, geographical or ethnic groups, even gender, can be can be targetedâstrengthening or weakening their positions in order to achieve certain effects on the way the social field is constituted. 4a. Offer actors using violent tactics the opportunity to change strategy Once an acceptable monopoly on armed force has been established and has been in operation for a while, negotiations with the actors should begin. In short, resources are offered to allow participation in the political process, but using peaceful means. The choice of resources will vary and will be guided by the actorsâ needs, and may involve both material and services. Reconstruction is thus not something that takes place after the conflict. Reconstruction of whatever is involved provides a route to gaining control over the area of operations; it is not something that happens through the process of establishing control.

Trust between individuals is different to trust we have in corporations. This asymmetry is a really significant issue for AS, because humans ground their trust in beliefs about the corporation behind the AS, not the systems themselves instantiated in a single car, robot, or computer installation. Social norming is an approach to procedural ethics outside of traditional philosophical theories from anthropology and sociology [101]. Social norming is about learning how to behave in groups to get along the best. It requires we understand social expectations. Detailed theories of cooperative behaviour stem from disciplines such as sociology, biology, anthropology and group psychology. These models are not about competence and achieving optimal performance on tasks, but about creating the most cohesive, resilient teams of organisms. Theories such as game theory contribute to understanding social norming [72]. One of the many advantages of group level norms is the ability to train AS with social norming without needing top-down ethical theories to drive behaviours. However, while there are promising avenues for research into the ethical programming to improve trust, many barriers exist for the universalization of such programming. This is because there remains vast disagreement on what the right ethical principles are or even whether ethical principles exist such that they could be implemented into an AS. What does ethical talk amount to? It seems that humans judge each others actions as ethical or not ethical based a huge range of theoretical, contextual, pragmatic and social factors that ethical theories struggle to explain beyond stipulating that actual human decision makers exhibit a sort of hopeless contrariness. There is a lot of work to be done in determining what the most ethical action is in any particular context and what model underpins such actions. However, even if we can program AS to be ultimately logical, rational or ethical, humans may be uncomfortable. Would we trust machines that obey norms without empathy [28]? Consider the origins of the word robot from the 1920 play, Rossumovi UniverzaÌlniÌ Roboti (Rossumâs Universal Robots). In the play Czech writer Karel Capek endowed robots with not just thoughts, but emotions to enable them to increase their productivity [97]. Capekâs robots were forced workers more like biological androids Replicants in Bladerunner than metal machines. If we program AS with emotions and empathy to build trust, will they suffer if we treat them badly? If AS are moral agents that can suffer, then building trustworthy autonomous systems also means building an ethical and legal framework around their use and identifying their rights [81]. Japanese roboticists are already designing robots to have âkokoroâ, translated into heart, spirit or mind [1]. Kokoro stems from animist spiritual thinking that all objects, including rocks and trees, have some level of consciousness and agency including emotions, intelligence and intention. Robots and AS of the future may need complex social identities to meet ethical and social norms."
13,328,0.992,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"The problem of the middle generationâknowing what kind of man/ woman they did not want to be, but not knowing what they wanted insteadâhas more or less disappeared. Both women and men in the youngest generation can talk at length about what kind of person they are or want to be, and this is mainly expressed in gender-neutral terms like being open and honest, social, active, easygoing, independent, flexible, stubborn, talkative, depressive or good-natured. The emphasis lies on âbeing oneselfâ. For the working-class informants, being oneself is most often equivalent to being relaxed and ordinary and not intolerant of others. For middle-class informants, it is elaborated on as being a special person, unique and not easily fitted into predefined identity boxes to do with gender, political opinions, clothing or lifestyles (see also Simonsen and Ulriksen 1998; Jensen 2001). There are gender differences, however, in how this desire for uniqueness is expressed. Among the women, it is about being authentic and coherent, the person you really are; among the men, it refers to being different and unpredictable, to be free, courageous and surprising or even provocative. The point of not fitting into a box is stressed by combining identities that others may see as incompatible: to be an intellectual and a surfer, to be serious and a hedonist, to like music or films that are normally seen as contrasts, or alternately to defend rightwing and left-wing political views to confuse others about oneâs political standââI donât like being a stereotypeâ, Anders says. We saw the same in Runeâs ruminations about what to wear. They admire other boys who are âinteresting personalitiesâ in this way. In only two of the womenâboth middle class and both strongly identified with their fathersâwe find some of the same desire to be special and provocative to others. Gender also exists on more explicit and quite stereotypical levels. Even though both men and women are at pains to explain that these"

57,112,0.992,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","Being Manipulated As described above, we assume that respondents have a particular version of the truth that they want to share with us, perhaps even an agenda, and while it can be challenging to figure out how to value and triangulate different accounts, we consider this part and parcel of our craft. But occasionally, we have encountered more blatant forms of manipulation. It is easy to suggest in the abstract that one should not fall for such attempts, but in practice it can, for different reasons, be difficult to avoid being manipulated. We describe a few of our experiences and try to draw some lessons. One such pitfall is the âresentful respondentâ, who may have valuable information to share, but has his own reasons (resentment against the system in general, or against a particular person) to speak to us. On one level, such a person can give us access to information that we would otherwise not be able to get. However, precisely because such data cannot easily be triangulated, it is more than usually difficult to assess its veracity. A second risk is that, unless we can keep the contact entirely confidential, it may interfere with the willingness of others to trust and speak to us. Both our India and our Kazakhstan researcher have encountered a âresentful respondentâ. Whereas the India researcher has cultivated the contact while being aware of the risk of manipulation, the Kazakhstan researcher decided to forego the opportunity. The difference lay not so much in their ability to judge the veracity of the respondentâs account, as in their research topic, and the associated opportunity cost: the Kazakhstan researcher feared it would interfere with the relationship she was building with other party cadres, whereas the India researcher was already focusing on regime critics rather than insiders, so had little to lose. Our Iran researcher has experienced the opposite situation: being manipulated by a former dissident turned regime informer. He met this young journalist, who wrote about films and had reformist leanings, on his first visit to Iran, spent time with him regularly, and developed a friendship. On a return visit, the journalist told our researcher he had been arrested before and feared another arrest. He instructed our researcher that if he should drop out of contact, the researcher was to deliver a prewritten press release reporting the journalistâs renewed arrest to Reporters Without"
169,459,0.992,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"sides have motivated and informed experiments to improve AM. Policy makers in general found the core AM cycle (Fig. 16.1) far too simple in its appreciation of the diverse inï¬uences that create the policy world in which they operate (Walters 1997). For example, Weick (1995) claims that a key challenge to adopting and implementing AM is that the basic concept may aim for the key management goal, but it does not give enough attention to one of the founding tenets of AM: the diversity of perspectives and goals among stakeholders. Many of them are driven by very different goals, which are tied to politics, business lobbying, or ideological stance and which are in turn linked with broader organizational and social contexts. Understanding these interactions is critical to a successful application of AM. Innovators in business management reached the same conclusion as government policy makers: the science of trends and causal mechanisms is critical to identify potential paths and related causes, but it must be complemented by appreciation of the most powerful factors that drive those causes and trends, e.g., the goals, paradigms, and mental models that drive the stakeholders (Senge 1990). Paradigms and mental models are like archetypes or basic templates of how we see the world, and we use them to ï¬lter information into categories like true or false and believable or incredible. For example, some see the world as a collection of individuals, whereas others see a hierarchical structure of power relations that connects everyone (see Kahan 2008; Yazdanpanah et al. 2014). The structure of relationships and the trends they generate arise out of these goals and mental models of society. How we interact and how those relations generate trends depend on how we think. How we think and what goals we use can be changed as part of the decision-making process. AM has been applied to foster this by creating a space thatâs safe to reveal our underlying thoughts and open the door for innovative compromises in thinking, policy, and action. Efforts to make business organizations more adaptive revealed a hierarchy of relationships between the factors that inï¬uence how stakeholders consider evidence (Fig. 16.2). Moving from the top to the bottom one encounters factors of increasing inï¬uence on how we perceive how our world works. Shallow analysis never goes beyond the tip of the iceberg, the events that periodically appear with no pattern that connects, and makes sense of them. Historians and statisticians might look deeper for those patterns that show us trends that brought us here or that suggest where we are going. Looking deeper one searches for the ways that we interact, the patterns of behavior, that create those trends. The network of such causal mechanisms is also referred to as the system structure. At the base are the most powerful forces that determine all the patterns above: the myths and paradigms we nurture or the goals that we as individuals or as members or an organization develop and follow. To summarize a vast and rapidly expanding ï¬eld in applying cognitive psychology to management, one still must pursue rigorous science and technical implementation, but achieving mutual understanding of the science and policy based on very different goals and underlying paradigms is essential. Science only becomes useful as the different perspectives in any dispute come to agree on how to deï¬ne the means to interpret and then implement science."

Even when the mother is described as an energetic housewife with âdust on her brainâ, she is seen as a powerful figure. The tone is humorous and the descriptions respectful, like in this account from the otherwise quite father-identified Geir: Very thorough and dust on the brain, cleaning herself to death. Vacuuming and cleaning and when she does something, itâs not bloody half-arsed. Then she does it 100 per cent.

As a result, I got socialized, not just on computers but also on entrepreneurs who were doing interesting things. The cutting-edge technology of the time and the entrepreneurs globally who were not much older than I was made a powerful impression on my mind. So when I went to the pharmacy school after the two years were up, I saw that my mind had started to develop in a completely different direction from that of the medical school culture. This was a very significant culture clash for me. I only lasted about a year and a half and came to the conclusion that this was not going to work. So I and went back to Strathmore for another year! You started working for several Internet service providers (ISPs), and in 1998, decided to make the transition and start 3Mice. Why was it the right time? By the time I left Strathmore, the desire to become an entrepreneurâ like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and the Netscape foundersâhad already settled in my mind to a point of no return. The basic direction, the highest level where one could go in terms of ambition as a technology person, had settled. What does it mean for you to be an entrepreneur? I think I am a rebelâself-directed maybe, but a personality who likes to have his own mind about things. For me, it was never about the money, but rather about the fact that you could, almost from a blank sheet, create and build something, out of your own thoughts, and shape it into whatever it could become. That was a very powerful idea for me. It still continues to drive me today. It is just an innate personality trait. Then seeing other entrepreneurs and what their companies were doing gave this trait a shape and a form of expression. It is like an artistâexcept that an artist expresses himself or herself in, say, a painting. I figured that you could express rebellion, sort of your view of the world, in the ability to create something new and greatâand that you can do that with a business as well. This desire was deeply ingrained in me by the time I left Strathmore."

Data furthermore show that ever-higher incomes may not buy ever-higher levels of satisfaction, but people who have already met their basic needs can increase their overall satisfaction by pursuing higher needs (higher in Maslowian terms). This chapter shall next show that although this understanding of human nature and society is much more valid than one that centers exclusively on material consumption and pleasureseeking, it still ignores one substantial motivator of human behaviorâmoral commitments. Without this dimension, the conceptual apparatus for understanding much of interpersonal and social dynamics is extremely deficient. Above all, it leads to giving the pursuit of happiness too much prominence and undermines the moral commitments that are essential for making a good life and a good society."
99,359,0.991,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"The experience of the Neighbourhood Childrenâs Services raises some interesting questions on the political and social conditions of innovative practices. One might tend to believe that innovations are more likely to appear and develop in contexts where there is a strong political commitment to promote innovation and where such commitment is more consistent, less affected by partisan quarrelling, and where actors such as governing bodies and innovation developers are open to cooperate in good terms. One might as well associate innovation with developed and knowledgeoriented environments. This case seems to support a rather different view. Some successful innovations (having lasted almost 20 years and a positive record of results is arguably success) may be possible in a context where innovation was not a priority and where political rivalries and mistrust (specifically between innovation developers and governing bodies) were, and still are, quite strong. This suggests that in some cases âdisorganisedâ and conflictual environments may leave more gaps open to innovative initiatives than consistent ones. It certainly does not make the life and work of innovators easier, but it may give them more leeway. Innovations may be âeasierâ in such contexts when it is possible to integrate them into different, sometimes opposite, narratives. In our case, proximity to users, flexibility and user participation and coproduction could be put into a left wing innovative and participatory narrative, but also into a right wing traditional conservative narrative on community involvement."

In this chapter, we describe the basics of how climate models are evaluated and how they are tested. The language and terms used in this discussion can be confusing. For example, the terms validation and evaluation are often used to mean different things, and a projection is not the same as a forecast. We will see why shortly.

303,119,0.991,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"constructed by interactions with others while also providing the space for such interactions. This space is, in a sense, not a subject, however, because it only accepts and permits these interactions to take place. Therefore, it is a place (Nishida, 1949). This is, in a sense, a double subjectivity, which consists of a constructed and an encompassing subject. These two are contradictory, but are integrated simultaneously. This contradiction is absolute rather than relative, because this contradiction involves the selfâs opposition to itself. There is nothing in this place prior to the interactions, and thus Nishida sometimes describes it as the âplace of absolute nothingness,â which is in sharp contrast to ârelative nothingness,â which is indeed antonymous to âbeing.â In this sense, a place of nothingness is based on the concept of the absolute nothingness, and in fact Nishida later used a different concept to refer to the same idea, namely, âabsolute contradictory self-identityâ (Nishida, 1965). It is possible to say that Nishidaâs concept of the âplace of nothingnessâ is the key to understanding the political meaning of World Englishes and the tribute system of China. Both are inclusive towards others and have a blurred center. Nevertheless, they function as systems with coherence and continuity. They transform themselves into something new in a continuous manner. In this sense, using Englishes as a communicative device for comprehending contemporary world affairs is equivalent to saying that IR is a place that is inclusive towards different narratives and the discourses of others. Introducing the concept of the âplace of nothingnessâ and the tribute system of China into our intellectual activities is more of a thought experiment than the provision of a concrete policy program. It is suggestive, however, in considering the future paradigm of research methodology. In order to transform IR into a more diverse and democratic discipline, we have to ready ourselves for the forthcoming changes that will presumably take place at the peripheries. Rather than turn down arguments and theories of non-Western traditions mainly because of their âimperfectâ English quality or logical inconsistency, we have to focus more on elements, whether intentional or coincidental, generated by new and unfamiliar forms of representation. IR will otherwise become one of those means of unification and standardization at the world scale that, according to Hannah Arendt, are a typical feature of the disappearance of the public and totalitarianism. Thus, we can conclude here that it is not others who need to be transformed into something new, but those who are working on contemporary world affairs."

Among all the comments we have had, two stand out as the most common. On a positive note, a large number of people commented on the importance of what we are doing, they described a world humanities report as timely and necessary, sometimes even as urgently needed. But there was another kind of reaction when our project was described as âvery ambitiousâ. After all, we were attempting to survey the state of the humanities worldwide and assess the challenges for the future. That itself is a challenge of almost bewildering proportions. We agree. Our project is as ambitious as it is worthwhile. But we make no apology, it had to be done, or it is at least one step in a longer-term process that has to be started. Many of the issues we address are already well-known (the value of the humanities, similarities to or differences from the sciences, interdisciplinarity, the digital humanities, funding and the relation between the humanities and society). But to come at them from a global perspective, comparing reports, commentaries and interviews from many countries brings an entirely new perspective to these well-worn issues. Furthermore, the very process of conducting the research â creating the contacts, building the goodwill, setting up a template for future research â might help build a worldwide platform for the humanities. So we see our effort, substantial as it has been, as a first step. Doubtless there are all sorts of ways in which future (or follow-up) reports can improve upon what we have done: more interviews, with different questions, covering a larger number of countries; the systematic collection of statistical data. We also explored the possibility of an electronic survey to elicit responses to our issues from a thousand humanists around the"

The Bland case was decided before the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) and thus the court gave no weight to issues of patient rights, including the right to life. However, subsequent to the HRAâs coming into force, the courts have sought to reconcile the Bland judgment with the right to life. In NHS Trust A v M; NHS Trust B v H [2001] 1 All ER 801, Butler-Sloss LJ explained that there is no violation of Article 2 ECHRâs right to life when life-sustaining treatment is withdrawn because it is no longer in the patientâs best interests. This approach to interpretation of Article 2 seems to have been plucked from thin air given that there is no precedent for reading the stateâs obligations under Article 2 as subject to a best interest determination. In terms of the right to life, this may look suspiciously like we have a right to life until it is not in our best interests to continue living. While this may be a sensible, even justifiable, approach in the context of PVS patients, it is surely worrying in more general terms? Who is to decide when our lives are no longer in our best interests? And how will they know? The withdrawal of medical treatment leading to death needs to be acknowledged as a legitimate exception to the right to life, but it is a pity that more explicit reasoning has not yet been provided to reconcile the right to life with end-of-life decision-making. As the state is only ever obliged to take reasonable steps to preserve life, it may be that a focus upon both autonomy and quality of life could cast a clearer light upon when it is no longer reasonable to preserve a life. Even in the context of a PVS patient, however, the right to life and other human rights do still have meaning and value. A doctor might be able to withdraw treatment to allow the patient to die, but it would not be lawful for a hospital intruder to shoot the patient in the head, nor for the hospital to throw the patient out onto the street. We would not accept a degrading use of the patientâs body even though he is not aware of it. Thus, we do still value this human beingâand the law does too. It is a living person, not just an empty shell, or an organism which the âpersonâ has vacated."

117,170,0.991,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"This example shows Leandra doing will-work. She wants to shower Ms Koch.16 In order to do this, she needs Ms Koch to want to shower, or at least to not refuse it. Leandraâs initial use of the generic âyouâ indicates that entering the room cheerfully is a more general way of approaching residents. But she then adjusts to the person herself and to the severity of the residentâs condition, as is evidenced in Ms Kochâs example. In other words, generalisations are not useful here. To get Ms Koch to want to shower, Leandra attempts to sculpt her mood. Although sometimes ânothing worksâ and wanting remains not amenable to Leandra to work upon it, sometimes it does work: in those situations, Leandraâs smile causes Ms Koch to âalso become cheerfulâ, to âmagnify the emotionâ and to relax. This, in turn, results in her allowing Leandra âto do moreâ, including giving her a shower. In another example of this way of doing will-work, Joani often brought three cups of hot chocolate to Ms Veenstra along with her medicine. We drank the chocolate by her bedside together. Meanwhile, we talked about the weather or what we had done yesterday, or about the joint breakfast awaiting her downstairs. By doing this, Joani hoped to get Ms Veenstra into the mood for getting out of bed, and it often worked. In those cases, what Ms Veenstra wanted was aligned with Joaniâs desire for her to have breakfast, and for her to be with others. Sculpting moods and emotions is one way to align wanting. Two important conclusions can be drawn from this. Firstly, the story affirms that moods and emotions cannot be separated from wanting.17 Secondly, it shows will-work as a relational practice: Ms Koch and Leandra are"
252,51,0.991,The Ethics of Vaccination,"when individuals are prepared to do their part in a collective enterprise âwere they to become sufficiently sure that others will do their part as wellâ (Aas 2015, p. 13), then it makes sense to say that the collective, rather than its individual members, is doing something; hence, the collective amounts to an agent that is, in turn, subject to collective obligations (Aas 2015). However, whether or not this position is philosophically sound, the collective that can realize herd immunity through a large enough number of individual members being vaccinated clearly is not an agent in this sense either: typically, as we have seen in Chap. 1, individuals do not decide whether to be vaccinated or to vaccinate their children on the basis of a belief as to whether others will be vaccinated as well, and therefore they do not form a collective agent in Aasâ sense eitherâalthough, as we shall see in Chap. 4, the assurance that other people around them are vaccinated removes a psychological barrier to choosing to vaccinate. According to another view, collective obligations can be characterized as âjoint obligations that are jointly owned by [individual] agents togetherâ (Pinkert 2014, p. 189). For example, the obligation to form a circle by definition requires the joint effort of a plurality of subjects, since no individual can by herself form a circle. In this respect, the obligation to realize herd immunity is analogous to the obligation to form a circle, that is, it is a joint obligation. But what kind of agent can be the bearer of joint obligations? According to those who endorse the âjoint obligationâ understanding of collective responsibility or collective obligations, joint obligations could be attributed only to individuals who can engage in joint actions. By âjoint actionsâ, Felix Pinkert means âthings that a plurality of agents do together, for example, to form a circle, independent of whether or not they have any specific joint intentionsâ (Pinkert 2014, p. 191). However, this definition is problematic: forming a circle does seem to require a specific joint intention to form a circle, as a random collection of individuals is unlikely to form a circle as a result of random individual behaviours of its member. More in general, it is difficult to see how something can qualify as a âjoint actionâ without some form of joint or shared intention, that is, the intention to take part in a shared enterprise on the common understanding that everybody else is doing their part as well (this is a very simplified definition of the notion of âshared intentionâ as presented in a way more sophisticated way by Michael Bratman (1993, p. 106)). However, as I have mentioned in the previous paragraph, realizing herd immunity does not require any joint intention or coordinated action by individual members of a collective. In this respect, realizing herd immunity is different from performing a joint action. Therefore, it is at least"
96,37,0.991,Networks in the Russian Market Economy,"the interview situation consisted of a young Russian female student conducting interviews mostly with middle-aged Russian men. Because of the Russian gender system, this age and gender difference probably helped in obtaining interviews from the busy IT directors and managers. Moreover, in the interview situation some of the interviewees took a âteaching positionâ, which was often helpful in terms of creating an overall picture of the field. Most important, however, is to acknowledge that the gender difference most likely emphasized some aspects of the phenomenon studied and concealed others. Substantially, both Russian business and the IT field are maledominated areas of life. This provoked a lively discussion between one of our female respondents (team leader, p37) and the female interviewer about the role of women in the IT business. The respondent noted that women are treated differently, and those starting from the bottom in the IT business have a harder time than men. This difference is, however, of complex character and contains several contradictory elements. According to her, being a woman has negative consequences until one has gathered enough experience, when the gender factor âstarts to function strongly in your favor.â Moreover, there are both places âwhere they donât take you because you are a womanâ and places âwhere they will take you exactly because you are a woman.â The respondent also related the gender aspect to the nature of the male Russian âwork collectiveâ in IT business: Firstly, many [Russian IT professionals] think that women cannot work as programmers. Secondly, many think that it is a crazy idea to take a woman into a company consisting of 20 men, because this spoils the collective and the mood of the men. And then one has to remember that women have a tendency of taking maternity leave. In the firm I worked at earlier, practically all of the women took maternity leave. Well, not all, but those with whom I myself had come to the company. (team leader, p37) Another female respondent belonging to top management stated that programming and engineering professions âare not womenâs affairsâ (ne zhenskoe eto delo) â unlike marketing, where women can use âfine toolsâ (tonkimi instrumentami mozhno vladetâ) (director, p41).

380,107,0.991,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"Shifting the LenS Many scholarly analysis and media accounts focus on the âgravitational powerâ that ChÃ¡vezâs figure exercised, some of them with an explicit undertone that portrays his supporters as passive and ignorant recipients of a seductive political message (e.g., see Corrales 2001; Canache 2002). However, in this and the following chapter, I will explore ChÃ¡vezâs appeal by turning my attention away from his public persona for a while. That does not imply that I want to remove ChÃ¡vez from my analysis; rather I posit that we have to slightly shift our perspective. If we focus too much on ChÃ¡vez as a charismatic figure and ideologue, we miss the opportunity to appreciate the âthick background,â to paraphrase Geertz (1973), which preceded and prepared the ground for peopleâs support of the successive ChÃ¡vez governments. In my analysis I will therefore focus on the shared historical experiences of marginalization and collective struggle that people from the popular sectors perceived as the background for embracing ChÃ¡vezâs political project. We will then be better equipped, I believe, to turn our attention back to ChÃ¡vezâs persona and understand how he was able to incite such popular support. However, before we proceed, it is necessary to dwell a bit on the recurring classification of ChÃ¡vez as a populist. Populism as a concept has been closely associated with Latin American politics though it has, in recent years, also been used to explain new political movements in Europe, the former Soviet Union and even contemporary US politics. Populism as a political style is generally understood to have surged in Latin America from the 1930s to the 1950s, supporting import-substitution industrialization (Weyland 1999:379) and gaining support from the working class. Examples of politicians embracing this approach are Juan PerÃ³n in Argentina, LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas in Mexico and Jorge EliÃ©cer GaitÃ¡n (who was murdered) in Colombia. In more recent times, political leaders combining"

On the one hand, this account must understand will-formation as a process that is guided by ethical reasons. On the other hand, this must be an open process in which certain solutions cannot be flagged as right or wrong without a deliberative, intersubjective exchange. Such an exchange should be held together by a justified sense of having a shared aim, but, at the same time, it must be assumed that right and wrong cannot be inferred from this shared aim without intersubjective deliberation. Kantâs use of the criterion of universalisability points in a different direction. The way in which he treats the question of whether it is ethically justified to take oneâs life if oneâs future life does not appear to be worth living is a case in point. He does not imagine this to be a weighing of multiple points of view or a process involving intersubjective social support. Rather he assumes that individually applying the test of universalisability inevitably leads to the conclusion that suicide is not ethically allowed. In other words, the shared aim of acting in accordance with the test of universalisability does not leave room for interpretation or different forms of concretisation in specific contexts as part of a process of intersubjective reason-guided communication. What is more, critics have pointed out that contrary to Kantâs own supposition, planned actions cannot be ethically justified or prohibited on the basis of the criterion of universalisability. These critics claim that Kant relies on implicit hidden assumptions that render planned actions non-universalisable. Therefore, the criterion of universalisability as such is empty. To take the two examples given above, someone who is willing to accept that he will not receive help in cases where he might need it might not see any contradiction if his preference not to help others were universalised. In the same vein, it can be argued that the assumed fact that a preference for suicide, if universalised, undermines the possibility of there being any wills is only a contradiction if one regards the existence of wills as undoubtedly desirable.2 It might be possible to save Kant from this criticism and perhaps also to develop an interpretation of his theory that can resolve the autonomy dilemma.3 However, since there are other philosophical accounts of autonomous will-formation that are better suited to resolve this dilemma from the start, it makes sense to turn to these approaches instead."
14,232,0.991,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"Symbolic Ethnicity and Race Another important question that should be discussed when talking about ethnic identity is the question of whether ethnicity is a matter of choice and how it is connected to race. According to Gans (1979), ethnicity in time becomes optional and people who keep ties with their ethnic identities are making this choice voluntarily because they can gain something positive from it. But Gans formulated his theory of âsymbolic ethnicityâ in reaction to the so-called âethnic revivalâ among the third generation âimmigrantsâ in the U.S. and the group he was referring to were âWhiteâ (non-racialized) immigrants. The same counts for Richard Alba, who suggests a great deal of choice in the case of ethnicity (Alba 1990). On the other hand, authors, who studied ânon-Whiteâ (racialized) minorities in the U.S. (Waters 1990, Kibria 2002), present a completely different picture when talking about symbolic or voluntary ethnic identity. In the case of Asians, Nazli Kibria argues that âa part of their ethnicity is not optional and they cannot, in the perception of others, unlike white ethnics who practice symbolic ethnicity, slip in and out of âbeing ethnicââ (Kibria 2002, 101). For most of the study participants, ethnicity was not always a matter of choice. Some of them said that this was because even if they would try to âslip outâ of being âethnic,â others would not let them because they would always see them as different or foreign. This presumption of foreignness in the eyes of others does not always have to be articulated directly to be truly felt. For example, compliments paid to the research participants by other people about their perfect knowledge of the Czech language, or the estimation that they should be âexpertsâ on the topic of Vietnamese culture aroused awkward feelings among these young people, putting their identities in question. On the other hand, not everybody experienced ethnicity as something involuntary. For example, Karel, who dated a Czech girl and had almost only Czech friends, said that he had never experienced the feeling of being different. âIt is true,â he said, âthat in the beginning, when people donât know me yet, they ask about my origin.â To him, however, this was something natural and normal, which did not constrain him in claiming the identity of his choice. âOf course I know I look different, but, you know, I actually never think about it,â he said. As we have seen earlier in this chapter, race was also not a prominent issue in the case of making friends or choosing a suitable partner. What really mattered with this decision were culture, mentality, and common experiences of growing up in migrancy. Although some societal issues and involuntary ascriptions associated with racialized or non-white identities (Waters 1994) were felt by some of the interviewed children and young adults, the question of race did not constitute a major concern for them."
186,51,0.991,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"Hence, literary ï¬ction and poetry also make broad reference to dignity, Grossman and Schiller being examples. But while it could be maintained that the earlier examples of dignity give the reader some information about what it is, the later examples leave the content blank. Schiller demands that we should all protect humankindâs dignity, without indicating what it actually is. And Grossman chooses to equate all that is perfect with all that is digniï¬ed, leaving unclear why he thinks so and what this would add to the concept of dignity. Of course, one cannot generalise strong claims from the above examples, few as they are. But it is nevertheless signiï¬cant that in these selected novels and poems the use of dignity points towards it being a personal characteristic, and that the broader use of dignity in selected ï¬ction tends to be vague. If the foreign visitor who was invoked above were also to judge the football example, she would probably frown and ask how two people (the German and French journalists) could use the same term, âdignityâ, to describe complete opposites. One of the journalists believed that Zidane had lost his dignity by attacking his Italian colleague, the other that he had kept and defended it. Matters would be complicated further if the visitor came across other quotes from the people mentioned above. For instance, Nelson Mandela said the following in an address to the South African parliament to mark ten years of democracy in 2004: âWe accord persons dignity by assuming that they are goodâ (Mandela 2004). This seems to contradict his earlier quoted view that the affluent must never fail to respond to the cries of the poor for food, shelter and dignity. If dignity were equated with being good, poverty cannot take this away or, in fact, make any difference.6 It seems that we have not progressed much in ï¬nding answers to the two riddles, which are, of course, related. The ï¬rst riddle asks why something that is inviolable needs to be protected. This presupposes that human dignity is universal and therefore an intrinsic part of human beings.

As we will explain in more detail in 5.3, where we argue for a view of justification as a kind of trade-off, the level of accuracy of the target can be decided upon in advance. Whether this level will be reached after we have arrived at proposition number three, four, sixteen, or more, depends on the structure of the series and on the chosen level. In no way does it depend on the question of how obvious proposition number three, four, sixteen, etc. is. Even if the proposition at issue is very obvious, and thus has a high probability, its contribution to the justification of the target might be small enough to be neglected. This is different from the contextualism of Klein and Rescher, according to which an agent stops when the next belief in the chain is sufficiently obvious and itself not in need of justification."

Being in a relationship with someone is therefore the first condition for being in the world. An ethics which emerges from such an image of human contingency and dependency represents an alternative to the model that regards people as âself-interested strangersâ (Held 2006, p. 77) who simply enter into a contract with each other. It highlights responsibilities which exceed contractual models of reciprocity. Furthermore, the motherâchild relationship sheds light on the special characteristic of ethical relations: In the eyes of the mother, her child is special. Because of the fact of natalityâwhich plays a crucial role both in the ethics of care and for Levinasâthe concept of humankind starts with an emphasis on the particularity of every person and every situation. Just as the child is special to the mother, all people are of importance to someone. They are unique and irreplaceable in their meaning to someone else. Finally, both ethics underline the importance of the attitude of being responsive to the Other and the world. Being responsive is not something one can really choose to be. Levinas uses the image of âbeing held hostageâ to describe the phenomenon of dependency. In pregnancy, this dependency becomes obvious. Having a baby limits the freedom of the motherâshe is not supposed to drink or eat what she wants, her body changes enormously and feeling physically sick is often part of pregnancy. It is not unusual for women to wish for their âcustomary bodyâ back (Staehler 2016, p. 31), that is the ability to perform everyday activities again as usual. A motherâs love for her child is not affected by these constraints, however. According to Levinas, the same is true for the relationship with the Other: Being in a relationship with the Other represents a challenge for the self. This relationship is not freely chosen in its conditions, but is based on unconditional responsiveness and responsibility towards the Other. Being responsive and responding to the needs of someone else are thus central to both Levinas and the ethics of care. While Levinas primarily foregrounds the needs of the Other, an ethics of care also asks to what extent the self can fulfil the needs of the Other. According to the wellknown definition by the care-ethicist Joan Tronto (Tronto 1993, 2013), care is best understood as attitude and as practice. While this differentiation can be made methodologically, in daily life the phases of care often"

46,131,0.991,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"We borrow our definition of humiliation from Evelin Lindner, who writes that the core of humiliation is an enforced lowering of another person, which attacks the dignity and self-worth of that person (Lindner 2007). We view this in connection with respect and the functioning of being respected, which we have explored in the previous chapter. Children are respected when they are treated in a way that corresponds with their worth as humans. Other theorists, most prominently Martha Nussbaum, use the concept of human dignity to capture this (Nussbaum 2011). Humiliation is an umbrella term that catches the many forms of actions that violate the entitlement to be treated as a person of equal worth while describing the subjective experience of a person who feels she is not treated as an equal by others. It is also possible, we will argue, that children experience this feeling and emotion of being less worthy than others due to their poverty, even if there are no particular acts of humiliation against them. This understanding is much wider than that of Avishai Margalit, for example, who connects humiliation with respect in the sense of being a part of the community of humans (Margalit 1996). Margalit considers humiliation an act that gives other persons good reason to feel expelled from the community of humans, and he reserves the term âinsultâ for acts that attack the self-esteem of a person. We prefer a wider understanding of humiliation that also encompasses all such acts of insult. Children in poverty are lowered by others and given the feeling that they are of less worth, which does not necessarily imply a more drastic sense, such as no longer being viewed as human. The insights from qualitative studies discussed before point in this direction and can be captured with our understanding of humiliation. We have here actions of humiliation from peers and adults that hurt children, and we find the whole range of emotional responses and feelings of being humiliated that are known to have potentially severe consequences. Growing up and living in poverty is in itself humiliating even if children do not encounter humiliating acts by others: it can never be detached from the experience of having less than others without a good reason. This claim is supported in the literature and what children tell us about how they view themselves and their lives. Having less than others is obvious for a child in poverty; even when no one makes fun of her because of it, the child knows, sees and experiences that she has less, that she cannot have the same clothes and toys, make the same trips and live in the same good buildings as others. The persistent inequality in all poverty makes it humiliating. This line of argument adapts the thoughts of Christian NeuhÃ¤user and Julia MÃ¼ller, who have argued that"

Attacking the problem involves conjecturing and testing a number of hypotheses in an attempt to gain greater understanding of the problem and to move towards a solution. At some point within this process of oscillating between entry and attack the solver will get stuck, which Mason et al. (1982) refer to as âan honourable and positive state, from which much can be learnedâ (p. 55). The authors dedicate an entire chapter to this state in which they acknowledge that getting stuck occurs long before an awareness of being stuck develops. They proposes that the ï¬rst step to dealing with being stuck is the simple act of writing STUCK! The act of expressing my feelings helps to distance me from my state of being stuck.

Women did not feel that they had to pay for a painful procedure to remove hair from their private parts until the industry convinced them that a âbushâ was embarrassing (Herzig 2015). Consumers felt no need to purchase mouthwash until they were convinced that without it their dental hygiene routine was incomplete. Faced with the preceding observations, economists argue that economic theory âneedsâ the assumption that preferences reflect the true inner self in order to assess the contribution of the economy to general welfare. The economy is assumed to function well when it provides the goods preferred by people at prices such that supply equals demand. Individuals are thought to vote with their purchasing dollars so as to guide the economy toward that blessed state of equilibrium, which is considered the âholy grailâ of neoclassical economics (Berger 2009, p. xii). If preferences can be manipulated by social pressures or advertising, then an economy that satisfies those preferences would appear not to serve the people but, rather, the manipulators who affect the preferences. Such a revelation would require economists to study the relative power of persuasion and political power exercised by various elites. True, acknowledging the reality of manipulation and the initial formation of preferences by a variety of social forces, as well as their continuous reshaping does not prevent one from noting that there are limits to the extent to which people can be manipulated. One telling example is that of the USSR. It tightly controlled its educational system and shaped cultural productions such as movies, television, and books in line with its ideology, while limiting access to other cultures. It further provided strong incentives for conformity and strongly disincentivized dissent. Nonetheless, after 70 years, the regime was unable to suppress religion, family loyalties, and aspirations for liberty, leading to its collapse. There have been many thousands of attempts in the West alone, from the Israeli Kibbutzim to American âhippieâ communes to various religious orders, to form cultures and communities dedicated to an ascetic life. All of these, too, failed to maintain their culture of denial for most members. These failures demonstrate that the extent to which preferences can be shaped against basic underlying human needs is limited (Etzioni 1971). Indeed, if it were possible to manipulate people without limits, as suggested in 1984, it would be possible to make slaves sing in appreciation of their servitude. The historical record clearly demonstrates otherwise, but only over the longer run, and for basic human needs rather than for specific preferences. (And those must be studied to determine who and what shaped them rather than take them as given.) Once it has been established what these basic needs are, it becomes possible to assess the contributions of the economy to the general welfare without disregarding that preferences to a significant extent are inauthentic in the sense that they do not express the true, underlying needs of the person but rather mirror the manipulators. However, in the longer run, regarding basic human needs such as the quest for a measure of autonomy, for dignity, and for affective bondsâpeople do prevail (Etzioni 1968). Although there are many variations (Maccoby 1992), the basic sociological and psychological understanding of the process of and factors influencing preference formation goes as follows: Children are born with biological urges but their mode of satisfaction is very open ended. They have basic needs to meet but are not born with a specific need for Cokes and french fries, or snails and red wine, or hummus, olives and nargila. These preferences reflect the particular cultures and communities they are born into and raised. In particular, childrenâs initial preferences are formed"
51,273,0.991,How Generations Remember,"Minelaâs narrative is full of ambivalence towards Yugoslavia. As we have seen, she speaks highly of Yugoslaviaâs progressiveness and the multinational coexistence it enabled and nurtured. She emphasises that people were all the same and that most people did not care about the nationality of their compatriots. She claims that only the Bosniaks have kept this spirit while the others in the Mostar context (referring primarily to Croats) have tried to distinguish themselves from the others. Despite this positive view of Yugoslavia and her values, Minela simultaneously argues that multinationality is dangerous when it affects personal spheres like marriage because it leads to loss of identity. When she says, âI believe that this war had only one positive outcome: that we are no longer ashamed of ourselvesâ; she is referring to the strengthening of the Bosniak identity as a consequence of the war. We find both contrary discourses present in Minelaâs narrativeâabout the sameness of people and about a primordial national difference that one cannot and should not attempt to overcome. On the one hand, we could reason that the ambivalences found in her narrative are connected to the ambivalent position Bosniak political elites hold (see Chap. 3). To a certain extent this may be true but I argue that this ambivalence is characteristic for the Last Yugoslavs regardless of their nationality. This will become clear with Å½eljko, a Croat informant. As discussed earlier in the book, the present dominant Croat public discourse condemns Yugoslavia much more openly than the Bosniak one does. Å½eljkoâs positive memories of Yugoslavia thus disturb the negative picture of Yugoslavia that he ideologically supports."

According to ACT-R, one cannot directly teach production rules. Rather, one needs to teach the knowledge associated with the production rule in declarative form and invite the learner to practice applying the knowledge in the context of problems. In other words, all knowledge begins in declarative form, and can become procedural when students have applied it enough to authentic problems (Anderson, 1983; Anderson et al., 2004). When students first learn knowledge chunks and attempt to apply such, they do so using general procedures (Anderson, 1983). This process requires the studentsâ active interpretation. For example, new parents might apply the knowledge chunks (relation: love, agent: baby, object: pacifier), (relation: hate, agent: baby, object: dirty diaper), and (relation: hate, agent: baby, object: hunger) in succession when their baby cries. Desperate to console the baby, they attempt to interpret what the baby wants by applying the chunks using the general framework that when someone is unhappy, it is important to figure out the root of the unhappiness and that one can do so through the process of elimination. As they apply the new knowledge enough using general procedures, they begin to develop production rulesâstrategies that they can employ without the use of active interpretation. In other words, the student knows that in X situation, one can apply knowledge chunk Y using strategy Z, and can apply strategy Z in X situation without actively interpreting the situation (Anderson, 1983). People are not always consciously aware of production rules, but not being consciously aware of production rules does not prevent their application (Anderson et al., 1997). ACT-R posits that learning complex skills involves learning the right declarative knowledge chunks and generating the right production rules in the right order as well as practicing deploying the knowledge chunks by way of production rules in the context of solving problems (Anderson, 1996; Anderson et al., 1997). ACT-R also sees an additional knowledge set brought to bear when solving a problemâthe goal moduleâwhich governs what individuals aim to do when presented stimulus materials that could prompt multiple actions (Anderson et al., 2004). ACT-R also sees excessive failure as not conducive to learning and thus advocates maximizing successful practice and minimizing opportunities for excessive failure (Koedinger & Aleven, 2007). Ultimately, the goal of ACT-R is that students practice applying content knowledge to problems and, in the process, generate and optimize production rules that govern the application of such declarative knowledge to problems (Aleven, Stahl, Schworm, Fischer, & Wallace, 2003)."

The difference between the learning gains of children in one teacherâs classroom and the average learning gains across all three first grade teachers in that school would be an estimate of her relative effectiveness. The estimation of teacher value added has been popular among economists since the pioneering work by Hanushek (1971) and Murnane (1975). In part, this work, and much that followed, was a response to a consensus among researchers that, although there were large differences in the effectiveness of teachers, the observed characteristics of teachers, including their experience, contractual status, and credentials, explained very little of these differences. By focusing directly on child learning outcomes, measures of value added sidestep the focus on teacher characteristics. This is both the strength and the limitation of this measure. If the assumptions that are necessary for estimates of value added to have a causal interpretation hold, then value added focuses directly on what really matters: child development or learning outcomes. But the assumptions may not always hold, and estimates of a teacherâs value added are silent about what it is that one teacher does that makes her more effective than another. The most important assumption in estimating value added is related to the unobserved characteristics of children. Children are not generally assigned to classrooms at random. Headmasters know which teachers are more effective than others. A headmaster who seeks to equalize outcomes within a school might assign the most difficult children to the best teachers. If the information that the headmaster uses to make these assignments is not adequately âcontrolled for,â the true value added of the best teacher would be underestimated (because she received the most difficult students). Conversely, better teachers may have more bargaining power, and a headmaster who would like to retain the best teachers in a school might give those teachers easier children. In this case, the true value added of the best teacher might be overestimated (because she received easier students). Parentsâparticularly parents who are most aware of and interested in their childrenâs learningâmay also exert pressure to have their children in one or another classroom. But these parents are likely to have unobserved characteristics that themselves have an impact on learning gains, regardless of the teacher their children are assigned to. This too would introduce biases. Because all the relevant characteristics of teachers and students cannot be measured, estimates of value added make one critical"

As such, monitoring refers to looking for and utilizing feedback to reassess oneâs goal orientation, metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive experience, and metacognitive choice in order to âmanageâ a changing environment (Haynie and Shepherd 2009: 700). Learning to Think Metacognitively Over the past decade, researchers have explored various instructional approaches that harness metacognition to improve reasoning (Kramarski et al. 2001). Mevarech and Kramarski (1997) created an instructional method to help students enhance their mathematical reasoning by developing their metacognitive skills through four types of questions based on (1) comprehension, (2) connection, (3) strategy, and (4) reflection (Mevarech and Kramarski 2003: 469). We refer to these questions as âmetacognitive questionsâ as they are used to stimulate learnersâ metacognition. First, comprehension questions are intended to encourage one to think about whether he or she really understands the nature of a particular problem before starting to address it. This understanding forms from carefully considering the situation such that one identifies a problem, its nature, and its implications. The following are examples of questions encouraging students to think about comprehension: What is the core of the problem? What is the key question asked? What meanings do the key concepts convey? Second, connection questions are intended to encourage students to think about a particular problem in terms of its similarities and differences with problems he or she has faced and solved before. These questions urge students to draw on existing knowledge and experiences without generalizing from them too much. Questions like the following prompt learners to think about these connections: How can I relate this problem to problems I addressed previously? In what ways does this problem differ from those I worked on in the past, and how does it differ? Third, strategic questions are intended to encourage students to think about which strategies are most suitable for solving a problem and why. These questions urge learners to contemplate the what, why, and how underlying their approach to a problem. The following are examples of strategic questions: What is the strategy/tactic/principle best suited for me to address this problem? Why is this strategy/tactic/principle so particularly appropriate? How can I put together information I need for solving the problem? How can I realize the plan?"

Manisha managed the case study project, edited a number of the cases, and wrote the one on the SEE Foundation herself. Her insights, her superb writing skills, the amazing way she befriends everyone and pulls them into our joint work will always be appreciated. Heesu jumped into the deep end with his chapter and pulled it off with great insight and aplomb. Mehvesh Mumtaz Ahmed stepped up as a great help with research when we most needed it. Sandy Collaco helped to make sure all appointments were made and kept in an always upbeat and positive manner. I want to thank our board of trustees (Ronnie Chan, Daniel Tsai, Jamshyd Godrej, and Lizzie Zobel) and advisory board (Ratan Tata, Nazir Razak, Shin Dong Bin, and Vichit Suraphongchai), who agreed to take on this role due to a sincere desire to further our mission of improving the quality and quantity of private social investment in Asia. They also believed in me, for which I am incredibly grateful. I especially want to thank our Chairman Ronnie Chan. I have worked with Ronnie for 20 years, and it has been a very rewarding partnership. Together we built the Asia Business Council and now CAPS (Centre for Asian Philanthropy and Society).

123,120,0.991,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"In the critical aftermath of a bad outcome, victims can be particularly susceptible to blaming themselves, no matter how irrational that may seem. When the professional meets them very early with an acknowledgement of responsibility, that causal attribution is much less likely to happen. One important dimension of the current example is that Westad could immediately grasp the facts of the situation, including his teamâs role in bringing about the terrible outcome. In other situations, doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers may be under pressure to acknowledge that they have made a fatal mistake, but may need more time to evaluate the circumstances and their own contribution to the outcome. The pressure to admit a mistake may also be present in situations where a reasonable interpretation of the facts does not warrant such an act. Angry and frustrated patients or relatives may understandably push for it, even in cases where the healthcare workers have actually done excellent work, to no avail. Those kinds of cases, and how they differ from the ones where the connection between a failure and a bad outcome can be established quickly will be discussed further in the next section. Doctor Westad stayed in close contact with the parents after the death of their baby, and when the couple expected another baby, they decided to keep the same team of professionals that had helped them the first time. That trust appears to have been built on the foundation of the immediacy of the acknowledgement. Trust can be explained in terms of three factors that need to be in place in relation between the trustor and the trustee (Mayer et al., 1995; Schoorman et al., 1996). The trustor must perceive that the trustee has the necessary ability, benevolence, and integrity to be trustworthy. This understanding of the phenomenon overlaps with Duttonâs, who also highlights benevolence"
186,99,0.991,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"To contain the end of an action in oneself is Kantâs way of saying that one is giving consent. If one agrees to an action, one carries the actionâs end in oneself. But liars do not reveal their true motives, they do not reveal their ends. Hence, it is not possible to consent to the ârealâ action, as one is being deceived, used for anotherâs purposes. And hence, dignity is an intrinsic and inviolable property of all rational beings, which gives the possessor the right never to be treated simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end. That dignity is an intrinsic or inviolable property can be derived partly from Kantâs claim that one cannot deny dignity even to a vicious man. At the same time, dignity is founded on the human ability to be self-legislative, and is therefore bound to rationality and restricted to rational beings. Kantâs Formula of Humanity can then be used to provide content to the meaning or at least the implications of dignity. Can one be satisï¬ed with these deï¬nitions? No, for two reasons. First, what does it mean to treat a person never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end? Explanations of abstract concepts should be clear and not require philosophical training to be understood, assuming one can understand them at all. In this context, W.D. Ross has noted that the Formula of Humanity only has"

Furthermore, they make it possible to assess thoughts, emotions, behaviors and relations through different temporal perspectives: a woman could then assess her couple relationship as it was in the past, as it is in the present and how she expects (or hopes) it to be in the future (Favez 2010). Questionnaires mainly make it possible to assess the subjective point of view of the person; as far as social support is concerned, they make it possible thus to assess the perceived support, which is of utmost importance as several studies have pointed out the more important role of perceived social support compared to the received social support by people facing cancer (Uchino 2004). Furthermore, in the domain of marital relationships, Hahlweg et al. (2000) noted that partners provide additional pieces of information about their relationshipsâ history and their manner of interacting with each other when they fill in the questionnaires. They have the opportunity to report data which are to a certain extent representative of the âobjectiveâ reality of the relationship. Accordingly, Kenny and Acitelli (2001) assumed that motive (willingness to have a good perception of the partner), opportunity (spouses have a lot of occasions to observe their partner) and information (possibility to share with the partner intimate feelings) should lead to accurate data about the partner and the relationship."

Teachers are quite alone when deciding on what would be the neutral information to âdisseminateââeven if they really want to âdisseminateâ rather than âpropagateâ. A teacherâs ideal could be that there was some âconcrete stanceââor helpful guidance to the teacherâwhich would be an academically sound one and not a political prescription. This, as elucidated by wilschut (2010) whom we quoted in the beginning of this chapter, is, however, difficult to achieve. So in case of inherently biased and politicised issues there is perhaps indeed no better solution than leaving them to the âlonelyâ teacher to decide (groping alone in the darkness, as one teacher put it), rather than risking that biased prescriptions would be produced as a result of some public negotiations (for example, see the volume by Nakou and Barca 2010)."
234,101,0.991,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"THE PERCEIVED NEED FOR CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN LMICS There can be no doubt that there is a need for continuing professional development (CPD) or Continuing Medical Education (CME) in the Ugandan health system. This is not the same thing as saying that Uganda lacks the capacity to train its own health workers. The main need for CMEs and the one that is immediately observed by volunteers when they arrive is that the majority of staff they directly encounter on the wards dealing directly with patients and typically unsupervised are at junior level. Some hospitals depend almost entirely indeed on (unsupervised) student nurses and intern doctors to deliver services. As we have noted in Chapter 2, this does not mean that there are no or even few very highly skilled and competent clinicians in Uganda but it is rare to ï¬nd them on public wards or supervising/mentoring those staff who are. During a short (two week) visit, a senior British obstetrician working on one of the busy obstetric theatres in Mulago Hospital expressed dismay at his initial experience referring to the âsheer butcheryâ he had witnessed. It was only later that he was made aware that all of the doctors in theatre were much junior interns with little experience or supervision. Add to this the overwhelming congestion and sense of chaos made worse by the absence of effective patient management systems (and triage) and it is not surprising that volunteers identify an immediate need for training. And perhaps this impression â of abject need â and absolute lack of resource â is functional in terms of attracting AID. On that basis, local managers may hesitate to challenge this naÃ¯ve prognosis. This situation has led to an emphasis in health partnership interventions on CPD or CME, a term used more commonly in Uganda and perhaps reï¬ecting once again the dominance of the medical paradigm. Another factor reinforcing this emphasis on short-course interventions concerns the emphasis within internal (project) evaluation processes on easily obtainable metrics. The following caption frequently displayed by THET to promote the HP scheme indicates the emphasis on training and the challenges of trying to capture more holistic impacts on human resource management systems. The data presented here capture the easiest metrics: numbers of people trained. And measuring this is far easier if staff are taken off the wards and put into rooms where they can be counted. Unfortunately, this tells us nothing about the effectiveness of interventions and their impact on health systems (Fig. 3.1)."
28,236,0.991,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"patients â supposedly for reasons of brevity â as âcuttersâ.40 In this study the behaviour of âcuttersâ is significantly differentiated from socially embedded hysterical, cry-for-help communications as well as earnest suicidal attempts. There is a sense in which this behaviour is new and unsettling (repeatedly labelled âbizarreâ) and that it repeatedly (if subtly) confounds existing categories. This clinical object is not self-evident, but is the result of human analysis and intervention. McEvedyâs separation of this action from the social setting is based upon a differentiation between âspontaneousâ and âsusceptibleâ cutters â between those who perform the action on their own initiative, and those who try it in response to another patientâs actions. There is a subtle relationship between these groups, but there is little doubt that the copying is â ultimately â secondary to the unity of the syndrome of cutting. McEvedy notes, with regret, that he would like to re-categorise the patients in order to separate out those who perform the act without any imitation of others. However, isolating these nonimitators requires too much of a reworking of the material. He has no doubt that some of his Bethlem group are only classed as repeated self-lacerators (those with five or more cutting incidents) because they happen to be present during the self-cutting epidemic.41 This makes it clear that the key to the syndrome is in the internal impulse, not the social imitation. McEvedy argues that the most notable aspect of behaviour is the apparently unprovoked mood swings â bringing emotional states to the fore. These are distanced from the social environment in the case of Kay R., who is said to have cut herself over and over, regardless of environment or levels of stress. McEvedy finally distances cutting from a socially motivated phenomenon because the impulse (presumed to underlie all the behaviours â from cutting forearms to swallowing dominoes) seems so unorthodox that it cannot be explained by mere social pressure or stress. He reasons that there must be something preventing the (supposedly suicidal) impulse from being conventionally expressed.42 That it might also be connected with hysterical, susceptible imitators does not change the fact that the behaviour begins in a pathological, emotional, internal impulse rather than a disordered social setting. McEvedy is not entirely sure what might replace the powerful aetiological force of the social environment or imitation, but he speculates thatthe so-called âspontaneousâ cutterâs personality has not only a high level of hysterical traits, but also something that he labels âhostile tensionâ.43 This is the first mention of âtensionâ as a key motive force for âcuttersâ in Britain â something that is well established in the"
3,36,0.991,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"Also crucial to the definition of scaffolding and to the idea of transfer of responsibility was intersubjectivity, according to which students needed to recognize an appropriate solution to problems similar to the one being addressed before they would be able to perform the supported task independently (Mahardale & Lee, 2013; Mortimer & Wertsch, 2003; Wood et al., 1976). Without intersubjectivity, students are said to be unable to engage in independent performance of the target skill (See Fig. 2.2). Intersubjectivity can be achieved without knowledge of how to perform the skill that scaffolding is intended to develop (Wertsch & Kazak, 2005). It is important to note that it is not required that the understanding be exactly the same, as partners in an activity likely hold differing perspectives, which can shape an understanding of a task (Rogoff & Toma, 1997). Furthermore, if the child and adult had an entirely identical understanding of what an appropriate solution would be to a problem similar to that being addressed, then the child may not need scaffolding (Wertsch, 1984). Rather, the understanding of the task should be substantially similar between the scaffolding provider and the student. This was said to be crucial because students needed to be able to recognize when what they were doing was successful when they attempted the target tasks independently in the future (Mortimer & Wertsch, 2003; Wood et al., 1976). In short, scaffolding could help students with how to ac-"

There are two necessities and challenges in particular of this approach we want to discuss here: first, conducting cross-media research as a necessity and challenge and, second, defining the boundaries of a communicative figuration as a necessity and challenge. In the final section of this chapter, we will consider a specific example to illustrate how a figurational approach can be employed. Again, we are taking into account the necessity of such an approach and possible challenges that (can) come with it. For all of these themes, our line of argument will address both the requirements as well as the challenges."

In this chapter we seek to illuminate the characteristics of these two processes, show their interactions with each another, and point out their common effect on behavior.

Thereafter, we present an integrative model of thinking and action in an endeavor to identify when which system of thought will be active and under what circumstances it will influence behavior."
46,166,0.991,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"but only insofar as they have roles within the institution. The managers of the company may have many other responsibilities in their other roles: being members of a particular society, living in a certain community, having children, profiting from structural injustices or injustices they cause directly through their jobs and the like. The same can be said of politicians who are in charge of designing their societyâs institutions and also those of the world in general through an international agency in which they act and which they support or help design. If one understands agents of justice in this sense, the categories of power and collective ability seem to collapse into each other and become one. An institution is often powerful because it can coordinate the actions of many people through their being members of that institution. Partially following this ecological approach, we distinguish eight agents according to their relation to the child. The agents are listed such that they grow ever more distant from the child in poverty in terms of direct interaction. This says nothing about other parameters, like influence on the child via indirect interaction or structural injustices or in terms of causing the childâs poverty and connected harm and deprivations. We use âagentâ in a loose sense and in some cases prefer to name environments and institutions, not particular individuals. In accord with what we said before, however, we always address the relevant individuals within these environments and institutions, since in the end they must start acting against child poverty. (1) The child herself. The child herself is an active agent interacting with her environments and also influencing and shaping them to some extent. Children in poverty are not mere passive objects. From an early stage on, they position themselves within their living conditions and must try to cope with them in some way, whether successfully or not. Participatory research has revealed many different ways that children try to do so (Ridge 2009). Poverty makes living harder for children; if it is very severe, it can kill them. It would, however, be wrong to deny them any agency when it comes to evaluating their condition or determining how it should be changed. We have argued that any justifiable theory of childhood nowadays incorporates a strong agency aspect that actively involves children in their own development. At the same time, one has to be clear that the exact moral status of their perspective has to be weighed by their age and maturity. (2) The family and close caregivers. The family is obviously crucial to alleviating child poverty and securing justice for children. Child"
46,187,0.991,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"In this chapter we have explored the issue of responsibilities towards children in poverty, focusing on the relevant agents of justice who can be held responsible for doing something about it. Our model is still vague, but this vagueness reflects both the complexity of the issue and the limits of philosophical inquiry. Based on the criteria presented, to attribute concrete responsibilities to the groups of agents we named would require a much deeper empirical knowledge. To some extent it would not be possible to disentangle relations and interferences. We argued that families in poverty are limited in their power and that parenting behavior is shaped and influenced by how these parents grew up and lived in poverty. It is not possible to disaggregate exactly how much of their harmful behavior can be attributed to circumstances for which they are not responsible themselves and how much responsibility they have to shoulder. Being poor comes with a restriction of freedom, one that is, however, not total. It would be unjust to neglect poor parents completely as agents of justice; this would either degrade them to children, which they are not, or to persons with severe mental disabilities who are not able to make choice for themselves. Likewise, it"
223,241,0.991,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"The Missing Link Between Knowledge and Action The experience of being and acting human is a universal theme of cultural expression. From movies to great literary works, great weight is placed on both of these aspects, being and acting. Literary figures that resonate in our minds do so both because of their heroic (or antiheroic) actions and their inner lifeâtheir motivations, feelings, and thoughts on their own existence and actions. Sometimes this inner life reflects a clever, reflective type of thinking, as with the Danaans in Homerâs Iliad and their plan to defeat the Trojans by infiltrating the city in a wooden horse. But equally fascinating are the stories of protagonists who show an impetuous, impulsive side, such as Icarus, the Greek youth who flew too close to the sun and thereby melted his artificial wings despite his fatherâs specific warning. Lastly, there are those figures who are faced with an inner conflict between reflection and impulseâOdysseus, for all his cleverness, cannot resist the temptation to hear the deadly song of the Sirens, yet his forethought in having himself tied to the mast of his ship defeats the impulse to drown himself trying to reach them. These three Greek legends appear to show different ways of thinking that lead to different results. Coming up with complex plans such as the Trojan Horse requires reflection and active use of knowledge, whereas such deliberation would seem antithetical to Icarusâ flight. However, these two different modes of thought do seem to come together in a fashion, as is in Odysseusâ use of forward planning to defeat the consequences of his impulsive decision. In everyday life, as well, people often approach situations in these two waysâspending a while considering what to eat for lunch and making a deliberate selection but also automatically grabbing a sweet dessert without thinking about it at all. When considering how these mental"

Professionalism is often a claim made by members of the âoperational coreâ of the company as a defense, a protest against what is perceived as an excessive top-down or bureaucratic control. Paradoxically, as we have shown, top management and human resource executives often also support and promote an ofï¬cial discourse that calls for more âprofessionalismâ. Obviously, derivatives of the word âprofessionalââprofessional, professionalism, professionalizationâattract various actors with various, if not conflicting, worldviews and purposes.

However, an overall picture of the way they are used, by whom, with which underlying meanings, in which purposes, could help us understand the âsystem of professionalizationâ within organizations. The technological developments (or rather, the beliefs and expectations related to them) and managerial philosophies (âthe future of managementâ) should be incorporated into this analysis, along with speculation about the âfuture of workâ.

308,217,0.991,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Karen Armstrong in her book âA History of Godâ [3] says: In practical terms Islam means that Muslims had a duty to create a just equitable society where the poor and vulnerable are treated decently. The early moral message of the Qurâan is simple: It is wrong to stockpile wealth and build a private fortune, and good to share the wealth of society fairly by giving a regular proportion of oneâs wealth to the poorâ (Holy Qurâan 92/18, 9/103, 63/9, 102/1). Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: âI swear by God, that a person who inflicts harm to his neighbor is not a [full-fledged] believer of Godâ [4]. In another hadith, he said, âA woman entered hellï¬re, because she incarcerated a cat until it died of hunger and thirst [5]â. These two hadiths admonish against maleï¬cence , i.e., doing harm to humans or animals. The following hadith recommended beneï¬cence to a dog: âA prostitute of Bani Israel (Children of Israel) was thirsty, so she came to a well and got water for her to drink. As she ï¬nished, she found a dog very thirsty licking the ground from thirst, so she went back to the well and got him water in her shoes until she quenched his (its) thirst. God was pleased with her and let her into paradise [6]â. AlGhazali said: âIf you cannot reach the level of angels, then do not fall into the level of beasts, scorpions and snakes. If your soul is content to come down from the highest heights, at least do not let it be content into the lowest depths (to the rank of beasts, snakes and scorpions). Perhaps you will be saved by the middle way where you have neither more nor less than what sufï¬cesâ [7], i.e., not doing harm and doing some good. David Humeâs moral psychology and virtue ethics makes motives of benevolence all-important in moral life, and maintains that benevolence is an original feature of human nature. He, like AlGhazali, recognizes egotism and selï¬shness can mask the inherent good in human psyche, and he uses the metaphors of the dove (angel with AlGhazali) wolf (beast) and serpent (snakes and scorpions) to illustrate the mixture of elements in our nature. Hume regards persons as motivated by a variety of passions, both generous and ungenerous, i.e., good and bad [8]. He maintains that these elements vary by degree from person to person. Each person should strive hard to uplift himself from the level of beasts and snakes to the level of doves (peaceful and doing no harm), if he cannot reach the level of angels doing good (as AlGhazali maintains). The Holy Qurâan says: âWe have indeed created man in the best stature, then we abase him to the lowest of the lowâ (Holy Qurâan 95:4â5). Man can be almost like an angel, but he also can be like snakes and scorpions."

And I am not saying that if you cut everyone they donât bleed red blood. A person who commits a robbery or an assault, they donât want to go to jail either. But the white-collar criminal has more to lose by going to jail; reputation in community, business as well as social community, decent living conditions, just the whole business of being put in a prison with a number on his back demeans this tremendous ego that is always involved in people who are high achievers.

Metacognitive Experience Metacognitive experience refers to experiences that are affective, are based on cognitive activity, and serve as a channel through which prior experiences, memories, intuitions, and emotions may be used as resources in the process of making sense of a specific task, problem, or situation (Flavell 1979). For instance, an individual has a metacognitive experience if he or she feels that a specific task is challenging to undertake or understand. In the next step, he or she draws on that prior experience to yield the creation of a new decision framework for a new but similar task. Like past experiences, emotions and intuitions related to prior situations can shape the generation of decision frameworks for novel tasks. As an example, emotions like fear, anger, joy, or grief or that are connected to an event in the past may serve to influenceâat a metacognitive levelâthe development of future decision frameworks aimed at novel events, tasks, or situations similar to those from which the experienced emotions stemmed. Intuitions serve a similar function in the metacognitive creation of decision frameworks: if the individual tends to draw on intuitions resulting from prior experiences, those intuitions will likely influence the development of future decision frameworks aimed at new tasks, events, or situations. A manager, for instance, may draw a decision based on a âhunch,â which reflects his or her reliance on intuition (Miller and Ireland 2005). In simple terms, metacognitive experiences enable people to make sense of their social world more easily (Earley and Ang 2003) and thus, together with metacognitive knowledge, help individuals choose a decision framework. Therefore, my (Dean) colleague and I (Haynie and Shepherd 2009: 697) referred to metacognitive knowledge as the degree to which the individual depends on idiosyncratic experiences, emotions, and intuitions when generating multiple decision frameworks aimed at interpreting, planning, and implementing goals to âmanageâ a changing environment."

Whether an infinite regress of justification makes sense may very well depend on the meaning of justification. We have seen that under a particular interpretation of âx causes yâ or âx is smaller than yâ regresses may be harmless, whereas under an alternative interpretation they do not make sense. Something similar might well apply to the case of epistemic regresses, so it is incumbent upon us to consider what may be meant by âA j justifies Ai â. In doing so, we are not trying to give a definition of justification. Nor are we making any claim about its relation to knowledge. Traditionally, justification has been seen as a necessary ingredient of knowledge, as that which has to be added to true belief. Recently, different views have been put forward, such as that justification is a derivative of the primitive concept of knowledge, or is possible knowledge, or potential knowledge, or appearance of knowledge, or that it implies truth, or that justification and knowledge simply coincide.7 We will make no such claims. Everything we say about justification is meant as a contribution to the debate about the possibility of epistemic regresses, not to the debate about how to define knowledge or justification. Of course, the two issues are connected, but it would be a mistake to treat them as being on a par.8 Our aim, as said, is to find out to what extent infinite epistemic chains are possible. It will turn out that for this purpose it is enough to adopt a very modest and uncontroversial claim about justification; there is no need to define justification or to say how exactly it relates to knowledge."
46,71,0.991,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"(5) We also want to combine the sufficiency rule with a priority view in regard to children in general and, in particular, in relation to child poverty. In a joint article with Rosalind Dixon, Martha Nussbaum discusses two reasons for such a priority view in respect to all children (Dixon and Nussbaum 2012): cost-efficacy and vulnerability. By vulnerability they refer to the dependency of children on adults, and by cost-efficacy they mean that investing in children saves huge costs the state would have to invest in adults; for example, a vaccination that costs only a few cents can prevent the development of a disease that demands hundreds of thousands of dollars to be treated. The vulnerability of children, which we already discussed in length, implies that the state has the responsibility to step in if parents or other caregivers cannot provide for children because they cannot do it for themselves. Cost efficacy, Nussbaum argues, is also relevant in regard to fertile functionings and corrosive disadvantages. The capability approach demands that each and every human is entitled to develop and realize certain important functionings (in the case of young children) and capabilities (in the case of adolescents and adults) and to invest in a fertile functioning that helps to do what can save huge costs later on. The same is true for corrosive disadvantages, which undermine the development and achievement of these important functionings and capabilities. Nussbaum and Dixon cite nutrition, childrenâs health and education as examples of such an investment in fertile functionings (or to avoid corrosive disadvantages), which should be prioritized by the state. That provides a good reason to tackle child poverty with a high priority. We want to move from the idea of a priority view toward children in general to the idea of prioritizing certain functionings and capabilities on the same grounds, or, to put it differently, of prioritizing the alleviation of particular injustices. Such a prioritizing has three elements: it asks how important a certain functioning or capability is; how severe and widespread its deprivation is; and how it can be overcome and what means are needed to secure justice in relation to that dimension. As we will show over the course of the next chapters, child poverty fulfills these three criteria (it affects functionings and"

There is a risk involved and the stock market situation is complex with several factors to consider (such as technological changes in the relevant industry). How to advise her? If there are relevant data that we can use and if the scenario is complex, we may be able to use some more complex model from statistical modelling. For example, we may use a Time Series model or Markov Chain. After fitting those models, we can then estimate the needed probabilities pi for the risk description (Equation 1.1). We discuss the key probability concepts in Chapter 3 and 4. This book is only focusing on Time Series and Markov Chains for three reasons. First, they are very commonly used methods for risk analysis. Second, we intended this book to be an intermediate-level book and we consider Time Series and Markov Chains suitable, while we assume no prior knowledge of them and we only show the intermediate-level modelling details. Third, it would not be possible to put all models in one book. So these two modelling approaches serve as examples of how to use statistical models for risk estimation, interpretation, and communication. Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence methods can also be used to estimate the risks. In fact, many researchers call the Time Series and Markov Chains examples of machine learning methods. There is extensive research on the development and application of statistical and machine learning methods for risk estimation. In our chapters, we will point at several key examples."

(P10: 856â869) Another reason for the lack of this âinterviewerâs desirabilityâ could be the fact that media use was initially mentioned only as one among other research interests. Hence, interviewees might have perceived it as more legitimate and might have felt more comfortable about not being able to extensively talk about media. At the same time, enquiring about media use with regard to every life sphere ensured that respondents who did not attribute high relevance to media did not drop the subject entirely, as was sometimes the case with strategy 3, when such questions were posed only at the end of the interview. Consequently, this fourth interviewing strategy allowed interviewees to express their individual relevance structures. Illustrative evidence for this claim is the interview account of a couple in which one partner is to a much higher degree involved with media and media use than the other. They readily stated their different weighting of media for their daily routines in the different interview sections. This can be shown in relation to the life sphere of work.

117,398,0.991,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Phenomenology and Lived Space Lifeworld Phenomenology refers to a philosophical attitude towards the world. âPhenomenology is the study of human experience and of the way things present themselves to us in and through such experienceâ (Sokolowski 2000). In contrast to Western scientific thinking, phenomenology aims to bring together polarities such as mind-body, subject-object, individualsocial and feelings-thoughts. The hyphens signify intertwining rather than separation (Finlay 2011). This is why Merleau-Ponty describes phenomenology as a science of ambiguity. There is always ambiguity and, in a sense, indeterminacy, âprecisely because we are not capable of disembodied reflection upon our activities, but are involved in an intentional arc that absorbs both our body and our mindâ (Merleau-Ponty 1962). Heidegger describes the impossibility of being disconnected from the world by his concept of being-in-the-world. The lifeworldâLebensweltâ is the central phenomenological focus and portrays this lived wholeness and inseparability. It denotes a meaningful whole that is both shared and experienced by individuals from their own unique perspective (Heidegger 1998). The issue of the lifeworld should be understood against the background of the advent of modern science; before then, people simply thought that the world we live in was the only world there was (Sokolowski 2000). The project of phenomenology as started with Edmund Husserl (1859â1938) was to show that the exact, mathematical sciences are founded on the lifeworld and that they are transformations of the experience people directly have of things in the world. Husserl attempted to call to mind that the lifeworld (â¦) is always already there, existing in advance for us, the âgroundâ of all praxis whether theoretical or extra theoretical. The world is"

We are like the driver of a modern automobile, cruising along on the Interstate (in a linear world), and now suddenly, we are faced with âblack iceâ! The impacts we have described above lead to unprecedented ethical issues as reflected in the three questions above. Moreover, questions such as: âWhat constitutes an acceptable risk and why?â take on new meaning in the face of challenges to the ecology of life. There is a growing belief, as noted by Donald Rumsfeldâs quote above, that not only is the future unknown, it is unknowable. Moreover, because these complex ethical issues are arising so much faster than ever before, and because there has been little time to develop normative processes for decisionmaking, there is even greater ambiguity. The unknown-unknown looms large in the domain of Risk as feelings. What we are pointing to, for lack of a better description, is a Cultural Risk Analysis. This would entail making explicit the implicit cultural conditioning of individuals, and organizations/institutions, and their relationship to the society in which they abide. Such a Cultural Risk Analysis would illuminate cases where the underlying societal culture runs counter to the demands of safety culture, such as for nuclear power. If aspects of the societal culture are left implicit, they just donât underlie the safety culture, they will undermine it. If made explicit, it becomes possible for the safety culture to be designed and constructed in a way that accounts for, accommodates or even overcomes the conflicts between the two cultures. Such a Cultural Risk Analysis would then require an analysis of cultural conditioning, much the same way we analyze the machine. This would mean understanding how underlying assumptions, values, and beliefs come from culturally defined sources and not âobjective factsâ.20 However, there is one major difference; people are âcomplexâ emotional, mental, physical and spiritual human beings. Humans are not âcomplicatedâ machines and so are not amenable to a linear reductionist approach. Human beings have emergent properties, namely feelings and thoughts that do not reside in any one part of the body. Humans may respond differently to the same stimulus on any given day. And there are no âclosed formâ analytical solutions to describe human behavior; it is, for the most part subjective. Coincidentally with the development of these new complex technologies, there has been growing empirical evidence that in the realm of human decision-making, the emotional precedes the cognitive [29], and that motivation and intention derive from the unconsciousâ emotive and subconscious-mental [30]. These findings have found their way into such fields as Behavioral Economics [31] and Risk Perception [32], among others (An extensive literature review can be found in [33]). And a number of consulting companies have developed analytical methods in an attempt to quantify the âRisk Cultureâ of Business Organizations. In this case, the focus is on comparing the âselfinterestâ of the individual employees versus the corporate interest. 20 By âobjective factsâ, I mean empirical observation and data.

The considerable volume of content that flows through ABATC make it a virtual popular science magazine, covering a breadth of issues and formats (including blog carnivals and other outreach mechanisms that aim to strengthen connections with other blogs). Zivkovic both relays information from other sources, commenting on it and explaining it to readers, and provides longer commentaries, for example on issues of science policy. He assumes that his readers are interested in science, but does not generally presume in-depth knowledge of scientific topics. This approach is in line with Zivkovicâs own background: while he is a trained scientist and writes from a first-hand perspective, his agenda is not that of someone paid for full-time research. While RRResearch presents both the results of research (rarely) and frames scientific issues for a scientific audience, ABATC translates scientific topics for a more general, non-specialist audience. The issues are much broader there than they are in RRResearch, where they align much more strongly with the bloggerâs own research interests. The latter blog is a window into the mind and daily work of the researcher, not a friendly conversation with a lay audience. This is not to say that RRResearch doesnât engageâits success illustrates how well it achieves this goalâbut whom it targets as its readership and what function it wants to realize remains at least partially unclear. Redfield uses her blog to frame issues for herself and her peers, while Zivkovic blogs for a readership with their needs squarely in mind. Much of the research that he relays is not his own, while much of what is discussed in RRResearch is Redfieldâs own work, or closely related to it. Whereas Redfield regards her blog as an instrument for communicating what she is currently working on or issues she is more generally interested in, Zivkovic provides a service and measures its success, at least in part, by its popularity and the amount of feedback he receives, a form of impact that may well be less relevant to a blogger like Redfield, who might be primarily concerned with her blogâs reception among her students and peers (Fig. 4)."
245,42,0.991,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"have been predictable because they have been planned, and the overall design of the plan has not changed throughout this period, or at least not until recently. They have been special in part because the plan was a continental one, supposed to involve countries that are very different in so many ways (history and traditions, political and economic systems). What is also special, beyond the scope and the motivations of the plan and planning, are the ideas, objectives and means of these planned developments, which were original and innovative in many cases. Moreover, beyond the mere design and intentions, there have been many genuine and original achievements of these projects, or âplanned developmentsâ, which also contributed to making this period a special one in the history of higher education. Many of the most important motivations and intentions, elements of the implementation machinery, and achievements are inventoried and reviewed in the present volume. Invoking Bologna and Lisbon, though, is not enough to understand why what has happened during this time was special and predictable, and even less why this period might be coming to an end. One needs to look beyond the two processes, or projects, to understand what made them possible, sustained and influenced decisively their morphology. Bologna and Lisbon are remarkable historical occurrences that warrant such a deeper inquiry, going beyond just studying of their existence, characteristics and impact. One could advance that two very powerful policy narratives (to call them so for lack of better concepts) and their interaction made possible and sustained these two processes. The recent corrosion of the two policy narratives (more immediately evident for one of them) is in turn responsible for the increased likelihood that developments in higher education in Europe will not continue the way that have progressed in the last 15 years or so. It was these two policy narratives that made these developments special and predictable. Their apparent fading away, in turn, makes future developments unpredictable. It is probably a purely speculative question for now whether other powerful narratives or a revised version of these two would emerge any time soon and eventually start playing a similar, or in other way important, role in influencing âthe European levelâ, or developments in higher education in Europe more generally. In short, the two narratives are the knowledge society narrative and the European integration, or European construction narrative. The knowledge society is one of the dominant policy narratives of our times globally, perhaps the most powerful contemporary policy narrative. It has to do with the belief, often a conviction, that knowledge is already and will remain not only the main factor of production, influencing economic efï¬ciency and competitiveness of a company, country or region, but also the main factor that underpins social progress generally (including âsocial cohesionâ, to use one of the favourite concepts of the Lisbon Strategy). Knowledge is therefore understood as being key to a better future, which, moreover, is a future that could be imagined, in fact planned in advance, and then shaped consciously (even âtechnologically malleableâ) in the form of a âknowledge societyâ. Both the Bologna Process and the Lisbon Strategy/Europe 2020 contain explicit language about the possibility and need to build a knowledge society in Europe/European Union. In fact, they are both what could be called knowledge"

299,426,0.991,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"difficult task. What can be done? One answer is for individuals to instruct the car they own or use to follow their value preferences. To a limited extent, this can be achieved through setting options. For instance, Tesla enables owners to set the distance their car maintains from the car in front of it (Gibbs 2015). However, data show that people tend not to engage in such decision-making if they must make more than a few choices. Numerous studies of human behavior, ranging from retirement contributions (see Beshears et al. 2009; Benartzi and Thaler 2013) to organ donations (Johnson and Goldstein 2003, pp. 1338â9) to consumer technology (Shah and Sandvig 2008) reveal that the majority of people will simply choose the default setting, even if the options available to them are straightforward and binary (e.g. opt-in versus opt-out). This is not to suggest that customization should be excluded but to acknowledge that it cannot take care of most of the personal choices that must be made. To proceed, we suggest that enhanced moral guidance to smart machines should draw on a new AI program that will âreadâ the ownerâs moral preferences and then instruct these machines to heed them. We call it an ethics bot. An ethics bot is an AI program that analyzes many thousands of items of information (not only information publicly available on the internet but also information gleaned from a personâs own computers) about the acts of a particular individual in order to determine that personâs moral preferences. Essentially, what ethics bots do for moral choices is rather similar to what many AI programs do for ferreting out consumer preferences and targeting advertising to them accordingly, except that in this case, the AI program is used to guide instruments that are owned and operated by the person, in line with their values, rather than by those of some marketing company or political campaign seeking to advance their own goals. For instance, an ethics bot may conclude that a person places high value on environmental protection if it finds that said person purchases recycled paper, drives a Prius, contributes to the Sierra Club, prefers local food, and never buys Styrofoam cups. It would then instruct that personâs driverless car to refuel using only environmentally friendly gas, to turn on the air conditioning only if the temperature is high, and to turn off the engine at stops. Note that this program does not seek to teach the car an ethical system that will allow it (and other smart machines) to deliberate and then form their own moral conclusions. Rather, it extracts specific ethical preferences from an owner and subsequently applies these preferences to the operations of the ownerâs machine. To illustrate: Nest constructed a very simple ethics bot, which has already been used by more than a million people. Nest built a smart thermostat which first âobservesâ the behavior of the people in their households for a week, noting their preferences on how cool or warm they want their home to be. The smart thermostat then uses a motion-detecting sensor to determine whether anyone is at home. When the house is empty, the smart thermostat enters into a high energy saving mode; when people are at home, the thermostat adjusts the temperature to fit their preferences. This thermostat clearly meets the two requirements of an ethics bot, albeit a very simple one: it assesses peopleâs preferences and imposes them on the controls of the heating and cooling system. One may ask what this has to do with social and moral values. This thermostat enables people with differing values to have the temperature settings they preferâto be either more environmentally conscious or less so (Lohr 2015)."

They are indispensable in generating knowledge about the dynamic changes in human values, identities and citizenship that transform our societies. They are engaged in research, design and transfer of practical solutions for a better and sustainable functioning of democracy. Their integration into Horizon 2020 offers a unique opportunity to broaden our understanding of innovation, realigning science with ongoing changes in the ways in which society operates. Furthermore, the Vilnius declaration supports assessment of impact as one of the basic quality criteria of good science, although it is not made perfectly clear whether such assessment is to be one of the criteria for the allocation of research resources, or if it is a post festum measure to find out if research results are disseminated and implemented.44 So, looking at policy developments in the EU and comparing them to the US, we might find some cause for optimism, even a model for other regions to follow. But, as we saw above, these same developments have their critics. As the authors of this report, where do we stand? The more positive view â in favour of greater engagement between humanists and policy makers â fits well with some of our findings in Chapter 2, where over half of our interviewees identified âsocial valueâ as the most important extrinsic justification for the humanities, defined as a broad concept ranging from moral values to informing social decisionmaking and contributing to or contesting social cohesion. Another very frequently stressed value was âcultural heritageâ, implying the preservation and critical evaluation of material as well as immaterial leftovers of the past. We also saw in Chapter 3 that much humanities research genuinely engages with the social in terms of the themes selected for study. But there are at least two problems with which we should close. First, in this chapter we have also seen that some policy makers take a much narrower view of the contribution (if any) that the humanities have to make, particularly in promoting economic growth and innovation. The problem is that, as we saw in cChapter 2, our interviewees rarely identified such values and showed very little appetite for seeing them as a goal for humanities research. So, whenever the more narrow-minded policy makers have the upper hand, there will be a serious rift with the humanists. Second, even when policy makers take the broader view and stress"

(6) Information. Children with no access to a radio or television (i.e., broadcast media). This indicator applies only to children above age three. Alkire herself is well aware that this selection reflects just a few dimensions of child poverty and that other important information is missing, but these pragmatic choices can be justified in empirical research âhaving some knowledge of a few functionings is always better than having none. For a concept of global justice, this is certainly not enough. Unfortunately, philosophers have seldom engaged with this task in such a way that they came up with functionings or capabilities that can really be measured. Nussbaum and others do write about the problem but do not provide us with many answers; it is unclear what the exact thresholds for capabilities on Nussbaumâs list are, for being healthy, for example, or being able to use oneâs senses. Not long ago, Ingrid Robeyns called the capability approach radically underspecified (Robeyns 2006), a critique that is still valid. For children, developing beings that change significantly over a rather short period of time, these problems are even more compelling, and issues of poverty dynamics and evolving functionings and capabilities are more relevant. We do not aim to come up with a definite list of functionings and respective thresholds for these functionings in terms of specified measurable functionings either. What is important, though, is to tackle the problem of differences between contexts. The functionings described above and used by Alkire in the context of Bangladesh show that over 90 percent of children live in a"

Indeed, if there is one facet of Israel education that has proven itself, it is that the power of an effective Israel experience is unmatched and irreplaceable.4 It is only logical that Israel education without an experience in Israel at some point is only a partial activity. The power of the actual experience in Israel is related, among other things, to Israel being a totally immersive culture. Embracing real-life experiences and the multiple expressions of Jewishness that exist both in Israel and in Jewish life today is paramount. Modern Israel encompasses the panorama of narratives from the biblical Promised Land to postmodern contemporary society that we discussed in Chap. 2. In Israel, Abraham, Moses, Hosea, Judah the Maccabee, Maimonides, Herzl, Ahad Haâam, Golda Meir, and David Ben-Gurion are not only street names, but also figures who still âliveâ there and their âvoicesâ are heard daily. Indeed, the Israeli experience provides a direct linkage to a rich heritage and a living culture. The power of this meeting is enhanced by being deeply experiential, sensual, and people-centered. There are many ways to see Israelâwith a FodorâsÂ© Guidebook, a camera, the Bible, a prayer book, or the latest edition of The New York Times.5 The person-centered approach obviously implies maximizing the direct encounter and minimizing mediated framings. It aims to facilitate a dialogue between person and place in which both speak to each other. Young travelers come to the Western Wall to speak to it, and the Wall wants to talk to them. The art of enabling encounter is a delicate one; sometimes in order to facilitate a direct interaction, it is necessary to engage in a certain degree of framing (or what is denoted as âpre-conditions of educationâ) so that the encounter can actually happen. There are situations in which a totally unmediated dynamic can sometimes actually prevent, rather than enable, genuine experience. The art of framing is the ability to enable the dialogue to take place, and not to impose a specific landscape on the actual moment. The actual implementation of Israel trips is a fine art, which has proven to be one of the unique achievements of American Jewish education. Indeed, one might well suggest that this aspect has been one of the most professional and sophisticated of contemporary forms of Jewish education."
116,104,0.991,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"different approaches, and discuss the extent to which they are overlapping conceptions dealing with the same phenomenon. The general question uniting them is: âThrough which cognitive processes can an individual who is generally rule-abiding and compliant with moral standards minimize cognitive dissonance, threats to self-concept, and experiences of moral self-sanction when he or she transgresses those standards?â (Ribeaud and Eisner, 2010, p. 300). The process in question is different from rationalization, in that it takes place prior to the action. Ex ante moral neutralization is the mental process that lowers the threshold, allowing the person to act against his or her original moral convictions, while ex post rationalization is the personâs attempt afterwards to justify the decision to act that way. What happens after moral neutralization regarding one kind of behaviour has occurred in an organization for the first time? A financial advisor has convinced himself that it is acceptable to recommend structured financial products to his clients. From the outset, he had moral qualms about recommending them to his customers. The first instance may well be the starting point for what Donaldson (2012) has called normalization of questionable behaviour. In an analysis of the ethical roots of the financial crisis in 2008, he describes how âbad practices can become institutionalized, and initial queasiness gives way to industry-wide acceptanceâ (Donaldson, 2012, p. 6). A standard process in an organization, then, can have three stages: 1 Moral dissonance 2 Moral neutralization 3 Normalization of questionable behavior. One significant challenge facing organizations and their managers and employees can be to counter and avoid the development of patterns like this. They will primarily have to identify and arrest attempts at moral neutralization. People can be encouraged to challenge what they see as efforts to get out of moral dissonance by using moral neutralization techniques. Do business leaders actually experience moral dissonance and respond to it by applying techniques of moral neutralization? Over a three-year period (2005â2007), I had the opportunity to explore this topic by observing the moral reasoning of business leaders who participated in leadership training in a Norwegian financial institution. The program consisted of two three-day sessions, and it ran 20 times, with an average DOI: 10.1057/9781137532619.0013"
282,84,0.991,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"what it right and what is wrong by doing a thought experiment. Would rational individuals agree to the norm underlying or the reasons given for an activity? If they would, the activity is morally acceptable, but if they would not, the activity is morally wrong. Kant expresses this principle in the first formulation of the categorical imperative: âhandle nur nach derjenigen Maxime, durch die du zugleich wollen kannst, daÃ sie ein allgemeines Gesetz werdeâ (Kant, 1996/1786, p. 68).84 John Rawls, the most famous contemporary Kantian philosopher, tries to make this thought experiment more impartial. He demands that individuals ignore their actual situation while considering the same question. To achieve this, individuals must make the morality test from an âoriginal positionâ or behind a âveil of ignoranceâ disguising their real current position: [T]he principles of justice for the basic structure of society are the object of the original agreement. They are the principles that free and rational persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality [â¦]. Among the essential features of this situation is that no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does any one know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like. [â¦] The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance. (Rawls, 1971, pp. 11â12) For Thomas Scanlon, a wrong action similarly is one that âI could not justify to others on grounds I could expect them to acceptâ (Scanlon, 1998, p. 4). Also seeking to include a criterion of impartiality, this leads him to describe judgements about right and wrong as âjudgments about what would be permitted by principles that could not reasonably by rejected, by people who were moved to find principles for the general regulation of the behavior of othersâ (Scanlon, 1998, p. 4). The contract argument in this form involves hypothetical consent. Kantian contractarians are typically concerned with establishing the legitimacy of specific norms and actions. The contract they are using therefore tends to involve the direct hypothetical consent of individuals to moral or legal norms and principles. Only rarely do moral contract thinkers consider the legitimacy of institutions. But where they do, they tend to follow the logic of their moral argument and rejoin the political social contract tradition based on Lockeâs writings. Kant, for example, treats the question of what good political institutions ought to look like only fleetingly.85 According to him, humans need to live in societies ruled by law to realise their innate capabilities. Government is necessary because humans are not purely governed by reason but sometimes also follow their animal-like instincts, violating the freedom of others. Government enforcing obedience to just laws is thus necessary to protect"

118,700,0.991,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"21.3 Searching for Fit The topic of this GoNERI meeting on January 6â8, 2008, was âNuclear Technology and SocietyâNeeds for Next Generation.â A historian who has spent time among engineers has expectations about how these meetings unfold. There are ceremonies and speeches expressing aspirations to serve society with advances in technology.3 There are lots of technical talks from professors and other highstatus people, supported by powerpoint slides. In this case the meetingâs technical agenda was overlaid with an emphasis on international collaboration and a gettingto-know-you-better function between engineers from Berkeley and Tokyo. Because of the formalities of sponsorship by the Japanese authorities, there was a significant effort at documentation; the proceedings of the workshop were prepared and ran to nearly 400 pages [13]. In meetings such as these, historians often get slotted to provide a historical perspective, or to generally speak about nuclear power and society. The nuclear community has long-established ways of thinking about society, which can be pretty well captured in a schema like Fig. 21.2. This was in fact the first slide from my GoNERI talk. It was a move of abstraction, using the license afforded by distance to speak in a direct voice. The second slide (Fig. 21.3) got a bit more theoretical. I was hoping to bring something foundational into view. Even when engineers are savvy operators, they often work from folk theories of society: familiar framings of societal processes and social order that live within a structure of their professionally reinforced ways of understanding their experience [14, 15]. Without pointing this out this openly, was there any hope of making the case for something else? In my first try at speaking in this setting, what came next was too abstract"
78,382,0.991,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"New information and communication technologies, to be short, create radically new relations between human beings and the world around them. Not only the structure of these relations deserves further inquiry, but also its implications for social relations and human existence. What do all of these new information and communication technologies do to us, from the new and unanticipated relations we develop with them? I will limit myself again to the relations of âimmersionâ and âaugmentationâ that I described above. In the relation of immersion, the material environment changes from a relatively stable background of our existence into an interactive context that interferes in novel ways with the ways we live our lives. Smart environments with âambient intelligenceâ are changing the character of the spaces in which our lives take shape. When public spaces are equipped with smart cameras that can detect suspicious behavior, new norms will be installed. When the doors in geriatric hospitals will have RFID chip readers, they can automatically determine who should be allowed to go out and who does not. When toilets will have sensors that can detect specific substances in our urine and feces, new norms regarding health and illness, and new regimes for healthcare will emerge. Moreover, these âintelligentâ technologies can also interact with our decisionmaking processes. Under the name of âpersuasive technologiesâ, products and systems are being developed to persuade people to behave in specific ways. School toilets can detect if children have washed their hands when they leave, and urge them to do so when they forget. Smart mirrors in the waiting room of medical doctors can recognize oneâs face, and morph it into an image of what you will look like in 10 years if you donât give up smoking, or eating too much, or working too hard. Smart windows in shops can determine the direction of oneâs gaze and give extra lighting to articles that seem to interest specific people. In the configuration of augmentation, technologies like Google Glass have the potential to radically change the character of social interactions. The mere look at somebody else can be enough for a face recognition system to look this person up on the Internet. This would result in a drastic reconfiguration of the boundaries between the public and the private. All oneâs private activities that are on the Internet will be much more easily accessible. And all resulting information will be available in social interaction in a asymmetrical way, because people cannot see if the person they meet is simultaneously checking them on the Internet. Also, the permanent availability of email, messaging services and Internet information will give us an increasing âdouble presenceâ in the world. Our physical, bodily presence in concrete spaces and situations will increasingly be accompanied"

And if it comes to a stop and there are principles, they say that these are unknowable since there is no demonstration of them, which alone they say is understanding; but if one cannot know the primitives, neither can what depends on them be understood simpliciter or properly, but only on the suspicion that they are the case. The other party agrees about understanding; for it, they say, occurs only through demonstration. But they argue that nothing prevents there being demonstration of everything; for it is possible for the demonstration to come about in a circle and reciprocally. But we say that neither is all understanding demonstrative, but in the case of the immediates it is non-demonstrable â and that this is necessary is evident; for if it is necessary to understand the things which are prior and on which the demonstration depends, and it comes to a stop at some time, it is necessary for these immediates to be demonstrable. So as to that we argue thus; and we also say that there is not only understanding, but also some principle by which we become familiar with the definitions.4"
386,29,0.991,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"Hierarchies are a direct contradiction to equality: as soon as one person issues orders to another or is considered superior in any other way, these two persons can no longer be considered equal. Anarchists are the group who take this challenge most seriously and, in the extreme, even parenting can be considered as immoral, as it involves clearly hierarchical structures (Tremblay 2008). On the other hand, hierarchies are often self-imposed, such as in our relationships with âcelebritiesâ, a keen focus of attention for many people. If you buy tabloid newspapers, watch TV shows or queue for tickets to see a particular group of people, this hierarchical structure between them and you cannot be so much of an evil. Media experts (Gorin and Dubied 2011) consider the rise and fall of celebrities to whom we âsubmitâ ourselves in the public discourse as a way of negotiating social values. In agriculture, hierarchies start in the farming family, but extend well into the relationships with associated businesses and the public administration. These three level fields for unfolding hierarchies will be covered in this chapter."
208,133,0.991,Actors and the Art of Performance,"punishment too.â36 Vindictiveness is powerful and tenacious. It rips the potential out of life, and can poison it permanently. But if we look more closely at actors and feelings and start with the common reproach that actors are guided by their emotions, do we not have to admit that the actorâs typical weak spot is, in truth, affect? Arenât actors always a little bit too loud, a little bit too excited, a little bit too weak of will, too worried about the impression they make? Arenât they all too ready to ride the waves of their emotions? Arenât their feelings always jumping here and there, unfaithful and dangerously easy to seduce? Arenât there enough contemporary examples of this in political history? Arenât actors per se refugees of reason? The actor has spirit, but little conscience of the spirit. Always he has faith in that with which he inspires the most faith â faith in himself. Tomorrow he has a new faith and the day after tomorrow a newer one. He has quick senses [ ... ] and capricious moods.37 Or do we need to turn what we have said about the actorâs disposition on its head and concede that the actorâs occupation forces him to ride the waves of emotion? What else could he do? You cannot swim or act on dry land. Acting is overflowing, chaotic, passionate, peripheral and proliferative. Is there more? Not even Brecht could have worked with actor cut-outs. Only a philistine can therefore demand the following of an actor: First, the collegium logicum. There will your mind be drilled and braced, As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced, And thus to graver paces brought, 'Twill plod along the path of thought.38 Isnât Mephistophelesâ mockery reminiscent of the way actors ridicule theory?

137,176,0.991,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"On the basis of the typology of father involvement developed by QuÃ©niart (2002a, cited in Pacaut et al. 2011) which we presented above, we can already point out that no father involved in our research belongs to the category of providers and protectors. This does not mean that this model no longer exists in Quebec, but it is clearly less present in the younger generation of which this sample of fathers were a part. Fathers who took paternity leave with their partner are similar to the âambivalentâ category of fathers because as we have seen in the results they have essentially a supporting role to the mother. However, many fathers who have opted for a combination of paternity and parental leave, and thus took more time than normative in the Quebec context, including some time alone with the child, show a progressive move from âambivalent fathersâ to âpostmodern fathers,â being more and more actively involved in parenting. Comparing with Wallâs typology (2012) that provides four profiles of paternal engagement for fathers on leave alone (constrained fathers, radical rupture, innovative and independent fathers as well as the innovative and subversive fathers), in our research no father who took leave of one month or more, alone with the child, fits the profile of the constrained father. As for the model of radical departure, when fathers arrive at the stage where they take part of the leave alone, they no longer see themselves as supporting the mother. They see their role of father as representing significant change. In fact many fathers in our study appear to be innovators and independent fathers, as the quotes above show. Indeed, taking the 5 week paternity leave with the mother, they made sure they learned a lot about housework and child care to stay alone afterwards. Some fathers had already taken one or two leaves for their other children and therefore already had all the knowledge needed to care for the baby. They often go as far as changing the routine established by the mother, and assume both domestic tasks and care. The profile of âinnovative and subversive fathersâ is very evident in our research. If fathers took parental leave alone with the child, it is often in order to allow their partner to accelerate in her career or to continue her university studies. Seeking gender equality and equal roles in private and professional sphere is important for these fathers. To complete the picture, we would add the profile of âinnovators and activistsâ to the profiles of innovative and independent or subversive fathers. Indeed, our research shows that just as mothers, fathers were able to handle all domestic tasks and caring for the child. Moreover, some fathers are somewhat annoyed about their near-invisibility in the public sphere but also resent the insufficient positive media coverage on the fatherâs place in the home. Although this has increased over the years in Quebec, there are still strong stereotypes and these fathers would like to see them reduced and to have less gendered attitudes in public places. Thus, to the two more"
147,36,0.991,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"dedicate all their time and energy to their business (Carter, Gartner, & Reynolds, 1996, p. 151). However, further research is needed to uncover why and when entrepreneurs undertake these activities when developing their ventures (Davidsson & Gordon, 2012) as well as how these activities are inter-related and mutually dependent on each other. To begin this research, it may be useful to view entrepreneurial action as a dynamic, highly iterative process of engaging in activities and experiences that both inform and are informed by a potential opportunity. When thinking of entrepreneuring as a series of activities in the entrepreneurial process, activity is the key unit of analysis. Along this line of thinking, scholars could begin to uncover the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action by exploring key activities and their outcomes. The overall picture of the entrepreneurial process without this more detailed understanding of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action is more linear, granular, and disconnected from everyday life, shedding little light onto the practice of entrepreneurship. However, when the emphasis is placed on activities, the picture of the entrepreneurial process becomes more dynamic, fine grained, and immersed in everyday occurrences. As we described in our call for an interaction-based perspective to entrepreneurship research, when a potential opportunity is refined, it produces (and reflects) changes in the entrepreneurâs mind and in the community of inquiry. These changes are caused by a series of inter-related activities. For instance, if an entrepreneur is left with some level of doubt (i.e., a feeling of not knowing [Locke, Golden-Biddle, & Feldman, 2008]) about the veracity of a potential opportunity after interacting with the community of inquiry, the entrepreneur would be motivated to inquire further. In this context, inquiry is the âactivity of resolving genuine doubt in order to arrive at stable beliefsâ (Locke et al., 2008, p. 908). In other words, doubt inspires the entrepreneur to undertake activities that inform (through changes in his or her mind) the refinement of the entrepreneurial idea. Thus, doubt can be seen as ânothing less than an opportunity to re-enter the presentâ (Shanley, 2005, p. viii) to help create a more fertile idea (Paavola, 2004).

223,412,0.991,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"State of the Art: Rational Choice Models of Mobility The mobility of hunter-gatherers is not a new field, so this chapter begins with a brief review of some of the existing anthropological models so as to prepare the ground for my theoretical argument. Probably the best known anthropological model in this respect is optimal foraging theory (Martin, 1983). It is particularly interesting because its application has not been limited to living hunters and gatherers but broadened to cover human behavior more generally. For instance, this theory has served to model human behavior in western-style museum exhibitions (Rounds, 2004). The assumption is that visitors to an exhibition optimize their visit by matching elements of high-interest value with low search costs and that there are some doâs and donâts that result in rules for deciding how long and in what order one should view the items at an exhibition. These rules (search rules, attention rules, quitting rules) are aimed not at the best possible solution but at one that is satisfactory given the environment as it is (p. 404). The original version of optimal foraging theory consists of theorems intended to explain when and how foragers move from one resource to another (see Kelly, 1995,"
152,213,0.991,interdisciplinary Perspectives On Mortality and Its Timings : When Is Death?,"againâ is roughly the standard for what has been called âhigher brain death,â the death of the brain where memory, reasoning, and consciousness reside. So higher brain death might mean ânever to be conscious againâ or ânever to have what is taken to be the essence of a human beingâ, or ânever to recover what had given someone their identityâ. In these cases, there is no question that the person is dead by any historically defensible category, but rather that she is in such a state that she is already socially and culturally dead and that therefore the living are justified in stopping measures which keep her biologically alive, that is, enteral nutrition and perhaps some assistance in breathing. Of course, we often stop these treatments, assuming for a moment that we consider providing food and air treatments, along with othersâantibiotics, vaso suppressors, specific therapiesâwhen death in its old-fashioned sense is taken to be imminent and all interventions hopeless. âPulling the plugâ, that is, removing the most critical interventionâthe ventilatorâis the main way of allowing death to enter. But this is another matter. The machinery of the intensive care unit has made biological death comport more closely with various conceptions of death as understood culturally even if âreally deadâ means what it has always meant. If the decision is taken that someone is ânever to have the essence of being human againâ, then the removal of technological life support can translate that decision into biological reality. But technology has done little to alter the rhythms of becoming dead in a broader cultural sense except, perhaps, to expand the lives of the dead among the living.

By his faith he speaks from the grave. We are about to read âthe work of a dead man,â announces the nineteenth-century Brazilian narrator in the prologue of The Posthumous Memoirs of BrÃ¡s Cubas by his compatriot, the novelist Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. Just to clarify, he wants to make readers aware of the âradical difference between [his] book and the Pentateuch:â Moses waited until the end to speak of the circumstances of his death; our author gives it away at the start. And lest we still miss the point: âI am not exactly a writer who is dead but a dead man who is a writer, for whom the grave was a second cradleâ. âI expiredâ he continues, âat two oâclock on Friday afternoon in the month of August, 1869, at my beautiful suburban place in"
187,283,0.991,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"Abstract In this chapter it is shown that if an appreciable risk is present in the use of Modelling and Simulation (M&S), Veriï¬cation and Validation (V&V) should be employed to manage and mitigate that risk. The use of M&S in the domain of critical infrastructure (CI) will always be accompanied by such a risk. It is important that a structured approach to V&V is used in order to be more effective and more efï¬cient than just testing without a clear plan. The Generic Methodology for V&V (GM-VV) is a recommended practise in the international M&S community and adopted by large organisations such as NATO. The GM-VV has a number of concepts that allow for a structured approach to V&V. A structured approach to V&V such as the GM-VV leads to a set of handles that allow the best choices for V&V techniques to employ. The choice for a speciï¬c technique is dependent on a number of factors such as the needed certainty, the expected residual uncertainty of the proposed technique and its requirements in terms of costs, real-world knowledge, etc. This chapter is divided in 4 parts. The ï¬rst part has the take away message âYou have to do Veriï¬cation and Validation because there is risk involvedâ, the second âYou have to do it in a structured way if you want to do it more effective and more efï¬cientâ and the third âYou have to choose the appropriate Veriï¬cation and Validation technique to balance risk, effectiveness and efï¬ciency.â In the last part some conclusions are drawn."
299,52,0.991,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Social science suffers from a surfeit of technical terms; I hence am reluctant to add one more. However, the current use of language is deceptive. By referring to both kinds of motivations and senses as âsatisfaction,â the difference between the two disappears, and the wording, in effect, affirms the hedonistic reductionist assumption that all acts that seem moral are actually self-serving and motivated by the pursuit of pleasure. Even if one wishes to argue that there is no profound difference between the two kinds of actsâdenoting the two kinds of motivations and acts under comparison is necessary before collapsing them. Referring to acts that are motivated by a sense that one should live up to oneâs moral commitments as âaffirmationâ rather than as âsatisfactionâ enables this discussion. (A similar attempt is made when people discuss pure or authentic altruism [see May 2011] in contrast to inauthentic âaltruisticâ behavior motivated by self-interest [see Feigin et al. 2014]). The term âobligationâ should be avoided in this context, because obligations are externally-imposed commitments, while those that drive moral behavior are internally-derived; they are what the person holds he ought to do. Finally, one might be inclined to refer to this behavior as virtuous (see Schwartz 2010); however, to reiterate, the fact that someone is driven by what he considers his moral commitment does not mean that these acts are moral. A jihadist who labors to kill as many infidels one afternoon as he can may feel that he is engaging in moral behavior. The term âvirtuousâ should be reserved for those acts that serve incontestable values, those whose moral standing is self-evident (see Etzioni 1998, 2006). For this chapter, I do not draw a distinction between the quest for affirmation as a source of motivation (âpushâ), and the sense of accomplishment (âpullâ)."

282,41,0.991,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"by contrast, has a strong preference for the agent to pursue Pâs interests. Therefore, the principal has an interest in making the threat of sanctions credible enough to induce A to choose âpursue Pâs interestsâ. From the perspective of the agent, the situation is slightly more complex. His first instinct is probably to try to weaken accountability so that he can pursue his own interests without incurring any sanctions. Two considerations, however, can change this calculus. Firstly, the principal is probably only willing to engage in this game at all or to play it again if she sees a reasonable chance that the agent will pursue Pâs interests. As long as the agent derives a greater benefit from playing than from not playing, he has an interest in making a credible commitment not to abuse his authority, that is, in strengthening accountability.74 Secondly, the agent also has a strong motivation to avoid a situation where he does his best to act in the principalâs interests, but gets sanctioned nevertheless. He can reduce this risk by demanding that the principal clearly articulates her expectations and preferences and by ensuring that the principal receives adequate information about the agentâs behaviour. In this sense, too, the agent can be interested in strengthening the accountability relationship. 2.2.3 The accountability dilemma The term âaccountabilityâ carries overwhelmingly positive connotations. Many therefore assume that it is simply a case of âthe more, the betterâ.75 This is particularly the case in the international sphere, where researchers and activists now increasingly come to see mechanisms to strengthen the accountability of different organisations as a means to balance the democratic deficit of global institutions.76 While accountability does play an important role in making the operations and policies of influential actors more responsive to the needs and interests of those affected, it is not always a case of âthe more, the betterâ. In Mark Bovenâs words, âPublic accountability may be a good thing, but we can certainly have too much of itâ (Bovens, 2005, p. 194). Accountability relationships can have negative impacts in three main respects. Firstly, principals can hold agents accountable according to multiple, sometimes even contradictory standards. Where this is the case, accountability demands can have a paralysing effect on organisations. In addition, even well-intentioned agents will find it impossible to fulfil all expectations at once and face undeserved sanctions. Jonathan Koppell has described organisations trying to satisfy various conflicting accountability demands as suffering from a âmultiple accountabilities disorderâ (MAD). In his experience, such situations are likely to undermine the overall accountability of an organisation: âRather than satisfying all conceptions of accountability, the MAD-afflicted organization often satisfies noneâ (Koppell, 2005, p. 99). Secondly, accountability mechanisms generate costs. Creating transparency and monitoring activities, for example, requires substantial efforts on"
185,114,0.991,The Essence of Software Engineering,"With objects and components a completely new family of methods evolved. The old methods and their practices were considered to be out of fashion and thrown out. What came in was in many cases similar practices with some significant differences but with new terminology, so it was almost impossible to track back to their ancestors. A new fashion was born. In the early 1990s, as we already have said, about 30 different object-oriented methods were published. They had a lot in common but it was almost impossible to find the commonalities since each method author created his/her own terminology and iconography. In the second half of 1990s the Object Management Group (OMG - see omg.org) felt that it was time to at least standardize on how to represent drawings about software â notations used to develop software. This led to a task force being created to drive the development of this new standard. The work resulted in the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This basically killed all other methods than the Unified Process (marketed under the name Rational Unified Process (RUP)); the Unified Process dominated the software development world around year 2000. Again a sad step, because many of the other methods had very interesting and valuable practices that could have been made available in addition to some of the Unified Process practices. However, the Unified Process became in fashion and everything else was considered out of fashion and more or less thrown out. Yes, this is how foolish we were. The Agile Methods Era The agile movement â often referred to just as âagileâ - is now the most popular trend in software development and embraced by the whole world. The Agile movement changed the emphasis away from the technical practices, placing the team, the work and the people front and center. As strange as it may sound, the methods employed in the previous eras did not pay much attention to the human factors. Everyone understood of course that software was developed by people, but very few books were written about how to get people motivated and empowered in developing great software. The most successful method books were quite silent on the topic. It was basically assumed that one way or the other this was the task of management. With agile many new people practices came into play, for instance self-organizing teams, pair programming, daily standups. Given the impact agile has had on the empowerment of the programmers, it is easy to understand that agile has become very popular and the latest trend. Moreover, given the positive impact agile has had on our development of software there is no doubt it has deserved to become the latest trend. And, while some agile practices will be replaced by other, better, practices, agile as a philosophy and attitude is not a fad that will pass away. It will stay with us for the foreseeable future. To summarize Though the different eras have contributed knowledge and experience, and a lot of it is specific for each era, they all resulted in a continuation of the method war controlled by a few gurus."

Then, by strengthening their ability to foresee the future and their ability to communicate, it is necessary to strengthen the impact on other countries. Learning is not just necessary for those in leadership positions. Through advances with AI, computers, sensors, robots, and 3D printers, part of the work currently done by human beings will be taken over by these inventions. That does not mean that peopleâs work will be taken but rather, new kinds of jobs and new work will also be created. At such a time, conventional knowledge and skills will not be enough to deal with this new situation. New knowledge and skills are necessary for tackling new work. Until now, it was possible to learn on the job and accumulate experience through work after one had finished school and become a working adult. But from now on, in order to keep step with the social changes happening, knowledge and technology must constantly be updated. A diverse educational system that supports peopleâs learning is needed. In the future, labor productivity will increase through the application of new systems and people will have plenty of time and opportunities to receive education after they have become working adults. Many people will receive education appropriate for the new times and partake in work that is advanced and of a high level, thus contributing to the further development of society."
253,68,0.991,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","The very act of driving conjures a range of strong and very human emotions. Whether it is the feeling of freedom that the mobility of the car provides, the frustration of being stuck in trafï¬c, the panic when realizing a potential collision looms or the joy of an open road with a favorite song on the radio, driving is a human experience. With automated vehicles, however, that experience changesâboth for passengers in the automated car and other road users who must walk or drive alongside it as part of the social experience of trafï¬c. The car ceases to be simply an extension of its human driver and becomes an agent in its own right, navigating through the highways and rules of human society. Given the sometimes uneasy relationship between humans and machines, what will these new interactions between humans and machines look like? Fabian Kroeger sets the stage for this discussion by showing what our cultural heritage reflects about our views of automation. In his chapter, Das automatisierte Fahren im gesellschaftsgeschichtlichen und kulturwissenschaftlichen Kontext, he details the long history of automated vehicle concepts and their treatment in media, beginning with Utopian visions of the beneï¬ts of such technology. His chapter traces the path from this early optimism towards the more cautionary themes found in recent ï¬lm depictions of our automated future. This frames a central question running through the remaining chapters âhow can the challenges of human-machine interaction be overcome to realize the promise of this technology? A key aspect of that interaction is how automated cars will conform to the ethical standards of the human world in which they operate. Patrick Lin opens this topic with an overall discussion of Why Ethics Matters for Autonomous Cars. Even with the best technology imaginable, sometimes crashes will be unavoidable for automated vehicles that share the road with human drivers and programmers must decide what to do when presented with such dilemma situations. As Lin shows, such decisions raise issues of equity, discrimination and unintended consequences that must be thoughtfully considered. Christian Gerdes and Sarah Thornton take the programming aspect of this discussion a step further with Implementable Ethics for Automated Vehicles. Mapping philosophical concepts to engineering concepts, they demonstrate how different approaches to ethical reasoning can be turned into algorithms that make decisions for automated vehicles. The"

Suddenly, there is a recurrence of the tumour in the mice, which puts Cliffâs data into question. Recurrence could be an interesting finding in itself, revealing something about the complexity of the interplay between virus, immune system and cancerous cells, and initially Cliff is fascinated by the phenomenon. But in view of the pressures, it implies the failure of his R-7 project. To make matters even worse, replication tests conducted in other labs are not getting the expected results. They fail to confirm Cliffâs claims. Marion concludes that they published too opportunistically, too soon, and decides to retract the Nature paper. According to Bouter (2015) there are only losers in this novel, but this does not seem completely true. In the aftermath of the crisis, Sandy accepts a new position, as head of a new private cancer facility in Wellesley, a position that is bound to make him an even richer man. But Cliff also seems to recover from the trauma. During the denouement or catharsis stage (the final chapters of the novel), when the discourse of the analyst takes the floor, Cliff realises that he will be able to work again with a clear name. He has lost 2 years of work, but is more experienced now, because of all the turmoil, and resolved to make a better start. He still loves science, the slow, exhausting work, the rush of discovery, and will never give that up. He continues to be susceptible to the quest for knowledge, coming from a promising new object of"
346,223,0.991,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","However, to better appreciate the different emotional reactions of students exposed either to controversial and difficult history teaching or to parrhesia, much more research is needed. These differences between studentsâ reactions could be highly consequential for theoretical reasonsâshifting our attention from defensive consequences of self-categorization processes to the intriguing issue of the self-regulatory role of group-based emotions. Certainly, reactions studied in this kind of studies are mostly referred to students in their young adulthood. Theoretical reasons could account to that, since in democracies young adults are expected to take their own place in the public forum to gradually substitute old generations. It is up to young adults, in fact, to decide to eventually continue or to change the political orientations of public actions, and this difficult choice could not be taken if a clear knowledge of facts happened during their âhistorical pre-existenceâ (Ortega y Gasset 1930) is lacking. But also reactions of participants belonging to other age groups could be extremely important to know and therefore more research is needed in this specific direction. Moreover, and more importantly, discussing on these differences could also advance our understanding of psychological processes in the educational field. In particular, I would like to propose that studies on concrete cases when all other sources of information are silent and only history teachers break down a long-lasting social denial of past crimes of the group could be highly influential, since for younger generations of perpetratorsâ groups moral reparation is a basic social and psychological need as well as for their ancestors (Nadler and Shnabel 2008; Shnabel and Nadler 2015; Bilewicz and Jaworska 2013; Leone 2012). for educational purposes, understanding psychological reactions which regulate group-based emotions of young students, when their teachers make a clear knowledge of moral faults of in-group history finally available for them, can be a key element helping to explain how intergroup relations may not only stay hostile for a long time, but may also change and flourish again when generations change."
360,129,0.991,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"7.2 Subjectivist Two-Tiered Theories Subjectivist theories that attempt to also account for the âobjective realityâ aspect of language all have the feature that they replace the Objectivist slogan of language representing reality with the slogan that (some aspect of) peopleâs mental lifeâfor instance, their mental conceptsârepresents reality. It would seem to take some fancy footwork to justify the replacement of an unexplained notion of representation with another unexplained notion also to be called a representation. One way that some Subjectivists have responded to the challenge that they need to have two distinct tiers was to take the viewpoint that they can use the distinction between peopleâs judgments of membership in a category and their judgments of the typicality of membership in that category. The membership judgment could perhaps fill the role of the objective-tier membership in that category. But from the Objectivist point of view using the judgements of membership as a substitute for âreally being a member of the categoryâ is the sort of idea that will give rise to Lewisâs âconfusionâ. At the best it can be evidence for membership in the category, but is is clearly âcontaminatedâ (the Objectivist claims) by all sorts of other biases. We can see that this canât really be the Objectivistâs âfact about realityâ by considering some of the actual experimentation that tests this. For example, the fact that subjects will judge a middle-height person as âboth tall and not tallâ in strong preference both to âtallâ and to ânot tallâ (Alxatib and Pelletier 2011) does not in the least tend to support any theory about the reality of people manifesting contradictory properties."

You need to be extremely well organized to do this sort of analysis without making any mistakes. A high degree of serenity is required throughout. What makes it difï¬cult is keeping track of the interactions that are in the model and those that have been excluded, and making absolutely sure that no nuisance variables have been omitted unintentionally. It turns out that life can be made much more straightforward if the analysis can be reformulated as an exercise in proportions rather than counts, because if it can, then all of the problems with nuisance variables disappear. On p. 643 the example is reanalysed with the response variable as a proportion in a GLM with binomial errors. This is possible because we have just two species, so we can reformulate the response as the proportion of all lizards that are A. opalinus. This is a big advantage because it does away with the need to retain any of the nuisance variables."

In a general game model, if player i changes her move, then the only available profiles for this may now be ones where some other player j has changed his move as well. Game theorists have studied correlations extensively: cf. (Aumann 1987; Brandenburger and Friedenberg 2008). But the same notion has come up in logic, since correlations provide âinformation channelsâ where the behavior of one agent can carry information about that of another (Barwise and Seligman 1997). And more recently, generalized forms of such dependencies have become the focus of attention in âdependence logicsâ (VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen 2007). In other words, independence may be costly, and the Product Axiom that seemed the pride of STIT may eventually stand in the way, being just an extreme case of a more sophisticated theory of agent behavior.19 In the rest of this chapter, we look at extensions of the current framework with features that seem essential to rational agency, and that have been the subject of study in dynamic logics."

However their mothers did not represent a threat to their feeling of being âauthentic selvesâ (Lawler 2000: 105). In the Nordic sample, where class journeys dominate, we find something in between: the critique of mothers for not understanding them or seeing them for who they were is similar, but the fear of becoming like their mothers is not salient. As we saw in Chap. 6, the upwardly socially mobile informants in this period found that it was their parents who were âdisplacedâ, not themselves. It seems reasonable to explain this difference by the special features of the Nordic class journey in this period, especially the âlock chamberâ model (see Chap. 1), where neither society nor the mothers held the daughters backâquite the contrary. The compressed story of modernisation in combination with gradual class moves and the support from the welfare state contributed to a perception of the journey as a move from rural to urban culture rather than from working class to middle class, as was the case in Britain. It gave a feeling of travelling along with and not against notions of what was felt to be normal.

85,1,0.991,Bayesian Methods in the Search for MH370,"Uncertainty is all pervasiveâwhether it relates to everyday personal choices and actions, or as background to business and policy decisions, or economic and climate predictions. In recent times, few things have attracted as much attention as the uncertainty surrounding the ï¬nal whereabouts of MH370. How to deal scientiï¬cally with uncertainty? Put simply, on the one hand there are events or outcomes of interest that we donât know; on the other hand, pieces of information that we judge relevant in some sense that we do know. We need to assess what we believe about the unknowns, given the knowns. Formalising our measure of uncertainty in terms of probabilities, the scientiï¬c approach is encapsulated in the so-called Bayesian statistical paradigm, in which beliefs about the unknowns are quantiï¬ed by a probability measure conditional on what we know. But typically, our state of knowledge itself gets modiï¬ed over time and a method is therefore needed to reï¬ne and update beliefs as new information is acquired and assembled. The logical, mathematical rule for carrying out this updating is Bayes theorem, hence the term Bayesian Methods to describe the analytic and computational toolkit that has been developed for updating beliefs as evidence changes or is added to. It is this toolkit that has been employed in the search for MH370 and this fascinating book provides a blow-by-blow case account of how the various strands of evidence have been brought together to give an overall probabilistic assessment of the ï¬nal whereabouts of the plane. This has been an extremely complex task and the authors are to be congratulated on setting out systematically and coherently the science and mathematics driving the evidential equations. But, in addition to the complex modelling there remains the task of pulling out the Bayesian probability messages from the tangle of data that has been assembled. The computational methods for achieving this are of relatively recent origin and, on a personal note, I am delighted to have played a small part, with Dr. Neil Gordon, in the signal processing revolution that is now the particle ï¬lter method of analysis."

The macro-level: socially relevant themes We were unlikely to find many patterns by looking at the micro-level, given the relatively small size of our sample, but even when we looked at the macro-level, few themes reached double digits. The exceptions included gender, which appeared in 13 responses, and identity, which appeared in 12. By abstracting a little further we met with a little more success and when using âcultureâ as a keyword we found over 20 responses that made some sort of reference to the word. On their own, these results do not entitle us to draw any interesting conclusions. But things change if we consider these results in the light of some of the findings from the previous chapter: here we saw that over 50% of researchers stressed the social value of humanities research, and also that many researchers put a strong emphasis on heritage. For the purpose of looking at thematic patterns, let us now bunch these two together and look across the macro themes to ask: to what extent are humanities researchers connected to the societal concerns that surround them? How frequently did our respondents mention socially relevant research themes? A brief look at the topics listed under the heading of macro-themes suggests a social orientation in the research topics, which is borne out by a closer look. To give a sense of how we understand the description âsocially relevantâ, here are the examples of themes and topics that we take it to include, listed by region."
296,327,0.991,Becoming a World-Class University : The Case of King Abdulaziz University,"3 Strategies for Excellence 3.1 Elements Obviously, education and research are central in any university strategy, while community engagement might be counted as a third goal of universities. But there is also the need for inspiration, for a choice on the culture universities want to exude. Few universities or university departments have been able to encapsulate this in a single sentence or motto. Most often, vague lines are chosen like âentrepreneurialâ or âinnovativeâ university. I came across a good example of a university which found a condensed way of describing its culture at the Free University in Amsterdam. In 2013 that university selected three core values: personal (in the sense of the staff setting the examples), open (to students from all different backgrounds), and responsible (meaning: engendering a spirit of responsibility towards society among staff and students). Another good example is Harvard Business School (HBS) which stated in 2014, ââ¦ we believe that leadership and values are inseparable. The teaching of ethics is explicit, not implicit, and our community values of mutual respect, honesty and integrity, and personal accountability support the HBS â¦â [2]. A university wants to make a specific choice in the cultural values it pursues. This is not a mere choice of the right words, but should be visible in the implementation of the strategy. It should be explicit and one should be accountable for it, as HBS wants to be. The choice for HBS was not unintended. Graduates of HBS were involved in many of the financial scandals in the US. HBS wanted to demonstrate that it had learned from experience, setting in this way an example for other business schools."

If the agreement, by which savage men first associated and conjoined their force, be here meant, this is acknowledged to be real; but being so ancient, and being obliterated by a thousand changes of government and princes, it cannot now be supposed to retain any authority. [â¦] But besides that this supposes the consent of the fathers to bind the children, even to the most remote generations, (which republican writers will never allow) besides this, I say, it is not justified by history or experience, in any age or country of the world. (Hume, 1994, p. 190) Even among the early contract thinkers, though, the social contract was often understood as a mental construct rather than historical fact. John Locke, for example, does make repeated efforts to find real life examples for his contract argument. But at the same time, he argues that moral principles cannot be derived from history. Rather, it is from reason and through reason that moral norms are discovered:83 [A]t best an argument from what has been, to what should of right be, has no great force [â¦]. But to conclude, reason being plain on our side, that men are naturally free, and the examples of history shewing, that the governments of the world, that were begun in peace, had their beginning laid on that foundation, and were made by the consent of the people; there can be little room for doubt, either where the right is, or what has been the opinion, or practice of mankind, about the first erecting of governments. (Locke, 1690, Book 2, Chapter VIII, Â§Â§ 103â4) In modern political and moral philosophy, the social contract remains central. Modern contractarians have given up all pretence about the historicity of the contract. Instead, they rely explicitly on hypothetical models of consent and delegation to derive the principles of morality as well as criteria for the legitimacy of government. Fred DâAgostino, for example, stresses this point: In its modern guises, contract approaches are not intended as accounts of the historical origins of current social arrangements, but, instead, as answers to, or frameworks for answering, questions about legitimacy and political obligation. (DâAgostino, 2006) In moral philosophy, for instance, thinkers writing in the tradition of Immanuel Kant use a hypothetical contract to derive the principles of morality. Kantian contract thinkers argue that individuals can determine"

Friedrich Schiller, Goetheâs and Kantâs contemporary, has a broad understanding of dignity similar to Grossmanâs. In âDie KÃ¼nstlerâ (The Artists), one of his most famous poems, he refers to the dignity of humankind and demands that we all protect it. In this regard, he comes very close to Kant and also very close to the German constitution, which demands that dignity be protected. Der Menschheit WÃ¼rde ist in eure Hand gegeben, Bewahret sie!

Unless we were engaging in a purely technical investigation, we should have some story to tell about what makes one Belnapian world relevant to anotherâsome account of what one world would have to be like in order to be relevant to another.12 However, given that (as we are now assuming) each point of evaluation will occur in only one world, we could consider a relevance relation directly between points of evaluation. In the closest analogy to standard models, instead of having world w relevant to world wâ² , we could have all wâs points of evaluation relevant to each of wâ² âs. Then â¦p would be true at a given point of evaluation m/ h iff p is true at each point m â² / h â² relevant to m/ h. Once we contemplate such point-to-point relevance, however, we should at least consider the possibility that relevance could be more selectively defined, so that perhaps only some of wâs points of evaluation would be relevant to ones in wâ² , and perhaps only to selected points of evaluation in wâ² . This would call for rethinking the relevance relation, to provide an interpretation which could reasonably be understood to be so selective. Depending on what that interpretation might be, we might also contemplate the possibility that the relevance relation could hold between selected pairs of points of evaluation within the same Belnapian world. In principle, these relaxations of the relevance relation open up a whole new dimension of potential sensitivity for systems based on such supermodelsâa dimension surely worthy of at least preliminary technical exploration. We shall not explore it further here, however. Looking in a different direction: instead of seeking to pursue the analogy with standard models, we could consider pursuing an analogy with neighborhood models based on possible worlds. In classical models the relevance relation relates a world to relevant neighborhoods, i.e. sets, of worlds. One common rationale for doing so is to take advantage of the fact that in possible worlds semantics, any given proposition will naturally be associated with a uniquely determined set of worlds: the worlds at which the proposition is true. The neighborhood is then used to represent the comprehensive proposition which captures all that is true throughout the neighborhood but which is false at all other worlds. Other interpretations similarly associate sets of worlds with events, or with actions. In each such case, worlds are gathered into neighborhoods in their capacity as points of evaluation, and so the apt analog for our supermodels would be neighborhoods made up of moment/history pairs, rather than of worlds. The default view would be that the neighborhoods could, and typically would, include points of evaluation from different worlds: the proposition that p, for example, would be represented in the supermodel by the set of all points m/ h at which p was true.13 12 One classic illustration is the specification, in standard deontic logic, that world wâ² is to be"

Pinocchio (object a) deflects the life of Geppetto ($), for instance, while the seductive nature of the âeffect xâ deflected Stapel from his initial course. Psychoanalysis aims to reconstruct this dynamics by following the Fallgeschichte with evenly-poised attention. The psychoanalytic reader is not interested in social psychology (for instance: in prejudice studies) as such, but rather in the question: what exactly is it that is drawing/deflecting the tormented subject into this apparently desperate trajectory.25 What is the difference between experimental social science (the field for which Stapel qualified until he disqualified himself) and psychoanalysis? In his inaugural lecture, Diederik A. Stapel (2001) defined social psychology as âthe science of everyday lifeâ, combining specificity with precision, a title which is reminiscent of one of Freudâs publications, namely The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens 1904/1941). In this book, Freud aims to demonstrate how minor, everyday instances of malfunctioning (forgetting names, memories or foreign words, slips of the tongue, reading errors, etc.) are symptomatic of unconscious complexes and inhibitions. Quite a few examples used by Freud involve ethnic prejudices and anti-Semitism, and this is comparable to social psychology as we have seen. For the prototypical social psychologist, the Mr. Hyde of European Caucasians is an anti-Semite (especially the ones who do not know this about themselves). According to Freud, psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt cannot really explain specific instances of forgetfulness or mistakes. His laboratory knowledge fails to elucidate concrete examples taken from everyday life. In the case of psychoanalysis, however, whenever a specific mistake occurs, a dialogue will evolve, building on free associations, which is expected to disclose the inconvenient, obfuscated factor. Whereas social psychology aims at discovering general mechanisms,"

Within externalism many things can be reasons, so the probability space is rather diverse, containing not only beliefs and propositions, but also perceptions, memories, facts, and so on. This difficulty can however be handled as follows. First we define different spaces: a space of beliefs, a space of perceptions, a space of memories, and so on. Then we define a space which is the Cartesian product of all those spaces. And finally we decide which relation of probabilistic causality we want to focus on. Do we want to focus on perceptions causing beliefs? Or memories causing beliefs? Or beliefs causing desires? Desires causing beliefs? Deciding on the answers to these questions is necessary in order to keep a grip on the heterogenous probability space, but it is just a slight technical complication, and it is not important for the general philosophical point that (2.1) is neutral with respect to both internalism and externalism. 45 Swinburne 2001, Chapters 2, 7, and 8. 46 Goldman 1986, 5-6."
275,280,0.991,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"9.4 How do We Know Who or What Is Trustworthy How do we decide whether to trust? In Sect. 9.3 the properties that establish and define trustworthiness were considered. In this section the epistemology of trustworthiness is examined-how do we know who or what is trustworthy? What are the indicators of trust? If a person claims to justifiably trust another, it indicates they have the ability and confidence to predict othersâ behaviour [62]. Implicit, heuristic or âgutâ indicators of trust are often grounded in physical responses and intuitions. Explicit, reflective or rational trust stems from our experience of people over time and our reasons to judge their trustworthiness. Often we do not know why we trust, we trust implicitly. Thomas Reid (1764) [75] argued that reasons could not be required for trust given thatâmost men would be unable to find reasons for believing the thousandth part of what is told them.â Reidâs point is that humans must be justified to trust even in the absence of reasons. Consider the way we use Google maps. Many people use Google maps to get them where they need to go, without knowing how Google maps works, how their phone works or how traffic influences the instructions Google maps provides. Not only do people not know why they trust Google maps, it does not seem to concern people that they do not know why. So how do humans make trust judgments of systems and each other, and are these the same mechanisms that elicit trust in AS? This section moves through implicit and explicit justifications of trust followed by a cognitive model of trust and competence and finally a brief comment on the relationship between trustworthiness and risk."
363,144,0.991,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"that only Ruth could be in possession of the journal they astutely ask: âThe question is, do we possess her reading, or does she possess ours?â (ibid.). This points to the fact that we, of course, are also the readers hovering at the edge of the page of each diary, and, in turn, raises the puzzling question, unaccounted for in the narrative, of how we come to read these diaries. As we have seen, Selinaâs diary is never physically accounted for and Margaretâs, we discover, is burnt, down to its very last page (348). Within the novel itself, these texts leave no discernible trace; they, like the desire they record, exist only in Watersâ, and her readersâ, imagination. What the novel suggests, then, is that Waters has materialised the diaries for us so that they may retrospectively inhabit and expand the Victorian literary tradition, materialising experiences rendered invisible by the historical record. In fact, this is dramatised for us in the novel. When Margaret Prior first visits Millbank Prison in her role as Lady Visitor, she casts off convention and, instead of reading to the prisoners from the Bible, determines that she will listen to the women tell their own stories (22). The response of one of the wardens indicates the extent of Margaretâs subversiveness: âShe looked at me then and said nothingâ (22). Indeed, the convict women share in this silence: they have all but lost the ability to tell their stories, stumbling over their words (39). Or, rather, the legal system has made them tell their stories, and has coopted and told their stories for them, so many times that they seem divorced from the women themselves: âthe telling has made a kind of story of it, realer than memory but meaning nothing. I wish I could tell her that I know what such a story feels likeâ (40). Margaret knows what this feels like because she has witnessed the rewriting of her passionate history with Helen into a heteronormative narrative allows Helen to pass as an ideal of Victorian womanhood: âHelen attended Mr Priorâs lectures,â [Mrs Prior] said, âand, Margaret meeting her there, she was brought to the house. She was always a great guest of ours after that, and always a favourite with Mr. Prior. Of course, we did not know â did we Priscilla â that it was all on Stephenâs account that she came here. â You must not blush, Helen dear!â (102) It is significant, here, that Helenâs blush becomes an ephemeral sign which we are asked to read in the light of two contestatory explanations, and that Margaretâs agency, as well as her passion, is entirely written out. Her role in bringing Helen to the Priorâs residence is written into"
140,90,0.991,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"what decisions are made which creatively regulate that output. The âpolitical systemâ concept in the work of Easton (1953) ï¬ts this model, yet Easton himself, to my knowledge, did not take the next step to a âï¬eldâ framework. Early development of ï¬eld theory in the social sciences begins with psychology, chiefly in the work of Lewin (1939). In his framework, individuals (and groups) are conceived of as goal-seeking life forms in environments which, over time, induce learning. Environments are perceived as opportunities and obstructions to goal attainment, motivating people to adapt their behavior. The goals themselves vary as basic needs at the biological level are adequately met.3 All these ideas constituted my own âlittle ï¬eldâ as I tried to understand the purpose of the DON Project and what my mentors were about. As I recall, Rudy began his thinking about ï¬elds with Wrightâs idea of states propelled by interests and power in an n-dimensional space deï¬ned by their attributes, and Lewinâs idea of people interacting in ï¬elds constituted by their personalities. Over the next four or so decades, Rudy made their insights for understanding international conflict quantitatively and systematically researchable, at least in principle, and applicable to Guetzkowâs and his concern with preventing war. Lewin sketched his theory as an equation, B = F(P,E). Behavior B is a function of the life space of an individual, the personality P and environment E (Fig. 5.1). Here, the irregular sections represent an âintellectual geographyâ or life space, that is, events or situations through which a person travels over time and which influence the person P moving from some origin O towards a desired goal G. Both the person and the environment are in flux, thus different people at different times experience different situations. Each person (or group) may well constitute one of those irregular shapes in the graphâeach shape representing their âï¬eldâ of beliefs and predispositions, as each pursues their own goals in interaction with P. Although Rudy takes exception to this graphical representation, at the end of his critical review of the literature, he notes that he is in substantial agreement with Lewinâs equation.4 Further, consider one of Rummelâs concluding graphs (Fig. 5.2). As I see it, this is clearly a more detailed rendering of one of Lewinâs irregular shapes, some details applying Maslowâs concept of basic needs.5 Thus, Rudy is integrating a variety of theories and, as such, makes an original contribution to at least one type of ï¬eld theory.

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"Given that the literature on ICTs tends to stress both the developmental and empowering virtues of this technology, and the lower take-up of such technology among older people, one would be forgiven for thinking that older hostel residents who use this technology would figure among the most empowered of all senior citizens. In fact, the findings show that ICTs may serve to exacerbate or amplify the menâs burdens, calling into question the empowerment thesis. The new communications technology, while a blessing in some ways, makes it easier for left behind relatives to âexploitâ family connections for money and other forms of remittance. Saleem, in particular, returned again and again during our discussions to the motif of exploitation, both in France and back home. I donât feel at ease, because I feel that â I feel I am alone, and I am still exploited â exploited by those who are here [in France] and those who are there [back home] (â¦) Itâs true that itâs my family, but Iâm exploited all the same, because I donât have a choice.

155,358,0.991,New Vision 2050 : a Platinum Society,"It Is Innovation for Being Used at the Site Yoshikawa Perhaps this is whatâs called social engineering. In the case of Japan, even if something is achieved at the level of science or technology, whether or not that achievement gets introduced into society is a separate problem. There is a huge social problem. In that regard, I believe that there is still much room for improvement in Japan. I believe that there is also a large role to be played by the state and the government. For example, a historical example that was successful that I think of, though maybe somewhat out of the blue, is the Dojunkai Apartments. In the recovery after the 1923 Kanto Earthquake, the Home Ministry erected about twenty Dojunkai Apartment buildings in Tokyo and Yokohama. Up until then, collective housing had consisted of wooden buildings with at most two stories; however, the collective housing introduced with the Dojunkai Apartments consisted of concrete structures that were 3 to 4 stories, or, in some cases, even 6â7 stories high. The Dojunkai Apartments served as the model for post-WWII collective housing, and it is clear that they represent the prototype of the modern-day apartment complexes. The Home Ministry played a leading role in carrying out that experimental project. Because âseeing is believing.â it is extremely important to present a model in a form that people can see with their eyes. Especially nowadays, I think itâs even more necessary to make a model. This is true especially in the fields of medicine and caregiving. An easy to understand example would be that even if a caregiver robot were developed, it is not introduced into an actual caregiving facility. It is because they are not a part of the medical treatment fee structure. Aside from the case where there is a unique business manager who wants to experiment with the robot and pays out of his/ her pocket for it, there is no basis for introducing such robots into caregiving facilities. Thus, the state must play a leading role in spreading the use of caregiver robots. People have been talking about this for 10 years now, but it still isnât happening. Even in the field of energy, in which you are interested, there was a certain type of scheme that was created in order to foster the diffusion of renewables. In the same manner, the medical and caregiving fields will more than likely require some sort of public initiative before innovative technologies are adopted for widespread use. I guess this is what is called social innovation. I believe that there is a lot of room for progress there."
0,12,0.991,Library and Information Sciences : Trends and Research,"example, with a more highly information literate workforce, private sector companies can expect that their workers will work smarter at whatever they do, and therefore produce at a higher rateâwhatever the products and services involvedâthan ever before. But I want to concentrate on librarians and information professionals because most of you are in that career area already, and I therefore want to try to address your needs and expectations, and try to deal with some of your fears and misgivingsâreal or imagined. To begin with, you are going to be in great demand for your knowledge and skills because you can expect that your superiors, colleagues, peers and subordinates, not to mention your family and friends, will have been reading about information literacy and asking many questionsâwhat is it, why is it important to me, how can I learn about it, and how can I practice it so as to improve my life, do my job better, and help my family resolve their problems? They will begin to look to you for the answers to those questionsâperhaps from the moment you arrive back home and go back to your jobs on the first day. They will need training, which is why this workshop is designed to help âtrain the trainers.â So the first opportunity Iâm addressing is that you are in a new and still-emerging profession, the members of which will be expected to have acquired, both in formal schooling, in special workshop opportunities such as this one, as well as in practice, on-the-job, information literacy knowledge and skills. Whether you respond to this demand for your expertise and talents is, of course, entirely up to you. Some of you may be timid, and believe that you have not learned enough to call yourselves information literacy experts. That is understandable. Sometimes titles are not all that important. But, hopefully, many, if not most of you, will, slowly but surely, rise to this demand for your talents, whatever your current job title, and, however modestly, and however carefully you begin to respond to that demand, you will, eventually, be looked up to in your organization as one of the, if not THE information literacy expert! Many professionals are in stable or even declining fields and careers. But yours is a field that is ascendantârising fastâand the demand will not lessen for years to come. I personally happen to believe it is rising exponentially! Secondly, as the benefits of a more information literate faculty, student body, office worker, laboratory worker, factory worker, and managerial level becomes more visible, quantifiable, transferable and sustainable, inevitably your job opportunities will proliferate and salary levels and other kinds of benefits can be expected to increase commensurately. Do not sell yourself cheaply! Perhaps you may need to transfer, moving to another unit, or even an entirely different organization, to take advantage of new opportunities that are arising. Do not be bashful or hesitant to consider such offers and opportunities. In short, the price tag you command should increase proportionately to correspond with the level of expertise you acquire as you learn more and more about information theory concepts and practices. Like all fields, you start as a beginner, then advance to an intermediate level, and then, sooner or later, go on to an advanced level. Be sure to keep your resume and C.V. up to date to reflect your information literacy expertise and learning. For example, include workshops of this kind in your C.V. so that when a more lucrative and challenging job offer becomes available, you will have a job portfolio that reflects accurately your training as well as on-the-job experience."

There quite possibly never was a contest in which the disputants failed so comprehensively to grasp one anotherâs point of view. John Simon, speaking at the International Medical Congress in London in 1881, summed it up thus: Our own [i.e. the experimentersâ] verb of life is ÎµÏÎ³Î±Î¶ÎµÏÎ¸Î±Î¹ [to work], not Î±Î¹ÏÎ¸Î±Î½ÎµÏÎ¸Î±Î¹ [to perceive].

46,9,0.991,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"should decide what poverty is and who is characterized as poor? Who has or should have the power to help and change the living conditions of the poor? In short, whether one is counted as poor or not is usually not dependent on whether one views herself as poor. Poverty measures focus mostly â and for good reason â on objective indicators such as income, wealth, goods and capabilities, but there is a growing concern that this focus might be a major shortcoming and that the multidimensionality of poverty and social exclusion demands the inclusion of the view of the poor themselves (Brock 1999; Norton 2001). The rise of the debate about subjective well-being, which obviously cannot be determined objectively without reference to the interior view, and its use for poverty research is also an indicator for this (Kingdon and Knight 2006). Finally, the role of poor people themselves in the conceptualization, measurement and evaluation of poverty is in question. Do they know best, maybe better than poverty researchers, what poverty means or should mean? Neither poverty research nor normative philosophy is situated outside the real world, which is full of relations of power and domination, and it is a fact that some knowledge is privileged and a few have the power to shape the discourse about poverty. Robert Chambers, one of the pioneers of participatory work, writes about that issue: A question remains: whose analysis and categories are to be privileged? These are largely âoursâ, those of professionals who are not ourselves poor, expressed in âourâ language. The words, concepts, categories and priorities of poor people, especially illustrated by the way they were elicited and expressed in the Voices of the Poor, were rich and varied with commonalities. There are trade-offs to be puzzled over: between âtheirâ realities and ours; between local participatory diversity and commensurability for purposes of aggregation; and between many categories representing poor peopleâs realities and fewer categories more manageable for outsider professionals and for measurement. (Chambers 2007, 37) We cannot tackle all of these issues in-depth in this book. They give, however, a first glimpse into the highly complex issues that surround any debate about poverty and the ways in which philosophical, in particular normative, questions, arise. This is not breaking news, neither to poverty researchers and policymakers nor to philosophers. However, today philosophy and poverty research still usually work separately and hence miss out on the benefits of a certainly needed interdisciplinarity. There are, of course, a few exceptions; for example, Monique Deveauxâs"
124,189,0.991,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"(pastwards connection) Constraints 1â3 ensure that the moments in a model are organized into trees. Adding constraint 6 would ensure that there is only one such tree per model. We focus first on models which are pastwards connected. One interesting observation is that if, in such models, we take the histories as correlates of possible worlds, we find that to determine whether two individuals appearing in different histories within a single model are or are not identical, we need only trace them back in time to see whether they have a common origin at some moment included in both the histories. So provided we are able to trace identity back through time, we get a natural solution to what would have been the problem of trans-world identity but which is now recast as the non-problem of trans-history identity. But from another point of view, because the various histories in a branching time model are all connected it is reasonable to consider, as Belnap does, that the entirety of the structure in one pastwards-connected branching time model represents âour worldâ. Such a model depicts a world rich with internal possibilities, past and present, and rich with alternative histories, each of them a possible history of the actual world, rather than an actual7 history of a different possible world. 7 Actual according to an indexical understanding of that notion, that is."

The interviewees recognize that no single set of recommendations could solve all problems in Romanian higher education; there is no âsilver bulletâ. Thus, we tried to break the problem down into smaller sub-problems that can be productively addressed by policy. We also gave recommendations to different actors: recommendations at national level imply the alteration of the legal framework and national evaluation instruments; those for universities imply changes at the management and departmental levels. The latter changes can be made immediately, without lengthy parliamentary debates. Our recommendations may be perceived as going in the direction of a completely decentralised evaluation system. While we think that more responsibility should be placed in the hands of faculty, we do not discount the importance of either national legislation, or leadership of the universities. The key here is dosage. Medicine should not be so strong that it kills the patient. Nor should it be so diluted that it doesnât work at all. Careful recalibration could achieve a lot. Our main message is that policy-makers should shift focus from the current obsession about process to achieving substantive results in learning and scientiï¬c research. They should envisage a bigger role for faculty and students inside the university, and a smaller role for themselves, for external inspectors and university management. While accountability will continue to be important, it should be based on demonstrated achievement, rather than on process. Put otherwise, Romanian policymakers should try to mobilise the brainpower of faculty and students in the universities. Inspectors and inspected should step off the merry-go-round of evaluations and start reflecting on the purpose and scope of existent practices. Only then can we engage in more meaningful evaluations.

Ted sees the value of whatâs in between, over and underneathâhow things connect. This is how he dreamt up hypertext, which goes so far beyond the typeset page (Fig. 12.2). WHATâS LOST: The nuance expressed in the shape of a line, the words deleted in edits. Sentences crossed out. Text inserted. Ink blots from late nights working, historical coffee stains.

Itâs a game thatâs available on Playstation and PC (available by search on YouTube). This is live game play, this is what the kids (cough, me) play these days.

123,94,0.991,Fallibility At Work : Rethinking Excellence and Error in organizations,"Over the years, reflection on practice has strengthened safety in aviation. A combination of practical and academic contributions have highlighted the need for precise and direct communication, and a development from a heroic and individualistic approach, to a more collective one, where teamwork is essential. Theoretical contributions from Reason (1990) have been central to this development, first through the establishment of a vocabulary to distinguish between different kinds of error, and second through his so-called Swiss Cheese Model for dealing adequately with error (Reason, 1990). Both of these conceptual sources have relevance beyond aviation, as they can be useful in analyses of fallibility and error outside the safety domain. Reason distinguishes between execution errors and planning errors. With the former, the plan is fine, but the execution faulty, while with the latter things go wrong from the start, since the plan is inadequate for the task ahead. Furthermore, he separates between two kinds of execution errors, and calls them slips and lapses. Slips are actions not carried out as intended or planned, as when a person struggles with digits on a phone when dialing in a frequency. There can be âFreudian slipsâ when a person intends to say one thing, but inadvertently ends up saying something revealing about his or her real attitudes or thoughts. The idea is good, but not the execution. Lapses are missed actions and omissions, as when somebody has failed to do something due to lapses of memory or attention, or because they have forgotten something. Gimmestadâs landing with the brakes on is an example of a lapse (Reason, 1990). A student presented another example of a lapse to me at a seminar at the Norwegian Police University College. The agent was a police officer who was an expert at rapidly disarming people who point a gun at him. He had built up this expertise through thousands of repetitions in training. The police officer had asked colleagues and friends countless times to"
378,113,0.991,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"For his own research questions, Kasser selected people who put making money and having possessions relatively high on their overall list of things they deemed important. In order to ï¬nd this group, surveys were conducted with an âAspiration Indexâ that listed a variety of goals which participants ranked according to their importance. If someone ranked, for example, ï¬nancial success higher in comparison to other goals like a good family life and friendships, it indicated a materialistic value set on the index. Each life goal was associated with descriptions of aspirations that have been observed to relate to particular values like benevolence, self-direction, security, power or hedonism. In the category of ï¬nancial success, for example, these included âyou will be your own boss,â âyou will have a job with high social status,â âyou will have a job that pays well,â or âyou will buy things just because you want them.â The study also documented aspirations in non-monetary goal categories like âimageâ and âfameâ that competitive societies tend to treat with similar importance. The commonality between these three goals is that they are extrinsic motivations, which means they involve seeking a sense of worth outside oneself. Feeling worthy thus depends on external rewards and the praise of others. From a methodological point of view we can see how Kasser tested how people who most closely resembled Homo economicus felt and how they experienced life. The complete survey also had four questionnaires to assess the individualâs score on two important well-being characteristics (self-actualization and vitality) and on the two most common psychological disorders (depression and anxiety). The results showed that people whose values were centered on the accumulation of wealth, material possessions, or fame, faced a greater risk of unhappiness, including anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and problems with intimacy, regardless of age, income, or culture. Kasser repeated the study several times with different groups and compared his ï¬ndings with those of others. He added more extrinsic orientation values like narcissism and used a more open methodology in which goals were not assigned by providing pre-set aspirations but deï¬ned by the individuals themselves. Across the board he found the same picture emerging: âThe more materialistic values are at the center of our lives, the more our quality of life is diminishedâ (Kasser 2002: 14). Another group of researchers has found evidence that many who care a lot about making money and succeed can offset the loss of well-being they experience by sacriï¬cing aspects of their life like family or leisure time. Overall, however, Kasserâs ï¬nding are supported, as Bok concludes in his meta-study, because âthe ï¬ndings of psychologists convey a warning that being preoccupied with getting rich carries a substantial risk of leaving one unhappy and disappointed in the endâ (Bok 2010: 15). The blurb accompanying Thrive, the 2014 bestseller by Arianna Hufï¬ngton, puts it this way: âOur relentless pursuit of the two traditional metrics of successâmoney and powerâhas led to an epidemic of burnout and stress-related illnesses, and an erosion in the quality of our relationships, family life, and, ironically, our careers.â So, encouraging and training people to see and think like a Homo economicus"
3,191,0.991,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"Adding can involve providing more directive support, providing additional feedback of a different nature, and increasing the frequency of prompts. For example, the Mobile Knowledge Constructor invited students to find a plant in a garden (Chu, Hwang, & Tsai, 2010). It then asked questions about features of the target plant. If students answered incorrectly, it guided them to another plant that has the mistaken feature. After studying the new plant, students needed to answer the question they missed again. Fading and adding is simply the combination of fading and adding within the same scaffolding treatment. As with fading and adding, fading/adding should be performed on the basis of dynamic assessment. Accordingly, fading occurs when performance indicates that students are gaining sufficient skill to perform the target task independently, whereas adding occurs when students are not on track to improve as rapidly as desired. For example, a scaffolding system broke content to be learned into different blocks (S. Li, 2001). For each block, there were four levels of support possible: no support, provide hint, provide example, and provide answer. Students started out at the hint level. In the system-controlled version, if they answered correctly, they would be moved down to no support. If they answered incorrectly, then they would be provided an example, and so on. No fading/adding means that there is no customization of scaffolding. In other words, scaffolding is the same throughout studentsâ engagement with the central problem. Researchers often argue that not-fading/adding can lead to overscripting, a situation in which scaffolding is provided when it is in fact not needed, thereby conflicting with existing mental models of how to address the targeted problem (Dillenbourg, 2002). This in turn is said to lead to weaker learning outcomes."

Our specific focus on the young peopleâs social networks in the biographical interviews turned out to be another advantage, as it provided us with a rich source of diverse information about the genesis and the relevance of social networks in the transition into adulthood. And the relatively large sample for our case-reconstructive project has proved to be an excellent base for further differentiation of our findings and to identify statements extending beyond the individual case. On a final note I would like to point out that working with biographical material always encourages us to question the ideas and standards used by the publicâand often also by researchersâto assess biographies and in particular the transition into adulthood. What seems to the outside world to be an easy transition into the workplace because it happens quickly and âquietlyâ does not always prove to be the transition that is subjectively experienced as the one that is most satisfactory to a given individual and that meets his or her requirements for an independent life. And the opposite is also true. Those biographies and transitions that seem to be very difficult and plagued by personal crisis can provide a great deal of subjective satisfaction and hold potential for social innovation.

Attention has become âmonetizedâ so that we are constantly playing the dual role as attention-consumer and attention-attractor in order to maintain or promote our place in life. Yet, there is more to being human in the digital age than a sort of meter that monitors the amount of attention we can attract in a crowded digital sphere. We should not be reduced to our online rating, as measured through our number of Facebook friends, Twitter followers, position in the Googlearchy, etc. Individuals need to recognize that they should have agency and choice in the online sphere and that they should have structures in place to support this agency and choice."
227,17,0.991,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Hence, the fruitless efforts of the initiation phase are only seemingly so. They not only set up the aforementioned tension responsible for the emotional release at the time of illumination, but also create the conditions necessary for the process to enter into the incubation phase. Illumination is the manifestation of a bridging that occurs between the unconscious mind and the conscious mind (PoincarÃ© 1952), a coming to (conscious) mind of an idea or solution. What brings the idea forward to consciousness is unclear, however. There are theories of the aesthetic qualities of the idea, effective surprise/shock of recognition, fluency of processing, or breaking functional ï¬xedness. For reasons of brevity I will only expand on the ï¬rst of these. PoincarÃ© proposed that ideas that were stimulated during initiation remained stimulated during incubation. However, freed from the constraints of conscious thought and deliberate calculation, these ideas would begin to come together in rapid and random unions so that âtheir mutual impacts may produce new combinationsâ (PoincarÃ© 1952). These new combinations, or ideas, would then be evaluated for viability using an aesthetic sieve, which allows through to the conscious mind only the âright combinationsâ (PoincarÃ© 1952). It is important to note, however, that good or aesthetic does not necessarily mean correct. Correctness is evaluated during the veriï¬cation stage. The purpose of veriï¬cation is not only to check for correctness. It is also a method by which the solver re-engages with the problem at the level of details. That is, during the unconscious work the problem is engaged with at the level of ideas and concepts. During veriï¬cation the solver can examine these ideas in closer details. PoincarÃ© succinctly describes both of these purposes. As for the calculations, themselves, they must be made in the second period of conscious work, that which follows the inspiration, that in which one veriï¬es the results of this inspiration and deduces their consequences. (PoincarÃ© 1952, p. 62)"

I was taken by surprise, so my father told me that I made a mistake that I will pay to the bitter end. I didnât know her. I quickly saw that I could manipulate her, that I could rule her with a rod of iron.â The husband gave next some criticisms: âShe is quite impulsive. Her brother says she is unreliable. She sometimes deserves : : : .[silent, sigh], she freaks out.â This example illustrates the necessity to assess this construct with several methods as the results are not the same depending on the method that was used: according to the questionnaire, the woman was high on expressed emotion while the man was low; according to the situation of observation, the woman was low on expressed emotions and the man was high. This certainly refers to a certain degree of ambivalence in their relationship; the mixed-method approach allowed us to note that both partners are ambivalent while a single method would have led us to conclude that one partner only is high on emotion and thus âresponsibleâ for the negativity in the relation. Moreover, we would not have identified the same partner as the ânegative oneâ depending on the chosen method. The mixed method also allows a more complex and comprehensive evaluation of a situation. In fact, each method measures a different aspect of this situation and grasps its nuances and subtleties."
299,119,0.991,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"The definition of âpreferencesâ is subject to some deliberation and debate.1 However, a widely-used definition in economics is a ranking of possible choices prior to any consideration of resource constraints. Hausman (2011), for example, defines the concept as âtotal subjective comparative evaluationsââthat is, a ranking of options based on all relevant information about value (p. 10), including social expectations and anticipated pleasure. Preferences are said to be ârevealedâ by the choices people make. However, critics held that this definition makes preferences tautological, because there are two observations based on the same data point. Whatever the person buys shows both his preference and what he actually got, hence there is no way of telling if he had a preference prior to the act of buying that influenced his choice. Thus economists write that a person who never consumed wine suddenly bought a bottle of wineâwhich shows that he must have had a preference for wine. In this kind of formulation, adding the term preference adds nothing to our understanding of choice behavior. This flaw can be corrected if one presumes that preferences entail at least some measure of consistency over time, a choice predisposition. To return to the example just cited, one would say that the particular personâs preference is not to consume wine and would seek to understand what made him act against his preference. The field of economics has largely ignored the study of preference formation, as reflected by the consensus among economists that utility and preferences are âpurely introspectiveâ and subjective, and therefore beyond the scope of economic modeling (Keita 2012, p. 77). Above all, they assumed that economic agents were closed systems when making choices and that their preferences were stable (Martins 2011, p. 253). Stigler and Becker (1977) capture this quintessential neoclassical perspective in their famous quote: âOne does not argue over tastes for the same reason that one does not argue over the Rocky Mountainsâboth are there, will be there next year, too, and are the same to all menâ (Rizvi 2001, pp. 141â142). In short, economists either simply ignored preferences or deemed it ânot useful for economicsâ (Rizvi 2001, pp. 141â142) to assume that preferences are changeable or to study their formationâsometimes referred to as âopening the preferencesâ (Etzioni 1985). Those economists who did recognize that preferences may be changeable did not advocate that preference formation be considered âpart of the corpus of orthodox theoryâ because such a study would detract from the study of âlogical actionâ in economics and thus âbelong[ed] to sociologyâ (Drakopoulos 2012, pp. 541, 542). Economists thus largely ignored or left the study of preference formation to other disciplines, particularly those that adhere to paradigms other than the neoclassical one preferred by economics.2 Moreover, several leading economists, particularly"

Most significantly though, past framing has failed to account for the social in relation to the biophysical and, where present, treating it as an add-on rather than integral to the question of what has to be governed (Ison et al. 2007). Framing failure is often a precursor to maladaptive responses (practices, policies, investments â see Barnett and OâNeill 2010) because âframesâ are used by humans to negotiate the complexity of the world they experience by determining what requires attention and what can be ignored. Any framing choice brings with it systemic consequences; they shape practice and create pathway dependencies. As Lakoff (2010: 71â72) notes: All thinking and talking involves âframing.â And since frames come in systems, a single word typically activates not only its defining frame, but also much of the system its defining frame is in. Moreover, many frame-circuits have direct connections to the emotional regions of the brain. Emotions are an inescapable part of normal thought. Indeed, you cannot be rational without emotions."
232,332,0.991,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"2 The Management of Extreme Situations, Multiple Dilemmas Broadly speaking, the application of ethics to major accidents and the management of extreme situations leads to a focus on the relationship between people (both individuals and collectives) and these events. During the workshop, the concept of the victim (which makes the relationship between people and the accident explicit) emerged as a heuristic that united the various ethical questions that were raised. For instance, how should the public (who are all potential victims of major accidents) be taken into account, and involved in decisions that may impact them at some point? As major accidents unfold, how do we determine what truly helps victims, and what is in their best interest? Should such a âbest interestâ be acted upon, even if victims do not give their consent? Finally after an accident has occurred, who should be considered as a victim? How can victims be recognized as suchâand ultimately, be compensated for their loss, assuming that such compensation is possible? One important issue that was raised is that of a mediator who arbitrates between victims and the accident. Such a mediator is necessary to establish a relationship between people and what has happened to them. This relationship is a prerequisite for the evaluation of the post-accident situation and attempts to restore harmony, from which a new cycle can begin. The question becomes even more difï¬cult when one looks at non-human victims (i.e. nature), that have no voice to express the damage it has suffered and where it may not be possible to restore harmony. During the workshop, the Sorites paradox1 was used to illustrate the immense difï¬culty of giving an identity to victims of major accidents. This is not only a question of the number of victims: tens of thousands could be named. But, for example, who should be considered as a victim of the Chernobyl accident, where millions were exposed to very small doses of radiation? If someone lives in an area that was affected by radiation from Chernobyl and develops cancer, how can we determine whether s/he is a victim of the Chernobyl accident? This philosophical argument is supported by epidemiology, which highlights the difï¬culty of correlating radiation maps with actual damage to human health. Together, these issues question the ability of traditional models to shed heuristic and instrumental light on phenomena that are as complex as major accidents. The issue of traditional models was only one way in which the relevance of current scientiï¬c approaches to major accidents was questioned. Other issues concerned how to establish a relationship between scientists and the public, and how to make scientiï¬c knowledge available to less-expert audiences and include them in decisions that may ultimately disrupt their life. Consequently, public"
229,200,0.991,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"would be a silent, unfeeling carcase, such as young surgeons sometimes practised upon.88 Confirming this fantasy, and relaying instructions for mastectomy, Dionis informed young surgeons that â[t]his Operation is easier than is imagined before âtis performed; for the Breast separates as easily from the Ribs, as when we divide the Shoulder from a Quarter of Lambâ.89 His statement, seemingly meant to reassure, tacitly acknowledged the dread with which some operators must have approached this procedure, and the mental tactics employed to overcome it. Representations of cancer surgery thus consistently engaged with the potential of that operation both to help and harm. Where cancer surgeons might try to efface the dangerous and painful nature of their interventions, however, other medical practitioners had no such qualms. For every author who provided accounts of or instructions for cancer operations, there were many more writers â often physicians, but sometimes lay onlookers or surgeons writing against their perceived inferiors â who accused cancer surgeons of conduct which was at best careless and at worst positively evil. In a 1703 publication from âT.D.â on the âAbusesâ committed under the name of chirurgery, for example, the author singled out one surgeonâs cancer operations for particular attention.90 This operator was, it seems, moderately famous for mastectomy operations in particular: T.D. stated that âI make no question but you have hearâd of one who calls himself the un-born Drâ.91 The doctorâs practice, wrote T.D., was âmonstrousâ: âThe Number of Womens Breasts, which this man has cut off within these few Years is scarce to be believâd: And yet ... he cannot produce One, where there was a true ulcerated Cancer, that is now living to tell Tales of Himâ.92 Given that cancer was widely acknowledged to be difficult if not impossible to cure, âwhat then can we thinkâ, asked the author, of this shameful Undertaker, who makes no more of taking off a Breast (althoâ no otherwise than a Butcher might do the same) than some Persons do to pair [pare] their Nails, so that scarce any thing of a distemperâd Breast is presented, but the poor Woman is frightenâd out of her Wits, with the dismal Sentence pronouncâd of its being Cancerous.93 For T.D., the activities of the âunborn Dr.â could not be viewed as compassionate or progressive. Instead, the casting of the surgeon as âUndertakerâ in this account explicitly opposed the operatorâs self-construction as a preserver of life. Moreover, naming the doctor as a âButcherâ who cut up women as readily as he cut his nails subverted surgeonsâ emphasis on the"
93,319,0.991,Nordic Mediation Research,"Another point to consider in terms of equality before the law is that in Norwayâas opposed to in Northern Irelandâthe access to youth Sanction and youth follow-up is a matter of estimate. As described above, the young offender cannot participate without his or her own consent as well as that of his/her guardian. Yet it is, depending on inter alia the seriousness of the charge and the life situation of the offender, up to a judge, the prosecution and/or a coordination group of professionals (including e.g. (case dependent) childrenâs services, school, police and youth coordinator) to decide whether the young person could beneï¬t from such a sanction and whether such sanction is an appropriate/proportionate response to the offense. The former would typically involve questioning whether, for instance, the quite heavy artillery of a youth follow-up might be over the top compared to aâdisregarding the offenceârelatively positive and stabile life situation of the offender. The latter can, for instance, mean that in very serious cases it can be seen as violating to the public sense of justice for the offender to receive youth sanction instead of a jail sentence. However, such conclusion is extremely rare, since the general tendency in Norwayâas mentionedâis to avoid the incarceration of minors, but is has happened in a few cases. In this way the elastic heart of the Norwegian sanctions of 2014 perhaps seems more in congruence with theâideallyâindividual approach of restorative justice than with the principal of equality before the law. But where there is room for judgment calls social research has continuously showed us there is also room for (more or less both traceable and conscious) discrimination. Professional does not equal neutral, so how do we ensure that the decision made is in the best interests of the young offender, as well as the local community and perhaps society as a whole (whatever the latter might mean)? The same elasticity also goes for estimating when a youth planâthe core of the two 2014 types of sanctionsâhas been diverted from to such a degree, that the young person has not lived up to it and the case needs to be sent back to the judge/ prosecution in order to put something else in play. This could, for instance, in the case of youth sanction, mean jail time for the young offender. Within the legislation it is up for the youth coordinator to decide when enough is enough, but in reality the decision is made with other professional members of the young personâs follow-up team and/or coordination group (for instance, police, childrenâs services, probation services, prosecution, teacher etc.) as well as the local management of the Mediation Service where the case is based. As illustrated in the quotations above, holding this (co-)power to decide when to stop trying to ârestoreâ is not something the professionals working with the sanctions at the Mediation Service seem to enjoy. Yet the rationale seems to be ârather us than someone elseâ as the perception within the Serviceâas outside critique also has suggestedâis that the people working here will stretch very wide to keep a (consenting) young person âon-boardâ. This dilemma, of course, contains universal relevance wherever ideology meets practice."

We should âbe much more direct about what it is that [we] mean to sayâ. Neuroscientists and experimentalists would, in fact, warm to âa list of facts or statements separated by periods with the occasional transition term to hold it all togetherâ; at the moment, it was hard to â[extract] the message out of what seemed like an artistically-written piece that made use of many unconventional phrases and secondary definitions of otherwise common wordsâ. The second reviewer came from quite a different angle â arguing that there was âsomething peculiarly paradoxical in [the paperâs] very conceptâ. We, the authors, were trying to set ourselves up as âexperimentally, experientially, and intellectually outside of the âblack boxâ â, but in actual fact, we were held captive by âthe tools of cognitive neuroscience, i.e., on a scientific apparatusâ. No matter the âdepth and authenticity of the joint collaborative exerciseâ for which we were advocating, we were pinioned by the inescapability and irreducibility of the scientific laboratory. For this reviewer, the point of âthis âfourth wayâ of neuro-engagementâ was far from clear. For the scientist, the rhetorical style in which the âartistically-writtenâ paper was written obviated the chance that its arguments would be received by those coming from different, scientific, traditions of research writing. For the second reviewer, whom we assume to be a social scientist or humanities scholar, it conceded far too much to the sciences. This is a fairly consistent refrain. And yet, in general the two of us, as well as many of our collaborators, have been quite successful at publishing significantly interdisciplinary papers in relatively high impact journals â a success that we attribute at least in part to such papers having a certain currency among editorial board members at some journals. We do not want to prejudge whether this enthusiasm is necessarily shared by the editorial board members of many mainstream neuroscience journals. And for the collaborating neuroscientist, being published in a high impact social science journal, which may have both a relatively long time from submission to date of publication, and a relatively low âimpact factorâ compared to even mid-ranking journals in some biological and medical fields, might represent poor return for her labour. (Letâs note at this point that while the 2014 impact factor of the leading journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience was 31.427, that of Social Science & Medicine (a very highly regarded social science journal) was 2.890.) There does appear to be a growing appetite among clinically-oriented journals for interdisciplinary research that crosses the life sciences, social sciences, and humanities. (e.g. The Hearing the Voice research team, of"

One of the problems is that the results are not well understood by their colleagues in marketing, research and product development. It is as if they operate in different worlds. LCA results do not really connect to what their internal clients want to know. This means many are seeking ways to drastically simplify results or translate them into guidelines. Getting the results out and understood is a problem, getting data in is another big problem. Often other departments are not really motivated to supply data. Getting access to data held by the purchasing department, for example, can be very difficult as they do not see the benefits. The general picture that emerges is that the LCA department finds it difficult to connect and to be relevant, while at the same time companies have committed themselves to improve the sustainability of products in a rational way.

378,237,0.991,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"least will not seem inevitable. The term âmindâ captures all of those less intellectual aspects of human existence, too: sense, meaning, soul, intention, or spirit. The seeds of imagination, belief, and argumentative ammunition for becoming a change agent have been planted. The emphasis in this book lies on exploring the transformational potentials of a Great Mindshift in mainstream economics for the agenda of sustainable development. Of course one could also open up the blind spots and contingencies in other dominant paradigms of the development agenda, like nationalism and sovereignty or human rights and individualistic justice systems. But none of these are built on ideas or âscientiï¬c conceptsâ that involve such a degree of flawed assumptions about the things to which they are applied: human-need satisfaction and natural resource governance. Sustainable development is about integrating social, environmental, and economic goals in the short and long term. So while the monetized numbers and mathematical equations appear to provide a high degree of scientiï¬c certainty and predictability, they do not say much about the trade-offs behind the costâbeneï¬t weighting that happened in the quantiï¬cation process. The models running predictions of growth, employment, productivity, and competitiveness are equally intransparent and based on the assumptions that nature and humans can be freely substituted and should move around in the correct amounts needed for efï¬cient markets. This is very unhelpful for informed decision-making. For democratic decision-making, it is a real problem. It means one can present computational graphs and numbers instead of having to make serious ethical and moral judgments explicit because they might be politically risky or detrimental for the justiï¬cation of oneâs privileges. Concepts such as utility, capital, market price, and growth are, as discussed, laden terms. Whether we like it or not they include many value judgments. Also, according to the mainstream economic theory, only more is better. Any idea of enough or sufï¬ciency necessarily translates into limiting and unsatisfying results. Any vision of arriving at steady-state equitable prosperity is ex ante excluded from the imaginary. This is at least ideological. When looking at the triple crisis in environment, social equity, and economic stability today it seems future-foreclosing. History is an open-ended process and the security-, justice-, and well-being-providing potentials of sufï¬ciency strategies become imperative for a world of nine billion, in particular with regard to future generations. They should not be qua theory excluded from the choice set of rational actors. Interestingly, some important economic thinkers like Mill (1806â1873) and Keynes (1883â1946) also had sufï¬ciency ideas for the scenario in which economic output growth led to a certain degree of material saturation. At levels of sufï¬cient supply, they reasoned, humans would work and produce at a constant level and efï¬ciency or technology improvements would lead to more time with family and friends, cultural events, education, recreation, and so on. These thinkers also always limited the realm of an economy, and therefore economics. Neither the governance framework nor the paradigm were foreseen to impact all of human existence and natural life."

315,418,0.991,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"we had planned. Taking the role of the narrator also provided the opportunity to show the material and let them comment on the photographs and the stories we had collected to complete the picture further. Recalling places, people, and memories provided a basis for asking about their perceptions of transnational spaces. The photographs helped the interviewees to remember stories and memories they had not told us before. For instance, the beach of Galicia (shown in Fig. 13.4) reminded the interviewee of the fact that he used to go there with his uncle and his cousin to search for crabs. Later, the aunt would cook them for dinner. As this story shows, the pictures and the accounts of the field trip in Spain helped to recall this imagined space that in migration research is called the transnational social space. Asking the interviewees how they perceived this space spared using the word or explaining the notion. Therefore, we drew a first sketch of Switzerland and Spain while talking about people here and there, about places visited, and about connections heard about. The drawing showed in a very simple way what we usually imagine when we talk about transnational social spaces: countries and places within, all connected through social networks. By drawing, we invited them to take a pen and draw their impression of how these connections and social formations could be conceptualized. The drawing (Fig. 13.5) shows the formation created by the transnational networks that link a family on various continents. In contrast to the geographical mapping we had sketched, the person who made this drawing completely changed the order of things. He placed the family in the core circle. Through their linkages, their practices such as calling, communicating through Skype, sending emails, visiting each other, or sending goods across the whole world to each other, they constituted an entity that holds together what is otherwise spatially disrupted. Because of modern communication and transportation technologiesâthey are symbolized by the time warp signs that connect instantly continents and countries as in a science fiction filmâthe distances become irrelevant.

186,37,0.991,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"In his request, Mandela asks the affluent and comfortable to respond to the cries of the poor and help provide food and shelter. It is unclear how dignity ï¬ts into this appeal. By referring to food, shelter and dignity together, he almost seems to suggest that the affluent could give dignity to the poor, just as they can give food and shelter. This ï¬ts neither of the dignity riddles. Dignity is then not an inviolable property of all human beings, which cannot be lost. If it were, it could not be given to the poor. Nor is it a property that human beings obtain through merit (Goethe), if it can be given by some to others, and if the only reason the givers are in the position to do so is that they are affluent. One could possibly venture that Mandela uses the term emotively here, in exhorting the affluent to assist the poor, but this is done at the expense of clarity. Likewise Johnson: had she said that extreme poverty was a violation of human rights, it would arguably have been a clearer claim than the claim that dignity is being violated. For instance, article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control (UN 1948)."

Each of the organizations also tackles the challenge of assessment. Balancing profit and mission is always a challenge for social enterprises. Ideally, most can tackle this challenge when first designing their business plans. Once beyond that, however, the balancing act continues. All three of these social enterprises, like many others in the field, must also contend with the twin challenges of measurement versus mission. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, businesses that try to âdo good and do wellâ create a laudable but challenging goal for themselves. It does take discipline and commitment to maintain that delicate balance, a task that can be made easier when progress toward each goal can be measured. With that in mind, the Western world has put serious effort into finding measurement systems that capture the impact of an enterprise in addition to its sustainability. Rise, the TPG fund, has partnered with Bridgespan to create a ârigorous set of metrics with which to measure performance.â11 In announcing the Ford Foundationâs commitment to provide US$1 billion to mission-related investments over the next ten years, the foundation stated that impact assessments have evolved sufficiently to warrant this type of investment.12 Asian organizations followed. The models from the West arenât ideal; they see mixed success, as it is difficult to develop frameworks on intangible benefits that can accrue. But some social enterprisesâ goods and services lend themselves more readily to impact assessment. Landwasher measures its success on how many toilets were set up and the tonnage of water that was saved by using its systems. Tree Planet measures how many trees and how many forests were planted as a result of its work. Educate Girls, a social enterprise offering fee-based educational opportunities for girls in Rajasthan, India, can measure the number of girls who received an education through its programs. All of these offer a product or service that had not been available previously. Their work, by definition, represents a net gain of services to the community. Measurement becomes trickier when there are confounding variables. For example, while Telapak can say that during the time it has been involved in a community, illegal logging decreased, it cannot claim clear causality. Telapak itself does not feel comfortable taking this credit. âWe donât want to be arrogant by telling people how much impact we have created to the community,â said Khusnul Zaini, Telapakâs president.13"
147,104,0.991,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"dIscussIon and conclusIon With the recognition that âopportunityâ is central to entrepreneurship and that opportunities are shrouded in uncertainty, a logical next step is to embrace the importance of understanding the implications of entrepreneurial failure. Entrepreneurial action and failure go hand in hand (given the high uncertainty), and we have only scratched the surface of this relationship. Whether exploring the actions of independent entrepreneurs in their newly founded (or emerging) organizations or those of corporate entrepreneurs in their innovative projects within established organizations, the nature of failure and its financial, social, emotional, and psychological implications likely have a critical impact on subsequent entrepreneurial action. However, despite its âcriticality,â we are just starting to gain an understanding of the complexity of the many interwoven relationships at play for these failure events. Although it is important to continue to explore main-effect unidirectional causal relationships, it will also be important to progress to multiple contingent/configurational mutually causal relationships of the antecedents and consequences of failure as the basis for a more dynamic micro-foundation theory of entrepreneurial action. That is, scholars need to overcome their anti-failure bias (McGrath, 1999) to better understand the decision making, cognitions, emotions, relationships, and behaviors of those involved in the entrepreneurial process. We believe that such research will help reconcile a number of paradoxes. A paradox involves âcontradictory yet inter-related elements that exist simultaneously and persist over timeâ (Smith & Lewis, 2011, p. 382). Being able to identify the underlying tension between two sets of relationships that seem to make sense when they are viewed individually but appear to be contradictory when viewed at the same time can lead to theorizing as an approach to resolving the paradox (Shepherd & Suddaby, 2017). Specifically, we can work toward the following: 1. Reconciling the perspective of âfail often and quicklyâ (e.g., real options reasoning [McGrath, 1999; McGrath & Nerkar, 2004] and design thinking [Brown, 2008; Brown & Wyatt, 2015]) with the perspective that failure âhurtsâ for those who directly experience it (Byrne & Shepherd, 2015; Shepherd, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2011). 2. Reconciling the perspective that failure is a badge of honor (e.g., Landier, 2004) with the perspective that failure can stigmatizeâput a denigrating stain or mark onâthose involved with the failure"

This takes us part way to finding the idea of âtrue in a caseâ inside of CIFOL+. Let us step back and think for a minute about âtrue in a case.â That phrase is special, partly because there is very little intuitive support for the phrase âtrue in a world,â even though one can be led by well-worked-out formal machinery to prize the idea. A substitute phrase, âtruth according to a worldâ seems marginally more idiomatic, although hardly an expression of conversational English. In contrast, âtrue in a caseâ is somewhat more idiomatic. I donât mean the truth of sentences, which isnât idiomatic at all, but rather certain informal âtrue thatâ expressions relativized to cases: â¢ Itâs true that we shall get wet in case it rains, but otherwise not. â¢ I shall be sad in case you find fault with my examples."
117,279,0.991,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Christian martyrs (Grk. martys = witness) testify divine truth not only through words but also through action which has to be seen (Drews and Schlie 2011, pp. 7â21). The multidisciplinary approach to witnessing shows its epistemological ambiguity: a witness is supposed to be the third, the neutral, the observing. But being the third does not mean not being involved and related. Being neutral does not mean not feeling or not experiencing or not reflecting and not acting. Being the observer does not mean only being made up of an eyed brain.2 Because it is situated and embodied witnessing involves trust. The integrative active part of participating cannot be separated from the seeing and observing presence in midwifery care. Even if the midwife seems to do nothing else than observing, she actually is intervening and interpreting. As witnessing is inter-relational, the midwife is enacted as a witness too. Eye-witnessing in midwifery care has a distant and alienating potential, because it might stem from or lead to womenâs bodily exposure. Women feel a separation with regard to their body then. Midwives witness and testify3 birth which can be perceived and influenced by midwives but âhappens toâ childbearing women and regarding which midwives have a certain professional knowledge and experience which the childbearing woman generally does not have. The childbearing woman for her part disposes of (medical, social, corporeal etc.) knowledge and experience, too. The witnessing role is socially and politically assigned to the midwife.4 This assignment is constantly renewed in interaction with women and families but also with colleagues, surroundings, and things. It is performative: Witnessing is established and maintained in and by acting. Legally speaking, midwives testify by doing paper work and documenting what they saw and did. Trust is conditional in the relationship between midwives and women. The midwife is usually met as a trustworthy person in regard to her competences, her confidentiality and her good intentions. Trust is not only anticipated by mothers-to-be but also established or reinforced in reaction to the required intimate exposure of themselves, especially during birth. Midwives are using technical aids such as the cardiotocograph (CTG) in order to produce testimonials. Technological testimonies function as"
28,197,0.991,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"We noted one phenomenon over and over again. An insensitive spouse, generally the husband, although he cared for his wife had failed to notice either her need for emotional support and encouragement or the growing sense of isolation within the home that stemmed from their lack.84 Domestic stress is still gendered, not through Bowlbian maternal deprivation but through a feminine lack of resilience, or a masculine lack of support. These gendered gaps affect Kesselâs way of framing and answering questions: âConfirmation was thus provided of the clinical impression derived from dealing with the patients, especially the women in the ward, that marital conflict is the chief aetiological factor in many casesâ.85 The practice of holding a clinical conference with PSWs at Ward 3 has been made a rule by February 1963.86 This co-operation brings in credible information, accessed by interview with somebody who is not a patient, opening up a space where Kesselâs casual clinical impression can gain empirical validation or confirmation. Thus, he is able to speak about domestic space through what is observed in a hospital ward. Once this clinical impression is confirmed, it can predominate, even to the point of overriding PSW input that helps to enable it: âThe psychiatric social worker, who had seen both partners, graded only half the marriages as poor or bad ... Perhaps, however, one has to be inside a marriage really to assess its satisfactions and its failuresâ.87 Visions of the home are created in these analyses, as part of the wider project that inscribes mental health and mental disorder onto the social, interpersonal fabric of everyday life. The unequally gendered archetype is tackled explicitly by Kessel, who disagrees that self-poisoning is âthe female counterpart of delinquency in young men ... [which] would suggest that women turn their aggression against themselves, while men act against societyâ.88 He argues, instead, that self-poisoning is better understood through emotional isolation and failure to adapt to domesticity. Through his rehearsal and rebuttal of a delinquency hypothesis, Kessel explicitly demonstrates a"
117,127,0.991,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"In line with this opinion, CÃ©cile Fabre argues that even though women in India often opt for surrogacy under non-ideal conditions (which should be improved), they live a âminimally flourishing lifeâ (Fabre 2006, p. 187), which ensures that they can decide freely and in accordance with life plans. Any notion of further concerns, for example the emotional distress of being pregnant and giving birth to a child for another couple, is something that has to be taken seriously, but is no reason to deny people the possibility of choosing surrogacy (Fabre 2006, p. 199). Indeed, Fabre even allows surrogates to keep the child because of emotional ties; however, from her standpoint this is a question of âvalid, but voidable contractsâ (Fabre 2006, pp. 186â218). The eventuality of emotional bonding does not constitute a reason to doubt the correctness of the surrogacy contracts themselves. Even though some studies show empirical evidence that bonding between mother and child during pregnancy does not necessarily occur (Robbins and Eaves 2013), the question remains whether the possibility of bonding and the consequential potential harm to the surrogate is a real challenge for the practice of surrogacy. These doubts are dismissed by Fabre: âwe cannot and will not ever be able to live in a risk-free society, particularly one free of the emotional risks attendant on parenthood. Nor, in fact, should we aspire to do soâ (Fabre 2006, p. 218). Other authors who also do not condemn contract surrogacy in general, but are rather concerned with gender inequality in the practice of surrogacy, mention the need to take care of âthe most economically and emotionally vulnerable party in any such arrangementâ (Satz 2010, p. 132), that is the surrogate, and thus demand an improvement in the conditions of surrogates in the global south. This may include, for instance, making third-party brokerage of pregnancy contracts illegal,"
99,15,0.991,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"ic method, but simultaneously characterised by an indeterminate quality that makes it adaptable to a variety of situations and flexible enough to follow the twists and turns of policy, that everyday politics sometimes make necessaryâ (European Commission 2013, p. 16). Indeed, it has achieved the status of a buzzword in national and European policy circles. US President Obama established no less than two offices for social innovation. The EU has used the term to fund several initiatives, including the research project upon which this book is based. It is then little wonder that the meaning has diluted, sometimes referring to anything that is considered new and that is not technical. Although as an academic concept, it is less wide-ranging, there still remains a broad range of interpretations. Some posit simply that it must constitute a new approach to a particular kind of problem. The Stanford Centre for Social Innovation, for example, describes it as âthe process of inventing, securing support for, and implementing novel solutions to social needs and problemsâ (Phillis et al. 2008, p. 34). This is a conveniently flexible interpretation, yet one could argue that, according to this definition, there is little that does not qualify as a social innovation. Other scholars are more specific in circumscribing the nature of innovation. For example, the SOCIAL POLIS project defined it as âthe satisfaction of alienated human needs through the transformation of social relations: transformations which âimproveâ the governance systems that guide and regulate the allocation of goods and services meant to satisfy those needs, and which establish new governance structures and organizations (discussion forums, political decision-making systems, etc.)â (Moulaert 2010, 2013). This implies not only that an innovation must be radical (transformative), but also that it changes the power structure within the system where it is introduced. The problem with this kind of definition is less with its normative character, but with its essentialist nature. It is true that innovations are about new ideas and purposes deriving from established paths and patterns getting practical; however, it must be likewise considered that they are about processes and ways of development under conditions and in contexts where interaction is not determined and foreseeable ex ante. Innovatory effects of a new product, strategy or service can be path breaking to different degrees. Thinking this way it becomes clear that what is needed is a concept of social innovation as a complex societal process, rather than a mere classificatory definition of an action or product. For the purposes of the WILCO project, we defined social innovation as both products and processes; ideas translated into practical approaches; new in the context where they appear. It was important for us to use such a definition, rather than a more specific one, because one cannot clearly predict what comes out of even a very promising innovation in the course of its development. The problem with defining social innovation resides less in âinnovationâ and much more in the meaning one attributes to âsocialâ. Studying the current literature on conceptualising and defining social innovations, one finds that âsocialâ is mainly equated with âimprovementâ (Phillis 2008), finding better answers to basic needs and more satisfying social relations (Moulaert 2010), and a range of other âgood thingsâ. One way of challenging such an interpretation of âsocialâ has been proposed by Johnson in his essay asking âWhere good ideas come fromâ (2010). He argues that there are four different environments that create new ideas, processes and things:"
124,531,0.991,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"This seems straightforward, but we have not yet found the real structure that we need. To get at this, consider a STIT choice situation with the same two states, but now only one equivalence class [w1 ] = [w2 ] = {w1 , w2 }. Now the agent only has one choice c. We cannot label the two transitions by c now, since that gives a PDL model with the same event, and it is unclear how this would fit the scenario. Here the difficulty is not that we cannot label the transitions: We can introduce different events for them, say e and f . In fact, this makes sense even in STIT, since histories consist of events, and as we said earlier, if two histories are different, this is because different events take place on them. But this still does not address the matter of the choice structure, and crucially related to this: how we interpret the branching in our PDL model.8 What emerges here is an ambiguity in the usual talk about PDL models. In particular, what do branchings mean? Sometimes, people talk as if these are conscious choices a process or an agent can make, sometimes as if they are variations that cannot be predicted. What we need to distinguish the two senses is precisely the notion provided by STIT, that of control. In our first scenario, the two labels c1 and c2 , when added to events, divide them into two control equivalence classes. In the second scenario, adding the label c to both e and f indicates how the events belong to the same control class. The agent cannot choose between the events."

Some of the challenges encountered in the SVP have been fully addressed by other projects, such as the management of traineesâ expectations of per diem payments. We also have more sympathy, as you might expect, with the need for DFID ministers to communicate clearly with the UK public. This necessitates a simpliï¬cation of messages, with some implications for evaluation. This is amply balanced in our experience, with an appetite for nuance and learning at DFID. The case studies in Chapter 5 are to be savoured. Based on the notion that youâve got to fail in order to learn â an idea, incidentally, highly valued by THET as well â they provide a wonderfully detailed and valuable portrait of the challenges encountered by practitioners on the ground. This book pulls no punches, and with a style both academic and personal the authors challenge us all to put our collective shoulder to the wheel to develop a more structured approach to professional volunteer deployment within health partnerships based on principles of negotiated conditionality. This is to be not only applauded but also acted upon for, as the book quite rightly argues, this way leads towards evidence-based incremental systems change. The wide-ranging critique of aid, based on the authorsâ years of experience of managing programmes of work in Uganda, covers a great deal of ground examining the nature of development interventions, ethical standards in volunteer deployment as well as the efï¬cacy of donations or the meaningfulness of prevailing evaluation methodologies. It also has a lot to say about the tough issues faced on the ground by health professionals working in development, such as corruption and labour substitution. The challenges thrown down by this book, based on ï¬rst-hand experience, are vital in helping us understand better the nature of the solutions. As we join together to co-create a better world I warmly welcome this bookâs important contribution. Tropical Health and Education Trust Ben Simms Chief Executive"
334,331,0.991,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Another point brought up by this case study â one that is closely connected to current debates within the Alliance â regards the meaning of success in antideportation protests. Success in preventing the actual act of removal is both the motivation for, and goal of, collective actions against deportation. However, from a deportability perspective, practices that break isolation, reverse public invisibility, and (to a lesser extent) reduce private visibility go beyond a narrow understanding of success: Rendering deportations, persons in a state of deportability, and antideportation protests visible, can be a powerful means of contentious politics when changes in the (political) opportunity structures make it more difficult to prevent the enforcement of deportations. Finally, the deportability perspective that we have developed in this article brings to the fore the importance of questions of citizenship that are negotiated in contestations over deportation. Despite the lack of a formal status or recognition, people without secure residence status become â(activist) citizensâ (Isin 2008) through dissonant speech acts. They thus call âinto question the givenness of [the] body politic and open its boundaries wideâ (Isin 2009, 384), or, in the words of Sandro Mezzadra (2004), they bring citizenship âinto motionâ. In OsnabrÃ¼ck these dissonant speech acts were part of a process in which people with different legal status, and from different groups of society became active as a community, thus creating new political subjectivities and understandings of belonging. This dynamic is captured in Wazirâs speech after the successful prevention of his deportation, in which he not only thanked the members of the Alliance, but made clear that he saw the action most of all as part of a common struggle for a society where everybody enjoys the right to have rights: Good morning! Thank you all so much for coming here today â« ÚºÛÛ Ú©ÛØ§ Ø¨Ø³ ÙÛâ¬We belong together. Thereâs our fight for residence, our rights and the life of the human beings.

82,21,0.991,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"three that are of especial interest are the Mode of Infinite Regress, the Mode of Hypothesis, and the Mode of Circularity or Reciprocation. Here is how Sextus explains them: In the mode deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another source, which itself needs another, and so on ad infinitum, so that we have no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement follows. . . . We have the mode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back ad infinitum, begin from something which they do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish the other, we suspend judgement about both.3"

I do not propose this precise model, with the speciï¬c researcher characteristics or âstandardsâ listed above, as the one that the European research community should adopt; rather, I present it as indicative of the kind of yardstick of researcher excellence that could be formulated and promoted. The detail of the content must be discussed and agreed, so that as many stakeholders as possible will have ownership of it. This could be done at European level, with the aim of agreeing a model of the characteristics of excellent European researchers generally, or it could be speciï¬c to disciplines, or to national contexts, or even to institutions. Yet it is also important to present developing researchers with both ends of the yardstick against which they should be evaluating their own practice, indicating not only standards of practice that are considered to represent, but also those considered to fall far short of, excellence. The latter help elucidate the former and encourage introspection on the part of the researcher."
282,3,0.991,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"Preface This book is about public policy partnerships and their accountability and its theme derives from my work for the Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi). At the institute, we have been following, analysing and debating the rise of public policy partnerships and their implications for global governance over many years. Time and again, we returned to questions of accountability. What effects do partnerships have on existing accountability relationships? How can partnerships themselves be held accountable? Answering these questions seemed central to any debate relating to partnerships, yet difficult since the necessary concepts were not sufficiently developed. Within the context of my doctoral dissertation, submitted to the University of Erfurt in late 2007 under the title âDefining Accountability Standards for Public Policy Partnershipsâ, I therefore set out to develop a concept and model of accountability that would help us understand, assess and guide the development of partnerships. Since partnerships include public, business and civil society actors and are active in very different areas, I quickly found myself building a generally applicable accountability model. I hope that the thoughts developed in this book will be helpful for those working with partnerships and of interest for those thinking about accountability. Naming all individuals who supported me during the research and writing phases or provided critical inputs would be impossible. My special thanks go first and foremost to Prof. Dr. Dietmar Herz, my supervisor, as well as Prof. Dr. Frank Ettrich, who acted as secondary supervisor. I would also like to thank Martin Sprott, Bernd SiebenhÃ¼ner, Angelika Steets, Andreas BlÃ¤tte, Thorsten Benner, Jan Martin Witte and Jenny Scharrer for their critical and supportive feedback and Kristina Thomsen for her support in revising and adapting the manuscript.

118,735,0.991,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"What the author discussed in the previous sections can be interpreted as a case of this phenomenon. Historically speaking, Science and Technology Studies (STS), Sociology of Science and Technology and History of Science and Technology have critically examined such mechanism motivated by the improvement of political legitimacy and the democratization of science and technology. In other word, they have problematized this issue for the sake of the other members of society, not for engineers. However, the author would like to argue that this situation is critically problematic not only for the rest of society, but also for engineers themselves at the same time, when we think about the future of (nuclear) engineering in society. Achievement of engineering is not limited to improvement of technology. Innovation of technology should also be, or sometimes more, important and exciting for engineers. Of course, improvement also requires substantial innovation in many cases. But, what is really admired by their colleagues and âclientsâ is the epoch-making breakthrough that provides brand-new options for society. This kind of innovation is sometimes not a direct evolution of preceding technology and its appraisal. Christensen sheds new light on mechanism of innovation by examining many cases of âdisruptive innovationsâ in his famous book The Innovatorâs Dilemma [12]. He emphasizes the importance to be free from stereotypical, conservative mindsets that prevent such breakthrough. It should be noted that experts tend to be possessed by conventional appraisal standard of technical merits. Sonyâs engineers could not change their goal for the best portable audio player from its sound quality, battery life and compact body to something another. Their productâthe Walkmanâhad monopolized the market in the past, but their"
117,118,0.991,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"care, caring for a patient involves, first of all, caring for individual wellbeing insofar as this can be seen as a prerequisite of individual will-formation and its intersubjective, dialogical structure. These constituents of well-being may, to a large degree, be common to all humans. Health, for example, can be understood as a prerequisite of this kind. Yet if one ultimately learns that the kind of life that the patient will be able to have after successful treatment does not correspond to what the patient thinks of as valuable and meaningful, even if all medical and social supportive measures are in place, hermeneutic care entails refraining from attempts to override this decision, since hermeneutic care is not bound to a supposed objectively given state of well-being but aims at enabling and sustaining autonomous decision-making. If such a decision in a borderline case turns against its own prerequisites, this is disturbing, but ultimately, if supporting measures do not change the decision, it bears witness to what autonomous human reflection is capable of, namely neglecting itself."

However, it has been argued that this assumption is quite insufficient as a background for a satisfactory model fit for dealing with the logic of tenses in natural language. The Thin Red Line is supposed to help, but perhaps it does not. Nuel Belnap and Mitchell Green have given a very nice example in support of this criticism of a âThin Red Lineâ theory: The coin will come up heads. It is possible, though that it will come up tails, and then later it will come up tails again (though at this moment it could come up heads), and then, inevitably, still later it will come up tails yet again (Belnap and Green 1994, p. 379)."

In oneâs dealings with other humans, it does not matter whether one is a woman from rural Nigeria and another a male from the capital of Sweden, with extraordinarily different life purposes. What matters is that the moral decision can be universalised across all human beings. For instance, since rational nature is an end in itself, in other words an entity with absolute inner worth, it is universalisable to prohibit the murder of humans. âDo not killâ is therefore a universalisable moral precept. A woman from rural Nigeria cannot be stoned to death if she has committed adultery, and a man from Stockholm cannot be killed even if his liver would save the life of the pope. This leads to powerful demands, eloquently formulated by Allen Wood: The demand that we treat every human being with equal dignity would challenge most ideas, in most cultures, about how people ought to regard one another. â¦ Human dignity is in this way very dangerous in that it threatens to undermine all traditional ways of life in all cultures.

In each stage we followed the same methodology, that is: we identiï¬ed a set of practices to study, we designed a questionnaire to survey practicesâ usage and we ran the survey in a conference organized by the agile community. In each stage we extended the number of practices under study and based on that we updated the questionnaire to include new questions and also the feedback obtained in the previous stage. We focused our study on core agile practices. To identify those practices, we considered 4 main sources: the agile manifesto [21], the book Agile! by Bertrand Meyer [1], the work of Alistair Cockburn [22] and our own experience. Alistair Cockburn is one of the authors of the agile manifesto and is very involved in the agile community. On the other hand, Meyer is a well-known academic and engineer with an extensive experience far beyond agile. We consider this mix of sources a good balance in order to develop an objective analysis. In Stage 1 we selected six practices: Continuous Integration, Frequent Release, Iterative Process, Retrospectives, Test Automation and Test-Driven Development. In Stage 2 we extended the list of practices to eight by adding: Coding Standards and Self-Organization. Finally, in Stage 3 we extended the list to ten practices: we added PairProgramming, Emergent Design and we removed Coding Standards because we consider it to be a very common practice nowadays even beyond agile contexts and we added Collective Ownership, which we consider a more signiï¬cant practice and more aligned with agile principles like shared responsibility and self-organization."

Baby journals have always had an element of quantitative tracking: it is common to include dated notes about achievements (first smile, first steps), weight and height charts and even information about which teeth came in on which date. But Sprout Baby encourages even more detailed tracking, letting parents track each feeding, each nappy change and each nap. Sprout Baby also prompts parents to add photos of milestones: First Smile, Found His Hands and Feet, Laughed Out Loud and so on. The iPad version of the app generates a newspaper style layout of all the latest journal notes, photos and numbers under the title (for a baby named Jack) âJack Todayâ in a newspaper-style headline font. Personal data, notes and photos are combined with standard advice to parents with babies of this age, for instance as shown in the demonstration screenshots in the iTunes store: âBaby and household chores can add up.

Technological filters allow us to express ourselves in certain ways but not in others. We can apply certain filters to an image we post to Instagram but not others. We can post animated gifs to Tumblr or Reddit but not to Facebook, although this may change. With Photoshop or programming skills and a self-hosted website of course we can express ourselves in other ways, but most of us do not have these resources and simply choose between different available filters. Twitter filters out long form writing, requiring us to limit ourselves to 140 characters at a time.

Reï¬ecting upon the past years, can you point out one of the biggest âAha!â moments that you have had? I think it is different for each stage when you are part of growing an ecosystem. I have been here for five and half years now. There are different things that happen throughout that time, and there are different things that matter, depending on the stage that we were in. The first âAha!â moment was that this little idea of having a physical space would be good for the community. The âAha!â moment was, âHoly crap, weâre oversubscribed by 2,000 people and, yeah, it worked.â The insight was thisâthat, yes, actual face time with people is important, even for technologists! I had a conversation with Eric Schmidt of Google on his visit a couple years back. We were sitting downstairs grabbing lunch at Peteâs, and I mentioned the numbers we were seeing and the success rates of those companies being around 10 to 15 % for their first year. He responded that in Silicon Valley, the numbers are much, much higher, but the success rates are even lowerâmeaning that we should expect to put out many more companies if we want to see a few succeed at a very large level. This was the âAha!â moment tied to the need to generate more start-ups. It is a numbers game. So how do we help get more things started? We understand many will fail and that is fine. But the more we get out there, the better. It is like if you want the real, sort of bigger investors to come off the sidelines and jump into the system for more start-ups to scale, then we need at least one of them to exit at maybe USD20 million in order to prove to people that there is something here. That is what the ecosystem is figuring out right now. For the iHub, the âAha!â moment came as we realized that we did not have to charge our members if we come up with a service model that allows us to charge for other services, such as consulting. That is why we built the iHub Research arm, the UX Lab, and iHub Consulting. These"

But at the same time, the creative event of acting insists on the porosity of his skin; it must be torn open ecstatically, become permeable. In the limelight of the stage, with no cloak of invisibility at hand, ânakedâ â no script in hand, no rostrum to hide behind, without the shield of scientific neutrality and with the pressure of performative quality â the traditional masterâslave relationship of corporeality and intellect is instantly reversed.17 The play can no longer be delivered from the spirits it has called. The body has been turned on; it surges, begins to duplicate itself â and there is no wise sorcerer in sight. He has vanished from the story. The body can only throw its own weight around; the body itself matters and acts on its own authority.18 Usually a slave, a lowly apprentice, the body now takes over the controls. It has no shame and it has low standards. For example, it may act like a lump of clay. No matter how nicely it is talked to, despite all the cajoling, it may remain clumsy and wooden. Suddenly, novice actors have not two, but four arms and legs. What do I do with my hands? Everything becomes a problem. Theyâre suddenly dangling so weirdly like they donât belong to me, alien. Just standing there without immediately putting his hands into his pockets â a favorite gesture of male novice actors â just standing there without looking like he has been bolted to the ground and without bolting, going to stand somewhere else because he just cannot bear it and feels like he has to do something; just standing can become the most difficult of tasks. It may sound hackneyed, but to be on stage, exposed to the eyes of others, and to âbelievablyâ act some daily task naturally, not cramped, not stiff, without clichÃ©s â simply but focused â is a higher art than is commonly believed. Actors experience the paradoxical phenomenon that a dominant will, the usual instrument of autonomous action, is counterproductive to engaging acting. The will gets in the way, literally. It initiates a process of self-observation that censors breathing and imagination. It is the critic who gives grades, the superego that appraises, argues, judges, and passes out sentences. Blocks are preprogrammed, innocence lost. At the same time, the actor depends upon his will. He needs it. Without it he cannot 17 On the transvaluation of the ideal bodyâmind relationship in Nietzscheâs philosophy, see Volker Gerhardt, âDie âgroÃe Vernunftâ des Leibes.

78,44,0.991,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"4. Though we cannot deny that this attempt has yielded unprecedented results, we must also acknowledge that at some point the processed information must be reintegrated in what Stiegler (pace Husserl) has called our own primary retention (individual memory), to acquire meaning and to be part of our lifeworld (Stiegler 2013). 5. It is important, then, to note that the computational era is rooted in the most extreme type of dichotomous thinking: that of constructing discrete, machine readable bits. To be human, here, means to remember that life is continuous and plural and experienced rather than calculated. 6. The second problem with a dichotomy is that it assumes jointly exhaustive alternatives, which entails that the pairs forming the dichotomy cover all there is to be said about whatever they aim to describe. In his pivotal âThe duality of risk assessmentâ, Ciborra (2004) has elucidated how the hidden presumption that e.g. a risk analysis exhaustively describes a developing reality endangers the resilience of whoever depends on that analysis to remain safe. 7. Smart Grids, policing, medical treatment or the food industry should never assume that the data derivatives that inform their risk analyses cover all that is relevant. To prevent the kind of havoc that plagues our financial system we must instead keep an open mind, assuming that the computational decision systems that feed such critical infrastructure are as biased and fallible as any smart system necessarily must be. To be human, here, means to admit such fallibility as core to the wondrous fragility of life. 8. An interesting example of a dichotomy that confuses instead of clarifies what it means to be human in the computational era, is the dualism that pervades the domain of the philosophy of mind. The cartesian idea of a separate res extensa and a separate res cogitans that together describe reality has given rise to a series of interrelated problems that still haunt much of our understanding of e.g. responsibility and accountability in a world of distributed causation. To overcome the confusion that results from this kind of dualism I believe that we should not merely turn to overlapping instead of mutually exclusive dual pairs, but take leave of the idea that reality should necessarily be described in pairs altogether. 9. Whether it makes sense to think in pairs or in other types of distinctions should depend on the context and the aim of our thinking, not on a propensity to keep things simple. I would, therefore, rearticulate the heading and speak of: Beyond dualities. Long live plurality.

Second, the initial innovations in Silicon Valley focused on âsiliconâ based ideas. It was used in the production of electronic components and microcircuits. Some of the companies involved were Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory and Fairchild Semiconductor, from whom Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, among others, were spawned. These innovations were taking place in the Santa Clara Valley in San Francisco. It is these innovators who âdeveloped a culture of openly denying the hierarchical culture of traditional corporations. People remained faithful to each other, but not to the employer or the industry.â5 This is Silicon Valley. We need to recognize this, because nowhere in Africa is silicon itself being used to innovate through production. Africans are joining this innovation space during the digitalâand, more correctly, the mobileâ era. So âdigitalâ is a better description of African innovation at this time. Also, though âsavannahâ is used to depict an African landscape, it is not an African word. It comes from a Native American community for the grassland prairies they inhabited.6 Should we not be using the name that Africans themselves gave their grasslands?âNyika! This renamingââDigital Nyikaââeven though a seemingly small change, is an exercise that forces us to look at the African innovation space without biases. We can then learn from other innovative spaces around the world, copy what is necessary, build what infrastructure we need, and innovate for Africa first. Only then can uniquely African knowledge and financial investment grow in an environment that is in itself unique. Third, it should be noted that most of the tech solutions that have come out of Africa and ventured onto the international stage had a local problem at their core. That is all well and good.

During the effective coping skills phase, children learn to identify, regulate and appropriately express their emotions, and learn productive coping strategies for dealing with stress and anxiety in order to reduce their anxiety and to prepare them to manage to share the details of their abusive experiences. An essential part of the treatment is to help the child to understand and express their feelings. Some children lack the ability to regulate their feelings. The treatment is based on cognitive behavioural therapy, and the therapist tries to clear the connection between the childâs thoughts, feelings and behaviour. Many children initially blame themselves for the abuse and may explain that it all happened because of their own behaviour. Such beliefs will be clarified later in treatment, together with the parents, and the parents can then take responsibility for acting wrongly. Considering the childâs age and maturity, activities such as games, role-play and tools can be used as part of the therapy. While safety is integral to every phase of CPC-CBT, the family safety planning phase focuses specifically on having family members develop and implement a safety plan that involves using the skills learned to date, in order to enhance the safety of all family members. The treatment starts with giving the child space and time to describe the specific occasion that led to the police report or the report to the child welfare service. This episode can be very frightening, and children may need to repeatedly talk it over, to explain what they have experienced and how their parents behaved. Children need to be reassured that they did not do anything that made them deserve to be hit or abused. The final phase of therapy, the abuse clarification phase, involves the child developing a trauma narrative. This occurs after there is evidence in parent and child reports that the physical abuse has stopped and that positive parentâchild interactions have increased. The therapist encourages the child to share a narrative about their specific experiences of abuse. The child will describe the situation, how they thought and felt. In this process, some children draw pictures or cartoons; other will play in sand or use dolls or character cards. The child and therapist will try to write the narrative down together and read it aloud to"
82,49,0.991,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"Do we have a finite mind? This is not so clear. We have finite brains, and minds supervene on brains, but does that mean that our mind is finite? What exactly does it mean to have a finite mind? That we cannot have an infinite number of beliefs? But how to count? Moreover, even if we have a finite mind in the sense that our beliefs are finite and therefore countable, this does not prevent us from saying many cogent things about infinities â how is that possible? The routine manner in which epistemologists have rejected infinite justificatory chains is reminiscent of the customary ways in which infinite causal chains have been cast aside. Again, Aristotle appears to have played a major roÌle here. His familiar arguments against infinite causal chains in his Physics and Metaphysics became a well-entrenched part of the philosophical canon. Yet Aquinas and other mediaeval scholars had already pointed out that Aristotleâs arguments may be more restricted than they appear: not every causal regress seems to be vicious, it all depends on what is meant by âcausal connectionâ. So let us take a closer look at Aristotleâs objection to causal regresses and the criticism thereof by the mediaeval schoolmen. This might help us to see why exactly it is that justificatory regresses have been rejected without much ado, and to assess whether such a hasty rejection is appropriate. In Chapter 8, in the final section, we will discuss causal chains in a more modern setting, namely that of causal graphs. Aristotleâs main argument against a causal regress is that it purports to explain a phenomenon, but in fact fails to do so. Suppose an event, an object, or a process A is explained by saying that it is caused by B, and B is causally explained by pointing to C, and so on. If this series were to go on indefinitely, it would remain unclear why A occurred in the first place. The only way to explain the occurrence of A is to refer to a principal or first cause, i.e. something that causes all the other elements in the series, but is itself uncaused. Aristotle stresses that his argument is not confined to a particular kind of causation, but applies to any of the four different causes that he distinguishes, i.e. material, efficient, final or formal: Evidently there is a first principle, and the causes of things are neither an infinite series nor infinitely various in kind. For, on the one hand, one thing cannot proceed from another, as from matter, ad infinitum . . . nor on the other hand 32 Fumerton 2001, 7.

There should also always be a justification, which can be brief if it is relatively obvious, of why certain sources need to be kept anonymous. As Shih proposes, scholars of authoritarianism could also be more explicit about the other ways in which research has been tailored to meet constraints imposed by the regime, making it clear, for instance, that in undertaking a survey, we might âask proxy questions that are highly correlated with the sensitive questionsâ (Shih 2015, 20â21).

299,29,0.991,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"members of one community or another, consider good behavior and we gently chastise them, it helps curbing such behavior. The same holds even on the international level. Nations hate to be criticized about the ways they deal with their citizens or with those of other nations, although there are sharp limits to how far they are willing to change their policies in order for these policies to be regarded as morally appropriate. Given the limited leverage moral voices have on the international level, I argue that we have to carefully select the targets of our moral voice. Chastising one regime after the other, for great and not so great violations of what we consider right, squanders whatever effect our moral voice can have. We need moral triage (see Chap. 11). Part V examines a few key ethical issues raised on the international level. The first centers on the American response to extremism in the Muslim world and asks how policymakers might better craft their messaging. Thus far, voices emanating from the USA have emphasized liberal values, like individual rights, democracy, and free markets, to counter religious extremist rhetoric. I argue that in doing so, we fail to recognize that while most of the Muslim world is not violent, the majority is also not liberal. They are believers who want to see religion play a greater role in public lifeâI call them âilliberal moderatesââand since they pose as central figures in the fight against violent extremism, we need to speak to them, I claim, on their terms (see Chap. 12). Part V then turns to the issues of mass atrocities and genocide. I followed these closely ever since a mutual friend introduced me to Samantha Power (who later became US ambassador to the UN during much of the Obama administration), as she was jogging on the banks of the Charles River. When she learned my name, she said with a broad smile, âI hate you!â It turned out that she was a journalist covering the brutal ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, calling in her story under fire to The Economist. She was told that her story had to be cut short to make room for a three-page story about communitarian ideas I was championing and which were, at the time, popular with Tony Blair and Bill Clinton. I soon read her Pulitzer Prize-winning volume A Problem from Hell in which she documents the history of Americaâs failure to respond to genocide and crimes against humanity. Bill Clinton, who did stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, stated that his biggest regret is that he did not in Rwanda (Hughes 2014). Indeed, more and more nations agreed that it was legitimate for foreign powers to interfere in the international affairs of nations if genocide took place. Part V examines how this moral consensus was abused and why the USA did so littleâdespite Powerâs urgingâto stop the civil war in Syria, the genocide in South Sudan, and the civil war in Libya. It is one of the great ethical questions of the ageâ as these atrocities continue (see Chap. 13). Senator John McCain made a compelling case for keeping the promotion of human rights as a core element of US foreign policy, but does not address the fact that while this goal is noble, the means may be foul. There is a vast moral and prudential difference between promoting human rights with nonlethal means (such as public diplomacy, leadership training, cultural exchanges, and even smart sanc-"
395,52,0.991,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"around what they believe to be an accurate and serious recognition of the problems and expertise that these entail. This has coincided with the development of specialised management processes focusing on the signiï¬cant technical and legal facets of these matters, and the use of specialists (in psychosocial risks, industrial risks, etc.); in other words, with the professionalization of workplace health and safety, in the sense that this issue is seen as one that should no longer be left to amateurs, but entrusted to people with expert knowledge, specialists in the ï¬eld. However, there is nothing immediate, technical or neutral about the tackling of work-related issues. This activity is a social construct, equally reflecting the dynamics of the way these questions are constructed as relating to problems that the actors or a sufï¬cient number of them agree to recognise as real, institutional dynamics that encourage the management of these issues and guide the ways they are tackled, and the dynamics of the production of responses (legal texts, negotiated agreements, instrumentsâ¦). These responses themselves reflect professional dynamics: how professional groups address these questions and participate in the formulation of the problems and the development of the solutions, or indeed claim to be those most capable of implementing those solutions. For all these reasons, the term professionalization seems applicable, but its use is not straightforward. Its meaning varies considerably from one country to another. The social construction of what are called instituted professions, in the strongest sense of the term, follows different trajectories, with the result that the same activities are not always fully recognised as the attributes of a profession (Wilensky 1964; Neal and Morgan 2000). However, the question here is whether all the actions required to foster health and safety at work must necessarily entail specialist knowledge and the techniques specialists may propose, as experts external to the work activities concerned, or whether instead, one should resist granting excessive autonomy to this knowledge and these techniques. With regard to the position argued in this chapter, the more concrete issue is the potential tension between specialists who claim to be ofï¬cial professionals in this domain and the middle managers who could assert their own standing as professionals with regards to the working challenges of their staff. If the term professionalization has its uses in this regard, it is because it can cover a multiplicity of meanings, even in a given country and language. It can have at least three deï¬nitions, all of which show that this professional status is less a matter of fact than the result of efforts to obtain recognition for a distinct status: successful for some groups, unsuccessful for others, even though they all seek for such a recognition. Professionalization can thus be deï¬ned as: â¢ establishment of a professional group, with its own territory (a jurisdiction), access to which is conï¬ned to its members. These members possess prerogatives based on peer-validated expertise; the specialists we are concerned with here probably do not possess all the attributes of a profession, but lay claim to scientiï¬c ethics and knowledge in order to persuade others to recognise such a status;"
271,487,0.991,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"The ânatural settingâ in which television viewing takes place has diversified over the past decades. Given the many ways in which television is consumed nowadays, considering one show in one medium through one type of methodological approach gives a limited perspective on social life, and can therefore only serve to consider one specific aspect of the lifeworlds of individuals. Of course there have been methodological developments which have in some way or other answered David Morleyâs call for a more nuanced style of research. One such example is the volume put forward by Berker et al. (2006). Relating to and building on the domestication approach, the collection takes a wider view of the home and the interrelation between media and technologies in the home. They focus on âthe continuity of routines and patterns of everyday life, but also consider the breaking of routines and the discontinuity of some processesâ (Berker et al. 2006: 3). If we apply the figurational approach to Angâs study, we might ask how Dallas relates to other media consumed and appropriated, who the different actors in the family home are, how they relate to a particular programme and how they communicate with each other and with other actors about the programme, a specific episode, and the specific themes it raises. In the current state of deep mediatization, these questions should be broadened to take into account other mediated interactions that take place in relation to the viewing of a programme. If we identify the media ensembles and communication practices of different actors within a"
360,193,0.991,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"Our hypotheses for the study related to the idea that apparent vagueness in the category boundaries can be attributed to a lack of a clear context for the classiï¬cation. We therefore had three main conditions in which we provided different contexts for the categorization. The ï¬rst was a Neutral control condition which simply asked âConsider each of the following items and decide whether they belong in the category of _____â. A second condition, the Pragmatic condition, asked people to categorize items in categories âwhere people would expect to ï¬nd them, so that they could be easily foundâ. Scenarios included an internet news group, a mail-order catalogue and a library index. Here we hoped to reduce vagueness because everyone would be attempting to mirror the behaviour of everyone else in the group. The third condition, the Technical condition, provided a set of contexts much like the case of Bridge and Sport described above. People were asked to imagine that they were advising a government agency controlling tax regimes (for Tools and Furniture), ecological reports (for Insects and Fish) or funding agencies (for Science and Sport). They were told that the classiï¬cation would have important consequences and so they should try to classify âcorrectlyâ. Participants worked through each list classifying items as Yes or No, and returned after 3â4 weeks to do the task again in the same condition as before. Our prediction was that if lack of categorization context was contributing to vagueness, then various measures of vagueness would be reduced in the Technical and Pragmatic conditions. There should be better inter-subject agreement on classiï¬cation, more stability in categorization decisions over time, a reduced correlation of categorization probability with simple ratings of Typicality, and a shift in the size of the categories, with Technical conditions yielding smaller categories. In the event, none of these predictions was generally supported by the data. Effectively categorization probability in all conditions was correlated at around 0.95 (the limit of measurement reliability) with judgments of item typicality in the category. A second study showed that requiring people to read the instructions aloud and reflect on them before starting to categorize had no effect on the results. There was no easily accessible âdeeperâ meaning for people to describe if asked to take the task more seriously. Finally, we looked at whether people would be less likely to give a âpartialâ or graded response in the Technical condition. In this last study, people were given a graded categorization scale to use running from not at all through barely, sort of and very much, to completely. If people felt that a category has a clear deï¬nition (even if they are uncertain what it is), then we expected them to be disinclined to use a partial rating such as âsort ofâ or âvery muchâ, and to stick to the two extreme responsesâânot at allâ or âcompletelyâ. In the event our manipulation of context had no effect on this measure either. In the light of these results, it would appear that instability and disagreement in categorization is not exclusively driven by a lack of speciï¬city in the context. Whether simply classifying, trying to capture common categorization practices, or yet advising a technical committee on the correct way to classify, people rely on the same underlying conceptual representation and this is best described in terms of a typicality gradient."
163,191,0.991,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"Balance ouTsTanding Participating in svart arbete involves keeping imagined accounts with the state and other people in the community. Buying or providing services svart stabilizes a perceived deficit back in favour of the taxpayer. Exchanges of svart arbete can be made in terms of reciprocal relations when the state is perceived not to have supplied its fair shareâwhat it should have provided as a collector of its citizensâ money. Throughout is the underlying notion of reciprocity as maintaining a balance of sorts; purchasing svart, valuing a service and agreeing on compensation. Viewing svart arbete through the spheres of community and state also highlights the tensions between the private and the public, the strong community and what services a responsible state ought to provide for its citizens, which type of exchanges ought to be subject for tax assessment and which should be left out. As purchaser and provider in an exchange can view the transaction differently (Slater 2002: 240), so can their views on the balance of relations differ. This book calls us to take reciprocity seriously, and using ethnographic examples from Sweden I argue that the same type of expectations that exist between exchangers resides within the relationship that citizens as taxpayers have towards the state. Although exchanges between inhabitants and state are vast even from a daily perspective, impossible to quantify or account for, and immensely complicated in a welfare state, there is an abiding sense of a reciprocal relationship. From a residentâs perspective, reciprocal expectations indeed have an impact on the assumptions of what society should provide. I am thus using reciprocity to look at how balancing is aimed forâa perceived equitable standingâin citizensâ everyday exchanges and in how the state can find legitimate ways to tax them. Buying svart can thus be seen as a response to a feeling of having contributed too much to the state. The tax level is used by many as a justification; it is said to be too high or too all-encompassing. There were many justifications such as âI pay more than other Swedes doâ, with the implication that the âothersâ are seen to provide less than they should. From this perspective, buying svart is a means of evening out other citizensâ negligence in contributing fairly to the state. âAnd if they cheat, I am stupid if I do not do the same.â This balancing is a model for how giving and taking, in relation to the state and towards othersâ contributions, ought to work. There are a number of ways in which a balance in dealings with the state can be maintained; contributions are looking at the taxpaying sideâ"
242,1143,0.991,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","For the research team that has been involved in studying Nicaraguan migrants in Costa Rica, various challenges have come up in the attempt to intervene in policy formulation, the critique of imaginaries, and community work. The first one refers to the ethical dimension, and relates to the responsibility that follows from listening. In other words, listening does not just involve attentively following what the migrants are saying, but it also involves raising questions about the ways in which what was said could be translated to decision-makers. Here there seems to be an important challenge for the social sciences, since needs assessments are frequent, and most often agree in their main conclusions, but there is usually no great willingness to follow up on the demands that are identified. A second challenge consists of the possibilities of creating work teams in which colleagues with different backgrounds can contribute to the research work and the ways in which the main findings can influence public policies, but also to the political work in a broader sense. The demands posed by the communities recall the tensions that arise from the relations between those social science perspectives most centred on analytical or comprehensive perspectives and those most interested in normative perspectives. Such tensions become more alive when what they are dealing with is not so much reproducing the analytical/normative distinction, but linking and articulating findings and policy-making (or politics) based on concrete situations and cases."
60,60,0.991,Research on Teaching and Learning Probability,"2.6.2 Effective Ways to Train Teachers Another line of research is designing and evaluating suitable and effective tasks that help in increasing the probabilistic and didactic knowledge of teachers. Some researchers describe different experiences directed towards achieving this goal. Teachers should engage with and analyse probability simulations and investigations. Simulations and experiments are recommended when working with students. To be able to use investigations in their own classrooms, teachers need competencies with this approach to teaching. When the time available for educating teachers is scarce, one possibility is to give teachers first a project or investigation to work with and, when finished, carry out a didactical analysis of the project. This type of analysis can help to simultaneously increase the teachersâ mathematical and pedagogical knowledge (Batanero et al. 2004). Teachers should engage with case discussions. Groth and Xu (2011) used case discussion among a group of teachers as a valuable strategy to educate teachers. The authors indicated that in teaching stochastics teachers navigate between two layers of uncertainty. On the one hand, uncertainty is part of stochastic knowledge; on the other hand, in any classroom uncertainty appears as a result of the dynamic interactions amongst teacher, students, and the topic being taught. Discussions among the teachers may help them to increase their knowledge since experiences with general pedagogy, mathematical content, and content-specific pedagogy can be offered and debated. Teachers also need experience planning and analysing a lesson. When teachers plan and then analyse a lesson devised to teach some content they develop their probabilistic and professional knowledge (Chick and Pierce 2008). Teachers need to understand the probability they teach to their students. One strategy is to have teachers play the role of a learner and afterwards analyse what they learnt. If they have the chance to go through a lesson as a learner and at the same time look at it from the point a view of a teacher, they may understand better how the lesson will unfold later in the classroom. Teachers should have extensive experience working with technology. We can also capitalise on technology as a tool-builder for teachers gaining a conceptual"

To be emotional and open, to do housework and take care of oneâs children are not seen as unmasculine, but rather as desired qualities in men. Stian says that he is ânot afraid to cryâ. Most of them have female friends whom they give credit for having taught them to become better at âopening upâ and talking about feelings. For most of the working-class men at 18, relational talk still tends to be more of a girlsâ thing, whereas the middle-class men demonstrate a much higher interest in interpersonal relationships and psychological aspects than the majority of their fathers did, their grandfathers notwithstanding. But in contrast to the women, who reflect more on their relationships with others and who have a more ironic view of themselves, the psychological perspective of the men is, as in the middle generation, often centred on their own personal development and taken very seriously. Trond, for instance, tells us at 18 that âfinding yourself â¦ I feel like Iâm constantly developing. I think itâs very healthy, I think itâs very healthy always to develop, even if it can be very tiring and very hard always to consider yourselfâ. Still, gender is more present in the menâs self-reflections and the absence of masculinity appears to be more of a threat to them than the absence of femininity in women is to themâor to the women themselves.

Mechanisms must be in place to enforce and monitor adherence to co-presence and respond accordingly to breaches of this principle. Individual volunteers and host locations are required to sign up to this commitment. In practice, the long history of breach of conditionality principles in Aid (Moyo 2009) has encouraged a tendency to ignore such principles without reprisal. As such, co-presence takes a long time to embed within a programme and every new volunteer will be faced with the expectation that they will go on rotas and engage directly in service delivery. As noted above many professional volunteers, especially doctors, will be tempted to ignore the commitment to co-presence, especially if they interpret this as a challenge to their primary commitment to individual patient care (for a discussion see Ackers et al. 2016). This underlines the need to impress on every volunteer that they are one member of a complex intervention and must comply with project objectives and principles; managing volunteers in this way demands an investment in infrastructure both in the UK and on the ground. Volunteer induction is a critical component of the âvolunteer journeyâ."

308,215,0.991,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Beneï¬cence connotes acts of mercy, kindness, and charity. It includes all forms of action intended to beneï¬t or promote the good of other persons. The principle of beneï¬cence refers to a normative statement of moral obligation to act for the beneï¬t of others, helping them to further important legitimate interests, often by preventing or removing possible harms. As we have mentioned in the previous chapter on nonmaleï¬cence both are interconnected. Preventing harm and removing harm (or evil) are both considered a type of beneï¬cence. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ordered his companions to do charity daily. They said: Who can do that? He said: Removing a thorny bush, or bones or dirt from the way (street) is a charity; showing the right path for those lost is a charity, enjoining right and forbidding wrong is a charity; helping those who are inefï¬cient in their work is a charity.â One of the companions said, âWhat if I didnât do any of these?â He said, âAt least do no harm to others.â Narrated by AlBokhari, Muslim and Ibn Hibban [1]. Doing Harm and Reciprocating Harm is Not Allowed [2]. The Qurâan and the Tradition are full of passages and sayings of the Prophet enjoining good and refraining from doing harm. We will quote here a few ayas of the Qurâan: (1) Have you seen the one who denies the religion (hereafter)? That is the one who drives away harshly the orphan. And does not encourage the feeding of the poor. So woe to those who pray, (but) who are heedless of their prayers. Those who made show of their deeds and withheld their assistance to their neighbors (Holy Qurâan 107/1-7). (2) Woe to every scorner and mocker. Who collects wealth and (continuously) counts it. He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal. No. He will surely be thrown into the crusher (Hellï¬re which crushes their bones) (Holy Qurâan 104/1-4). (3) Whoever does an atomâs weight of good will see it and, whoever does an atomâs weight of evil will see it (Holy Qurâan 99/7, 8). (4) And they were not commanded except to worship Allah; (being) sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and give zakat (obligatory alms giving) and that is the correct religion (Holy Qurâan 98/5). (5) Did he not ï¬nd you (O Muhammad) an orphan and gave you refuge? And He found you poor and made (you) self-sufï¬cient. So for the orphan do not oppress him and for the petitioner do not repel him (Holy Qurâan 93/6-10). (6) And the righteous one will avoid it (hellï¬re). He who gives his wealth (to the needy) to purify himself. And not giving in return for favor but only seeking the countenance of His Lord, Most High (Sura alLayl 92/17-20).

This has come about purely as a result of the pragmatic arrangements that need to be in place to administer a system as complex as this with any degree of parity and efficiency at all. However a relatively individualistic model such as this also promotes exclusivity, and a by-product may be the development of elites (Swan 1996), as we have seen in the tendency to filter certain types of student out at upper secondary level. This filtering process has its own complexities. The broadly configured European Baccalaureate that students sit at age 18 has been designed around an essentially Francophone model (hence the name) with some aspects of the German Abitur system embedded within it, and it is a long way from the British A Level examination, which focuses more on early specialisation and choice. The system is very much an academic one, and does not usefully provide for vocational streams (Marjoram and Williams 1977), although there does seem to have been a single attempt at this. Existing technical and vocational provision is very limited and dates from 1969. It includes: (Group 1) geometric drawing, notions of technology, handicraft; (Group 2) accounting and commercial arithmetic, typewriting, shorthand and commercial correspondence; (Group 3) child care, domestic science and art. These represent short non-academic courses and while still permissible under the regulations, do not seem to be offered any longer in European schools, leaving no vocational programmes at all. Children who donât fit with this elite academic model are regarded as having what Goffman (1963) might describe as a âspoiled identityâ in which they are effectively rejected by the mainstream, leaving to seek an education elsewhere. We see therefore that citizenship issues are highly complex within the European School System, and yet it is this that is the primary indicator that such schools are needed. Students are in effect a form of temporary migrant, and in transit throughout different EU member states in a way that is difficult to accommodate at a national level (Olsen 2000). Therefore the original founders were correct in understanding that there would be a continuing need for the European schools. However the identity formation of students, and to the same extent teachers, is more often than not a European schoolsâ identity rather than an essentially European one. It would be wrong to make the assumption that just"
49,50,0.991,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"1 Introduction Intelligent robots as commonly depicted in science fiction are able to interact with their environment, with people and to perform various human like actions. Often it seems that we are only one step away from building such machines. However, despite of a long research in the field it is not the case. We may be able to build highly sophisticated robotic bodies or, theoretically, a complex intelligent system controlling the actions of a robot but so far we have failed to make the robot perform some tasks we people consider very basic. For example, our robots cannot see as we do. We did not build a robust, multipurpose system giving a robot the ability to visually recognize objects in its environment - yet. Humans (indeed many animals) do it easily thanks to their highly developed brains. Learning what the environment consists of is the first step in the development of an intelligent behavior. Jeff Hawkins has explained a memory-prediction theory of brain function in 2004 [1]. This theory was among the first that provided unified a unified basis for thinking about the adaptive control of complex behavior and it is in the"
2,172,0.991,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"Decreasing ChoiceâA Paradox From the discussion above, it follows that there are different mechanisms for reaching overall goals through the use of marketisation. These mechanisms have been referred to in terms of user choice and governing through contracts. Whether the mechanisms are compatible or not has been a topic of lively discussion. One issue that has received a signiï¬cant amount of attention is the idea that marketisation actually creates a market of different providers with their own special proï¬les. It has been argued that customers actually have less choice and receive fewer individualised services than beforeâa condition that has been referred to as the âdecrease of choice despite the rhetoric of freedom of choiceâ (Dahl and Rasmussen 2012, 41). To understand this argument, we will return to the practice of governing through contracts, which requires the codiï¬cation of care. Without this, it would be difï¬cult or nearly impossible to both write and evaluate contracts. By codiï¬cation of care, we mean the speciï¬cation of the time devoted to and the coding of the performance of various tasks. Completing such codiï¬ed tasks is facilitated by the use of modern technology in home care services; for example, personal digital assistants. The overall result of this process, according to Hanne Dahl and Bente Rasmussen, is a growing standardisation of care (Dahl and Rasmussen 2012). Standardisation of care represents a paradox in relation to arguments concerning the âwelfare mixâ and âcustomer choiceâ. This paradox has been clearly described by Dahl and Rasmussen, who argued that, contrary to what one would expect of marketised welfare, âcustomers have less choice and receive fewer individualised services than they did in the old model where they were allotted time rather than tasksâ (Dahl and Rasmussen 2012, 41). In the old model, the professionals, i.e. care"

Our material world is developing into an active and intelligent counterpart, rather than a mute, stable and functional environment. At the same time, our own access to the world is rapidly changing. With the advent of technologies like Google Glass, the phenomenon of âaugmented realityâ is rapidly gaining influence. Google Glass consists of a pair of small, transparent monitors and a camera. The device provides an extra layer of information about the people, objects and images one sees. It has the potential to recognize the faces of people you meet, and provide all information available about them instantaneouslyâwithout these people noticing this. It makes it possible to send and receive messages, than can be composed with eye movements, voice input, or touch. This will enable people to communicate with each other in new ways, again without other people noticing it. If this type of augmentations becomes widespread, this will have enormous implications for virtually all dimensions of society. Educational processes will need to be reinvented, when all information is available to anybody all the time. The boundaries between the public and the private will need to be drawn again, when a quick glance at somebodyâs face reveals all their activities on the internet. Security policy, privacy legislation, commercial activitiesâit is hard to imagine a sphere of society that will not be affected by the advent of augmented realities. Our lives get increasingly interwoven with online realitiesâwe get âonlifeâ, as the contributors to this book have come to call it. New information technologies, in sum, put us potentially at the dawn of a new era. While many people are focusing on the biotechnological revolution, and the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science, companies like Google and Philips are redesigning the world. How to understand these changes? And how to evaluate them?"
360,161,0.991,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"As various writers in the past have claimed, the former is âinertâ and âis a mere congeriesâ, whereas the latter actually âdoes somethingâ in making an assertion that describes a feature of Kim. Note that a structurally identical puzzle arises if âWordâ is replaced by âConceptâ and âMy assertionâ is replaced by âMy judgmentâ. Both Objectivists and Subjectivists are subject to this puzzle, and they both should give some sort of answer. However, Subjectivists seem not to have thought of a difference between the noun-phrase conceptual combination {SANDY; SWIM } and the sentential conceptual combination {SANDY IS SWIMMING}. Nor has it seemed to occur to them that in order to give a concept-analysis of some noun phrase like a man who is tall, there needs to be a sentential analysis of the embedded relative clause (as well as an analysis of the contribution of âaâ, as mentioned above in Sect. 8.1.2). This puzzle is at least as old as Plato, and has provoked considerable discussion over the centuries. One type of answer might be to postulate a copula-like intermediary, call it âexemplificationâ, with the idea that it is this intermediary that causes the other items to merge into a full sentence. But as one can pretty easily see, this just leads to some sort of infinite regress: for, now there needs to be a further explanation of how it is that âKimâ (or the person corresponding to that name) can combine with this newly postulated object to then be able to combine with ârunsâ (or the object corresponding to that predicate). This is known as Bradleyâs Regress, or The Unity of the Proposition/Sentence problem. Objectivists have proposed various answers to the Unity problem, one of the most popular being some variant on the metaphor of saturated/unsaturated from Frege (1892a). The idea is that singular terms are such that they are designed to designate âindependentâ or âsaturatedâ objects, whereas predicate terms are designed to designate âunfilledâ or âunsaturatedâ items, namely âconceptsâ. (Recall that for Frege and the Objectivists, a concept is a non-mental, abstract entity.) When these two different kinds of entities âmeetâ, the saturated object âfills inâ the unsaturated object, producing a new, saturated objectâa complete sentence (which expresses a âthoughtâ, in Fregean terminology. . . where âthoughtâ is also understood as a non-mental, abstract item). Well, whatever one thinks of such metaphorical accounts (and something akin to this is adopted in Formal Semanticsâ model-theoretic theories), it is at least some sort of explanation, showing that there might be some wiggle room in Objectivist theories that would provide an appropriate description of what is going on. However, it seems that Subjectivist accounts are not in such a good place, at least not if they hold that lexical concepts designate mental items like concepts. For it seems that this would presume there to be a concept of INSTANTIATIONâsort of a mental version of the linguistic exemplification, and now it appears that the Bradley regress can start. Subjectivists of the sort we have been considering will respond by claiming that conceptual combination is how they handle this topic. But it should be noted that conceptual combination in these works is defined for noun-noun and adjective-noun combinations (perhaps also for adverb-verb combinations?). But this wonât work for sentence generation: perhaps the conceptual combination of DOG and"

Referring to the platform Innocentive.com, where more than 200,000 ââproblem solversââ are registered, it is obvious that not every single member submits input for every single challenge. Due to the size of the group, however, there is a very great likelihood that a lot of valuable ideas will be put forward. Technically speaking, it is possible that every participant could take part in every challenge, but this is not true of all the platforms mentioned here. Nevertheless, Innocentive.com provides an opportunity of thinking ââoutside the boxââ because it allows the participants to name not only their own field of knowledge but also their field of personal interest. It is accordingly possible to generate new ways of solving complex problems. It seems obvious that either communication and interaction within a community or the building of new communities is of interest: the submitted ideas are frequently hidden. It is possible that lots of companies are not as ââopenââ as open innovation suggests, but perhaps concealing ideas is not that absurd after all: these open innovation challenges do not interact with the masses like many other common crowdsourcing projects do. Many crowdsourcing platforms that work in the field of open innovation provide an opportunity for organizing challenges for closed groups or pre-existing communities whose members are either invited, belong to the company or other associated communities that are then sworn to secrecy. As shown above, scientists can choose between diverse platforms if they want to participate in open innovation. Usually you can register with detailed profiles. In"
134,111,0.991,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"Selection The European Schools System is meant to be comprehensive, which resembles the English system of secondary school, but incorporates some aspects of the French and German systems, such as a broad curriculum throughout, with only limited subject selection. Another characteristic of the European Schools System is the use of retention, where a student is kept down a year if he or she is seen as not meeting the usual standards of the existing year cohort. Educationally speaking, this type of intervention is unlikely to be effective and can even be seen as a problem (cf. Hattie 2008; Martinez et al. 2015). In the case of the European Schools, some children who donât fit with the system are held back for multiple years and eventually encouraged to leave the European schooling system altogether if matters arenât resolved. As far as students are concerned, retention may simply be a consequence of being in the wrong European school or language section at the wrong time, something that has little if anything to do with innate student ability. This is clearly evident within retention rates, which differ considerably across the different schools and countries. For example, if we examine the retention data for the primary sector (P1âP6), for 2010 to 2012 (the latest available literature freely available to the authors), we see that it is 0.1% to 1.2% in Culham, UK, where this is not regarded as a common educational practice, and the highest is 3.1% to 3.9% in Luxembourg 1, and 2.5% to 5.3% in Mol, examples of where retention may be more closely aligned to prior teacher expectations. Mean rates were 2.2% to 2.7% across all European Schools P1âP6 for this period. As the rates differ so much, to the sociologistâs eye, it seems less likely to be caused by student unsuitability, and more likely to be a consequence of regional cultural practices and expectations. The practice of retention can have negative consequences. Sociologically speaking, retention with the year group below may well bring with it a potential sense of anomie (alienation) on the grounds that one doesnât fit. In this way, the European schoolsâ upper secondary triaging of students into an âin-groupâ (who can cope with the work) and an âout-groupâ (who canât cope with the work) amounts to clear evidence of social selection, with unintended outcomes when students leave for academic"

And when we say âmediaâ we simply mean the presentational arts as they get to be distributed in the world. And in all these arts and media, the processes of designing and detailing are the same.

For the men, modern gender equality is fundamentally at odds with their own life project as it makes their own form of masculinityâand the sacrifices that came with itâworthless. It also makes their idealised stay-at-home wives the targets of critique. They are occupied with the crumbling moral order in many areas and trace this decay back to the material greed of modern times, where people expect to get everything in their lap without having to work for it. As we have seen, their critique of modern times is epitomised by their worry about the increasing prevalence of divorces. However, these old men are also aware that things have changed since they established their own families. Some of them help their wives more in the household now after they have they retired, and think this is fair but not easy to learn at such a late age.5 Their investment in the gender complementary model is much stronger than the womenâs and they strive to reconcile this with the new times. Behind their worry for young mothers today we discern compassion with their own hardworking mothers, whereas the discontent of the women of their own generation seems to have gone more or less unnoticed. Martin, who idealised the female homemaker in his own marriage, says: Now itâs more even. Man and wife are more on the same footing. Often they both work. My daughter-in-lawâand then he has to help with various things at home. Before they got married too. Inside as well, when she is at work and comes home at 16.30. And they have two children. So itâs much more even now. It wasnât like that back then. The wife didnât work, outside the home. Thereâs probably more of that today, but it could result in the wife being more overworked when she both has a salaried job and has to keep the home. Q: Yes, because she is still responsible for the home? Yes, you never get away from that, that equality that the husband does the same things, looking after the children or those things. And we are probably not Statistics from 1988 onwards indicate a clear rise in positive attitudes to equal sharing of housework and childcare in all cohorts. For instance, the percentage of the cohort born 1931â1934 who thought housework should be shared equally rose from 38 per cent in 1988 to 52 per cent in 2008 (Hansen and Slagsvold 2012: Table 6.2)."
211,298,0.991,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"following entrepreneurial project failure, attempt to see their mistakes as part of the human condition in an organizational environment, remind themselves that there are many employees in their own and other organizations who feel dejected in the case of project failure, and remember that everyone goes through challenging situations (adapted from Neff 2003b). Without connecting to others in this way, people can feel isolated, lessening informal learning and information access as well as decreasing their ability to initiate action (Martinko and Gardner 1982). When employees have higher common humanity, they do not stay connected to the failure of the entrepreneurial project because they have forgiven themselves for any mistakes they contributed to the failure and have also forgiven other project team members who may have been blamed for the failure (Shepherd and Cardon 2009). In turn, this forgiveness deactivates the defensive mechanisms that obstruct learning. Mindfulness and Learning from Project Failure Mindful organizational members keep emotions caused by entrepreneurial project failure in check, handle emotions regarding project failure with curiosity and open-mindedness, and maintain a balanced understanding of the failure event by keeping things in perspective (adapted from Neff 2003b). Employees who are less mindful tend to be strongly influenced by personal feelings (Neff 2003a: 88). For instance, when a person concentrates on an entrepreneurial project failure, his or her focus can move away from the failure itself to the negative emotional experiences stemming from the event, thus increasing his or her negative emotions (NolenHoeksema 1991). We are not suggesting that mindful organizational members do not show emotional reactions to entrepreneurial project failures. Instead, mindful individuals can place these emotions in a larger context and see the significance of these emotions with a broader perspective (Neff 2003a: 89; Teasdale et al. 2000). Because this larger context is unlikely to jeopardize individualsâ self-esteem, there are likely few ego-protective obstacles to learning. It appears that mindfulness helps people end the cycle of self-absorption as well as escape ruminations. For instance, Shapiro et al. (2005) showed that an intervention over eight weeks, which was based on mindfulness and aimed at reducing stress, effectively improved health-care professionalsâ self-compassion and decreased their stress. In the organizational context, mindfulness helps in reducing the significance of the negative"

In many cases, those who have acquired a university degree may receive some criticism from family members who see it as a waste of time to study after a degree if not to be used for work for some companies. In facing such dilemma, the respondents would turn to others who are experiencing similar situations within their offline and online communities for support. These supports may be in the form of motivation and encouragement from the communities for them to continue with their decision to work while staying at home and be successful with their choice.

In March 2012 Forster was trying to isolate ribonucleic acid (RNA)âthe genetic blueprint for proteins within the cellâwithin mouse cells. To prepare the cells for her experiment she mixed them with a special gel that provided them with all the nutrients to grow and proliferate, even outside the body, for a short period of time.

245,614,0.991,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"1 The Problems of Deï¬ning Student Engagement Student engagement has come to be seen as a âgood thingâ in higher education for researchers and policy makers alike. For example, the 2011 UK Higher Education White Paper âStudents at the Heart of the Systemâ (BIS 2011) emphasises student engagement as a key element of the development of learning communities in higher education. However, as Geven and Attard (2012) noted in relation to âstudent-centred learningâ, the fact that it would be very difï¬cult to be against student engagement is testament to its vagueness. The vagueness around student engagement means that it is currently used to refer to student engagement in learning activities, in the development of curricula, in quality assurance processes, and in institutional governance (for example see Coates and McCormick 2014; Kuh 2009; Trowler 2010). These many different meanings of student engagement have led some researchers to be very critical of its use as a term, with some arguing that it is used uncritically (Zepke 2014) and others arguing that its use is âchaoticâ, with its very vagueness doing important work to mask inequalities by those who use it (Trowler 2014). What is interesting about these criticisms is that âstudent engagementâ was initially a term used by researchers, which has later been adopted by policy makers as it appears to do useful work. The question at the heart of this chapter is whether the vagueness and confusion around the use of student engagement can be addressed in a way that helps us to ask P.

Ideas and practices of childhood and ideas and practices of migrancy are not ï¬xed but moving relatively to each other and to other parts of their environments, and this dynamic movement creates and changes the patterns that connect. Although I still do not understand everything Bateson writes, he has certainly contributed strongly to shaping the way I think. His writings have also guided me through some of the more recent, related theories such as critical realism and complexity theory, both of which provide an alternative to conventional social theoretical perspectives (e.g. Morin 2008; Potter and LÃ³pez 2001; Walby 2007). These theorists regard social phenomena as interconnected systems rather than as structures versus agencyâwhatâs more, they argue that social systems are always open, which means that parts of one system will always be interacting with parts of other systems (Danermark et al. 2002; Sayer 2010; Smith 1998). I also ï¬nd relevant their emphasis on the historical embeddedness and âpath dependencyâ of agency, so evident in the variety of ideas and practices of childhood worldwide as well as within national and local communities. So many practices and choices are simply not conceivable in other contexts. For instance, look at Adaâs chapter on âprotectingâ Roma children in Norwayâalthough the Roma do experience and respond to control and oppression in many other national settings, these play out in other, particular ways for particular historical reasons. Adaptation strategies that have worked well in the past may no longer give the intended results, because the present is always different and always changing. Critical realism as well as complexity and dynamic systems theories provide ways of thinking about society that dissolve the structure-agency dichotomy, replacing it with an approach foregrounding the dynamics of practice and process, as immanent in individuals as well as in larger social entities. The issue of whether social phenomena and events should be understood primarily in terms of structure, or primarily in terms of individual agency constitutes an ongoing challenge to the social sciences. While existing literature has tended to favour structural explanations at the expense of agency, or the other way around, I am much more interested in exploring how structure and agency interplay with each other and with power processes. âPureâ structure and âpureâ agency are theoretical constructs that have little resonance with empirical research. If you focus on processes and systems, questions about where structure ends and agency begins just seem like a dead endâ at least to me, they do. Is it not more interesting to explore identity processes as processes, rather than trying to pinpoint whether a young person is part of one or the other static social structure through individual choices? If we regard Czech, or Danish, or Norwegian, or any national society as open and dynamic systems, and the individuals as smaller open systems adapting to and thereby also changing the larger systems, to me that comes much closer to understanding what identity processes are all about. It also shows how influence and power are multi-directional. Even when relationships are clearly power asymmetrical, such as in all the chapters in this book, people donât just sit there and let things happen. Thatâs not how people are and thatâs not how power works."

I see these considerations conï¬rmed, when looking into Larry Roseâs second text, published eleven years into his diagnosis. In this narrative, frequent typos witness disease progression. The same is true for his emphasis on signiï¬cance rather than temporal sequence in chapters that reï¬ect short attention span, as they hardly extend over more than two to three pages. Notably, Larryâs Way has always only been available as printon-demand â as are several other patient narratives I am referring to in this discussion. This fact tellingly discloses the publisherâs concern that the storyâs lack of coherence would not make it a big seller, and it conï¬rms that coherent narration contributes to the construction of a societally more valued self, on a personal and public level.20 Nevertheless, some texts perform the condition-enforced limits of expression, particularly in more advanced stages of the illness, while still serving the patientâs agenda. Yet, I believe that such choices strongly rely on the ï¬rst dementia patients, who stepped out of the shadow, to assert themselves in the public eye.

Such public involvements also can infuse public values into technology development discussions and are essential for a healthy democracy (e.g., Rip & Robinson, 2013; Wilsdon & Willis, 2004). Public engagement with science can increase the public understanding, appreciation, and opportunity to argue for or against acceptance of emerging science and technology advances (e.g., Gastil, 2017). There is, therefore, great hope for the value of public engagement. In contrast to the great hope for engagement, there is a dearth of science about engagement. As we have argued previously (PytlikZillig & Tomkins, 2011), simply deploying listening sessions or other types of engagement with the public may not suffice: It is essential to ascertain what is a successful engagement, what works to ensure successful engagements, in what contexts, and why. As noted in Chap. 1, and as underscored by our own unwillingness to offer a hard-and-fast definition, the concept of âpublic engagementâ itself is ill-defined. Currently, public engagement encompasses everything from opinion surveys to information campaigns, to interactive museum exhibits, to citizen science, to voting behavior, and to deliberative discussion. The definition of âpublicâ is also broad and wide ranging. Consider, for example, that public engagement through deliberation can involve dialogues among or between peers, policymakers, technologists, scientists, and many other stakeholders. Furthermore, engagement methods and terminology used to describe those methods within studies of public engagement are widely varied; numerous dimensions of public engagement have been proposed without much consensus on which dimensions are most important to future research agendas; potential differences and opportunities for engaging marginalized populations for the most part have not been the target of theory or extended empirical focus (but see Young, 2002); and current categories of public engagement effectiveness criteria do not easily lend themselves to suggesting theories that would advance understanding of how various forms of public engagement work for different purposes and aims. Given all these challenges, whatever is an aspiring public engagement researcher to do? Our work provides but one example of an approach forward. For our research, we functionally operationalized our engagements as deliberations about a target (learning about and assessing nanotechnology/synthetic biology) using accessible and appropriately thorough written materials as part of a class to inform studentsâ decisionmaking as part of specifically designed tasks (see Chap. 2). We hope in the future much of what we need to know about public engagements we will know because experimental methods and valid assessments reveal what works to ensure engagements are successful according to clear criteria, under what circumstances, and why. We hope that a science of public engagement will answer questions that go beyond our current data, such as whether, when, and why: Face-to-face encounters are or are not preferable to online engagements. Written materials are or are not a more effective way of providing background information than a brief video. Engagement discussions are or are not more productive in small groups than in town hall formats. Bringing people together in the real, versus the virtual, world enhances certain outcomes and so on."

Because we did not interview them about their pregnancies and motherhood, it is mainly their reaction to menstruation that we have information about. In the oldest generation it is seen as a female curse, something mothers and daughters are equally subjected to. But since it is not talked about, this does not lead to any closeness between mothers and daughtersâit is the silent and unwelcome sign of womanhood. In the middle generation the menstruating female body is also felt as a negative thing, but is taken more as a fact of life and even something that may contribute to some intimacy between girls. This may be surprising when seen in connection with the negative relationships to their mothers; however, it may also tell us about the basic care that these devalued mothers actually provided for their daughters, in addition to the decreasing taboo that came with more information about sexual reproduction. It is actually the youngest generation that reacts the most strongly against menstruation,"

From listening to their words as reported by adults, it has become apparent that dying children veered through diverse emotions, from fear and anxiety, to joy and excitement. The cause of these conflicting feelings was the doctrine of salvation and its polarising outcomes of eternal happiness and eternal doom. By investigating joyful feelings, as well as the more distressing ones, this study has sought to offer a more balanced picture of the emotional culture of early modern Protestantism than is usually offered.87 Nonetheless, it has also been suggested that we try not to distinguish too rigidly between ânegativeâ and âpositiveâ feelings, since these categories fail to accommodate the complexity of contemporary attitudes to such emotions."

For Tom, the empty, flat, formless Fens symbolise his version of vacant reality, âand no one needs telling that the land in that part of the world is flat. Flat, with an unrelieved and monotonous flatnessâ (2). The dykes, sluices and channels that give the Fens their provisional shape represent history, the stories and âthings made to happenâ with which that reality is filled. Just as the land which is reclaimed appears firm and solid, so do the âfragile islandsâ (341) built out of the formlessness of reality give the appearance of solidity, truth and actuality. Initially the novel distinguishes between two means by which chaotic, formless reality is filled, or reclaimed. The first is embodied in the languorous, âphlegmaticâ Cricks who, âborn in the middle of that flatness, fixed in it, glued to it even by the mud in which it aboundsâ, outwit reality by telling stories: âand thereâs no saying what meanings, myths, manias we wonât imbibe in order to convince ourselves that reality is not an empty vesselâ (41). Stories, told by both his mother and father as well as read in books, infuse Tomâs childhood: âmade-up stories, true stories; soothing stories, warning stories; stories with a moral or with no point at all; believable stories and unbelievable stories; stories which were neither one thing nor the otherâ (2). Since Waterland is an assemblage comprising history and fiction, and makes no uncomplicated distinction between these categories, historical narratives are included as story-telling possibilities here. Indeed history-teacher Tom becomes the most prominent embodiment of this method for outwitting reality. The second means of filling an empty reality is embodied in the âsanguineâ Atkinsons, Crickâs maternal ancestors, who, being from the hills of Norfolk, look down and âsee in these level Fens â this nothinglandscape â an Idea, a drawing-board for plansâ (17), the opportunity to make things happen: and thereâs no saying what consequences we wonât risk, what reactions to our actions, what repercussions, what brick towers built to be knocked down, what chasings of our own tails, what chaos we wonât assent to in order to assure ourselves that, none the less, things are happening.

If we wanted the value of the upper_bound() we could dereference it; to ï¬gure out its location, we use the distance() function. â¢ Small note: if we want this function to be as fast as findInterval() in R (which uses handwritten C code), we need to compute the calls to .begin() and .end() once and save the results. This is easy, but it distracts from this example so it has been omitted. Making this change yields a function thatâs slightly faster than Râs findInterval() function, but is about 1/10 of the code. Itâs generally better to use algorithms from the STL than hand rolled loops. In Eï¬ective STL, Scott Meyers gives three reasons: eï¬ciency, correctness, and maintainability.

360,443,0.991,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"substances and these accidents or features are seen to inhere in the substance. This contrasts markedly from most modern views, in which concepts consist of properties. That is, the concept is made of or just is the set of properties. Thus, the properties are more basic than the concept, which has several interesting consequences. One is that if this general view were true, one would expect that categorization would be a matter of identifying the properties of a thing and then using those properties to determine whether this thing is in the category. Indeed, as a general description, this is basically how categorization is understood in most modern theories. However, this implies that the properties should be identiï¬ed prior to the category. Thus, before one grasps that the thing they are looking at is a bird, they should already have grasped that they are seeing a beak and feathers and wings, etc. Note that it is not that they are seeing visual information that can be interpreted in these ways, but literally that they are grasping those conceptual features. A second implication of this approach is that there should be a clear and simple linkage from the extraction of simple visual features to simple conceptual features to the concept. In short, we should have no discontinuity between research on object recognition and research on concepts and categorization. Yet, research on object recognition rarely uses conceptual features, while research on concepts and categorization assumes conceptual features and rarely even posits the exact connection to the simple visual (or, for that matter, other sensory) features. Finally, it is important to understand that the A-T view of concepts and properties is embedded within a very complicated and intricate understanding of not only the mind, but of the physical world. Thus, for example, the A-T way of thinking about essences, properties, and concepts derives not from what is convenient for philosophy of mind, but from prior metaphysical commitments about the physical world and how the mind is seen to function (fairly reliably) as a part of that world. That is to say, the A-T approach to accounting for physical change through terms like actuality/potentiality and form/matter serves as the basis for A-T cognitive theory, and this cognitive theory is, in turn, a further speciï¬cation of those basic metaphysical commitments. An immediate and obvious beneï¬t of this approach, say advocates of A-T cognitive theory, is that it is completely consistent across differing levels of cognitive and metaphysical explanation, from how intellectual concept formation occurs, to other sorts of cognition, to an explanation of the constitution of physical things (including humans), and even to the processes of change as such (e.g., Feser 2014) because it is all part of a general and consistent view of the world. What is surprising about this is how well the philosophy of mind inherent in the A-T approach ï¬ts modern evidence about the mind. (Spalding and GagnÃ© 2013), for example, discuss how the A-T approach ï¬ts well with a wide variety of evidence drawn from modern psychological research on concepts, including evidence for prototypes and exemplars, as well as work on generics and essentialism, the relation between human and non-human animalsâ abilities to deal with categories, and other recent research topics in concepts. We should also note here that (Prasada and Dillinghamâs 2009) notion of K-properties (i.e., properties that are indicative of a kind of thing) is explicitly Aristotelian, though they do not explicitly make use of"

As soon as we conjure up the most familiar images of flower buds or young leaves on a tree, or creatures hatching from their eggs, we are reminded that new life is utterly fragile and miraculous, and appeals to us for protection. This is the frame of mindâwonder and humility when witnessing the gift of life, and a sense of responsibility for the well being of all living thingsâthat undergirds scientist citizenship. At the end of Devilâs Tango, in the chapter called âWhat the Light Was Like,â14 Pineda presents us with another sensory exercise to complement the first one. This time we are asked to imagine a scene called up from the authorâs pastâ her memory of gazing at trees bathed in sunlight. Pineda recalls how she was able to comprehend the passage of time by watching how the light moved across a grove. The light embraced in turn each tree and every part of each tree as the earth turned on its axis, a movement normally imperceptible to us yet on that day made perceptible to her through attentiveness to the caressing passage of sunlight over trees. Both of Pinedaâs sensory exercises are telling us to direct our gaze away from outer space toward this beautiful planet that we already inhabit, because without total regard for Earth, we risk destroying it beyond repair. Especially in the episode of remembering how sunlight moved across a grove, Pineda calls attention to the miracle of in/finite space and in/finite time that we are always capable of perceiving in the here and now. These sensory exercises re-inscribe a scientistâs understanding of in/finite space and in/finite time in the language and point of view of a poet. For although space and time are foundational concepts in all fields of inquiry, philosophy, art, science, and social science have different ways of representing and thus comprehending space and time. The sensory images comprising Pinedaâs instructions for imagining the amplitude of 86 planets and thereby re-cognizing our commitment to planet Earth, and the sensory images comprising Pinedaâs instructions for seeing what she saw on that day of sunlight passing over trees, come from the discipline of poetry and exemplify her placement of the poetâs toolbox in the service of the lunchbox. The most prominent example of Pinedaâs poetic language is of course the metaphor âdevilâs tango,â which is used to illuminate the fact that nuclear history records a dance with deathâHomo sapiensâ apparent addiction to nuclear technology no matter how great its known record of devastation and irreversible damage. Poetic language is not something for writers or literature scholars only, but is part and parcel of the language skills needed by a nuclear engineerâby any scientist or technicianâto communicate specialized knowledge to laypersons, by virtue of the fact that poetic language is the primary language through which we comprehend and express the beauty of life and the gift of human being. To be a nuclear engineer without literacy in poetic language is to be like a computer with a voice, able to speak oneâs expert knowledge but devoid of any context of lived life"

The results for the Pizza Ratio Problem above showed that Chinese students were more likely to use the conventional strategies of Argument 1 above, comparing fractions with common denominators or comparing decimals. However, only about 20 % of the U.S. students used this conventional strategy. In contrast, the vast majority of the U.S. students used somewhat non-conventional strategies. This example shows a dilemma we face. Clearly, the conventional strategy is quite efï¬cient and it can be easily applied to solve other similar problems, but this conventional strategy shows little originality. Whilst non-conventional strategies show the originality of studentsâ thinking, they are also task-speciï¬c and less easily applied to solving other problems, especially those that involve bigger numbers. The results from this particular example may suggest the effectiveness of Chinese classroom instruction in developing studentsâ efï¬cient strategies and the effectiveness of U.S. classroom instruction in developing original mathematical thinking. Ideally, we would hope that instruction can foster studentsâ learning of efï¬cient problem solving strategies and develop original mathematical thinking. If that is one of the goals for school mathematics, we have to seriously investigate the classroom instruction in both nations so that each can learn from the other. We can extend the discussion of the strategies to solve the Pizza Ratio Problem to a broader context. It is possible that educators and government ofï¬cials tend to believe that the USA does a better job of nurturing studentsâ creativity than Asian countries do. For example, Indiaâs Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, revealed that two-thirds of the nationâs universities and 90 % of its degree-granting colleges were rated as below average, and that university curricula were typically not in alignment with the needs of employers or job seekers (Bharucha 2008). On the other hand, in the USA, several recent reports call for the U.S. to learn from Asia because it is believed that Asian countries like China, India, and Singapore are much more effective in mathematics and science education, thus posing a major threat to the global competitiveness of the USA (Asian Society 2006). However, some Asian-born scholars believe that Asian countries should learn from the USA about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (e.g., Bharucha 2008; Zhao 2008) because the U.S. does a better job of nurturing creativity."
192,234,0.991,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Arrowsmith addresses a basic divide running through biomedicine, a clash between two (incommensurable) deontologies, two integrity regimes as it were: the principles of medical ethics on the one hand and the demands of experimental research on the other. Although biomedicine is allegedly motivated by the objective to promote well-being (enhancing the effectiveness of clinical practice), Arrowsmith emphasises that there is another, rather disruptive impulse at work as well: a violent will to control life, endangering rather than protecting the well-being, not only of research animals, but also of patients and, eventually, of biomedical researchers (such as Martin Arrowsmith) themselves. They must choose between two options, both of which are presented as morally unsatisfactory: on the one hand medical practice, portrayed as fundamentally insincere (permeated by mauvaise foi, to use the Sartrean term), on the other hand the methodology of randomised trials, depicted as inconsiderate and ruthless. After a series of fiascos, Martinâs âsolutionâ is simplification and escape (flight instead of fight). This raises the question whether this nihilistic portrayal of the moral dichotomy is inevitable. Dialectically, the relationship between medical practice and basic research may perhaps be seen in a different light. In Arrowsmith, the claim is made that, as soon as the principles of biomedical science (M1) are applied to practical situations, multiple conflicts and contradictions emerge (M2), but a more sustainable and satisfactory outcome would be the awareness that, eventually, the one cannot really function without the other (âM3). In splendid isolation, pure science becomes thin and empty, so that the plea for âpureâ research may actually be an immunisation strategy, a mechanism of defence (the beautiful soul position). Moreover, it is precisely in the confrontation with real-life situations that the relentless drive towards control, fuelling the quest for knowledge, is brought to the fore. In other words, application and extrapolation are necessary experiences to discover what science really is about. The experience of working through the conflict is then seen as a precondition for self-understanding. But this outcome is not easily achieved. The chronic tension is there for real, as indicated when we read the novel in terms of the discourse of the analyst:"
46,176,0.991,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"to take away their children, because the harm of being taken away would be less severe than the harm of staying in the family. Poverty would then fall into the same category as abuse and severe neglect, which also count as legitimate reasons for state intervention today. In fact, empirical research shows that children from poor families are more often taken away, and it has also been suggested that social workers are more likely to intervene in poor families than in richer ones, even if the level of neglect or abuse is similar. We now want to discuss why parents are not fully responsible for being poor and why this leads to the conclusion that even if poverty should constitute falling under the threshold necessary to uphold parental rights, parents should be supported instead of having their children taken away. Most people in poverty are not poor by choice, in the sense that they wish to be poor. The question is whether poor parents can be seen as being poor because they made bad and wrong choices, which lead them to become poor against their will and desire. This would be evaluated as a kind of deserving poverty. The first argument that speaks against such a conclusion is that poverty is very often grounded in childhood, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty suggests that people move through the life course on a trajectory that is very hard to change. It is certainly not impossible to escape poverty, but it is hard to because of the many disadvantages we discussed, like deprivations in health and education. The second argument in favor of our conclusion is the structural nature of poverty. The economic crisis of the last years pushed millions of people into poverty and made it much harder to escape it, showing impressively that the individual is dependent on the economic and social chances she finds. If there are simply not enough jobs available, someone will be unemployed, and if the economy changes in a way that transfers jobs from one country to another, the individual worker with a family and a mortgage to repay simply cannot move along (in fact, in most cases this would not help much, since it would still be too expensive). The counterargument, that uneducated persons are much more vulnerable to poverty, captures only one dimension and so must be rejected at least partly. Educational choices are in many countries made very early and depend on such things as available schools in the neighborhood or the support from parents. Children cannot control them, and when they reach an age at which they can be held partially responsible for their educational achievements and choices, it is often too late. We do not wish to dismiss adolescents completely, but they are at least partially the victims of their circumstances and the environments in which they grew up, which makes it more likely that they will leave school early,"
28,255,0.991,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"sociological studies that focus upon the particularly intractable management problems presented by these patients, problems that are increasingly reduced to âcuttingâ. Despite these management issues, Simpson becomes increasingly confident that the behaviour is essentially a response to tension, even if also learned or contagious. He argues that â[t]his form of a response to tension can be learned and propagated in a hospital or institution and is often sustained by the widespread conflict and guilt such acts tend to arouse in the staffâ. Any focus on the social or administrative setting is secondary to the essence of the behaviour, which is characterised as a âresponse to tensionâ. The focus on internal, emotional states is combined with a desire for solitude, leaving any wider social or communicative significance out of the reckoning: âThe patient feels depressed, angry and tense, and wants to express the extent of her feelings, but feels unable to do so in words. Tension becomes the predominant affect ... she will seek solitude if she is not already aloneâ.91 Simpsonâs study illustrates the lack of concern for the social setting with his assessments of lethality, the focus upon the subjective experience (phenomenology) of the cutting, and it shows the management issues that persist in assessments of self-cutting. Again, the focus is upon individual, intolerable tension as motivating the cutting incidents. Simpsonâs literature review of self-mutilation, published in a collection about suicide, reports a âvery clear composite picture of the typical cutterâ as being a young, attractive, intelligent woman. He mentions Offerâs and Barglowâs analysis, which ranges from the interpersonal and social settings to internal motivations. According to Simpson, they propose âseveral motives such as gaining attention, the need to be loved and cared for, attempts to control aggression, tension reduction, and gaining prestige among the social group in the wardâ. Such an explicit mention of the social setting merits significant disagreement: Simpson claims that â[e]lements of such motivations may well play a part in the dynamics of self-mutilation, but they are inadequate explanations â Why choose to gain attention or express the need for love by cutting oneâs wrist?â92 Note that it is the social, communicative motivations singled out for their inadequacy, rather than (for example) the observations about aggression or tension. However, he also mentions that many authors have focused upon issues of loss and abandonment as precipitants for cutting incidents. The social focus of this behaviour comes through most clearly in a passage where in Simpson discusses how âcutting behavior can be learned and propagated in a hospital, clinic or institutionâ and how patients may"
180,126,0.991,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"One final crosscutting issue lurks behind all the cases in the resource allocation chapter (perhaps all the cases in the volume)ânamely, the nature of the decisionmaking process that addresses the issues they raise. Public health decisions about resource allocationâjudging from the cases on that topic in this volumeâface reasonable ethical disagreement. That is because the tradeoffs involved in the two main goals of public health policyâimproving population health and distributing health fairlyâare trade-offs about which people often reasonably disagree. How can public health decisions be made in real time, given these ethical disagreements, in ways that enhance their legitimacy and are arguably fair to all parties? One approach to the problem is to construct a fair process for making those decisions and to rely on the outcomes of such a process. People will judge the outcomes of a fair process to be fair (Daniels and Sabin 2008). What conditions should such a decisionmaking process meet if it is to be considered fair? Four conditions are arguably necessary (even if some may think they are not sufficient and want to add others): (1) The decisions and the rationales for them should be made public. (2) They should be based on reasons all think are relevant. (3) They should be revisable in light of new evidence and arguments. And (4), these conditions should be enforced so that the public can see that they obtain. Some explanation is needed for these conditions. The publicity condition is widely embraced, even if it is fairly strong. It calls for the grounds for decisionsânot just the content of the decisionsâto be transparent. People have a right to know why decisions that affect their health are made the way they are. Moreover, making the reasoning for such decisions public is a way of exposing them to scrutiny so errors in reasoning or evidence can be detected and decisions improved. Even though we may not be able to be explicit in advance about all criteria we use to decide such cases, that is, we may work out our reasons through deliberation, we can explain on what we base our decisions. And that gives people affected by our decisions the knowledge they have a right to possess. The search for reasons that all consider relevant to making a reasonable public health decision about resource allocation can narrow disagreement considerably. Even if people can agree on what reasons they think are relevantâin the spirit of finding mutually justifiable grounds for their decisionsâthey may not agree about the weight they give these reasons. One way to test the relevance of such reasons is to subject them to scrutiny by an appropriate range of stakeholders. What counts as appropriate may vary with the case. Who should be heard in deliberations is itself worthy of deliberation. Stakeholders raise different arguments that should be heard, and including their voices improves buy-in to decisions. Since stakeholders may not in many instances be elected representatives, we may be skeptical about whether the democratic process is improved by including them, but, if the deliberation is well managed, the quality of the discussion may improve greatly. The revisability condition, requiring that decisions be modifiable in light of new evidence and argument, is also widely embraced and not considered controversial. Decisions are made on the basis of evidence and arguments, and better evidence and"
108,59,0.991,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"peacefully in the political arena. In this case, it might involve actors who exercise force in the operations area and who thereby make financial gain through smuggling. The exercise of force is an outward manifestation of maintaining control over a smuggling operation. These actors are more interested in economic power than political power and should be tackled accordingly. This knowledge is of course important to enable an understanding of the actors and motives driving the current wave of violence in the operations area. David Kilcullen writes that in Afghanistan 3000â 4000 of the Taliban (which were approximately 10% of them) were âhard-core fanatics who are not reconcilable under any circumstancesâ.13 It is important to use not only physical violence, but foremost symbolic violence on these individuals. This can be discrediting them in religious, social, political, ethnic or economic ways. It is either this or giving up the idea that there is a cultural element in conflict, which there often is. That we, the West, for example, want to impose democracy on âthe othersâ as that is something the West as a society believes to be objectively right like a jihadist believes in Islamic law as objectively right. Some people are hard to reach and that must be acknowledged as a fact and treated accordingly, with force if necessary. Another method problem is the purely operational one of establishing collaboration between the military units and the various forms of voluntary organisations (NGOs). The latter often have a policy not to collaborate with military units. However, this problem lies outside the scope of the possible for a study of this nature; it will require a favourably pragmatic approach to operations in the field. By way of introduction, it should be said that ethnic cleansing and genocide do not occur in all conflict situations. No matter what International law says; there are plenty of examples of people being forced to flee an area, or being killed just because of ethnicity and not because of some kind of actions taken on the victimâs behalf. There is no shortage of plight and suffering among those who find themselves with the âwrongâ ethnicity or nationality. This text is concerned with operational realities for forces on the ground, rather than definitions made for political reasons. International law is only normative if there are interests from important national statesâwhich often can be condensed down to the USA, Russia or ex-colonial states in the regionâso if an event"

Her narrative of failure was highly relevant for the other participants, several of whom worked on other digital projects in the public sector, and could easily end up in similar circumstances of having to decide whether to stop a project and admit failure, or not. Bolstad has highlighted the learning aspect of the closing down the E-project. âWe have failed, but the experience made us stronger. We are now an organization where it is acceptable to try, fail, learn, and move on. One other notable thing is that have become more professional in handling disagreement. That is a prerequisite for open and honest talk about our projectsâ (Bolstad, 2017). The need to create a digital depot for the public sector in Norway remains, and the current efforts to do so are different from the first in four significant dimensions, in that the project is characterized by: â¢ Stronger user orientation, taking into account the needs and competencies of the people who are going to use the system. â¢ Not just one, but multiple alternatives for a solution are under consideration from the start. â¢ A communication climate where people are encouraged to voice concerns and disagreements early. â¢ Tolerance for failure in the process of developing the alternatives. What Bolstad describes as the key elements in the work to counter digital dementia overlaps with the main tenets of design thinking, where principles of design are applied to the way people work. This approach focuses on usersâ experiences in encounters with technologically complex processes and uses prototypes to explore potential solutions. It is built on the assumption that some alternatives need to fail in order for others to stand out as the better ones. Design thinking has proved to be especially useful in addressing wicked problems (Buchanan, 1992), that is, problems with high levels of complexity and ambiguity. A common aim for such processes is to make the usersâ interaction with the technological solutions intuitive and pleasurable. That is the task for the team currently working in Bolstadâs organization to create a digital archive. At the time of the interview, they had seven active conceptual alternatives, and will eventually converge on one of them for further development"

She stressed that although to Western eyes the moral values of these different societies (or tribes) may seem strange, if not objectionable, each made sense once they were understood within the context of the moral culture of the various societies. Viewed in the context in which her works and those of other leading anthropologists (especially Franz Boas and Margaret Mead) were published at the timeâin the mid-twentieth centuryâthey served as a major antidote to cultural imperialism, to the arrogant but widely-held notion among colonizing nations that they were called upon to bring light to the primitives. At the same time, by arguing that the values of the different cultures were merely different rather than some being morally superior to others, she and her colleagues in effect promoted moral relativism. True, some social scientists tried to save the day by maintaining that these anthropological positions amounted merely to âmethodological relativism,â the need for unbiased studying of cultures different than those of the social scientist who did the study. However, their findings were often cited and commonly used to support philosophical relativism, the suspension of moral judgment, which takes the oomph out of moral wrestling. Once one takes the position that x believe in monogamy but y believe in polygamy, and that x has no basis on which to tell y that xâs choice is more moral than that of yâone pulls the rug out from under all cross-cultural moral claims. And because the same is true for subcultures within each society, these intrasocietal judgments are also left without a firm foundation. Seeking an exit, various social scientists have argued that some values are held by all cultures, and hence could serve as a solid foundation for moral judgments. However, it turns out that even the most elementary moral value, thou shalt not kill, is not universally shared. Of course many cultures approve killing outsidersâ whether they are Nazis, Communists, or infidels. However, many cultures also strongly lionize killing some of their own, for instance in so-called honor killings, in which fathers and brothers kill their daughters or sisters if they bring shame on the family. No exit here."

Firstly, the editors were especially sceptical about the agendas of private asylum proprietors, pointing out that it was in their best financial interests to retain patients rather than cure them. Secondly, they heavily criticised the families of patients for failing to care for them in the home. In doing so, they revealed that their issue lay more with confinement itself, rather than any unpleasant conditions identified in the private asylums: To read the prospectus of some Private Asylums, we would fancy them to be each a little paradise. Employment is provided, and amusement. There are games, balls, private theatricals, and concerts. In fact, all are to be treated as âmembers of a family.â Why, then, does not the family to which a lunatic belongs provide all this solace which we are so ready to pay for? Why must we cloak our selfishness under the guise of affectionate relationship? Why must we bury each insane member of our kindred, as we do our dead, out of our sight, and comfort ourselves with the complacent notion that we pay largely to provide a haven for him?"
223,253,0.991,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Interaction of Systems Now that we have described the basic operating principles of the RIMâs two systems, it is necessary to show how they function together. The very structures of the two systems contain a first important point relevant to their interaction: the impulsive system is always effortlessly active, whereas the reflective system may also be inactive. The implication is that the reflective system, when it does operate, does so in parallel with the impulsive system, not in place of it. That is, reflective processing always occurs with parallel impulsive processing. It is also clear that the concepts that are transformed in working-memory space in the reflective system do not come from nowhere but from the long-term store of the impulsive system. As the systems cannot interact when the reflective system is disengaged, it is adequate to examine how they interact from the beginning to the end of a reflective operation. When a reflective operation begins, perceptual input will already have activated several associative elements. For example, when thinking about what to have for lunch, a person may already have seen what is on offer in the cafeteria, a selection that will activate whatever associations that person has with the given meal options, but other perceptual data in the attentional focus (the presentation of the"

A skill is unaffected by voluntary error, whereas a virtue disappears through voluntary error. Somebody who purposely undertakes an unjust action is simply not just. If one possesses a virtue, one has not merely a moderate tendency towards a particular action, but a strong disposition towards it. For instance, if somebody is honest, one can reliably expect them to be so even under difï¬cult circumstances. They will be honest, even if it is disadvantageous to them. They will value honesty in their friends and they will try to instil it in their children. Virtues, when present, are strongly entrenched, and to turn a genuinely honest man into a dishonest man or vice versa requires a profound change, for which one would normally expect some sort of unusual explanation (such as drugs or religious conversion) (Foot 1978: 11â14).

(See, in particular, The Notorious B.I.G.âs âPlaya Haterâ, in which he sang about the two kinds of people in the world, today: the âplayersâ and the âplaya hatersâ.) What is going on here? First, in the move from 1990s rap to this researcherâs diagnosing of the fractious â though, letâs face it, rarefied â space of an interdisciplinary workshop on neuroscience? Second, in our deciding to include this culturally and historically dense moment, one that invokes a specific linguistic terrain, often associated with a particular kind of black masculinity, and that then uses that terrain to complexify what regular commentary might simply have characterized as predictable cross-disciplinary critique of neuroscience on the part of the humanities and social sciences? First, let us consider the sentence, âThis room is filled with neuroscience playa haters.â FC believes this to be a moment of diagnosis, in which there was the identification (correct, FC believes) of some sense of grievance and envy on the part of at least some of those in the social sciences and humanities; as well as of a disparity in power between the neurosciences (strong) and those enviously attacking it (the weaker humanities and social sciences); as well as of the strangeness of running a conference about neuroscientific evidence that was filled with so many people âoutsideâ of the field and that contained so few practising neuroscientists. The sentence, on the one hand, can be interpreted as a powerful means both to gesture to a recent transformation in disciplinary hierarchies (the neurosciences were thrust into the limelight at the same time as the humanities were feeling increasingly anxious about their status) and a means to install (not wholly ironically) anyone issuing the sentence close to the heart of interdisciplinary power. But there is more going on here, too. The term âhaterâ, as it has emerged in the last couple of decades, conveys a complex mesh of affects: the âhaterâ not only is unable to be happy about the success of the person she or he is âhatingâ, but rather wants to undermine that person by attempting to expose her flaws or inadequacies. Here, then, is an acute analysis of the shape that critique of âthe neurosciencesâ, on the part of humanities and social science scholars, can sometimes take. FC remembers the atmosphere in the workshop as, indeed, at times, hostile against âneuroscienceâ â and hostile in a way that refused any real engagement with the heterogeneous methods or epistemologies of the neurosciences, and that was forcefully committed to trying to identify as many flaws in âneuroscienceâ as possible.

Our logic can be seen both as a general proof technique for reasoning about concurrent programs, and also as tool for proving the absence of out-ofthin-air behaviour for challenging examples, and reasoning about coherence. In the future, we would like to extend the logic to cover more of relaxed memory, more advanced reasoning principles, such as those available in GPS [26], and mechanise its soundness proof. Interesting aspects of relaxed memory we would like to also cover are read-modify-writes and fences. These would allow us to consider concurrent algorithms like circular buffers and the atomic reference counter verified in FSL++ [9]. This could be done by adapting the corresponding rules of RSL and GPS; moreover, we could adapt them with our new approach to reason about coherence. To mechanise the soundness proof, we intend to use the Iris framework [11], which has already been used to prove the soundness of iGPS [12], a variant of the GPS program logic. To do this, however, we have to overcome one technical limitation of Iris. Namely, the current version of Iris is step-indexed over N, while our semantics uses transfinite step-indexing over N Ã N to define non-promising safety and allow us to reason about certifications of arbitrary length for each reduction step. Progress has been made towards transfinitely step-indexed logical relations that may be applicable to a transfinitely step-indexed version of Iris [25]. Acknowledgments.

If we donât the new ideas we bring could be much worse for them than the old ideas we want to help change.â European nurses in Papua New Guinea during the colonial period thought of themselves as challengers of traditional culture, bravely facing down ânative law,â âfear of taboos,â and the supernatural forces that held such a prominent place in indigenous explanations of illness (Kettle 1979). In the decade leading up to Independence in 1975, Papua New Guineans of both sexes were recruited to replace the European sisters and matrons that had previously held the majority of government nursing positions alongside lower ranked male orderlies and medical assistants. The assumption was (and to a certain extent remains) that these educated nationals would serve as cultural brokers between the newly independent state and the rural majority, understanding, if not actually sharing, indigenous etiologies and healing practices. Over 40 years after Independence, nurses in PNG are indeed exceptionally attentive to âcustomary beliefs,â though perhaps not in the ways that national development planners had hoped. Rather, in the contemporary context, with quality health care largely inaccessible outside of urban areas, nurses are taught to see witchcraft, sorcery, and magic as weapons of the weak, with which rural clients can elicit recognition from neglectful others, including the absentee state and its representatives. Classroom lectures emphasized that students should always treat claims of supernatural illness as real and accountable matters: as teachers explained, âCustomary belief, it can affect us, so you must entertain it. Otherwise, they will start a big war in the village and they will take the hospital to court.â They taught students that the Nursing Councilâs professional code of ethics required acknowledging the reality of pasin tumbuna (ancestral practices). Whether the forces behind these beliefs were ontologically real or not, âIf you donât respect the beliefs, the talk will come back to get you, it will hold you.â BjÃ¸rn Bertelsen, in Chap. 2 of this volume, notes that contemporary witchcraft and âtraditionalâ cosmologies share a âprofoundly open natureâ¦ irreducible to stable sets of socio-cultural values, institutions and practicesâ (Bertelsen, this volume, 50). For my informants, the openness, and volatility of customary belief were part of what made it so frightening, and its geographical variabilityâwhat people believed and practiced could change"

One pair of siblings expressed it as: âThe older one of us wants the parent who does not have the children with them to be all right when the children are with the other parent. Doesnât want them (the parents) to be sad even if they live in separate houses. Wants them to do things that make the children happy.â We interpret this to mean that it can be a burden for the children to think about their parents missing them. Another example of this is from a 10-year-old girl who says she feels a little bit guilty when she spends time with just one of them, but she has a solution: âI want you to live together â be with you at the same time.â When the children talk about their parents missing them, many see it in terms of what is fair. The children often understand fairness in terms of children sharing their time equally between the parents: âI want to be fair â spend just the same time with bothâ (13-year-old girl). One pair of siblings say: âWe are ï¬ne. We can stay one week with each of them, that makes it fair for both mum and dad. And then there is no need for dad to miss us.â The material shows clearly that the children feel particularly sorry for and/or are worried about their father. One of the children says the following: âI think about dad a lot â that heâs going to be all right. That he needs to know that I love him.â Some of the children are worried about the future and say they miss their parents, that they are not used to spending long periods away from one of them. Some fear that the parent they see least of is going to disappear altogether. A large number of the children talk about having emotional problems as a result of the divorce. Others point to the practical consequences of the relationship breakdown. For many it is important that the parents live near each other, and also near the school. They do not want to change schools, and it is important to keep their friends after the separation. Some experience a conï¬ict between the wish to spend time with the parents and the consequences this has for life outside the family: âI like being with dad, but I donât have any friends there.â Some say itâs okay to have a 50/50 arrangement, while others point out that their parents wish for such an arrangement is a problem for them: âIt is hard to share ourselves equally between parents. Everyday life is very busy, donât want 50/50.â The minority, who state that life is all right, that their parentsâ divorce is almost a good thing, relate this to, among other things, increased access to material things. The relationship breakdown can provide room for negotiation or an opportunity to make wishes come true. There are several examples of children asking the mediator to tell their parents that they would like a pet. One pair of siblings ask the mediator to tell the parents that they would like a dog. Two 10-year-old girls would ï¬rst like a budgie, then a dog at their mumâs and tropical ï¬sh at their dadâs. We do not know whether these are wishes the children have previously conveyed or whether they have arisen in relation to the family break-up. It could be that the children have registered sympathy and willingness to listen in the situation, something which might make it possible for wishes, which would previously not have been granted, to come true for the children."
113,257,0.991,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"(Myhre 2014). Instead of commodity-like entities that are bought and sold by those who wish to get ahead in economic pursuits, the albino murders concern and involve attempts to appropriate and administer the life-force of others for the sake of oneâs own personal being. Its urgency in 2008 was possibly linked to the expansion of secondary schooling, where people were required to provide money and materials, as well as contribute labour to build the schools for which they would later have to pay their childrenâs school fees. As these dictates arrived from national and regional authorities and trickled through the local government, the increasing demands and needs for money were experienced as extractions of life-force that pulled people apart. Wary of assigning causal dynamics, I wish to point out that this idea does not weaken the connection between the albino murders, witchcraft, and the economy, but undermines the concept of occult economies where people use âmagicalâ means or âmysteriousâ techniques for material ends. The concept of horu entails that these events and practices are neither magical nor mysterious, but material and practical interventions in dwelling and life that affect the modes of being of those involved. They belong to a world where all that exists is horu in some form, and hence is a transformation of something else. In such a world, life itself is vulnerable and prone to transformation, which assumes a form where body-parts are used as forms of lifeforce, deployed as tools for its conversion, or used to nourish an animal counterpart that can be used to harm others. Like in the epigraph above, these engagements emerge as alternatives embodied in life itself, which affirms its existence as a concern for the transfers and transformations of horu. Life and dwelling are thus constant possibilities to be seized in opposition to witchcraft, which gives new sense to peopleâs concern and circumspection when sharing and consuming powerful foodstuffs in situations where they may be bewitched (Myhre 2009: 131). Witchcraft then not only constitutes the end of dwelling and life, but outlines the limit of an anthropology preoccupied with representation. On this account, the concern of witchcraft is with modes of being and not-being, whose intensities these events and experiences evince and convey (cf. Favret-Saada 2015: 104). Accordingly, its character as an action upon action differs from the idea of representation, where one form of action comments on another (Strathern 1985b: 112). Representation is obviously a concern for a discipline that describes and reproduces social life in other forms, but it does not follow that it holds the same interest and urgency for those with whom we work. Indeed,"

There must be one person to manage this step and make sure that the university people know who to address. Mobility and exchange programs have to be in one personâs hands.â Implicit here is a set of challenges related to what appears to be an artiï¬cial division of responsibilities across two institutions (the university and the CBPAM) and often within one institution (IO and Bologna Ofï¬ce) centred on one set of activities: academic mobility. (This participant described the emphasis on academic mobility this way: âAs for now, we understand the Bologna Process as only academic mobility. Most universities do the same.â) At issue is whether IO staff have the capacity to work across this division of labour to achieve institutional goals for one institutional strategic plan. This capacity challenge is suggested by one International Ofï¬cer interviewed who described her view that her IO staff should be made aware of âBologna Process related laws and articlesâ, but they do not receive any information or training either at her institution or through the CBPAM: âI would introduce the staff to the Bologna Process-related laws and articles. They need to know. Itâs relevant to our work. But the university leadership does not initiate this training.â When asked whether her staff were ever invited to the CBPAM for training, she replied, âNo. The IO is not invited.â At this stage, this challenge is merely suggested in the interviews and needs to be explored in greater depth as an issue that may become increasingly signiï¬cant in the future, when the planned closure of the CBPAM devolves Bologna-related work to other national institutions in 2015. This could have a signiï¬cant impact on the nature of IO work, and capacity development may emerge as important."

What can you tell me about him? âNutcaseâ (pridurok). Thanks a lot, Gennady Viktorovich. (general director, p3) In this example the written testimonial was bypassed in favor of a personal recommendation which was not made public: unlike formal evaluations, informal ones are often made orally and the persons evaluated do not necessarily know about the contents of these assessments or even about their existence. Checking the background of the applicant over the phone was a common way of inquiring about the applicantâs character and competences. During one such conversation concerning an applicant, the advice given was âto chase him out with a broomâ (project leader, p24). However, informal recommendations were also evaluated critically and were cross-checked with different sources: If I see from the applicantâs CV that he worked in a particular firm, it is very important for me to be able to phone some acquaintance in this firm and ask how things are with this person. Why did he leave the firm, what he was unhappy with, what are his weak and strong points? It is of course very important to talk directly with the employee because the information received from a third party is not always objective. Thus one shouldnât blindly trust some recommendations but always communicate directly with the person in question. (technical director, p11) Moreover, neither good informal recommendations nor testimonials will secure a job if the candidate does not pass the formal tests required, for example, to land a programming job. In one company the applicants had to fill in a form where they were asked if they had acquaintances in the company.

Public outrage can never have positive effect for society to exert its resilience thoroughly, if it is just neglected or poorly cared. Some (engineering) experts may still argue that this problem is solvable by âeducationâ of public (that encourage them to accept expertsâ notion): we should let them know that we need to keep those two things separated to make our society resilient and to prevent the next similar failure. If this is a discussion about just âfailure,â not âaccident,â it might be possible to maintain this strategy. However, it is an indisputable principle of modern democratic society that we must take care of the issue of damage and responsibility with deliberate ethical considerations and the deep sense of social justice.

72,280,0.991,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"general measure of success is that 85% of challenges find winning solutions, but there is no such figure that focuses solely on social innovations. Nevertheless, two of Innocentiveâs high-profile success stories involve social innovation. The first was a challenge to find new ways of providing education to populations in poor and developing countries4 and the second was a challenge to find a means of measuring âhuman potentialâ.5 Thus, although social innovation is just a small part of Innocentiveâs activities, it is possible to use the Innocentive model to stimulate social innovation. Innocentiveâs success seems to hinge on its ability to leverage two of the core mechanisms of social innovation: matching problems and solutions and exchanging information across domains. The challenge grant structure is also suited to innovation in that it opens problems up to a wide audience of potential solvers. A typical way for an organisation or individual to attempt to find a solution to a problem might be to hire a consultant or other experts in the particular field it is operating in, but these people are often too committed to existing ways of operating or established best practices to generate truly innovative ideas (Nielsen, 2011). As the literature on social innovation suggests, innovation is usually the product of the novel combination of adjacent fields of knowledge (Arthur, 2009). This certainly holds true for Innocentive, where many winning solutions have come from experts in fields different from that of the challenger (Nielsen, 2011). However, while Innocentive might be good at stimulating new inventions, it seems to be poor at supporting innovations through to implementation (Tjornbo and Westley, 2012). Once a solution has been matched to a problem, there is not much more support available from Innocentive in terms of developing the idea. The section of the site entitled âSolver Resourcesâ mostly contains a few brief articles on the basics of how to answer challenges. There are built-in supports for people hoping to partner with others in designing their solution and an online forum where members of Innocentive can chat about a broad range of topics, but these tools seem to have limited impact. The global forum, for example, sees a new topic opened at most once or twice a month and most of these receive two or fewer replies. At the time of writing, the first three posts in this forum were all observations about how difficult it is to form a team.6 Based on a sample of twenty randomly selected challenges, the average number of public comments in the public project rooms is less than three. This suggests that Innocentive is not effective in building shadow networks. In addition, Innocentive does not have built-in tools to help innovations establish themselves in broader systems.

378,110,0.991,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"Researchers concluded that it is attention that plays a crucial role for the quality and intensity of an experience and that individual attention is high when something is new. With time, however, the fraction of attention concentrated on the new thing goes down and so does its influence on oneâs general state of well-being. Working with attention lies at the heart of mindfulness practices and therapeutic strategies deployed to cure the increasing number of people that burn out in hedonic treadmill civilizations. Constantly keeping attention on what ubiquitous advertising is suggesting one lacks in oneâs life and what others have that is better is not a good recipe for happiness. Neurosciences show that mental activity creates neuronal structures and, depending on which skills people use most or what they pay attention to regularly, some wirings and associations of their brain become more connected. Some parts even grow physically bigger. So if societies create attention architectures that keep people concentrated on accumulation and monetary expressions of value, this influences their ideas about a good life, the best need-satisfaction strategies and, ultimately, their experienced happiness (Hanson 2009: 18). Neurosciences and biochemical research also tell us that a brain processing massive excitement would fry if it did this over longer periods of time. Accumulating limitless stacks of happiness is thus neither possible nor desirable. Happiness is a flow phenomenon rather than a stock that can be hoarded. Its measurement takes place on a scale between high and low and its levels are expected to fluctuate. It is not measured with aggregated growth curves. Psychologists like Tim Kasser provide more scientiï¬c evidence against the conflation of more gain with more happiness, and also against the âlawâ that all humans are naturally wired toward competitive accumulation. He shows how experienced well-being of even materially wealthy lives seems to decrease if too much attention is given to economic indicators and the satisï¬er strategies of having."
275,638,0.991,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"ciency, so we should not expect to have an economically efficient allocation of resources. This is a central point in this chapter: conventional notions of utility maximisation break down rapidly under complexity. Moreover, the quality of decisionmaking of agents under capital rationing is especially sensitive to unforeseen changes in the future cost of capital, which means for autonomous agents potentially exquisite sensitivity to failure under uncertainty. Given hard and soft constraints under ontological uncertainty, decisions regarding how much resource to put into each side of the strategy amounts to judgements about own tolerance to loss, more than it is about the potential for the environment to dish up favourable or unfavourable outcomes. So at the core of the strategy is the requirement for autonomous machines to be equipped with a theory of self, specifically for the purpose of evaluating exposure to unacceptable failure and deciding hedging plans, and for recognising feasible opportunity for reward and determining investment plans given a range of such opportunities. Theory of mind in the usual sense is then really an extension of theory of own mind as the more fundamental concept for autonomous systems research. The strategy amounts, therefore, to a mechanism for substituting the unapproachable problems of prediction and knowledge acquisition in uncontrolled unstructured environments in general with the much more manageable problem of self-knowledge. Note that soft capital rationing is self-imposed, and amounts to judgements and this condition appears to very directly imply a requirement for an agent theory of self. It also seems that a theory of self would imply that, in a sense, such agents would effectively talk to themselves, much as humans do [28, 38], constructing a kind of narrative of self as they debate with themselves about different investment options, and moderate and alter their own beliefs and expectations. There is a deep issue lurking here that motivates and underpins this proposition about agency. Incompleteness means that self-knowledge, and thus knowledge of oneâs own sensitivity to failure, is inherently limited; after all, we all observe ourselves from inside ourselves. A theory of mind supporting the development and application barbell-type strategies accommodates this in two ways simultaneously. Firstly, the judgement caveat on plasticity and thus on autonomy concerning limits we consider to be operationally acceptable is about making visible to the agent itself the consequences of the limits of its own self-knowledge in terms of managing the effects of the limited ability of anything - or anyone - to determine its own failure modes. Secondly, with respect to determining potential exposure to unacceptable failure, I am advocating a defensive kind of posture: exposure to decisive failure is a matter of choosing boundaries beyond which unacceptable failure is a potential rather than a certainty. We cannot determine failure sensitivity completely or with exactitude, but we can choose those boundaries conservatively or optimistically and in priority order depending on our faith in the broader social enterprise to absorb the possible consequent failures. It seems that this problem of self-knowledge is much more manageable, however, both by virtue the fact that the system we then have to deal with is much smaller than that of the entire environment, which, after all, includes the agent itself, and by virtue of the fact that we humans are a testament to how successful in uncertain worlds agents armed with self-knowledge can be."

The decision to link the healthcare providersâ side with the patients via the existing GPsâ EPRs created the need to work with the EPR vendors and enroll them in the project. However, it was not certain that all EPR vendors would be willing to participate. Some were small vendors who provided EPR systems to GPs but not patient portals. One pre-study participant recalls that for them this was a âfantastic opportunity to join, to hop on the boatâ. But other vendors had their own patient portal and questioned âhow should we earn money in this market, because whatâs happening now is that we have our patient portal, with other services that you say that you want to develop we have them in place already, itâs not big, we have them spread all over, but now you want us to just blend in with the others and that you just take over the portal sideâ.

It could be that the desire for autonomy is associated with obtaining the flexibility to deal with health-related issues or opportunities (described above), but autonomy may provide additional psychological benefits. Haynie and Shepherdâs (2011) research offered some initial insight; they found that people who were injured after obeying orders on the battlefield wanted more autonomy as did individuals who required a long period of hospitalization due to their health problems, during which they had to follow othersâ (e.g., nurses, doctors, therapists) instructions. These findings indicate that the more a health-related problem is associated with a loss of personal control (either directly causing the health problem or being caused by the health problem), the more the individual desires autonomy in an entrepreneurial career. Therefore, while the need for autonomy is considered a basic psychological need (Ryan & Deci, 2000), the weight and the nature of this need for autonomy likely vary across (potential) entrepreneurs and the amount offered by the careers they pursue. The key then becomes obtaining a fit between the level of autonomy needed and the entrepreneurial career (created or chosen). How do individuals achieve such a fit? Future research looking to address this question about fit may want to begin with the career literature, particularly the research on identity work discussing how individuals can modify themselves to achieve fit, modify the nature of the task to achieve fit, or both (e.g., Ibarra & Barbulescu, 2010; Nicholson, 1984; Pratt, Rockmann, & Kaufmann, 2006). This career literature has typically been developed such that changes to the task are relatively modest given a focus on employment; more research is needed exploring substantial changes to the task (e.g., an entrepreneurial career) (see Shepherd & Williams, 2017). To what extent have individuals created and changed the nature of their entrepreneurial role to satisfy their health-related needs for autonomy? It is likely that such accommodations have implications for the nature of the opportunities identified and pursued. Competence and health. Over and above physical accommodations, flexibility, and autonomy, what other requirements do people with health problems seek when deciding whether to pursue an entrepreneurial career or deciding between different entrepreneurial career alternatives? According to self-determination theory, people also need to satisfy the psychological needs for competence and belonging (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2000). It appears that when poor health prevents one from doing tasks, there is an even greater desire to pursue an entrepreneurial career in which the individual can build and use his or her competen-"
3,74,0.991,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"2.4.1.4.3 Operationalization of Scaffolding As the goals of scaffolding differ depending on the theoretical framework that undergirds their design and use, so does the operationalization of scaffolding. From an activity theory perspective, stretching studentsâ abilities to the maximum potential is desired (Jonassen & Rohrer-Murphy, 1999; Roth & Lee, 2007). As such, one designs scaffolding so as to maximize productive struggle (Belland, 2014; Reiser, 2004; Simons & Ertmer, 2006). Productive struggle refers to struggle within the areas of the task that are most likely to lead to target learning outcomes and which is not likely to lead to disengagement (Belland, Kim, et al., 2013). Thus, within reason, struggling is not cause for concern, but rather represents an opportunity for learning. In this way, adding scaffolding is not desirable, but rather removing (fading) scaffolding is (Pea, 2004). From an ACT-R perspective, struggle is counterproductive, and thus intelligent tutoring systems allow students to request hints when they struggle (Anderson et al., 1997; Koedinger & Aleven, 2007). The first hint is more subtle, but as the student requests more, the hints become more direct, eventually ending in a bottom-out hint that provides the answer (Koedinger & Aleven, 2007; Koedinger & Corbett, 2006)."
296,210,0.991,Becoming a World-Class University : The Case of King Abdulaziz University,"2.3 How to Begin a Strategic Planning Process Within a University? Let us illustrate how to begin a strategic planning process in the context of an excellent university. As an example, reference is made to Princeton University, a rather small Ivy League research university in the US, with only about 8000 students, but which is consistently ranked among the top ten universities in the world. In a university such as Princeton University, the question of what its future should look like is regarded as very legitimate. However, when trying to answer this question within the framework of strategic planning, allergic reactions on campus emerge. Committees that collect data, lead assessments, and work out reports are quickly denounced as part of a bureaucratic, cumbersome effort that only leads to a nebulous âwish listâ. Many on campus think that the best way is to just let the future happen, through decentralized actions of departments only. Yet, to overcome this fragmented approach, the newly appointed university president suggested another framework. To better shape PrincetonÂ´s thinking about its future and about how the âbigâ issues with which Princeton University is confronted can be tackled, the president proposed to engage in strategic planning, so that PrincetonÂ´s thinking is structured along prescribed lines. In addition, since the allocation of resources needs to be optimized, strategic planning has to set spending priorities for Princetonâs budget. As a consequence, the president started the process of strategic planning by raising four key questions (quotes from [1]). â¢ âHow best can Princeton sustain teaching and research excellence that makes a difference in the world?â To offer the highest quality in research and scholarship is taken for granted at Princeton. The open issue, however, is what the university can actually do to make a difference in the world. â¢ âWhat new academic initiatives should Princeton pursue to address long-term issues of fundamental importance?â Addressing that question means moving into new fields of research such as neuroscience, but it also entails embracing old knowledge in a new way, e.g., to discuss ethical issues in the context of a globalized, digitalized world."
310,89,0.991,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"To begin with, the commenter here does draw the line at parents forcibly sending their children to NARTH (National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality), an organisation that offers gay conversion therapy, thus, recognising the danger that such therapy can bring on LGBTIQ youth. However, the language used in the rest of the comment indicates a strong negative stance toward homosexuality and a profound ignorance of LGBTIQ issues. Firstly, the user refers to non-straight sexual desires as âunwantedâ¦urgesâ. Both these words have negative connotations and imply something unfavourable. Moreover, by way of the modal verb âshouldâ, the user offers a suggestion for people with such âurgesâ to âget helpâ. In doing so, the user implies that heteronormative values are hegemonic and any deviation from them creates an urgent need for the individual to seek help. Finally, the use of the inclusive âorâ in the sentence âWhether those urges are for men or young boys, it shouldnât matter.â strongly implicates that, in the mind of the commenter, homosexuality is on a par with paedophilia and thus warrants âtreatment.â In view of all this, then, the ï¬nal, positive, statement that parents should not force their children to undergo gay conversion therapy is overshadowed by the overall negative stance the user has towards the LGBTIQ community. Similarly, the comment in (32), which was made in response to a newspaper article about the civil union of a gay couple, might not seem at ï¬rst to be overly discriminatory. Yet, if we break it down into its component parts and discern the meaning beneath the allusions being used therein, we might form a different opinion. (32) people marry because they fall in love, and although itâs a choice, it was meant to be like that even in the animal kingdom, for example swans mate for life, male and female, not male and male.38 The user that posted this comment may posit the idea that marriage is a choice, but frames the relevant clause with the conjunction âalthoughâ (a conventional implicature Ã  la Grice), which is generally used to present two contrastive arguments, thus indicating that even though marriage is a choice for people who fall in love, it is also a choice that comes with restrictions. By bringing in a comparison with mating in the animal kingdom, whereby all swan relationships are described as being heterosexual, the commenter subscribes to heteronormative ideals, implying in this way that any deviation from the heterosexual norm is unnatural. So, even though this comment concedes that marriage is a choice, somewhat echoing the main argument of most gay rights movements on the matter, it still exhibits a negative attitude towards the members of the LGBTIQ community. Clearly, this short section cannot do justice to the far-reaching implications that that the study of indirectness can have for our understanding of discrimination in language use. What we hope to have achieved through this discussion of some online reactions to news items in the Maltese press is to have justiï¬ed the need for going beyond the explicitly expressed and overtly communicated meaning when it"

But dependency does not, as is often believed, revoke freedom. In creative interplay, dependency is a prerequisite for maximal freedom, for the freedom of play. Actors know, or at least intuit âthat the true site of originality and strength is neither the other nor myself, but our relation itself.â30 âIt is the originality of the relation which must be conqueredâ so that the play can be a success, a felicitous event. That is why the space surrounding actorsâ relationships is neither the ego of one nor the ego of the other, but their cusp, in between the two. It is the hyphen of the open moment that both separates and joins, like the fond gaze that enables both actors to transcend themselves in play(ing) without losing their own individuality. From the paradox of with-out me, a web is spun between them (Greek: hyphe-web, hyphen-together), held by the finest of threads, and when it works, âwhen the relation is original, then the stereotype is shaken, transcended, evacuated, and jealousy, for instance, has no more room in this relation without a site, without topos.â31 Response and responsibility meet. When all senses are penetrated in this way, and oneâs very existence merges with others, doesnât it bring ethics and aesthetics in the closest proximity? Isnât one precondition of the art of ensemble acting a regard for the exposed defenselessness of the other(s) and respect for the face of the other?32 Through this connection, the actors break through, throw off the pretenses and prejudices their past has conditioned them to carry.

For example, SveuÄiliste did not offer computer sciences at first. So, the only option for students with a Croat background wanting to stay in Mostar but hoping to enrol in computer sciences was to study at DÅ¾emal BijediÄ. From conversations with such students, I learned it was not always easy for them to convince their families that this was the right thing to do. Parents were afraid that they would face harassment and discrimination on the âother sideâ. Another reason students gave for studying on âthe other sideâ was to avoid having to take a difficult entry exam. In the case of national subjects (such as Bosnian or Croatian language and history), however, the barrier seems insuperable even if it conflicts with personal interests. One young history student I met at a seminar for multi-perspective textbook writing told me he is most interested in the Ottoman period. But I was surprised to learn he was studying at SveuÄiliste because I had thought that this period would be taught in more detail at DÅ¾emal BijediÄ. Although the young historian confirmed my assumption, he made it very clear that he, as a Croat, would want to study history at SveuÄiliste."

As indicated above, after conducting 45 interviews, we added a component to the questionnaire, which gauged respondentsâ reactions to the values we have been discussing in this chapter. We asked them which values they considered most important, and which their society did. We had 44 responses from Africa, Australia, Latin America, the MENA region, Russia and Asia. The responses to the added question showed a disparity between the intervieweesâ own attitudes and those they felt prevailed in their own country. Although intrinsic value is popular among the respondents themselves, far fewer thought that it would gain any purchase in society at large. It is also noteworthy that, while the interviewees tended to believe in the social value of the humanities for policy making, they are less sanguine about whether their societies would agree. The same applies to the responses regarding critical thinking and innovation. On the other hand, there is a relative alignment between attitudes on cultural heritage. Yet again, we see that economic value is not something many humanities scholars espouse, though more think that it is something society expects of them.

The concept has therefore often been used to address relationships in primitive but also informal and non-market economies. Reciprocity is the outcome of an array of human exchanges; from altruistic gifts, via market transactions to pure theft, where the exchanged items have been food, services, commodities, land, sacred items and the ultimate giftâthe woman (Levi-Strauss 1966: 204). Reciprocity as an explanatory factor has in anthropological literature been applied to many a context: emotions among Swedish civil servants (Graham 2002); everyday sustainability among sugarcane workers in Brazil (LâEstoile 2014); beggars in Rome (Thomassen 2015); US garage sales (Herrmann 1997); and even in the concentration camp of Auschwitz (Narotzky and Moreno 2002), just to mention a very few examples. One of the examples that Mauss drew on in his book was the kula trading system in the Trobriand Islands. Bronislaw Malinowski, a Polish anthropologist educated in England, was stranded there during part of the First World War and had ample time to investigate the economy, the householding and the intricacies of exchange among the Trobrianders. He described the kula exchange that took place between islanders when visiting each other. This was a ceremonial exchange, used to create relationships and obligations (Malinowski 1966 [1922]). A giver presented a valuable armband or necklace to his host with much ceremonial brouhaha, showing the more or less discreet pleasure of drawing the recipient into a relationship where the latter needed to provide a countergift. This countergift could not of course be reciprocated directly, but had to be given on a suitable future occasion. Noteworthy is that not all exchanges were considered kulaâon the contrary, among the Trobrianders it was important to distinguish them from the barters and purchases of everyday necessities. The quality of things exchanged matters and so does the quantity. The person in society who receives the largest gifts has most status. As s/he must reciprocate, one assumes that s/he has more than what s/he receives, making her/him able to reciprocate with an even bigger gift. If unable to do so, her/his status dwindles. A too large gift, such as almsgiving, degrades the recipient, especially if it is given without expecting a gift back (Mauss 2002 [1990]: 95)."

The US strongly holds that religion should be a private affair; it continually seeks to ally itself with secular forces in the Muslim world and to promote them. These often turn out to be the weakest groups because the overwhelming majority of Muslims, data show, seek more religion in public life, not less. The US is promoting capitalism and hence in effect the affluent way of life associated with it. To many devout Muslims, it seems that Americans worship consumer goods instead of God, and others are further alienated to the point that they cannot find a job or are poorly paid and thus cannot gain even a piece of the life portrayed on American TV and in movies. Promising them economic development or a âMarshall Fund for the Middle East,â which cannot be delivered, just adds to their frustration. Promoting liberal democracy ignores the evidence that many of the nations involved have not yet developed the sociological foundations necessary for such a regime to take hold. The USâwhether dealing with ISIS or other such groups or in addressing the much larger Muslim worldâneeds to appeal to different values than secularism, capitalism and democracy. The answer may be found in the fact that there are basically two different iterations of Islam. One legitimates violence, for instance in the call to kill all infidels. The other abhors violence and holds, for instance, that there ought to be no compulsion in religion. A very large part of the Muslim world, data show, subscribes to the moderate iterations of Islam. However, many of these do not accept secularism or liberalism. Hence, they are best called âilliberal moderates.â One can appeal to them in terms of rejecting terrorism and violence but much less so if one seeks to convince them to embrace other values that Americans hold dear. For fairly obvious reasons, official US agencies are not well-suited to promote moderate Islam as the best antidote to violent Islam. Rather, the best messengers for this message can be found in the Muslim world; they are already in place, but their reach must be significantly expanded. And their message of moderation must not be undermined by seeking to graft onto it values other than doing good without using force."

I explained that even I, a non-developer, had had a lot of fun participating in a session of Llewellyn Falco and that I would like to try it with the teams. I told them I thought it would be fun, and mentioned similarities I saw with some of the online games that I knew the junior team members liked playing in their own time. These games are high paced shoot-âm-ups, in which they acted as a team with a lot of online communication, and I hoped the similarities would spark an interest. A second argument was, via feedback in the retrospectives the teams had raised, that there was lot of difference in the skill level and use of tools between the team members, regardless of seniority and time with the company. Everyone agreed that it would be in the interest of the teams, the individuals and the company to spread those skills more evenly. I emphasized how Mob Programming could help us achieve this. Still, the ï¬rst reactions were lukewarm. Even while stressing that the goal was learning and not delivery, people were complaining about the apparent lack of efï¬ciency. A senior colleague, who was not part of these teams but influential in the company, openly said he would dislike working on a daily basis as was shown in the video. I stressed that if people liked this way of working we could do it more often, but that it was not my goal to make this the new default way of working in the ofï¬ce. In the end, I decided to just try."
51,319,0.991,How Generations Remember,"being actively involved in the war due to their young age, my interlocutors may, like Lomsky-Federâs war veterans, feel that their personal war stories do not pass as âtrueâ stories of the war. But their distancing from the older generationsâ experiences may also be an act of self-protection, as suggested below. Climo (2002) describes a similar phenomenon of distancing autobiographic from group memories in the case of WWII and suggests that it may be a conscious choice when people do not make a connection between their personal and social memories. This may occur when it feels too threatening to put oneself into the recognised historical context. So, by separating personal memories from collective memories, the person feels protected from the difficult collective experiences (Climo 2002: 126; see also Leydesdorff et al. 1999). This would suggest that past war events are so overwhelming and threatening that young Mostarians prefer to remove their personal stories from the wider social context. This avoidance or distancing may well be a constructive (rather than pathological) mechanism for children who experienced war (Jones 2004). Achugar and colleagues (2013) and Larkin (2010) come to similar conclusions in the context of the Uruguayan postdictatorship period and the post-civil war period in Lebanon respectively. They show how young people distance themselves from the past in order to construct a positive self-identification (in the case of Uruguay) and in order to make room for reconciliation (in the case of Lebanon). It is likely that both explanations outlined above are true in the case of the Post-Yugoslavs. They may not feel that their own war experiences count as full ones, not least because this is often suggested to them by older family members. On the other hand, distancing their personal war memories from those of older compatriots may provide a strategy to make room for oneâs future. For the young Post-Yugoslav generation, adopting a victim identity would not only mean having to acknowledge the effect the war had on their lives but would also lead them into having to adopt a passive position. Discursive tactics of distancing and normalising are then utilised in order to cope with the legacy of the war and as a defence against stigmatisation by the older generations as well as to create room for hope for the city to which the Post-Yugoslavsâ lives are inextricably bound (see Palmberger forthcoming). This dynamic is likely to be connected"

These were âthe concept of âneeds,â in particular the essential needs of the worldâs poor,â to whom, it argued, âoverriding priority should be givenâ and âthe idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environmentâs ability to meet present and future needsâ (WCED 1987: 41). To reach these goals the Brundtland Commission urged that: âHuman laws must be reformulated to keep human activities in harmony with the unchanging and universal laws of natureâ (WCED 1987: 271). We will see that mainstream economic theory does not provide much understanding as to how to do this but rather offers concepts that keep us blind to these key points. The urge to âintegrateâ environmental, social and economic concerns led to the expansion of the economic mind-set into the governance of ever more areas of life. This effect has been called the âeconomizationâ of societies and its ongoing trending reiï¬es unsustainable path dependencies instead of helping to unlock them. So it is at least as important to limit the realm of issues to which economics are applied as it is to update the entire discipline. So to what questions do economists claim to provide answers? Perhaps the most widely used and accepted deï¬nition was coined by Lionel Robbins, the famous London School of Economics professor who wrote in 1932 that âEconomics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative usesâ (Robbins 1932: 15). Such alternative uses are also called âcompeting endsâ and Robbins argues that the only situations that fall under economic consideration are those in which choices between ends (going to the opera, sleeping or baking bread) need to be taken because the means (time or resources) are limited. Hence, economic situations are those in which some wants need to be relinquished. This means that economics can explain choice making, but cannot shed light on either ends or means. In fact, it was the aim of Robbinsâ essay to limit the concerns addressed by economics. This focus is reflected in the key ideas and concepts that it puts forward and that I have summarized in Table 3.1. All the ideas in the left column clearly ï¬t into the overarching Enlightenment movement that started in the seventeenth century.

93,478,0.991,Nordic Mediation Research,"Hopkins (2006) argues that commitment to a whole school approach is essential when implementing restorative practices in schools. She sees that it is important to produce a restorative âmindsetâ before starting to use restorative practices. Without understanding the values and principles of restorative approach, practices have no real effects, she states. She found as a critical point that there occurred resistance to a new way of thinking by some staff members and noticed also that lack of support by the head of a school created challenges when implementing the restorative approach. By proper training and careful information these barriers could be overcome, concludes Hopkins. She lists recommendations with which restorative practices can be implemented into the schoolâs everyday life. Hopkins sees that it is important at ï¬rst step to train the school leaders and senior staff to understand the restorative approach and restorative methods. After the training, this group can plan how to train the schoolâs entire personnel and how all the pupils are informed of and trained in the new practices. Hopkins considers it of upmost importance that after the start-up of the activity, there is real follow-up and updates on it to support the restorative approach in the schoolâs everyday life. Hopkins concludes by stating that the restorative approach and methods should be mentioned in the school curriculum, and it is useful for a school to build a network with other schools in which the restorative approach is being applied (Hopkins 2006)."

Different applications require negotiating the consistency vs. performance trade-offs in different ways. The key issue is the applicationâs required degree of consistency, and how to meet such requirements with high performance. Cerone et al. [4] survey a hierarchy of consistency models for distributed transaction protocols including (in increasing order of strength): â read atomicity (RA): either all or none of a distributed transactionâs updates are visible to another transaction (that is, there are no âfractured readsâ); â causal consistency (CC): if transaction T2 is causally dependent on transaction T1 , then if another transaction sees the updates by T2 , it must also see the updates of T1 (e.g., if A posts something on a social media, and C sees Bâs comment on Aâs post, then C must also see Aâs original post); â parallel snapshot isolation (PSI): like CC but without lost updates; â and so on, all the way up to the well-known serializability guarantees. A key property of transaction protocols is the prevention of lost updates (PLU). The weakest consistency model in [4] satisfying both RA and PLU is PSI. However, PSI, and the well-known protocol Walter [20] implementing PSI, also guarantee CC. Cerone et al. conjecture that a system guaranteeing RA and PLU without guaranteeing CC should be useful, but up to now we are not aware of any such protocol. The point of ROLA is exactly to fill this gap: guaranteeing RA and PLU, but not CC. Two key questions are then: (a) are there applications needing high performance where RA plus PLU provide a sufficient degree of consistency? and (b) can a new design meeting RA plus PLU outperform existing designs, like Walter, meeting PSI? Regarding question (a), an example of a transaction that requires RA and PLU but not CC is the âbecoming friendsâ transaction on social media. Bailis et al. [3] point out that RA is crucial for this operation: If Edinson and Neymar become friends, then Unai should not see a fractured read where Edinson is a friend of Neymar, but Neymar is not a friend of Edinson. An implementation of âbecoming friendsâ must obviously guarantee PLU: the new friendship between Edinson and Neymar should not be lost. Finally, CC could be sacrificed for the sake of performance: Assume that Dani is a friend of Neymar. When Edinson becomes Neymarâs friend, he sees that Dani is Neymarâs friend, and therefore also becomes friend with Dani. The second friendship therefore causally depends on the first one. However, it does not seem crucial that others are aware of this causality: If Unai sees that Edinson and Dani are friends, then it is not necessary that he knows that (this happened because) Edinson and Neymar are friends. Regarding question (b), Sect. 6 shows that ROLA clearly outperforms Walter in all performance requirements for all read/write transaction rates. Maude-Based Formal Modeling and Analysis. In rewriting logic [16], distributed systems are specified as rewrite theories. Maude [5] is a highperformance language implementing rewriting logic and supporting various model checking analyses. To model time and performance issues, ROLA is specified in Maude as a probabilistic rewrite theory [1,5]. ROLAâs RA and PLU requirements are then analyzed by standard model checking, where we disregard"
75,186,0.991,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","factors like privacy settings and the chosen communication channels, SNS partly reveal who is connected to whom and how closely. The Ambiguous Roles of Identity, Pseudonymity and Anonymity. With regard to private use of SNS, pseudonymity instead of having a profile with oneâs real identity is frequently practiced, though discouraged. Thus it is possible to differentiate between different roles. Anonymous accounts are usually not possible. By contrast, in professional SNS which often also serve as public calling card directories, pseudonymity would be counter-productive because the users need to get in touch with âârealââ people. Similarly, pseudonymity is mostly dysfunctional in academia. Science communication rests on the premise that you communicate, whatever the medium, with actual persons in order to be able to cooperate or coauthor. In other words, merits need to be attributable: researchers definitely expect that behind a profile in a SNS is another researcher who has actually written the papers listed in the publications attached to the profile. Some SNS try to guarantee this by verifying the identity on registration (e.g. BestThinking). In most cases, researchers also desire to be recognized in order to better establish themselves and increase their reputation. However, there are two cases where temporal or functional anonymity is in the interest of academia: In many fields, the peer-review process is usually double-blind. We may conceive that also the various rating systems within SNS, most of which are not anonymous as of yet, may be implemented in a way that allows anonymous rating. The other case is when it comes to testing new ideas in a creative forum space or during collective brainstorming. Here it may fuel creativity when the relation between callow thoughts and the originator would not be registered permanently in a written archive. For many cases, it seems desirable to create several personal ââmicro-publicsââ which may overlap, but ââallow for distinct fociââ (Barbour and Marshall 2012), e.g. in order to address different fields and audiences, such as peers and students. Is Privacy an Issue in SNS? Mixing private and professional roles is an obvious problem in general SNS (like Facebook) which almost inevitably blend both identities. This is less so in science-specific SNS where the related privacy conflicts are attenuated: We observed that most researchers reveal only their professional identity here. This is usually supported by the set of information one is supposed to enter when setting up oneâs profile: the forms ask for biographical information relevant to academia and less for private facts such as relationship status. Note, however, that even ResearchGate asks for pet books and hobbies, but only receives answers from a few according to our observations. In any case, people using SNS leave their digital marks and traces, and so do researchers. There is currently an intense discussion about privacy concerns in the general SNS. At least some of researchersâ reluctance to join SNS may be explained by fear of losing control over their privacy. In science-specific SNS, the data needed to enable efficient networking based on automatically generated suggestions is to a very large extent professional in nature, such as curriculum vitae, publications, research interests, office contact information, etc. Nonetheless, if researchers are very active on various Web 2.0 platforms, they create significant digital traces that can be analyzed by data-mining tools.

Belnapâs analysis of action in terms of ramified time has the merits of taking very seriously into consideration the temporal and causative order of the world. I follow his approach under many aspects. But I want to take into account the proper intentionality of agents that Belnap ignores. For that reason, agents carry out too many actions in his logic. Suppose that a proposition strictly implies another which is not then necessary. According to his analysis, an agent cannot make the first proposition true without also making the second true, even when the second proposition represents a fact that no agent could bring about or even try to bring about at that moment. Thus whoever repeats an action sees to it that he does that action and has done it in Belnapâs logic. Let me now repeat the principles of my approach.17 In my logic, intentional actions are primary as in philosophy. Some of our actions are involuntary. But any agent who performs unintentionally an action could in principle have attempted that action, and that unintentional action is generated by his or her intentional actions. The basic actions of agents are their primary attempts that are means to make all their other attempts; they generate all their other actions whether intentional or not. Agents know and intend few effects of their basic actions. A lot of their actions are then involuntary. However, not all unintended effects of intentional actions are involuntary actions, but only those that are historically contingent and that the agent could have attempted. In moving we inevitably agitate subatomic particles. Sometimes we are mistaken and we fail. Such events which happen in our life do not constitute actions. Indeed we could not move without agitating particles and our mistakes and failures could not be intentional.18 My logic of action contains a theory of attempt and of action generation. In my analysis, attempts are actions that agents make (rather than attitudes that they have). Attempts are actions of a very special kind: personal, conscious, intentional, free and successful. Only the agent can make his or her individual attempts. No one else can make them. Thus when two agents succeed in doing the same action (e.g. to drink) they do it thanks to different personal attempts (in that case different body movements). Attempts are intrinsically intentional actions. There are no involuntary attempts. When an agent makes an attempt, he or she makes that attempt in order to do something else. Attempts are means to achieve ends. Whoever attempts to make an attempt succeeds in making that attempt, but he or she can fail to reach his or her objective. An attempt is essentially a mental act. Whoever attempts to raise the arm can fail because of an external force. But he or she has anyway mentally made that attempt in forming consciously his or her present intention to raise the arm. Among intentional actions, attempts have then particular success conditions. It is enough to try to make an attempt in order to make it eo ipso. Direct attempts by an agent to move parts of oneâs body are real basic actions. When an agent forms the present intention to make a direct movement, an attempt is caused by the very formation of 17 See Vanderveken (2005b, 2008a). 18 Goldman (1970) notices that certain act properties like misspeaking, miscalculating, miscounting"

Rosa, whom we got to know in Chap. 3, recounted that she had been asked by a neighbor: âWhy do you continue to work when you have two children working for the government?â Rosa told me this to exemplify la mentalidad (the mentality) that circulates among many people. If you have children working for the government they are able to pull strings in order to provide the things you need. And as government workers they are well positioned for getting their hands in the honey jar one way or the other. However, I suggest that it is a highly fictitious intellectual exercise to separate corruption at state level from corruption in other spheres of society (be it the business community or any other public or private institution or enterprise). Corruption is part of multi-vocal bundles of social practices that are thriving upon ambivalent norms and values, socially codified strategies for regulating supply and demand and historical formations of power and privileges. Thus, in essence, we need to understand how templates of corruption are historically dense and intimately intertwined with broader processes of state formation and social relations, forming part of a broader set of discourses and practices embodying and articulating social and political moralities. As this chapter has demonstrated, the Bolivarian discourse harbored on the one hand, a profound tension between everyday realities of social and political life, and on the other, ideals and visions of a different moral order that could engender a more just and harmonious society."

Each of these images circulates and reproduces promiscuously, accruing meanings in excess of their original purpose. Their production and consumption are entwined with a burgeoning capitalism galvanised by the introduction of photography in advertising. William Ransomeâs rationale for using photographic images of Harriet to sell his chocolates appeals to an increasing public appetite for the visual, and for imagistic invocations of pleasure, instead of information in their consumer choices: my plan is a girl. Not an imaginary girl, but a real one. Not only a painted picture, but also a photograph. A real girl. If we put a girl on our boxes, we will sell them faster than we can imagine. She will become the Wetherbyâs girl and when people look at her, and she is pretty and pure and smiling, like someone they might like to know, they will think of us, and they will buy our cocoa (165) â¦ [if] when you drank a glass of smooth cocoa, its froth catching in your beard, if you had one, its sweet warmth caressing your throat, you thought of the girl? Would not that be a clever thing? (234) Here, the commodity, the tin of cocoa or box of chocolates, comes alive, symbolic of something else. The photograph of a girl stands in for the girl herself, becoming âa girl on our boxesâ (165), with the implication being that she is coeval with her image and that consumers will acquire her when they purchase the cocoa or chocolates. Throughout the novel the Victorian era is produced as the origin of our advertising practices and types of image-production and, ultimately, as the foundation for the consumer culture we inhabit today. Gary Day, too, constructs our relationship to the Victorians in terms of continuity; that of Victorian values and of âthe Victorian condition itself: âwhat we understand as modernity and postmodernity can simply be seen as different facets of Victorianismâ (Day, 1998: 2). He argues that whereas JÃ¼rgen Habermas claimed that the division of substantive reason into science, morality and art, so that each becomes the domain of the expert to the exclusion of others, is characteristic of modernity, this is âequally the feature of the Victorian periodâ, in which the reform in universities and in technical education had led to increasing specialisation, undermining the âsynthesisâ of knowledge (ibid.).

147,136,0.991,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"that many of the biases that lead to persistence can be reduced or avoided through the creation of a psychologically safe organizational environment such that ego-protective mechanisms are no longer needed. For example, in a psychologically safe environment, there will be less need to justify to others previous decisions to start and progress an entrepreneurial project, thus âfreeingâ the decision maker to terminate a weak project. Similarly, there will be less need to seem consistent such that the decision maker may be more willing to change the criteria for an upcoming gate. Moreover, as others share this psychologically safe environment, they are likely to be more willing to voice concerns (Edmondson & Lei, 2014) and less likely to penalize those who do, which can have a positive impact on the specifications of stage gates and their use. We believe that these are conjectures worthy of scholarly investigation. For example, what aspects of a psychologically safe environment reduce the likelihood of persisting with a weak entrepreneurial project? Perhaps the creativity generated in a psychologically safe environment (Gong, Cheung, Wang, & Huang, 2012) enables greater flexibility in generating gate criteria. It could be that the learning facilitated by psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999) informs the formation or refinement of and/or changes the potential opportunity to enable it to exceed the gate criteria. However, is there a downside to a psychologically safe environment for an entrepreneurial project? Furthermore, while we have highlighted the possibilities of psychological safety, there are other aspects of organizational climate and culture. Organizational climate refers to âthe meanings people attach to inter-related bundles of experiences they have at workâ (Schneider, Ehrhart, & Macey, 2013, p. 361), such as procedural justice climate (Naumann & Bennett, 2000), voice climate (Morrison, Wheeler-Smith, & Kamdar, 2011), and climates for initiative (Baer & Frese, 2003). Organizational culture consists of employeesâ âbasic assumptions about their work and the values that guide life in organizationsâ (Schneider et al., 2013, p. 361) and includes the notions of clan, adhocracy, market, and hierarchy culture (Hartnell & Walumbwa, 2011)âculture factors that could facilitate the integration of learning into staged decisions in the innovation process. Summary In Fig. 4.2, we offer a sketch of a stage-gate process for entrepreneurial projects. At the start, when managersâ uncertainty is high, decision makers use their initial conception of the potential opportunity to create an"

The experience of solo caring leads to a questioning of mothering as an innate biological vocation and strengthens fathersâ perceptions of primary caregiving as a skill which may be acquired through learning and agency. Even the fathers who are strongly supported and spend less time caring âaloneâ feel that they have changed in this respect. Although they still consider the mother as the natural and competent caregiver, they were surprised to find out that a father can learn the basic skills of motherhood, not only to be able to replace her occasionally but also to be âdifferentâ fathers."
82,42,0.991,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"another proposition. Thorny as the issue may be, the meaning of âjustificationâ cannot be set aside if we want to examine whether chains of justification must be finite or can be infinite. Klein is right that there exist many different accounts of epistemic justification, but it is not so that all these accounts can be used without problem. Some of the accounts will be useful to infinitists, while others might be more advantageous to foundationalists or coherentists. It is therefore important to have an account of justification, however provisional it may be, on which everybody agrees, and then see whether this account allows infinite justificatory chains â and if so, in what sense. William Alston has argued that such a neutral account of justification is impossible.25 In his view, no definition of justification can serve as an impartial starting point or as a tool for adjudicating epistemological debates. Every definition will eventually take sides, and favour a particular position in the epistemological debate about the structure of justfication. Alstonâs advice to the epistemological community therefore is to abstain from attempts at defining justification and instead turn to spelling out what he calls âepistemic desiderataâ. That will be more fruitful for the theory of knowledge than undertaking ill-fated attempts to find a definition of justification. Alstonâs point is well taken, but we think it applies primarily to material accounts of justification, less so to formal ones. As we will argue in Chapter 2, focusing on the formal properties of epistemic justification might generate more consensus than Alston deems possible. Moreover, as we will show in Chapters 3 to 6, a focus on formal properties casts doubt on several objections to the idea that justificatory chains can be infinitely long. In the end, our formal explication of justification provides us with means to preserve many, although not all, of Peter Kleinâs intuitions about the value of infinitism."

360,89,0.991,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"In Chomskyâs view, âit is possible that natural language has only syntax and pragmaticsâ (Chomsky 1995, p. 26); that is, only âinternalist computations and performance systems that access themâ; semantic theories are merely âpart of an interface levelâ or âa form of syntaxâ (Chomsky 1992, p. 223). In his view, then, there is no distinction between semantics and pragmatics, and neither forms a part of linguistic theory. So, in the Chomskean take on the matter, semantic topics such as the meaning of lexical items are a matter for theories other than linguistics to determine. It is a matter of the cognitive systems that describe our beliefs about things in the world which would determine what meaning (and reference) is. Without using the term concept in any technical sense, it would seem that Chomsky endorses the claim made in Definition (3) above, about Emergentism, and denies only that this should have anything to do with linguistics. (Of course, when an Emergentist hears this they will be astonished to hear the âonlyâ in such a sentence, since they believe that this is the fundamental starting point for linguistic theory!) Nonetheless, we can see that this form of Evansâ âtraditional linguistic theoriesâ does not embody his âfoolâs paradise of literalismâ.

299,460,0.991,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Most of the discussions of AI caregivers ask whether or not they couldâor shouldâ replace human caregivers. We already indicated that AI caregivers are best considered as partners rather than as substitutes. The next step is to bring to this field the kind of analysis often carried out in other areas, about human-machine interaction and collaboration (Nakajima et al. 2003). It is especially important to focus on how labor is best divided between the human and AI caregivers. For example, AI caregivers are obviously vastly superior to human caregivers when memory and retrieval of information are at issue. Therefore, they are best charged with recalling which medications a patient has taken and their interactions and side-effects. And they can encourage patients to take their medications, as patient noncompliance is a major issue (Shea 2006). AI caregivers can reward people in physical therapy for repeated exercises, and others for physical exercises to maintain or improve health. A study on assistive robots by Maja MatariÄ et al. found that âpatient compliance with the rehabilitation routine was much higher during the experiments with the robot than under the control (no-robot, no prompting) conditionâ (MatariÄ et al. 2007; see also Fasola and MatariÄ 2013). At the same time, human beings are better at reading between the lines, listening not just to what people say but the way they say it, their tone of voice, and at touching; patients are reported to benefit greatly from such contacts. On many issues AI caregivers are best considered only as the first line of defense; humans are the main one. For example, if an Alzheimerâs patient wandered out of the house or caused a fire on the stove, AI partners are to alert humans rather thanâ at least for the near futureâbe programmed to deal with them directly. It seems most of the work involving the details of partnering between human and AI caregivers has yet to be carried out."

The role of sundhed.dk was to engage and, at the same time, control the partners. This was considered a ââ¦difficult balancing act for sundhed.dkâ to get the regions and municipalities to engage and own the process while at the same time manage and coordinate the efforts (representative, the regions). Building on the installed base of a core set of actors was in this case a doubleedged sword, as one of the informants also stated; âWhat is their [sundhed.dk] strength is also their weaknessâ (representative, SSI). The informant here is referring to the broad alliance of partners, which gave the organization and e-health portal legitimacy, but also made it heavy and inflexible in the sense that many considerations were required for every decision. For example, the prioritization of tasks was described as a politicized decision-making process: âIt is very difficult to be sundhed.dk in terms of serving so many mastersâ (representative, Ministry of Health). The head of administration in sundhed.dk further elaborated on the challenges in decision-making and prioritization processes: âWe cannot prioritize projects ourselves [internally in sundhed.dk]. We need to do that in collaboration with our partners. They have their own interests and local benchmarks and we donât have resources to financially support all their wishesâ. This situation put sundhed. dk in a certain bind. In addition, priorities seemed to shift after certain tasks had been initiated, thus making the daily development of new services cumbersome: âYou can risk that when the economical agreements are made, a politician will suddenly say âNow we need more people to donate their organs, so in 2013 this should be registered on sundhed.dkâ. This was not how it was earlier â we knew very well what we needed to do. Now our partners often want to lift their IT-strategies and projects via the portalâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). Although it complicates development when having to accommodate all partnersâ needs and IT strategies, it is encouraged and part of sundhed.dkâs overall mission. Overall, there has been broad support from relevant players in the Danish healthcare arena, but at the same time, it has been challenging for the sundhed.dk organization to serve so many masters. As time passed, the majority of actors started to question what was in it for them. The regions, who financed 80% of sundhed.dk, wanted to see their requests being realized: âWhen we pay for a service, we also assume that it will appear on the portalâ (representative, the regions). In particular in 2009, when sundhed.dk decided to do most development of services in-house as opposed to development by external consultants, it was a challenge for them to keep up with the pace of demands since âthe pipeline was getting too tightâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). A representative from one of the regions, who argued that the production line was too limited with the consequence of delayed projects, confirmed this observation: ââ¦ there has been a shift from being a client to being a vendor, and this has been a challenge for sundhed.dk. Mostly because the production line has become very narrow [â¦] and there has been too many things that have been important for the regions, but we donât want to constantly discuss prioritizing those services that are included on sundhed.dkâ (representative, the regions). The request for the future was that the organization behind sundhed.dk would be able to develop projects in parallel."
223,325,0.991,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"What Is Semantic Knowledge? What is it that you know when you know a language? Certainly, you know many words of the language (its lexicon), and you know how to put the words together in an appropriate way (the syntax). More important, you know the meaning of the words (the semantics of the language). If you do not master the meaning of the words you are using, there is no point in knowing the syntax (unless you are a parrot). You can communicate in a foreign language with some success just by knowing some words and without using any grammar. In this sense semantic knowledge precedes syntactic knowledge. This chapter focuses on an aspect of semantic knowledge that has not been well studied, its organization into domains. Children learn a language without effort and completely voluntarily. They learn new words miraculously fast. Teenagers master about 60,000 words of their mother tongue by the time they finish high school. In their speech and writing they may not actively use more than a subset of the words, but they understand all of them. A simple calculation reveals that they have learned an average of 9â10 words per day during childhood. A single example of how a word is used is often sufficient for learning its meaning. No other form of learning is so obvious or so efficient. Nevertheless, the semantic learning mechanisms show some strong asymmetries. For instance, why is it easier to explain to a 4-year-old the meaning of the color terms chartreuse and mauve than to explain monetary terms like inflation or mortgage? The difference is not a matter of word frequency: The monetary terms are more frequent, but the 4-year-old masters the semantic domain of colors and thereby knows the meaning of many color words. Adding new color terms is just a matter of learning the mapping between the new words and the color space."
51,289,0.991,How Generations Remember,"their experience of it with WWII or to embed it in a narrative of suffering that goes beyond the experience of war, in the narratives of the Last Yugoslavs the 1992â1995 war stands out as an experience that cannot be connected to any other experience. Moreover, a longing is expressed for the normal life (normalan Å¾ivot), which is tightly connected to the social security and economic well-being people fondly remember from Yugoslav times but also to good komÅ¡iluk (neighbourliness) (see Jansen 2015; SpasiÄ 2012). So, we may say that the idea of normalan Å¾ivot and its connotations are an interpretative template borrowed from Yugoslav times. In this nostalgic discourse Yugoslavia is often remembered as the ideal home, a lost home that can never be regained (Palmberger 2008). Home thus does not represent a geographically defined place but is, as Jansen (2007) vividly shows in the case of BiHâs returnees, strongly tied to feelings of security (Sicherheit), which again is bound to specific needs arising from the stage of life in which people find themselves. For the Last Yugoslavs, pre-war, not post-war, Mostar presents this âsecureâ place. Evidently, only the relatively prosperous Yugoslav period is remembered by the Last Yugoslavs and not the economic decay of the 1980s. Even if social security and equality were central ideals of Titoâs Yugoslavia in order to legitimise the socialist regime, these ideals were never achieved and the system failed to develop progressive redistributive mechanisms. Basic social securities, for example, in respect to housing, health care and educationâoften mentioned by my informantsâwere not as abundant as they are remembered today (see Allcock 2000; see also PeÅ¡iÄ 1988).6 Nevertheless, in the narratives of the Last Yugoslavs the past is clearly set in relation to the present. Considering the extreme difficult economic situation BiHâs citizens face today, Yugoslavia is recalled in a highly idealised fashion and evidently only the relatively prosperous period is remembered and not the economic crisis of the 1980s. In the case of Aida and her longing for Yugoslavia it became clear that a loss of home can be experienced even when one is, geographically speakEspecially in urban areas accommodation was in chronic short supply and, with a few exceptions, only those in leadership positions received housing through their occupational position. In terms of healthcare it has to be said that it was free but medicine provision was not. Education was free, too, but there was limited financial aid available. Moreover, unemployment insurance was not sufficient (Allcock 2000: 192â194)."
305,238,0.991,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"It is, of course, impossible to predict the long-term impact of quantum computing with any accuracy. If we look back at the birth of the modern computer in the 1950s, nobody could have predicted how much computers would change society and how dependent we would become on them. There are well-known quotes from computer pioneers proclaiming that the world would only need a handful of computers and that nobody would ever need a computer in their home. These quotes are out of context. The authors were generally referring to specific types of computers, but the impression they give, though exaggerated, is true. Initially computers were massive, had to be in air-conditioned rooms, and were not very reliable. Today, I have a laptop, a smartphone, and a tablet. All three are far more powerful than the first computers. I think that even visionaries like Alan Turing would be amazed at the extent to which computers have thoroughly permeated all levels of society. Turing did discuss chess playing and artificial intelligence, but nobody predicted that the rise of e-commerce and social media would come to dominate so much of our lives. Quantum computing is now in its infancy, and the comparison to the first computers seems apt. The machines that have been constructed so far tend to be large and not very powerful, and they often involve superconductors that need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures. Already there are some people saying that there will be no need for many quantum computers to be built and that their impact on society will be minimal. But, in my opinion, these views are extremely shortsighted. Although it is impossible to predict what the world will be like in fifty years time, we can look at the dramatic changes in quantum computing over the last few years and see the direction in which it is heading. It might be some time before we get powerful universal quantum computers, but even before we"

As this chapter has shown, many perspectives on social innovations have explicit or hidden normative assumptions that obscure the dark side of the phenomenon: the failures, the conflicts and the oppression of universalistic approaches. As argued in the previous sections, attention for detail and a diverse group can go some way in preventing such assumptions from stifling the debate. In the end, one should always have a few critical questions at hand. Who benefits from the introduction of social innovations? Who loses? Did anything get worse? Common sense also helps. In the context of welfare, many of the problems are what policy science calls wicked problems, such as poverty, addictions and homelessness. These do not have easy or ultimate solutions.

Of course, since the publication of Peter Singerâs influential Animal Liberation (1975), the interests of animals are less likely to be omitted from the utilitarian calculus, but few if any experimenters value animal lives on a level with human ones. Singerâs own commitment to their interests did not extend to calling for the abolition of vivisection, and the balanced position he expressed in 1980 is very close to the view of the medical research community today: The knowledge gained from some experiments on animals does save lives and reduce suffering. Hence, the benefits of animal experimentation exceed the benefits of eating animals and the former stands a better chance of being justifiable than the latter; but this applies only when an experiment on an animal fulfils strict conditions relating to the significance of the knowledge to be gained, the unavailability of alternative techniques not involving animals, and the care taken to avoid pain.

Suffering takes many forms, and the question âWhy do I suffer?â is a basic, existential question that has been posed time and again, ever since Job did it in the âBook of Jobâ in the Old Testament. The story of Job is a story of suffering. The innocent Job is hit by one catastrophe after another because God and the Devil have made a bet as to whether Job will stick to his belief in God regardless of massive misfortune. Jobâs friends are not exactly great friends; they insist that Job must have sinned in order to be hit by such suffering. As they see it, all suffering is Godâs punishment for sinning, and since God is justice incarnate, the punishment must be just: ââ¦those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap itâ (Job: 4,8). They therefore believe that Job must necessarily be guilty but might have forgotten it himself, because you reap what you Until modern times, this was religionâs standard response: Have you been hit by the plague? Surely, you must have sinned. An earthquake? Godâs punishment! That will teach you. This is theological theodicy tradition, which defends God as good and almighty in spite of the existence of suffering. The term itself, theodicy, is a compound of teo = God and dikÃ© = justice. It was introduced by the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646â1716), who added the philosophical remark that suffering is a necessary evil in the best of all possible worlds11 to the traditional religious explanation of suffering as punishment. Supposedly, the reason man cannot see this is due to our limited perspective; but God sees it, and the Lord works in mysterious ways. There are examples of more modern responses in classic literature. The French philosopher Voltaireâs book Candide is a satirical debunking of the perception of suffering as deserved or a necessary evil (Voltaire 1991).

378,162,0.991,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"The beauty of this transformation was that there were far fewer limitations on the amount of money that could be created. But how did this impact the functions of money? This is the key question that Marx was looking at and he showed that the useful public good or social illusion was slowly but surely turned into a private commodity serving the accumulation of ever more ï¬nancial wealth in any form. For Marx, this was one of the essential and speciï¬c features of a capitalist market economy in comparison to other forms of market economies. His original use of the term âcapitalâ expresses the objectiï¬cation of value in the form of ï¬nancial âproductsâ that enable people to not only spend money on buying other commodities but also to apply it, with the sole aim of accumulating more money. Marx expressed the difference by turning the normal money function around: C-M-Câ (the purpose of money is to serve a higher input/output goal of creating something with more use value) becomes M-C-Mâ in which the purpose of money is to make more money. It is applied in any economic transaction that promises more exchange value and thus more ï¬nancial return on investment (Marx 1887: 102â108). What is actually done in this process becomes secondary. Prior to Polanyiâs ï¬ctitious commodities, Marx showed how âï¬nancial capitalâ becomes an input factor just like all the goods whose value it should express. The analogy expressing what he called a socioeconomic âcrazinessâ was the general genus of âthe animal.â Imagine a world in which it would suddenly come to life and interact with lions, tigers, rabbits and all the other creatures that this term had been created to subsume (Heinrich 2005, 76). Making money a âvalue objectâ destined to be sold in markets is the incarnation of an abstract idea that turns debt into wealth. This new commodity, however, is the most desirable of all as long as the conversion belief holds strongly. It does not rot, it needs little room for storage and promises to transform itself into any use value at any time. And for those with more money than their own need satisfaction requires, its application creates even more money without much actual work being required. In several languages we have the expression âmake your money work for you,â which refers to money invested purely to generate interest. This became a strong desire in accumulation-seeking individuals and soon we saw the emergence of private banks and lending organizations. This is where the âpublic goodâ concept of the way a ï¬nancial sector should be set up was very beneï¬cial, although it no longer reflects reality. Public goods serve all of society, so a ï¬nancial sector designed from this perspective would have the role of ensuring that credit could flow where it was needed for use value generation. As a consequence, the fewer the costs involved in accomplishing this service, the"
31,21,0.991,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Traditional definitions of medical death are unambiguous, describing a final event that leads to the absolute state of being deadâin which case the biological death of a human being (idem identity) is co-terminus with the social death of the person (ipse identity). The biological death of a person has narrative consequences in how we may configure personal identity. In the most formal terms this involves correct signification. Being dead signifies a corpse, a state of non-being, for which the personal pronoun in the phrase âI am (a corpse)â is no longer correct. A corpse refers to a husk, and a husk is no longer a person that actively possesses a body. Furthermore, physical death has relational consequences for others. My death, for example, would mean that my wife would undergo a relational/narrative change: that is, my wife would become a widow. Social death concerns our ipse identityâthe narrative identity of who we are. While social death is dependent on having existed, it is not necessarily co-terminus with existing as a biological entity. Real changes in our biology certainly prompt relational changes in how we may configure the narratives of our lives. After a heart attack, for example, there may be a subtle shift in who we understand ourselves to be through what we believe we are realistically capable of doing. This may signal a subtle shift in our personality. Less subtly, brain injury, as argued earlier, can lead to narrative inversions in our clinical status: from a living person that is self-conscious and aware of others, to a living human organism which in PVS is not conscious in this way. A relational change in the meaning of who a person is has both an existential as well as a biological dimension. The narrative of who we are is existentially anticipated in the face of our physical mortality. We existentially configure the meaning of our lives in anticipation of our physical death. This has a secular and religious dimension. In secular terms the meaning of our life matters beyond its physical annihilation. For example: we might suffer a serious brain injury that marks our autobiographical death destroying our dignity; we resonably anticipate being respectfully treated and honestly remembered after our physical life has ended. In spiritual/religious terms we may anticipate who we are and how we might continue in a life hereafter. If one believes that how we treat mortal remains matters for a disembodied life hereafter, then the burial rituals associated with keeping the corpse intact take on a special ânarrativeâ significance."

212,687,0.991,Life Cycle Management,"Last but not least, users have to be extensively trained to gain the necessary understanding on sustainability and life cycle assessment, which inevitably requires time and significant resources. Most users have a background in nutrition, food science, process engineering, or packaging technology, which provides them valuable insight in their focus area. In order to be able to make meaningful decisions on the environmental impacts of the products they develop, they need to expand their skill sets to include this topic. It cannot be expected that the quality of the assessments is comparable to that of a trained LCA specialist at the beginning. NestlÃ© has trained the designers with the LCP board game, a âseriousâ game to learn about the concept of life cycle assessment that has proven to be very powerful (Fig. 25.1). But an initial training course is not sufficient. Practice and frequent use of the tool, along with"
356,84,0.991,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Conclusion The feedback towards the scenarios and their development process was positive. Stakeholders felt that the process of evaluating their own current levels of innovation and designing scenarios that increased the level of innovation in at least one dimension was a useful exercise. The maturity model framework allowed them to establish a shared vocabulary and a means of analysing their own understanding and expectations. The process gives the opportunity to be creative, and to think laterally about how technology can be used. Furthermore, the introduction of the idea of trends, an abstract concept, made stakeholders more aware of context. Having scenarios allowed a way of sharing best practice. Some participants recommended that the toolkit be incorporated into teacher training in order that stakeholders would become familiar with reï¬ecting on context and practice in this structured way. It could also be integrated within national professional development structures. Facilitators and trainers mediating the process would beneï¬t from targeted support on the use of the toolkit and should be supported to use the toolkit in their own practice. In relation to lessons learned, the scenarios which were selected show the importance of ownership. A greater range of scenarios are implemented if the stakeholdersâparticularly teachersâare responsible for their creation. The process also shows how stakeholders need support to recognise and integrate trends and challenges into their practice but that these need not be abstract and can address issues affecting them not only at a national level but also in the classroom. The resulting scenarios must not be rigid either. They are intended to be inspirational and must allow ï¬exibility in implementation according to the context and the resources available. Finally, there are implications for policy and practice; the toolkit has been designed to be used at national, regional and school levelsâpulling in all relevant stakeholders in a structured manner. The methodology allows relationships to be established with industry, research and policy makers. As discussed by those who used the toolkit in Cycle 5 the Future Classroom Toolkit would be especially applicable in countries where the toolkit clearly supports current policy directions.

13,253,0.991,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"The Battle of Gender Equality The middle generation established their own families in the 1960s or earlier, before the Womenâs Movement or modern gender equality politics gave words and direction to the discontent they felt with their own parentsâ model of gender complementarity. But that a mental change had already taken place is seen in the fact that none of the women imagined becoming full-time housewives as young women, but wanted to combine family and work. They did so by choosing jobs where this balance was easier to accomplish (teacher or nurse), working part-time or staying at home only when their children were young. They wanted to combine a life inside and outside of the family, and they also wanted a more open and equal relationship with their children than they had experienced with their own mothers. Many of the women remember some pressure from parents and in-laws, who were alarmed by their returning to work after maternity leave and who feared the negative consequences for the children. The fact that the women ignored this critique indicates the presence of a new generational project from the women, even though it was not yet formulated in terms of gender, and even less in feminist terms. It appears not to have included much reflection on gender relations in the family either. As we saw in the previous section, the womenâs emotional reactions to their childhood family included negative feelings towards the housewife-mother, not towards the working father. This may have made them initially blind towards the fact that a change in the female role in the family also presupposed a parallel change of the male role. The question of what husbands thought about their wives taking up paid workâa pertinent question in the previous generationâdoes not make sense anymore. The men we interviewed did not seem to have reflected much upon what consequences their wivesâ employment would have for their own situation. Many of them said in the interviews that they knew they wanted to be closer to their children than their own fathers had been and to contribute to an emotionally better upbringing. However, this is seldom formulated either as a wish to share the work at home in general or to engage less in work outside the family."
378,111,0.991,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,The technical term for what has become the ârepresentative agentâ in mainstream economic models is âHomo economicus.â Its character is the embodiment of the ï¬rst law of the human condition: constantly seeking to improve the hedonic calculus and constantly comparing and competing with others over scarce resources and best offers. The costâbeneï¬t analyses that this agent undertakes lie at the heart of explaining human behavior and the choices that should be expected. The ï¬nancial crisis has shown how helpful the resulting predictions are for complex real world dynamics. But this is not the topic at hand. We want to stay with the assessment of how key ideas and concepts of the mainstream economic paradigm not only limit which development solutions are imaginable and justiï¬able but also how their incorporation in culture and institutions drives societies away from sustainable outcomes.
152,178,0.991,interdisciplinary Perspectives On Mortality and Its Timings : When Is Death?,"authorities must do all that could reasonably be expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have, or ought to have, knowledge, although the Court did recognise that this obligation must be interpreted in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities.12 A government committed to the right to life must, therefore, not merely refrain from killing, but also govern in a manner that seeks to preserve human life wherever reasonably possible. Arguably, the most important principle underlying the right to life is not the sanctity of life but rather a requirement of respect for all human life.13 The right to life protects all living human beings (with some lingering ambiguity about its application before birth (Vo v France (App. 53924/00), 8 July 2004 [GC], (2005) 40 EHRR 259, ECHR 2004VIII). As discussed above, under the BSD definition of death, that includes patients in PVS whose brain stem continues to function even if the aspects of their higher brains which made them who they were have been destroyed. Does the state have an obligation under the right to life to maintain the life of patients in PVS? It would appear not. The landmark English case of Airedale NHS Trust v Bland confirmed that it is lawful to withdraw life-sustaining treatment (commonly artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH)) from a patient in PVS. The key to the legality of such a course of action is that it is no longer regarded as in the best interests of a patient in PVS to receive the life-sustaining treatment. In the absence of patient consent, medical treatment can only be provided if it is in the best interests of the patient. The best interests test was developed at common law in a very different context (non-therapeutic sterilisations) but is now at the core of the statutory regulation of persons who lack capacity. Section 4 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 requires that all decisions about persons lacking capacity are taken in their best interests and includes a checklist of factors to be taken into account in determining that. When applied to a patient in PVS, this means that a decision has to be taken whether continued treatment (usually comprising ANH) is in the patientâs best interests and, if it is not, then it must (rather than may) be withdrawn. Under the Mental Capacity Act, the best interests test is more patient-focused than before, with a requirement to take into account the patientâs own past wishes and feelings, values and beliefs, rather than merely medical evidence as to prognosis. The latter is still likely to be very significant, however, and thus it is still not an entirely subjective test of interests. In Bland, the Law Lords were adamant that the relevant question was whether treatment is in the patientâs"
379,14,0.991,"Tobacco Control Policy in The Netherlands : Between Economy, Public Health, and Ideology","Idealists in the tobacco control field may expect that the presentation of scientific facts will automatically result in rational policy decisions, and when this does not happen a common explanation is that the tobacco industry has been successful in casting doubt on the evidence and in lobbying to delay regulation (Larsen, 2008). The industry is certainly well known for casting doubt on science, misleading politicians, and opposing or delaying tobacco control (Baba, Cook, McGarity, & Bero, 2005; Bornhauser, McCarthy, & Glantz, 2006; Costa, Gilmore, Peeters, McKee, & Stuckler, 2014; Lie, Willemsen, De Vries, & Fooks, 2016; Tobacco Free Initiative, 2008), but pointing to the tobacco industry as the sole reason for why governments do not take action is a gross simplification. Although efforts by the tobacco industry to prevent and delay tobacco policy making are important factorsâand I will present many details on how this was done in the Netherlandsâthere are many other factors that one must take into consideration if one wants to understand the nuances and complexities of tobacco control policymaking. With this book I move beyond the mainstream tobacco control literature which often assumes that knowledge on smoking risks leads, or should lead, to tobacco regulation. I want to explore what can be learned from insights from public policy research. I have already found a superficial glance at this rich literature rewarding, as it offers many insights that are immediately applicable to the tobacco control field. It can teach us, among other things, that public policymaking is not a rational, linear process starting with the identification of a problem, followed by selecting the best solution, finalised by adopting, implementing, and evaluating. Such models of knowledge transfer do not do justice to what happens in the real world. It is not so much that âknowledge plays no part in tobacco control, but that it is just one factor among many other policy determinants, and one that needs a political interpretation to have a policy effectâ (Larsen, 2008, p. 764). Indeed, progress in tobacco control is a function of the internal dynamics of the policy process itself, and it has been argued that a more profound understanding of the political dimensions of health policy will help âto better anticipate opportunities and constraints on governmental action and design more effective policies and programsâ (Oliver, 2006). Understanding these dimensions is crucial for those who want to contribute to more effective policies, including to so-called endgame strategies that may eventually eradicate the sale and consumption of tobacco products (Cairney & Mamudu, 2014; McDaniel, Smith, & Malone, 2016)."
108,65,0.991,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"trafficking of people, weapons, drugs etc., was established as in all conflicts, with various actors using violent means to establish their territories (meaning here primarily not physical territory).2 Partly, because of this professor, Mary Kaldor has described this form of conflict and this specific conflict as a new form of war. Kaldor thus writes that she has identified a new form of war which has emerged since the Cold War, involving more or less organised violence between different parties (often not states). The motives behind this phenomenon are many and varied. As I put a theoretical perspective of my own on the conflict, I would like at this point to dwell a little on Kaldorâs ideas, ideas which have met some criticism.3 Her view of the informal economy as the driving force behind the war is essentially correct; she makes a fundamental point when highlighting the presence of the criminal world as an influential force. In bourdieuan terms, one could refer to a changing social field. That said, I would like to take issue with many of the theories she promotes. One problem is that history shows us plenty of examples of the fact that the parameters for the ânewâ wars already have existed and still exist; it is easy to recognise the phenomenon from history. The informal economy is not new, certainly not where war is being waged. People in the West today are used to regarding war as something that takes place between sovereign states. However, one does not need to look too far back in time to see the processes that Kaldor describes as part of just about every nation-building process that has occurred in Europe (this is probably also true for other parts of the world, but certainly holds generally throughout Europe). She highlights globalisation as a new contributing factor to this new type of war. It must be said that the consequences of war now have a more wide-ranging influence, but that this should affect events in a qualitatively new fashion remains to be proved. Breeding grounds for unrest have taken on a new significance within criminal circles, when all sorts of illegal transport make its way through the lawless country like electricity conducted through copper.

Really cosy here! There is nothing negative about this room (Girl, 13â15 years). Another typical answer related to the fact that children could do things in the waiting roomâthey did not have to sit passively and wait: â There was a lot of toys here and that was nice. Itâs lots of things to do (Girl, 10â12 years). â I like the waiting room because there are lots of fun things to do here, for instance play Wii, or relax (Boy, 10â12 years). â You can do a lot here. I wish my room was like this! (Girl, 10â12 years). A third quality that the children appreciated was the ability to relax in the waiting area. â It is nice here, and there are no kids here so it is nice because it is mostly quiet. And I have relaxed and it was good so I really had a good time in the waiting room (Girl, 10â12 years). â I liked the waiting room because of the [massage] chair. It was really good to sit in it while I relaxed and some of the people who work here talked to my mum so I sat in the chair (Girl, 10â12 years). Referring to Rasmussenâs (2008) study, ÃstrÃ¶m and Rejmer (2008) argue that childrenâs responses in interviews suggest that they appreciate and notice the colours, toys and furnishing at the Barnahus. From the perspective of the children who participated in the survey on Norwegian Barnahus, child-friendliness is also connected to the activities that the waiting area invites and the choice between relaxation and play or entertainment. These possibilities are important in both the concrete and symbolic sense; they offer children a sense of agency and they can choose the level of activity that suits them in the situation."
363,129,0.991,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"system (425). Rolandâs confession of love recognises this paradox: âI love you ... It isnât convenient. Not now Iâve acquired a future. But thatâs how it is. In the worst way. All the things we â we grew up not believing in. Total obsession, night and day. When I see you, you look alive and everything else â fades. All thatâ (506). His avowal of love acknowledges that all such declarations must always be citations but also that in his quotation he has, as Umberto Eco puts it, âsucceeded, once again, in speaking of loveâ (Eco, 1984: 32â3). In the dialogue of mutual possession so integral to the novelâs representation of reading and loving it is the imagination that holds in tension theoretical knowingness and the desire that subverts it. The ways in which love can be spoken becomes more interesting than the ways in which it cannot. Ventriloquising Ash and LaMotte enables Roland and Maud to relinquish some of their self-possession in order to take possession of the other, and be possessed in turn. This is represented by the scene in which they make love. It is figured as both possession and dispossession, and the language Byatt uses signifies death as well as life. Or, more specifically, a life that inheres in death: in the morning, the whole world had a strange new smell. It was the smell of the aftermath, a green smell, a smell of shredded leaves and oozing resin, of crushed wood and splashed sap, a tart smell, which bore some relation to the smell of bitten apples. It was the smell of death and destruction and it smelled fresh and lively and hopeful. (507) Byattâs use of sex as a vehicle for characterising Roland and Maudâs mutual possession captures the paradox of life coexisting with death, of self-possession cohabiting with dispossession. In this novel, love destroys autonomy and self-possession, and yet it is also somehow necessary to the individual, and much desired. Or, as Belsey writes, âdesire is inevitable (ânecessityâ) Christabel calls it, twice â¦ and at the same time dangerous â beyond the pleasure principle, destructive, angry, âa wrecker,â as Maud puts itâ (Belsey, 1994b: 696). Love, in this romance, embodies the paradox of âpossessionâ itself; it involves possessing the beloved, but at the same time, being possessed, possession and dispossession. Bronfen, too, observes that in the novel âto take possession in love need not always mean that the beloved is reduced to an object of possessionâ (Bronfen, 1996: 132). This is the lesson that Roland and Maud must learn. They must rethink, or, more precisely, re-feel the theoretical position they have"

The German phrase for âto learn by heartâ is auswendig lernen, literally to learn by turning outward. Such learning turns both inward and outward. It is a process with two mutually reinforcing aspects that belong together. Not until this process of incorporation is complete has the text been completely understood, not just by the intellect, but by the entire body. Incorporation of a text is a complex learning process that functions similarly to the digestive system.25 It takes time. It is often misconceived as a mechanical act of repetition, tedious learning by rote as so many people remember doing at school. But it is more than that. An actor needs to almost eat his text, and to do so with enjoyment, like a gourmet delicacy. He must chew slowly and thoroughly, and the more his appetite increases, the richer the text becomes. The nuances of flavor are only brought out by slow and repeated chewing. If in contrast an actor simply swallows his text quickly, or if he inhales it mechanically as quickly as possible, its quality is lost. It is understood only superficially. Undigested. Not until all of a textâs elements have been broken down has it been processed completely. Only then can it be drawn from by an actor while playing, without effort, automatically and reliably. A text that has not been incorporated completely can disappear. In the heat of emotions it is forgotten. The actorâs memory is a clean slate and his feelings have erased it. The actor draws a blank, as it is called. And even if he remembers his lines, the text is still only âhot air.â The audience sees an excited actor, but does not really understand why. That is boring, and the audience soon loses interest. But if a text has been incorporated, remembered with the physical body, then affect, logic, and logos are joined and can be released to play at any time. The text can be repeated at will as if reinvented, as if it had just been found, giving pleasure to all. And it can be repeated not just once but again and again and again â without ever becoming rote or mechanical. And the more poetic a text it is, the richer it becomes through repetition, since more can be found and understood in it and thus played with all the more."

Children who are not able to discern the thoughts and feelings of others are more likely to behave aggressively and experience peer rejection (Denham and others 2003), and children with both âinternalizingâ behavior problems characterized by depressed, withdrawn behavior, and âexternalizingâ behavior problems, characterized by aggressive, angry behavior are more likely to have difficulty in school (Rimm-Kaufman, Pianta, and Cox 2000). 9. The fetal origins hypothesis posits that âconditions, most likely nutritional, âprogramâ the fetus for the development of chronic diseases in adulthoodâ (Rasmussen 2001, p. 74); for a recent review, see Almond and Currie (2011). 10.

There is no doubt that events and circumstances at the community level are important to shape childrenâs experiences. However, in this book, we focus on the role of interactions between children and those caring for them at home, the daycare center, and in schools and therefore communities is not a central issue of this book. 13. âIn development science, the term âsensitive periodâ is generally preferred to âcritical periodâ because it implies less rigidity in the nature and timing of formative early experiencesâ (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000, p. 195). 14. Unfortunately, in this specific application, better information did not lead to the changes in behavior required to reduce obesity rates in the long run. 15. As an incomplete contract in the presence of asymmetric information, childcare services are defined as an experience good. Although the economic transaction between parents and childcare providers is very straightforward (paying for childcare services), the resulting relationship between buyers (parents) and sellers (childcare providers) is rather complex. First, the contract between parents and the provider is a highly incomplete one because it is impossible to specify how the provider should act in every possible circumstance. Second, parents cannot observe what happens in the center while they are away, and children can communicate only partially information about what goes on there (thus, there is asymmetric information). Third, providers may overinvest in aspects of quality that are easy to see by parents, such as infrastructure, and underinvest in process quality (that parents do not see and/or do not know how much it matters for child outcomes). 16. The direct provision of a standardized childcare service by the public sector may substantially reduce the information gap between providers and government, but it is not clear if it makes the parents more informed. If the childcare services provided directly by the public sector are all very homogeneous, then parents may actually have less incentive to acquire information about quality. Moreover, if the level of quality varies little among providers, then"

13,278,0.991,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"The men who shared childcare and domestic work and were not divorced also thought the feminist rhetoric of the 1970s was over the top. Their distaste for radical feminism also has to do with their preoccupation with preserving sexual and psychological gender differences. The idea of equality in sharing the work within and outside of the family in a fair way is a much more acceptable idea than feminism and womenâs rights. In contrast to the women, educational level does not interfere much with their standpoint on gender equality; rather, it is the practice in their own family that guides their view, in addition to a relatively close match with their parental identifications. Those who had positive relationships with their mothers are in most cases positive to the idea of gender equality, although their practice may lag behind, and those who have daughters are even more so. The men who have traditional arrangements in their marriage have the least to say about gender equality. The upper middle-class men Ragnar and Magne say that this is not an issue that engages them much or that difference is exactly what they find attractive about the female gender. This emphasis on sexual difference does not necessarily lead to a negative stand to homosexuality. Two men, both with traditional gender arrangements in their families, make references to homosexuality. One is Magne, who says that he believes more diverse sexualities will become a normal thing in the times to come:10"

Like Rorty, he is clearly annoyed with a project that has demanded so much from so many and has delivered so little.4 Our concern with epistemic justification in this book is in fact secondary. When we aim to say something interesting about the issue, this is not because we aspire to define epistemic justification as such. Rather, we want to find out whether, and if so to what extent, it makes sense to speak of infinite justificatory chains. The major proponent of infinite chains in epistemology, Peter Klein, has argued that the latter objective can be achieved without the former. As he sees it, we need not unduly exert ourselves to understand justification, for the meaning of epistemic justification is irrelevant to a discussion about the possibility of infinite justificatory chains. We can merrily discuss the pros and cons of infinitism without worrying about what exactly justification means, since infinitism is consistent with the many different accounts of the expression âA j justifies Ai â. Klein lists five of those accounts, adding that the list is not exhaustive: 1. if A j is probable, then Ai is probable and if A j is not probable, then Ai is not probable; or 2. in the long run, A j would be accepted as a reason for Ai by the appropriate epistemic community; or 3. A j would be offered as a reason for Ai by an epistemically virtuous individual; or 4. believing that Ai on the basis of A j is in accord with oneâs most basic commitments; or 5. if A j were true, Ai would be true, and if A j were not true, Ai would not be true.5"

These three outputs are clearly tangible beneï¬ts. Scenarios can be used or adapted by any of the stakeholders. They provide a ârealisticâ inspiration for teachers. From scenarios, speciï¬c Learning Activities can be derived which leads to a change in practice (see Chap. 3 on Learning Design). Moreover, by having a narrative that relates to desired practice it is easy for all stakeholders to comprehend the scenario and analyse and reï¬ne it collaboratively. At a national level the scenarios can relate to educational policy in the real world and allow for an exchange and comparison of approaches. The Future Classroom Maturity Model is also of tangible beneï¬t. It enables stakeholders to reï¬ect in a structured manner on the current levels of innovation within schools, local and national contexts. This is important because shared understanding allows stakeholders to identify what needs to be done to actually innovate practice. It also leads to discussion around terminology allowing stakeholders to deï¬ne what is required and analyse the current situation. Thus stakeholders can be explicit about current status and develop a shared vocabulary. Similarly the Future Classroom Toolkit itself is of tangible beneï¬t. It provides a structure for the creation of scenarios, and a way of thinking about practice embodied in the modules. The process enables the stakeholders to reï¬ect on who are required to input to the scenario, what issues need to be addressed, what technology will be used, etc. The toolkit is a forum for the exchange of ideasâstakeholders will have differing views on what is important to them, as well as ideas around what factors will be inï¬uential that have not necessarily been identiï¬ed previously. In addition to the tangible products there are generic intangible beneï¬ts for stakeholders: the ï¬rst being an appreciation for individuals of the potential of scenarios and their role in changing education. Also, there is a growing understanding that innovation is relative to the context and that it is equally important that practice advances incrementally rather than just aiming at radical innovation. The Maturity Model approach highlights that it is often better to move up one level at a time rather than introducing new technologies and practices for teachers and students without the experience and knowledge to use them effectively. The model also acknowledges that many factors lead to innovative practices, and technology is only one aspect. A second intangible beneï¬t is the creation of a relationship between the stakeholders. Through the process of scenario creation, stakeholders learn to share their viewpoints and engage in strategic dialogue around the direction of policy and practice."
346,417,0.991,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","Middleton and Edwards 1990). Efforts to change these representationsâe.g. by promoting âprejudice reductionâ interventions through intergroup contactâmay not always be successful or may actually work to strengthen dualisms of good/bad and perpetrator/victim (Dixon et al. 2012). Yet, if such dualisms are so rigid and the cycle of nationalism is simply renewed every time through different means, then one wonders about the prospects of collective action for reconciliation. This tension is particularly evident in historical narratives taught in schools in many conflict and post-conflict societies, whereas such narratives provide a framework through which children make sense of and lay claim to a national collective memory (Davies 2004; Siegel 2002). History curricula implore students to remember the nationâs glories, leaders and warriors through practices which aim at establishing a historical consciousness that âaligns forgetting with evil forcesâ (Eppert 2003, p. 186) that threaten to destroy the nationâs identity and its very existence. In fact, one of the functions of collective memory is to highlight the victimhood of the in-group and silence the traumatic experiences of the out-group members, what has become known as one-sided victimization narrative (Bekerman and Zembylas 2012). However, students and teachers are not dopes answering the mandates of âpolitics of memoryâ (Todorov 2003; Simon 2005). Instead, a sense of rupture with official historical narratives and essentialized identities may be grounded in the notion of dangerous memories, for this idea challenges assumptions that âtransmitted memoriesâ are endlessly powerful and thus can facilitate conflict transformation processes. Dangerous memories are not a particular kind or function of memory that can be isolated and defined, points out Ostovich (2002, 2005); rather, they are âa disruptive practice of and from memoryâ (2002, p. 239, added emphasis). Any memory can become dangerous when it resists the prevailing historical narratives. what makes though a memory to be disruptive and therefore valuable to facilitate conflict transformation? Dangerous memories are disruptive, for example, when they call for solidarity with the âenemyâ on the basis of common human suffering. These kinds of disruptions come as dangerous memories when we remember events of the past that question our consciences and assumed horizons; âdangerousâ, then, takes the meaning of challenging, critical and hopeful while propelling individual and collective consciousness into a new process of narrativization.

His model is based on six basic assumptions concerning the divergence of adult learners from children: â¢ Adults need to know why they need to learn something before undertaking to learn it. â¢ Adults have a self-concept of being responsible for their own decisions, for their own lives. â¢ Adults come into an educational activity with both a greater volume and different quality of experience from youth. â¢ Adults become ready to learn those things they need to know and be able to do in order to cope effectively with their real-life situations. â¢ Adults are life-centered in their orientation to learning. â¢ While adults are responsive to some external motivators, the most potent motivators are internal pressures (Knowles et al. 1998, pp. 64â68) Whether researchers found that their studies agreed or conflicted with Knowlesâ criteria it still served as the basis of their work. Many of them refer to other theorists like Jack Mezirow, Paulo Freire or Lev Vygotsky and authors of social constructivist theory like Albert Bandura, JÃ¼rgen Habermas or Michel Foucault."

Christie (1977) pinpoints that mediation is a possibility of discussions as communities, i.e. âopportunities for norm-clariï¬cationâ. He expands this point through a description of the losses potentially involved in upholding the conventional legal process: It is a loss of pedagogical possibilities. It is a loss of opportunities for a continuous discussion of what represents the law of the land. How wrong was the thief, how right was the victim? Lawyers are [. . .] trained into agreement on what is relevant in a case. But that means that it is difï¬cult to stage what we might call a political debate in court.

262,32,0.991,"Reality Lost : Markets of Attention, Misinformation and Manipulation","Few people like being ignored, not seen nor heard by others. As individuals, we crave at least minimal dose of attention from other people and need it to thrive, both as children and adults. A lot of people just canât get enough, judging from the present-time celebrity and reality television culture. The pursuit of fame as reality star on TV or as a micro celebrity (or micro influencer) on social media may look like a pursuit of attention for the sake of attention itself (Marwick 2015) (Fig. 1.3). Once in possession of peopleâs attention, it may be transferred to others. If a stage performer points to one person in the audience, a large part of the audienceâs collective attention will be transferred from the performer to the happy fan. If you have peopleâs attention, you can channel it to another person or product and monetize it. This is the principle in overt sponsorships and product placement alike. When the name of the firm goes on the playerâs T-shirt, or a media darling is paid to wear a brand visible to the cameras, the advertiser is purchasing into the audienceâs attention. Marketing is intrinsically linked to attention harvesting. The aim of marketing is to influence behavior. Marketing is about persuading consumers into buying a certain product or voting for a specific candidate. No persuasion happens if no one is listening, reading of watching. Attention is the portal to peopleâs minds and a necessary condition for all successful communication; from teaching and knowledge presentation to persuasion, seduction, and manipulation. This makes attention extremely valuable for everyone with something to sell. It is the main factor in all forms of marketing, branding, and advertising (Teixeira 2014). Models of marketing qualify different levels of attention, ranging from no attention to partial attention (due to multi-"

378,167,0.99,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"The following summary is thus also the conclusion of this chapter. It briefly runs through the four big ideas listed in Table 3.1 and why they fall short when we seek to understand how to satisfy human needs while respecting natureâs law. The discussions above have shown that they are scientiï¬cally flawed. Yet, through their materialization in todayâs market and government structures, these ideas have become very real in their impact on people, their decision-making and their freedom to do things differently and more sustainably. The reflexive ontology behind this book sees the opening up of worldviews and belief systems as the ï¬rst step in system innovation strategies: identify which arguments, practices or laws are built around flawed assumptions and ideas and understand how they hamper more sustainable developments. Engaging in transforming such path dependencies will of course always be a highly political, contested and power-ridden process whose outcome no one can predict. But shedding vested intellectual interests often comes before shedding economic vested interests: sense and legitimacy of the status quo start crumbling and alternative practices multiply, inspired by an emerging imaginary that there are indeed alternatives. Trying to understand the world by dividing it into pieces creates an imaginary in which the relationships and generative rules underlying system dynamics get lost behind numbers and detailed descriptions of the individual pieces. This atomistic view of mechanical systems suggests that the single items remain unchanged and between them one can detect and thus manage linear and reproducible causalities in an additive or subtractive approach. System dynamics are viewed as predictable and controllable as long as the properties of the individual parts are understood well. There are no time delays or feedback loops that allow one to anticipate the fact that stopping a particular cause will no longer stop a particular reaction once system dynamics have reached tipping points. General ignorance of the Tyranny of Small Decisions is related to this: large output changes need large input changes. It is this âparticleâ worldview or paradigm that leads to the common juxtaposition of incremental versus radical change. But applying this view to complex systems ï¬lled with humans is not helpful, as the ï¬nancial crises show. Using it to inform strategies of human need satisfaction offers very little insight about the matter it is supposed to address: utility or happiness is a relative and context-dependent experience and not a thing that can be privately held and hoarded. Meanwhile, natural capital is a web of life and not a"
185,137,0.99,The Essence of Software Engineering,"1.1 Why ask the Question? In addition to the sheer intellectual joy of pursuing a hard, fundamental, and potentially unanswerable question, there are additional more pragmatic reasons for thinking about the essential nature of software. One such reason is that if there are others who work with software then it might be possible that their experiences in doing so might be of value to those of us who work with computer software. Other software practitioners might have encountered problems and issues that are analogous to those that concern us. In doing so they may have found some effective approaches to some problems that frustrate us. At the least, their struggles with analogous problems might at least underscore the universality and importance of the problems. Indeed idiosyncrasies of the problems posed in these analogous domains might well provide new perspectives on the problems that might be useful to us in our own work."
360,427,0.99,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"2 Background Concepts can often be paraphrased by expressing an underlying implicit relation between the concepts (flu virus is a virus that causes flu). Previous research has found that relational information plays a central role in the processing of combined concepts (for an overview, see GagnÃ© and Spalding 2014a). The interpretation of combined concepts involves selecting the appropriate relational structure, and factors associated with the use of the relations affect the processing of the combined concept (e.g., combined concepts that share a recently used relational structure and a constituent are processed more easily than those that use a different relational structure, and these effects are true of both novel and known combinations; see GagnÃ© and Spalding 2014a). However, such relational interpretations provide only the gist (i.e., a paraphrase) of the combined conceptâs meaning (e.g., that a dog house is a house for dogs) and do not exhaust our knowledge of the combined concept. Where does the rest of the meaning come from? For example, imagine that someone hears, for the ï¬rst time, the phrase dog house and that they know the meaning of dog and house. Now, suppose we ask this learner, do doghouses have doorknobs? There are several interesting points to note. First, the gist interpretation house for a dog, does not, in and of itself, give the answer to the question. Second, the gist is not unrelated or irrelevant to answering the question. The person might reason that because dogs do not have hands, a doorknob would not be likely. Clearly, though, this is an inference based on the gist, not something that is inherently true of the combination of the concepts dog and house. Third, to be more explicit, note that dog and house could also be combined to form a gist something like house that has a dog, and this type of doghouse would be highly likely to have doorknobs. The key point for the current chapter is that answering the question requires an inference about the speciï¬c combination (and gist). Our primary research question concerns how people make judgments about whether or not particular properties are true for a given concept. In terms of empirical evidence, we will focus on property veriï¬cation in combined concepts, which refers to how people determine whether a particular characteristic (e.g., âis heavyâ) is true"

The most important soft skill for software testers is having good communication skills. The demand for soft skills seems to be stable over the years. However, we found that the trends in these demands are changing. There is an increase in the skills requirements regarding being a team-player, fast-learner, independent-working and having openness and adaptability skills. The trend could point to an increase in the number of responsibilities for testers. It may be that software testers now have to be involved in more aspects of the development pipeline: from creating software to managing it, quality-check it, building it and releasing it. It could also mean that projects themselves have changed the structure, becoming smaller and more open to changes, and people working on them must adapt to this new way of developing software. Additionally, we identiï¬ed new skills that employers want software testers to have: work ethics, customer focus, pro-activeness, responsibility, ability to work under pressure, focus on details, focus on quality and commitment. Exhibiting professionalism in oneâs work, delivering ï¬nished work and trustable results get more into the focus of employers. We expected that testers working in agile environments are requested for signiï¬cantly more team-playing, communication, interpersonal and fast learning skills.

252,41,0.99,The Ethics of Vaccination,"to be in a childâs best interest, and parents have an ethical obligation to act in the best interest of their children, at least when doing so requires reasonable efforts and the interest being protected is deemed important enough (as seems to be the case for an interest in health preservation and as is certainly the case for an interest in survival). Unfortunately, it is more controversial than it might appear to argue that the best interest of a child can ground an ethical obligation to vaccinate oneâs children. For one thing, as we shall see in a moment, in certain circumstances it is not so clear that it is in a childâs best interest to be vaccinated. Furthermore, even if vaccination is in a childâs best interest, some parents might still claim that they have the right to make autonomous choices about their childrenâs health and about what goes into their childrenâs body. What I have just said about child vaccination applies a fortiori to adult vaccination. While in the case of child vaccination one might argue that parental refusal to vaccinate their children presents a conflict between a childâs best interest and parentsâ right to make autonomous choices about their childrenâs health, the same refusal in the case of adult vaccination does not seem as ethically problematic. At least according to contemporary liberal ethics, principles of self-determination and of bodily integrity outweighs any paternalistic consideration about a competent adultâs best interest: if a competent adult autonomously decides not to be vaccinated, the fact that vaccination might be in her best interest does not seem to imply that the adult in question ought to be vaccinated or ought to be forced to be vaccinated. Besides, as was the case with child vaccination, it is not so clear that adult vaccination is always in the adultâs best interest. Since this last claim has probably raised an eyebrow or two, allow me to elucidate it. Of course, vaccine denialists do share the view that parents have a moral obligation to protect their childrenâs health; however, as we have seen in the first chapter, they do not believe that vaccination sufficiently protects their childrenâs health. While vaccine denialists undoubtedly overestimate the risks of vaccination, we have to concede that, as a matter of fact and for reasons different from the ones they defend, sometimes it is really not in a childâs best interest to be vaccinated. How so? Even those of us who see vaccines favourably cannot deny the fact that vaccines can have side effects, some of which can occasionally be quite severe. Vaccine injury compensation funds (Mello 2008) adopted in many countries, such as the US and the UK (Looker and Kelly 2011) exist precisely because side effects can happen. For example, the MMR vaccine can cause anaphylactic reactions, and according to some controversial evidence (CDC 2018a). The seasonal flu vaccine can cause Guillain-"

The three demand an effort of distancing capable of converting the biography and premises of work into an object of inquiry. Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2009: 125) offers a second contribution, suggesting that reality cannot be reduced to what exists, but requires also a sociology of what is missing and a sociology of what is emerging.4 A third perspective, upon which this chapter is mainly based, is Michael Burawoyâs call for public sociology, a sociology which addresses wide publics and asks for whom and for what knowledge is being produced. Burawoy (2007: 243) identifies four spaces of sociology: professional sociology, written for other specialists, which has the greatest legitimacy and recognition; the sociology of public policies; critical sociology; and the one he underscores as the main challenge, public sociology. Some critics have reservations about whether public sociology will effectively be able to subvert the hierarchies within the discipline (Hays 2007); others ask how far public sociology recognizes the asymmetries between sociology and subordinate fields of knowledge, such as Latino studies or ethnic studies (Nakano Glenn 2007). A greater doubt is to what degree this debate about public sociology enters into a dialogue with similar perspectives in the global South (see Burawoy 2007: 254 for an exception). Following Patricia Hill Collins (2007: 21), this chapter asks whether and how we who work critically in migration have âbeen making public sociology without knowing itâ (emphasis in the original). It asks too in what ways these debates are enriching our work in a period in which the institutional weaknesses of the Central American universities and the predominance of international cooperation priorities leave few possibilities for new generations of social scientists to be able to enjoy stable work options from which they can respond to the needs for knowledge of the dispossessed peoples in the region. Both the views of de Sousa Santos and Burawoy require us to reflect on the ways in which power/ knowledge relations are forged in migration research."

And there is the real will of a canton-city to have a politics that reintegrates people (iIII, p. 8). But if we look more attentively at the core values that are mentioned in the party programmes and also by our interviewed stakeholders, we can also see shared deep core values, characterised by notions like solidarity, humanism, individual responsibility, respect for people and equal access to social opportunities. But with respect to the policy core, meaning the strategies used to attain the identified deep core, and even more the secondary aspects, we notice significant differences that correspond to classical right- and left-wing dichotomies regarding the role of the state, its legitimate fields of intervention and, consequently, the amount of public taxes that have or do not have to be spent in these fields. This agreement about deep core values, sometimes accompanied by a massive divergence in the policy core, is particularly pronounced in the fields of childcare and unemployment."

A reason for not being able to calculate the correlation of the tools is that they cover slightly or even not at all some of the practices. An example of this is the Smaller and Frequent Product Releases practice. OPS includes four questions, while on the other hand, PAM and TAA have a single question each. Furthermore, Appropriate Distribution of Expertise is not covered at all by PAM. In case the single question gets a low score, this will affect how effectively the tool will measure an agile practice. On the contrary, multiple questions can better cover the practice by examining more factors that affect it. The same practice is measured differently. Something interesting that came up during the data analysis was that although the tools cover the same practices, they do it in different ways, leading to different results. An example of this is the practice of Refactoring. PAM checks whether there are enough unit tests and automated system tests to allow the safe code refactoring. In case the course unit/system tests are not developed by a team, the respondents will give low scores to the question, as the team members in Company A did. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the team never refactors the software or does it with bad results. All teams in Company A choose to refactor when it adds value to the system, but the level of unit tests is very low and they exist only for specific teams. On the other hand, TAA and OPS check how often the teams refactor, among other aspects. The same practice is measured in opposite questions. The Continuous Integration practice has a unique paradox among TAA, PAM and OPS. The first two tools include a question about the members of the team having synchronized to the latest code, while OPS checks for the exact opposite. According to Soundararajan [18], it is preferable for the teams not to share the same code in order to measure the practice. Questions phrasing. Although the tools might cover the same areas for each practice, the results could differ because of how a question is structured. An example of this is the Test Driven Development practice. Both TAA and PAM ask about automated code coverage, while OPS just asks about the existence of code coverage. Furthermore, TAA focuses on 100 % automation, while PAM does not. Thus, if a team has code coverage but it is not automated, then the score of the respective question should be low. In case of TAA, if the code coverage is not fully automated, its score should be even lower. It is evident that the abstraction level of a question has a great impact. The more specific it is, the more a reply to it will differ, resulting in possible low scores. Better understanding of agile concepts. In pre-post studies there is a possibility of the subjects becoming more aware of a problem in the second test due to the first test [26]. Although the testing threat, as it is called, does not directly apply here, the similar surveys on consecutive weeks could have enabled the respondents to take a deeper look into the agile concepts, resulting in better understanding of them, and consequently, providing different answers to the surveysâ questions."

The Perform program involved a number of companies with their own work cultures, yet participants seem to have developed trust (as explained in our results section) both from top to bottom (as illustrated by the Programme Directorâs âLet the people who know how to work, work!â, and trust between teams as described in understanding that teams needed to be shielded during an iteration. Agile methods with focus on transparency and feedback loops are well suited to develop trust. Other practices such as common work spaces and shared lunches also created a form of identity and stimulated contact, both of which increased the level of inter-team trust. The amount of open and informal communication and decisionmaking has been shown to be indicators of how trust develops [46]. Additionally, trust literature shows that trust develops if there is more interpersonal contact [47]. There is a negative relationship between team size and interpersonal contact. This relation between team size and trust might explain why the agile methods seem to work better in smaller organisations compared to larger ones. However, relationships within teams and the context around teams are not static. Hence the static nature of the practical models does not align with the reality of how relations develop in multiteam systems. Reflective sessions such as retrospectives used in Perform and described in both SAFe and LeSS will likely influence the amount of trust. Practices, artefacts and roles facilitate and stimulate coordination, yet one very influential factor hardly receives attention: the human. For example, literature on trust tells us that it does not develop easily across team boundaries [34] and that it influences"
386,14,0.99,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"Institutional economists have devoted a lot of energy towards the question of why persons would choose either hierarchies or markets as coordinating mechanism of their interactions. Three important factorsâasset specificity, frequency and uncertaintiesâhave been identified in the wake of this research which had a strong predictive power on the level of transaction costs in this context and therefore would also influence organizational choices: â If the specificity of assets is high, this creates a strong mutual dependency which suggests a long-term hierarchical organization rather than short-term trade on markets. Courses in milking technology will rather be organized in an intra-firm setting than courses in presentations. â The more often a transaction takes place, the more transaction costs can be distributed. Frequent transactions may rather be organized within one unit and in a hierarchical framework, so that repeated negotiations may be avoided. â Uncertainty increases transaction costs, so that long-term hierarchies may be chosen to avoid such uncertainties. The advantages of hierarchies are that human resources can rather flexibly be reallocated, mental work can be distributed and shared more flexibly than in a pure market setting and a well-established communication system is also more easily established within a hierarchy. More than half a century later than Ronald Coase, Ostrom (1990) introduced coordination as another important mode of interaction, showing that often people chose to jointly work for a common goal by neither trading nor submitting to each other. Everyday examples for cooperation are traffic, sports or associations. If we think about the most beautiful incident of our life, it is likely that we find it in the realm of cooperation, be it a romantic encounter, an occasion with our friends or joint work. While economists love to talk about utility maximization, they tend to neglect the fact that it is unlikely that individual utility maximizations, added up, will lead to a societal optimum by itself. It is true that, as economists often emphasize, cooperation suffers from possible opportunistic behavior like the freerider phenomenon. It is often possible to exploit a team to which I become a member by contributing less than benefitting, sometimes to the point of the collapse of the system. The spirit that joint and mutual actions produce, however, is nevertheless driving many people to, again and again, enter attempts of successful cooperation Fig. 1.1. Having mentioned cooperation and hierarchies as important occasions of interaction, they have never made it into the core domain of economic analysis. It is no"

Regarding the limitations of this study, we have to consider that generalizability of qualitative research findings is usually not an expected attribute, since qualitative research studies are meant to study a specific issue or phenomenon, involving a certain population, and focused in a particular context. In our study, for example, although the study participants have different profiles and personal experiences, some traits of culture can be typical of the Brazilian developers. Therefore, we can not assume that our results apply outside the specific setting in which it was run. Besides, the number of participants in this study may not be sufficient to generalize the results. Another validity concern is the possibility of researcherâs influence on the qualitative data analysis. To mitigate this threat, we have adopted the thematic analysis as a systematic method following a pre-established protocol. Also, the results of the analysis were reviewed by the other two authors. Regarding study participantâs, despite most developers had no previous experience with TDD, it may be that oneâs personal experience has influenced their particular opinions and perceptions. In future work, this issue can be better analyzed. Acknowledgements.

We have different thresholds for trust depending on the risk of the decisions that have to be made and this in turn depends on impact of decisions-see Fig. 9.3. This figure shows the relationship between decision impact, trustworthiness and trust. Life-threatening decisions, such as our choice of neurosurgeon have a higher threshold for trust than merely inconvenient decisions such as our choice of lawyer to settle a contract on a house. Consider PARO, a robot that resembles a baby-seal designed to assist the elderly similar to pet therapy. If PARO malfunctions, very little is lost to the humans who rely on it. But if a rescue robot malfunctions during an evacuation human lives are at stake.

Theoretically, one could measure the extent to which they live up to their particular societyâs set of values. Such a score, however, would be of limited merit because it would be high for societies that set low standards for themselves or values that are considered to be of little virtue in the eye of the observer. Religious extremist societies, such as the ISIS caliphate, are one such example of a society that would score high on such a measurement of the extent to which a society lives up to its own values. Instead, such a measurement should be based on adherence to a universal set of values, such as measured by rates of child abuse, corruption, and volunteerism in a given society (Etzioni 2011). Because there is only moderate consensus about what these universal values should be, different"
187,320,0.99,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"The above-described structured approach to doing V&V has a number of advantages that make it more effective and more efï¬cient than doing V&V in a less structured way. Below some of the key advantages are discussed. The right starting point for the V&V effort leads to more effective results The V&V effort should start from the perspective of risk. Who runs the real risk in an M&S endeavour? It is not the modeller, not the implementer (maybe there is a risk of repetitive strain injury) and not the person who executes the simulation (maybe if there is a moving base simulator). In general the real M&S use risk is found when the M&S based results are applied in the real word. Therefore V&V processes that are developer oriented might miss the real risk. Also, when studying the 4-world view in Fig. 5 it may become clear that possibly many more aspects may need to be considered than just the domain knowledge as coded in a simulation. Thus organizational aspects that may make or break the use of simulation, the level of proï¬ciency of all people involved, the processes used to derive the products such as the Operational Needs, etc. may all play a signiï¬cant role and may need to be included in determining the overall utility and thus in the V&V approach. If such a very broad scope is used it becomes clear that a domain oriented V&V process may also miss some aspects. Therefore a general methodology that starts at the true M&S use risk and that can incorporate domain speciï¬c elements as well as other aspects will result in a more effective V&V result because the right starting point can be chosen and all relevant aspects included. Balancing resources with needs leads to efï¬ciency and effectiveness A structured decomposition of the Acceptance Goal into all aspects that are relevant and on top of that a decomposition of the contribution of the M&S use risk attached to the Acceptance Goal leads to the possibility to spend the available resources for the V&V effort wisely. Based on priorities related to the contribution to the overall M&S use risk it can be decided which parts of the decomposition requires more or less effort. When available resources do not allow testing all aspects to their maximum, i.e. in all practical situations, it can be decided to let the goals with low contribution to risk remain undeveloped. In that case it should be explicitly recorded that that goal is not used in the rest of the V&V work, see âKnowledge of the completeness of the V&V effort leads to effectivenessâ below. If nodes are developed to the point where tests can be deï¬ned, the contribution to the M&S use risk can be used to make choices for tests. Low contribution to the risk allow for cheaper tests"

Models are attempting to simulate this. But the current versions of ice sheet models, even when trying to simulate these bottom (basal) lubrication processes, have not been able to get much mass loss at a rapid rate, and not as fast as observations over the past 20 years or so. This is a serious deï¬ciency in model evaluation, and one reason why projections of sea-level change are so uncertain. But as new processes are discovered, this may change. Or maybe estimates will be revised downward as we better understand the simulations and pieces of them. As long as we know what is missing and what the uncertainty is, we can gauge whether a prediction is wrong, and also in what direction. Is a projection an overestimate or underestimate? Or an upper or lower limit? Thus, what really makes a projection âbadâ is overconï¬dence, or underrepresentation of uncertainty. Often uncertainty is stated somewhere, but not presented well or ignored. The lesson is always to try to understand a projectionâs stated uncertainty. This is true in general, not just for climate models. The best practice for using models is to go back to the model documentation or description to make sure a proper representation of uncertainty is available, and an analysis of the model ï¬t for the purpose is assessed. For example, projections of changes to a phenomena based on models with a bad representation of the present phenomena (like the South Asian summer monsoon, for example) may fall into this category."
262,109,0.99,"Reality Lost : Markets of Attention, Misinformation and Manipulation","Citizens and journalists alike, as well as politicians (especially if they are under pressure), often call for political substance. Political substance concerns solving societal problems and improving social, economic, or cultural conditions in the long run. Politics is much about creating results; otherwise, it simply crumples to reality TV, horse races, and drama. The fundamental value of a political itemâits political substanceâmay be established by its capacity to represent a societal problem. By being placed on the agenda, light may be shed upon it; it may be deliberated and acted upon. Trivially there are ideologically founded differences among various political parties pertaining to what should be considered societal problems and their order of priority. In Denmark, for instance, equality is seen as more of a problem by the left wing than by the right wing, and the opposite goes for high taxes. However, there is still quite a consensus that political issues such as unemployment, immigration, crime, and domestic violence are indeed social problems that need solving. These problems will not get solved politically, if the political debate loses its substance. If too much attention is spent on symbolic messages, signal policies, and debating for the sake of debacle without any potential of reaching concrete results, other than perhaps a further polarization of the political fronts. Swaths of the scarce attention in such cases go to political items with no actual content. What is being debated and sucks all oxygen out of the public space in a political bubble is not, for instance, how best to solve integration problems or address the current refugee and immigration crisis. Rather, it is the sending of a signal to the public germane of who the sender is and where that per-"

Of course, the act of waiting on the semaphore has the effect of decrementing it, so the second thread to arrive will have to wait until the first signals. I have indented the update operation to show that it is contained within the mutex. In this example, both threads are running the same code. This is sometimes called a symmetric solution. If the threads have to run different code, the solution is asymmetric. Symmetric solutions are often easier to generalize. In this case, the mutex solution can handle any number of concurrent threads without modification. As long as every thread waits before performing an update and signals after, then no two threads will access count concurrently. Often the code that needs to be protected is called the critical section, I suppose because it is critically important to prevent concurrent access. In the tradition of computer science and mixed metaphors, there are several other ways people sometimes talk about mutexes. In the metaphor we have been using so far, the mutex is a token that is passed from one thread to another. In an alternative metaphor, we think of the critical section as a room, and only one thread is allowed to be in the room at a time. In this metaphor, mutexes are called locks, and a thread is said to lock the mutex before entering and unlock it while exiting. Occasionally, though, people mix the metaphors and talk about âgettingâ or âreleasingâ a lock, which doesnât make much sense. Both metaphors are potentially useful and potentially misleading. As you work on the next problem, try out both ways of thinking and see which one leads you to a solution."

First, there are a number of issues and topics in the philosophy of action related to free will that are made more precise by the stit logic developed in FF, which philosophers who deal with action theory (usually only in informal ways) would do well to take note of. The distinction between the achievement stit and the deliberative stit (pp. 32â40) is particularly important in my view for discussing issues about free will. The achievement stit involves an earlier moment of choice or action that guarantees the later outcome A of an action. The deliberative stit, by contrast, is evaluated at the moment of choice itself, the very moment at which the agent sees to it that the outcome A will occur. The outcome A is guaranteed by the present choice at the moment of choice itself. Both achievement"

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"Rectifying these inconsistencies and inaccuracies can be a long and costly process (Samaoli 2007), requiring no little time and money if back-and-forth travel is necessary in order to present oneâs correct credentials to bureaucrats in both countries, or attend court judgements, and so on (Hamadache 2002). Such toing-andfroing between administrations in both countries is another example of how states may enforce mobility on the least resourceful (Gehring 2015). For those who are older or whose health is failing, the burden of going to court (and the time that will take) may simply not be worth it. Badr, whose remark about French colonial administrators not doing their job correctly was quoted above, does plan to get his papers corrected at some point. Presently however he hesitates because it is a timeconsuming and complex administrative process. First he needs to find 12 witnesses who will vouch that he was born in 1948 (this is stipulated by Moroccan law, since he needs a new Moroccan birth certificate). Then the case passes to a tribunal and a judge will make a decision. Of course, this is only the Moroccan side of the story, and he is well aware that it would take far longer than his once-a-year month-long holiday in Morocco to arrange, which is why he has not done it yet. It will then be necessary to change all the documentation and records held by the French authorities too. Self-Inflicted Problems and Timetabling Other problematic biographical records are more accurately portrayed as self-inflicted, generating considerable suspicion from administrative authorities.

186,185,0.99,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"of development will inevitably lead lives of greed, excess and ultimately destruction and death (Koran 76:3; 96:6). Despite these gifts, human beings are imperfect. They can become alienated from their fetrah and weak and restless (Koran 4:28; 70:19). As noted earlier, humans generally fall into two groups: one that develops its talents, and another that destroys them by resorting to force and deception (Koran 21:80; 16:76; 7:191; 29:17). If one stays steadfast in fetrah, weaknesses will become strengths and dignity will be increased. However, if perspectives shift away from tawheed, life forces will become transformed into forces of death, leading to tyranny, death and destruction. The Koranic explanation of human alienation reminds us of a fact we often ignore, namely that human rights are intrinsic to human beings. Each person, as a vicegerent of God, is born free, born a leader. Before human beings assume any belief (religious or otherwise), they have rights and a responsibility to defend these rights, as well as those of any other person irrespective of belief, race, nationality, ethnicity and so on. In other words, rights are not given to people through agreements among humans; we are born with them. This is in line with the interpretation of dignity as an intrinsic property for rational beings, leading to rights, as in Kant; and for all human beings, as Godâs gift, as in Catholicism. In Islam, one cannot gain or lose rights by believing or disbelieving in any speciï¬c belief system, including Islam. There is no compulsion in religion (Koran 2:256). A person has, among other rights, the right to turn towards religion. However, a Koranic lesson that is highly important is this. So long as people want to remain free and are conscious of their freedom, it is impossible for a power to emerge that would lead to the loss of freedom and rights. Such a power emerges when people become alienated and forget freedom, rights and dignity. No one can revoke oneâs dignity but oneself, and only when one defends rights does one become Godâs vicegerent on earth. Like many constitutions around the world, the Koran claims that dignity is inviolable and already embedded in human nature, as noted by Abraham (Koran 16:120â123), who spoke on behalf of humanity. In defending dignity and rights, humans are never alone; God is always with us, and we will emerge victorious in the end. But why are freedom and rights intrinsic in human beings? Neither can be deï¬ned by any principle other than tawheed. In this context, some would argue that one personâs freedom begins where anotherâs ends. However, if this deï¬nes freedom, can we argue that every individualâs knowledge stops where anotherâs starts, or that one personâs creativity ends where anotherâs begins? Or can we argue that our talents for justice, friendship and love end where those of others start? If we argue this way, we can see that power is embedded in this deï¬nition of freedom, as without it we cannot say that one freedom ends where another begins. Force is the absence of freedom. Hence, if we reduce freedom to exercise force, then each individual becomes a prisoner of the freedom of others, and relations become power relations. It is obvious in this case that the stronger will violate the freedom of the weak. Within power relations, freedom, human rights, human life and nature become casualties."

The present, however, is somewhat enigmatically situated on the cusp between these two: is it settled, like the past, or unsettled, like the future? (Often âunsettlingâ, to be sure, but unsettled?). The technical issue associated with this query is this: should the valuation V in models for branching time assign values to atomic sentences at moments or should it instead assign such values at moment/history pairs? We might call these the static and dynamic views of moments, respectively. When we consider moments to be analogs of possible worlds, each associated with a maximal consistent set of basic facts and their consequences, we expect the atomic formulas to be true or false at a moment, even though more complex formulas involving tense operators must be evaluated at moment/history pairs. This is the view that a moment is a state through which some histories pass, and that the atomic formulas of the language are purely stative and should therefore be determinately true or false at any given state. On such a static view, the valuation should assign a truth value to each atomic formula at each moment, rather than at each point of evaluation. This has the odd result that some formulas get truth values at moments, but most only get truth values at moment/history pairs. We then have an odd contrast between points of valuation (moments) and points of evaluation (moment/history pairs), and a correspondingly odd contrast in treatment between atomic and non-atomic sentences. If, on the other hand, we hold that formulasâall formulasâhave truth values only with respect to a point of evaluationâa moment/history pairâthen in the absence of further constraints the valuation is free to assign different values to the same atomic formula at the same moment, but along different histories. Then, for example, âthe cat is aliveâ can be true at m/ h 1 and yet âthe cat is deadâ be true at m/ h 2 . If the cat in question is Schroedingerâs, suffering from that malaise known as quantum uncertainty, this might seem a desirable feature of the system. Similarly, âI choose c1 â and âI choose c2 â could be true at the same momentâthe moment of choiceâbut along distinct histories. On this view, then, atomic formulas do not (or perhaps do not all) express states. They are (some of them, at least)"

Furthermore, environment disturbances coming from connections with live entities may impact the behaviour of the M&S system. During the execution of the model, human input can become part of the displayed behaviour. This can be from trainees, but also from operators such as opponent players to provide stimuli to the trainees or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) that interfere with the execution of the simulation for some purpose dictated by the Simulation Frame (e.g., keeping the execution within a desired regime). So, all in all the M&S process consists of cutting away all elements of the real and imaginary world that are not needed for the purpose at hand, then apply various abstraction techniques to make the model suited for use, then the model is executed in order to obtain results (e.g. a trained operator or an optimized CI conï¬guration). These results are then applied in some form or another in the real world. And that last part is exactly where the risk exists. When the M&S-based solutions to problems are applied in the real world there is a risk that those results are not fully appropriate. There can be a number of causes: the purpose for the M&S endeavour was not what was ultimately needed, maybe the simuland did not contain all needed elements of the real and imaginary world, maybe some abstractions were too large and important details were abstracted away, maybe the implementation and execution of the model or the interpretation of itâs results introduced errors. If the results of M&S are never used in the real world, e.g. if it is used for entertainment purposes or as a hobby, then there is no problem. But for CI this is not the case. The possible sources of errors may for example lead to operators of actual CI taking wrong actions if M&S was used for their training. If it is used for determining the best possible conï¬guration of interconnecting CI, it may result in a system that performs less than desired. The conclusion is that we need to be sure that the M&S results are ï¬t for purpose before actually applying them to the real world. There are two processes that do exactly that: Veriï¬cation and Validation. Therefore the take away message of this part is âYou have to do Veriï¬cation and Validation because there is risk involvedâ."

277,108,0.99,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"3.3.2 The Effect of Policy Differences With our earlier observation that the share of foreign citizens residing in a country depends not only on past immigration levels, but also on policies regarding naturalisation we touched upon an aspect in immigration research that complicates comparisons even further. While it is true that agreements have been reached in the European Union on the definition of some of the major concepts that relate to the process of migration â albeit after long deliberation â it has proved to be much more difficult to arrive at some common standards on how to measure immigrant integration (see also Chap. 7). This can be explained to a large extent by the fact that European countries differ significantly in their views on how concepts such as integration and social cohesion should be understood and on what role public policy should play in facilitating such processes. This is not the place to elaborate on differences in objectives that countries may define for their integration policies (see, for example, Scholten 2011), but it requires little effort to understand that a policy of multiculturalism requires data that differ from those needed when policies are oriented more to assimilation. In the former case, for example, governments may wish to know how many children attend classes in mother tongue teaching, whilst in the latter case they will be more interested in knowing how many are fluent in the national language. In the foreseeable future it is not very likely that consensus will be reached at a European level on a definition of immigrant integration and on the indicators used to measure it and to assess the effectiveness of relevant policy instruments beyond the limited â and ambiguous â Zaragoza indicators (see Eurostat 2011). Certain oft-used indicators are not always as clear-cut as they may seem. Segregated housing, for example, is usually seen as the outcome of unfair selection processes and discrimination, and therefore as reflecting a lack of integration. But what if members of a migrant community deliberately choose to live close to co-ethnics or co-nationals, a choice that automatically leads to concentration and, as a logical consequence, to segregation of other communities? And what if a high frequency of contacts with the home country is seen as a sign of lacking integration, as is often the case, while in reality research has shown that migrants with frequent transnational contacts also maintain frequent contacts in their country of residence, usually taken as a sign of integration (Snel et al. 2006)? Thus, one has to be very careful in interpreting immigrant behaviour and in drawing conclusions from it concerning their integration. That commonly used indicators can be interpreted in such different ways makes it extremely challenging to achieve consensus on how the process of immigrant integration should be understood and measured in a comparative perspective. A final question that arises in comparative research on immigrant integration has to do with reference groups and benchmarks. The following example may clarify this point. Labour force participation among immigrants is generally seen as a reliable indicator for their integration. Now take an immigrant community, say the Turks, which in country A has a labour force participation rate of 70 %, while the"

It is in our opinion, however, not that simple: Methods cannot be differentiated into good and bad, and if a particular method fails to provide results (or even more often: results beyond tautologies), then this probably says more about their competent handling, rather than their validity or reliability. Exceptions prove the rule, of course. In our view, there are two aspects to consider that influence methodological choices. First, it all depends on why the evaluation is needed, what the goal of the evaluation is, and who the recipient of the evaluation data is. For example, if the target is to feed back into psycho-pedagogical or technological development, qualitative means can provide deeper insights on what has gone wrong, what works, and what leaves room for improvement. Moreover, qualitative methods bear the potential to discover, why this is the case."

The young doctor now has the opportunity to describe the condition of the child patient, but decides not to do so. He wants to cope with the situation on his own, without support from senior colleagues. During the night, a complication occurs with the patient, and the young doctor can again choose to consult a senior doctor, but decides not to do so, thinking that he can and should handle the situation by himself. The patient is sleeping, and the young doctor believes that the complication can be dealt with when she wakes up in the morning. The patient dies, and would most likely have survived if she had received proper, routine treatment during the night. When a hospital faces a situation of this kind, it is a test of its ability to perform an autopsy without blame (Collins, 2001), or a calm and clearheaded analysis of the chain of events where the main attention is on causes, rather than blame. It appears that the young doctor has made passive mistakes in (i) not consulting the senior doctor before he went off duty, and (ii) not calling for help when the complication happened during the night. From one perspective, these are personal mistakes for which he is accountable, while from another perspective, they are systemic mistakes. A verdict depends on whether the hospital has clarified expectations about doing things together rather than one by one. Both the real and fictitious examples of junior doctors who want to impress have a past, present, and future dimension, with corresponding questions (Table 1). It may be that the principle of seeking help when you are in doubt or at the limits of your own capabilities seems so obvious that it should Table 1"
93,193,0.99,Nordic Mediation Research,"7 Linguistic Analysis As we conducted our analysis of substance and creativity, we found the agreements strikingly similar in structure and language. This motivated us to do a third analysis of our material: an examination of the âverbal wrappingâ of the mediated agreements. We focused our investigation on examining whether the agreements reï¬ect a standard linguistic practice and, if so, what the characteristics of this standard practice are. In the tradition of critical discourse analysis and among others Fairclough, we understand language as not just a neutral tool that depict a reality (Fairclough 1992). Rather, we understand language as a social practice that plays a role in shaping our perception of identities, roles, social relations etc. (JÃ¸rgensen and Phillips 1999; TÃ¸nnesson 2008). Hence, we can learn something about a practice by studying the discourse used in that practice. Nordic mediation literature has different approaches as to who should write the agreement. Some ï¬nd that agreements are naturally written up by the courtconnected mediator (e.g. Kjelland-MÃ¸dre et al. 2008), while others ï¬nd that the parties and their advisors should do the writing (e.g. JÃ¸rgensen and Lavesen 2016). In all of the mediations in our observational studies of court-connected mediations meetings mentioned above (Adrian 2012; Mykland 2011), either the mediator or the partiesâ lawyers authored the agreement. Based on these observations combined with the linguistic appearance of the agreements in our dataset laid out below, it seems safe to assume that either the mediator or the lawyer drafted the mediated agreements that we analyse."
309,262,0.99,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"Concomitantly, the choice of products in such contexts was often very selective, limited predominantly to vegetables and fruits for the children. Going the extra length financially and by adding to the regular shopping routine in order to provide the familyâs children with the perceived safest food not only indicates the weight that is put onto the childrenâs health. It also hints at a form of responsibilisation in which it is the task of the individual to protect the health of those unable to exercise choice by themselves, namely children. The role of responsibility for the familyâs health as a pivotal moment was not limited to the interviewed shoppers but also voiced by the organic entrepreneurs. Minh, founder of the organic delivery service started farming based on organic principles on family land in order to provide himself, his family and friends with healthy food: âBecause I care [for] my health and [for] my familyâs health. And I think some of my friends they need my productsâ (Interview, 10/2015), a decision that later evolved into a business. Organic entrepreneur Hoa explicitly described expecting a baby as the pivotal moment that drew her attention to the health aspects of eating: So before 2013 I was not concerned about what I eat, I donât care, I donât know about organic. But when I was pregnant in the first 3 months I was sick, sickness of pregnancy, so I did not eat anything except raw vegetables. So whenever my mom or my husband bought vegetables from outside to bring home we always need many things to clean it. Take time to clean it and people still worry about vegetable chemical effects [being] not good to my baby and my health. So I spent time on the internet to find out, to discover about safe food and organic. So I thought that organic is the highest safety standard in the world. (Interview, 01/2016)"

Following this detachment, she can draw even more disabling similes ethically, for example, picturing herself as putting a safe return bracelet around Hankâs arm, while their little dog triumphantly lifts its paw (28), or showing Hank, next to their dog, conï¬ned by a baby-gate (104), as if to say that the patient needs more control and surveillance than the family pet. That Hank is usually depicted as slightly stooping further suggests Spohrâs perception of his helpless inferiority. Against this background, the most revealing statement remains Spohrâs ï¬nal confession that, suddenly, after Hankâs death, her life is âempty, without focus. For ten long years Hank has been the center of all my thoughts and activities. His illness has controlled every waking and sleeping hourâ (208). Spohrâs caring for Hank is her actual coping strategy that helps her not only to deï¬ect the pain but also the awareness and anxiety about losing the husband himself; personal feelings for him cannot rise up, as he is being reduced to the mere origin of her caring strategies.33 Reï¬ecting on Spohrâs need to provide testimony and offer advice to fellow caregivers makes one wonder how caregivers write about their experience â and, hence, portray their spouse â twenty years later. This question is pertinent, given how societal dementia awareness as well as caregiving approaches have changed since the 1990s. A recent caregiver manual, for example, summarises: studies have progressed from a focus [ . . . ] on the burdens of caring to research which focuses more on the interrelationship underpinning care giving and receiving [ . . . ], and more recently [ . . . ] where these interrelationships become the focal point for understanding the dynamics of living with dementia.34"
116,33,0.99,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Moral Luck Abstract: The concept of moral luck appears to be an oxymoron, since it indicates that the right- or wrongness of a particular action can depend on the agentâs good or bad luck. That goes against the assumption that the moral quality of our conduct, the praise- and blameworthiness of what we do, should only hinge on factors that are within our own control. It seems unreasonable to let the moral verdict of someoneâs decision and action depend on whether the outcome happens to be good or bad, particularly in situations where luck plays a significant part in how things turn out. In organizational life, moral luck nevertheless is a recurring phenomenon, in that actual outcomes do affect our moral evaluations of what people do. A reckless person can get away with his or her moral gamble if the outcome is good, but will get severe criticism in the likely event of a bad outcome. This chapter explores how moral luck connects to the normative theories of duty ethics and utilitarianism, and the extent to which moral evaluations based on actual outcomes are acceptable.

124,502,0.99,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"With our basic theory, we have already achieved some similarity to Belnapâs BST. This becomes evident by contrasting the present TPAcarve to the TPAknit of Strobachâs paper. While the latter starts out with given possibilities, each with its own relation of ancestry, which have to be made to match each other by certain requirements on those relations to enable the next step of knitting them together, the former needs no corresponding requirements because possibilities are carved out of a single pre-existing object, the structure of possibilia. However, we yet have no natural one-to-one correspondence between the possibilities of TPAcarve and the possibilities of TPAknit . This is so because our basic theory leaves out many of the requirements, especially of cardinality and connectedness, which are implemented in TPAknit (which it in turn had inherited from the non-modal formal theory of ancestry, FTA). So, although we already have captured a few basic metaphysical intuitions, there is still some way to go for our TPAcarve to model the biological realm in a satisfactory way."
50,6,0.99,"Seeing Ourselves Through Technology : How We Use Selfies, Blogs and Wearable Devices To See and Shape Ourselves","In 1524 Parmigianino painted his Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. Parmigianino used oil paints to paint on the hollow inside of half a wooden ball, to mimic the shape of the mirror he copied his reflection from. The distortions of the convex mirror are exactly replicated in Parmigianinoâs self-portrait. His hand is in the foreground, grossly distorted by the fisheye perspective of the convex mirror he is looking into to see himself. We can just see the short pencil he is holding to sketch his own image. We see what he sees. Parmigianino used a convex mirror to see himself; today we use digital technologies. We snap selfies on our phones and post them to Instagram. We write about our lives in blogs and in status updates to Facebook. We wear activity trackers on our wrists, log our productivity and allow Facebook and other apps to track our locations continuously. The data we track is displayed back to us as graphs, maps, progress charts and timelines. Parmigianinoâs self-portrait may not seem to have much in common with a FitBit userâs charts of steps and sleep patterns, but both are examples of how technology is a means to see part of ourselves. Whether we use a wearable, networked step-counter or a convex mirror and oil paints, technology can reflect back to us a version of who we are. And the data, filters and social media we use to see and share our reflections distort our images in their own particular ways, just as Parmigianinoâs convex mirror distorted the perspective of his face. With digital cameras, smart phones and social media it is easier to create and share our self-representations. But self-representations have always been part of our culture. We have drawn, carved, sculpted and painted images of ourselves for millennia; we have kept diaries, scrapbooks and photo albums; we have sung ballads and told stories about ourselves. Sometimes we use the mediation of technology to help us see ourselves better, to understand ourselves or to improve ourselves, or simply to imagine someone to speak to, a âdear diaryâ to tell our secrets to when nobody else will listen. Other times we want to share our experiences with others. We paste photos and memorabilia into a photo album to share with family and imagine one day passing it down to our children and their children. Some of us write autobiographies or memoirs to be published for a wider audience. This book explores the ways in which we represent ourselves today through digital technologies. Like Parmigianino, we create visual selfportraits and share them.

Are we re-stealing the conï¬ict as Christie suggests? Again I think these questions call for a consideration of the present alternatives for young offenders. In a revised 2015 edition of The little book of restorative justice Zehr includes a list of what he thinks restorative justice is not. Mediation is on this list. This is, of course interesting in the context of the book on mediation research that you are reading right now. According to Zehr, mediation and restorative justice are related, in that they will both normally aim to include an encounter. But they differ because mediation connotes that âparties are assumed to be on a level playing ï¬eldâ, and this assumption can be inappropriate or offensive in the case of restorative justice. Also, according to Zehr, in the case of restorative, an important component is that âa wrongdoer must admit to some level of responsibility for the offenceâ. This leads him to conclude that âthe âneutralâ language of mediation may be misleading and even offensive in many casesâ. So why is this article even in a book on mediation research?"
299,263,0.99,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"This is similar to what the Gloucester County Public Schools opted for in the case of Gavin Grimm: offering him use of a unisex restroom in the nurseâs office. The ACLU argues that such a policy is unacceptable because it singles out transgender students and subjects them to different treatment (American Civil Liberties Union 2014). In 2015, a transgender high school student in Missouri began using the girlsâ locker room to change for gym class, rejecting the schoolâs offer of a separate, single-occupancy facility (Grinberg 2015). One major reason given for the rejection of these accommodations is that what transgender people seek is a full recognition of their new sexual identity; the biological females want to be treated as males, and the biological males as females. Providing them with accommodations in which they can relieve themselves or change in private, without being stared at or subject to comments, does not meet this aspiration. The question then is not whether transgender people have a right to an accommodation, but whether their desire to have their chosen gender identity fully affirmed is a constitutionally protected right. The answer, I suggest, lies in two parts: the size of the harm and the feelings of others. One needs differ in the scope of the harm transgender people seek to address. The civil rights movement fought for the de facto right to vote, to abolish discrimination in jobs and housing, and to fight many other forms of discrimination that inflicted serious harms on those subjected to them. The same cannot be said about those subject to what are called microaggressions, as the term itself implies. I am not suggesting that these should be ignored, but only that the harm involved is of a different order. It follows that issues of relatively low harm are particularly suitable to be addressed socially rather than legally. Assessed in this way, the desire of transgender people to fully pass does not rank as high as, for example, the desire of gay people to marry. The argument is not that the feelings of transgender people should be ignored or taken lightly, but that they may not be best handled by elevating their protection to the level of a constitutional right, protected by the full forces of the federal government. Once an issue is framed in legal terms, it is difficult to see how the issue might have benefited from less coercive treatments, at least as a first and second cut. The following new concern, shared by some members of the LGBTQ community, may serve as a way to explore the point at hand because it deals with an issue that has not been turned into a question of rights so far. The issue is a quest for a gender-neutral language; for example, the use of Mx. as a gender-neutral honorific. Mx. is favored as an option for transgender individuals or anyone who does not want a gender-specific identification of themselves (Petrow 2016). âI think Mx. should be adopted as the standard form of address for everyone, because the real promise of the transgender movement was not the freedom to figure out ways to become more fully male or fully female, but rather freedom from gender entirely. Loosening the gender grip on language is a step in that direction,â writes Wake Forest University Professor Shannon Gilreath (Petrow 2016). In 2014, the Vancouver school board introduced a policy to recognize gender-neutral pronouns (xe, xem, and xyr for third person, plural, and possessive, respectively) for students who do not identify as male or female (Kenwood 2014).

191,77,0.99,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"What is also evident here and in the concrete implementation of Barnahus in Norway is that child-friendliness in time came to mean a child-friendly layout and interiors, and that the idea of establishing Barnahus as a separate house in a residential area was abandoned. Child-friendliness became an issue to be solved within mostly office buildings. In an analysis of the relationship between architecture and pedagogy in Waldorf education, BjÃ¸rnholt (2014) discusses how childcenteredness can be achieved through the manipulation of the physical environment and asks whether âthe act of modifying and transcending the limitations of the given building structures may be as important as the architectureâ (p. 120). The same question could be asked in relation to Barnahus. In summary, aesthetic-spatial considerations were high on the agenda throughout the process of establishing the Barnahus model in Norway. The idea of the aesthetic-spatial dimension of child-friendliness that was launched in the early texts about Barnahus was linked to safety as a primary need for children who have been victimised. Safety was furthermore understood as linked to a feeling of being welcome as a child, and not a victim, hence the weight put on toys, dÃ©cor and equipment that invites children to play or relax. One of the key ideas was also that any association with a formal institutionâeither police or hospitalâwould compromise the atmosphere of safety. The concept of atmospheres is difficult to define, but can be understood as âa sensuous âsomethingâ that takes place between things and people. Atmospheres may be ontologically difficult to grasp or contain, yet they play an important role in ordering spaces and social lifeâ (Bille 2015, 257). The concept of making or âstaging atmospheresâ (Bille 2015; Bille et al. 2015; BÃ¶hme 2013) through locality and symbolic dÃ©cor captures the thinking about child-friendliness in the texts referred to above. Staging atmospheres relates to âhow people actively try to shape experiences and moods of selves and others through organizing objects, bodies and spacesâ (Bille et al. 2015, 33)."
56,335,0.99,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"when I told my respondents that I was a student or a researcher (chercheur), it did not necessarily mean very much to them. Taking the literal meaning of the term, they would ask me, âMais quâest-ce que tu cherches ici?â [But what are you looking for here?] In some cases, such complete unfamiliarity with the idea of academia or research had a significant bearing on the degree to which I was able to secure informed consent, as will be discussed below. Suspicion could come in other forms. On several occasions residents displayed a great deal of apprehension about my motives, alleging that I was a spy sent by one of the social security agencies to inform on them. This suspicion is understandable given the climate of distrust which reigned in certain establishments and the practices adopted by certain agencies to crack down on benefit fraud (for manifestations of this mutual distrust see Chap. 3). A number of respondents voiced concern about the confidentiality of their testimony, despite my best efforts to assuage these doubts. The following exchange with one respondent â Mehdi â is indicative of such suspicions, as my field notes record: I asked if it would be OK to record the interview. Mehdi said some very interesting things about this: to do a recording was âtrop graveâ (too serious). If we made a recording, then the government would listen to it and they would try to get him in front of a judge or deport him for something he had said. I said that he could remain anonymous if he wished, but he said no, the government can recognise you just by your voice. He then started talking about how he is a delegate for his comitÃ© dâentreprise [staff council is perhaps the nearest translation], he has been a delegate for ten years now, and every time there is a meeting the boss asks if he can record the conversation, for the minutes, but he always refuses. Again, because he is scared of the consequences: the boss could easily mess around with the recording, edit it or add words and then he would be up in front of a judge. He is very suspicious of the current government; he is sure that they are against immigrants, and are looking for any reason to deport people, including older people. âIls prÃ©fÃ¨rent que nous crevons lÃ -basâ [âtheyâd prefer that we snuff it back homeâ]. Again very interestingly, he said that if there was a âseriousâ government in charge â âif the Socialists were in chargeâ â then he would have no problem giving a recorded interview. I replied that I understood entirely, that it was up to him to decide and that I respected his decision.2"
137,297,0.99,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"use. Within the family, economic barriers to fathersâ long leave were not reported and fathers reported little discussion with partners about leave. The desired preschool start date and mothersâ interest in returning to work often influenced fathersâ choices. In line with cultural expectations for fathers, these men emphasized that leavetaking was experienced as personally fulfilling, valuing close contact with their children and finding childcare to be a desirable task. Leave was regarded as a âbubble,â a welcome respite from employment. They faced the same challenges mothers have on leave and expressed ambivalent feelings about being at home, such as social isolation. They came to see themselves as capable of caregiving as mothers and as the âprimary parent,âcreating their own routines and practices. However, mothers often appeared to still be involved in some aspects of childrearing suggesting that equal parenting practices were not common. Moreover, fathers did not express concern over inequality in parenting; nor did they remark upon how difficulties separating from work might be related to traditional workplace expectations for male employees. The experience of leave appeared to make these fathers strong supporters of reforms offering fathers more non-transferable months. They felt this would encourage fathers to take longer leaves which, based on their experience, is important for men to become active fathers. Those men who had completed leave expressed both continuity and change with a traditional male norm for employment. While all returned to full-time work, some had sacrificed career progression, a development they didnât regret because now they prioritized family over work. Some had changed to more family-friendly jobs or reorganized their workday to be more available for childcare. At the family level, fathersâ reports indicated close relationships with children and active engagement in childcare but not fully realized gender-neutral parenthood, without considering this as a problem. Fathers reported enhanced closeness with partners, since they felt they understood each otherâs situation better, but did not mention equality as a goal in these relationships. The main conclusion from these interviews is that it is possible for fathers in Sweden to feel like, and act like, primary caregivers. Even if traditional expectations and cultural norms for motherhood and fatherhood can be difficult to change, these fathersâ experiences suggest that there is a change in the norm of fatherhood where caregiving is becoming more central. Perhaps gender relations are also shifting to be more concerned with sharing tasks, although this seems to be a more inconsistent and incomplete development. The main focus of change seems to revolve around the positive experience of being with the child, something that was expressed as having major consequences for future prioritizing of family over work among the interviewed men. Acknowledgements We are grateful to our respondents in this study. We are also grateful to Fredrik Movitz for important comments on the questionnaire and we acknowledge financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VetenskapsrÃ¥det) via the Linnaeus Center on Social Policy and Family Dynamics in Europe (SPaDE), grant 349-2007-8701."
46,142,0.99,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"fourth issue concerns rights and institutions: there exist no social policy institutions on the global level and no functioning legal framework that would guarantee social protection from poverty. This is a major obstacle, and while most cosmopolitans argue that such global institutions are needed, most particularists contend that they will not succeed for various reasons. In the case of child poverty in welfare states, the situation looks different. Here we have states which all have at least some kind of social policy in place; social protection and poverty alleviation is embedded in certain social rights directly granted to families in poverty or children in poverty. It is therefore much less necessary to debate whether global institutions are feasible and if so, in which form. Although we support the view that child poverty in welfare states is best tackled by changing the international and global institutions, most of the work needs to be done in welfare states themselves in terms of designing and implementing more inclusive social policies and allotting enough funds to support poor children and their caregivers. It seems likely that cosmopolitans and particularists will come to very similar conclusions in regard to child poverty in welfare states, both probably agreeing to some extent that its alleviation is first an issue of social justice within a rich state (or a community of them, like the EU) and that global justice is not primarily concerned with it. The reduction of child poverty in richer countries is part of an ideal of global justice but not its primary problem. Our own account will analyze the relation different agents have to children in poverty, and we will then try to attribute responsibilities based on a set of morally relevant criteria; in this sense, we will defend what the literature calls an agent-centered approach (Deveaux 2013; OâNeill 2001). Instead of focusing on one or two important agents, like the state and the family, we wish to distinguish more of them, including those with limited responsibilities. Furthermore, we wish to emphasize that there are some very important agents who often get neglected in theories of responsibilities; in this context, we point to peers and enterprises, for instance, which raise particularly challenging questions for the concept of responsibilities towards children affected by poverty. All this leads to the conclusion that child poverty is not only a social policy issue but touches many policy areas: the labor market, public infrastructure, health care, education. Before we outline our own theory, let us briefly comment on one of the few philosophical debates that has emerged on the topic of responsibilities towards children and why we connect our argument only loosely to it and build it mainly on other approaches to responsibilities which have not so far addressed the specific case of children. The debate we have in mind"

Theodore is âLetter writer 612,â he is praised for his work, later we are also told that he likes books, a sign that he is old-fashioned, a dreamer. Few publishing houses still do print, and in daily life, speech-based operating systems have eliminated the need for writing. In Her the technology is seamless, no hiccups; the devices have beautiful interfaces like books and the larger screens have picture frames around them like art; culture is now technological and online. The computer game that Theodore is playing is a hologram in the middle of the room; he is totally immersed in online communication, and at night he can access cybersex chatrooms just by speaking into the air. Like Disconnect, a major theme in Her is loneliness in a society saturated with opportunities for communication. The ï¬lm is set in a futuristic landscape, and we often see Theodore in his semi-dark apartment with beautiful views over the metropolitan cityscape, very alone. When he travels on the subway, everyone around him wear earplugs, chatting incessantly with their devices, not looking at each other. Although surrounded by marvellous technology, he is not happy, and only comes alive when he falls in love with his operating system. Theodore loves the fact that Samantha is new, fresh and enthusiastic about life, does not have history and baggage, is constantly available and supportive, and has no physical presence. Ironically, the relationship between Theodore and Samantha is the only major relationship in any of the ï¬ve ï¬lms that evolves lovingly and harmoniously, a satirical version of a classic romantic comedy. Theodore and Samantha go on trips, comfort each other, play music together, go on a double date and introduce each other as âgirlfriendâ and âboyfriendâ to friends and family. In these scenes, Theodore is physically alone â with an electronic device in his pocket â but he communicates and behaves as if he has company. In the futuristic world of Her, society has evolved to a point where man-machine relationships are nothing to be shy about, indeed, they are depicted as more rewarding than real-life contact. Almost everybody reacts positively to Theodoreâs romance with Samantha; the only negative reaction comes from Catherine, his estranged wife, who accused him of being âmadly in love with his laptop.â Catherine represents the voice of technological resistance; defending human relationships even if they are complicated and difï¬cult. However, as spectators, we recognize that Samantha is far more than a âlaptopâ; her many talents, complex mind and capacity for unlimited growth make her the perfect company, although she laments the fact that she âdoes not have a body.â"
252,95,0.99,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Some have argued that making the exemption procedure itself particularly burdensome from a bureaucratic point of viewâfor example, requiring notarization of forms, hand delivery, physician confirmation of information disclosure, and so onâwould also represent a form of nudging (Lynch 2016, p. 110). This might be true, but seemingly only up to a point. Part of the concept of nudging is not only that decision makers retain their freedom of choice (Li and Chapman 2013, p. 188), but also that no option, including opting out, should be particularly costly for the chooser (Thaler and Sunstein 2008/2009, p. 5; Blumenthal-Barby and Burroughs 2012, p. 3). One might object to the use of nudging by appealing to the Kantian categorical imperative, in its formulation that prescribes one to always treat other people also as ends in themselves and never merely as means. Since nudging would circumvent certain deliberative capacities and thus diminish individual autonomy, it would imply that people are treated not as ends in themselves, which would require respecting their autonomy, but as mere means to benefit other people. Now, it is true that, on a Kantian understanding of âmeansâ, nudging would imply treating individuals as mere means. However, there are two considerations that mitigate the wrongness of violating the categorical imperative. First, nudging would often benefit not only society at large but also individuals who are nudged, given that vaccination offers a very high degree of protection against infectious diseases. Nudging in the interest of the those being nudged would make any limitation of autonomy more morally acceptable than nudging that is solely in the interest of the one doing the nudging (Halpern et al. 2007) or of third parties (such as society at large). If individuals are used as mere means, this will often be to their own benefit as well; and it is at least doubtful that autonomy violation represents such a serious wrong that it cannot be justified even by the large benefit it would entail to the individual in question. Second, outside of a Kantian framework, but within a very reasonable perspective, whether autonomy is such an important value seems to depend on the extent to which making an autonomous choice in a certain context matters to an individual. If vaccination were the default option, since the possibility to opt out would remain open to them, parents would still be able to make the autonomous choice not to vaccinate their children in cases in which they have a strong enough desire to avoid vaccination, that is, in cases in which making an autonomous decision about vaccination matters to them. By âstrong enough desireâ I mean a desire that is sufficiently"

The recommendations of the British Working Group on Expanding Access to Published Research Findings, the Finch Report24 preferred Gold to Green. This triggered a discussion on what the best way to Open Access is (see, for example, Harnad 2012 or Suber 2012a). Obviously, seen from a scientistâs point of view, both ways have the right to exist. Looking at the green road means publishing an article wherever one thinks it is the best for oneâs career. At the same time, one makes use of the opportunity to give access to all relevant readers. Fundersâ mandates will not be a problem, the green road is compliant. If self-archiving is supported by a well made institutional infrastructure, this way works quickly and easily. Additional costs are generated from infrastructural needs. In too many institutions there is still poor help for researchers; too often they are still left alone to self-archive. Hence, institutions should not only state policies, but actively support their scientists and strengthen infrastructural backing. Meanwhile, the golden road is part of an axiomatic change of the publication landscape. It is a primary publication, which gives immediate access to an article in the context of its journal, including linkage to all additional services of a publisher. âââ¦ journals receive their revenues up front, so they can provide immediate access free of charge to the peer-reviewed, semantically enriched published article, with minimal restrictions on use and reuse.

378,189,0.99,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"supply chain interruptions when transport or credit in one part of the chain is hampered. Meanwhile, sustainable communities, according to Hopkins, do not subscribe to a culture of consumerism but seek to link âsatisfaction and happiness to other less tangible things like community, meaningful work, skills and friendshipâ (Hopkins 2012: 20â21). Here we ï¬nd a direct connection with ï¬ndings on human well-being and its origins. It was insightful to see that some workshops of the Transition Town movement were using Max-Neefâs human need matrix to discuss a diversity of strategies for a high quality of life beyond âhavingâ things. This also ties back to the criticism of ecological economists like Paul Ekins and Robert Costanza in Chap. 3, who state that the social utility gained through the human interactions during production processes should get much more attention when assessing productivity. Meanwhile, many resilience researchers also emphasize the importance of trust as a core ingredient to well-functioning, adaptable communities and individual perceptions of well-being. The 2012 High Level Panel on Global Sustainability did not get this far in its report to the UN Secretary-General before Rio+20. Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A Future Worth Choosing describes the world system as volatile and uncertain, and suggests that the panel start their recommendations with a call to âempower people to make sustainable choicesâ as a response to this. It does not seek to empower people to build their own communities though, but rather focuses on how the social safety nets of governments are set up so they can be resilient in times of structural change, and how disaster risk reduction and adaptation programs could be improved (United Nations Secretary-Generalâs High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2012: 46â47). The Transition movement, on the other hand, makes these self-empowerment processes the essence of its existence and adapts them to systems or communities of any size, not just towns. Its mission is summarized as follows: âto inspire, encourage, connect, support and train communities as they adopt and adapt the transition model on their journey to urgently rebuild resilience and drastically reduce CO2 emissions.â The seven principles for guiding such processes in towns are set out by Hopkins and Peter Lipman on the Transition Network website (transitionnetwork.org) and can be summarized as follows: 1. Positive Visioning: Campaigning for rather than against something. 2. Help People Access Good Information and Trust Them to Make Good Decisions: Raising awareness and hearing many opinions lies at the core of rational decision-making. 3. Inclusion and Openness: Banning âthem and usâ thinking and reaching out to all subsystems in the town, early in the process. 4. Enable Sharing and Networking: Acknowledge everything, including stories of failure. 5. Build Resilience: With the primacy of environmental resilience, change food, energy and economic systems in the town and across governance levels."

It was observed that 5 and 8 people had been vomiting after taking the medicine A and B, respectively. How would you use such data to estimate the probability of this adverse event? 7. The data may include knowledge elicited from a relevant domain expert, e.g., a clinician. Such process of obtaining the knowledge is called the expert knowledge elicitation. There are two principled types of decisions theories: 1. Non-statistical decision theory. It does not use data, i.e. it does not run experiments or collect data. It is purely based on probability theory and utility theory. 2. Statistical decision theory utilises data. It is based on statistics, probability theory, and utility theory. It is based on knowing the random variables and their expectations. It is also based on statistical Inference (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals), and it can also use Bayesian statistics. When making a decision, we as the decision maker may face the following: â¢ One-stage decision problem. E.g., we decide if we buy a share, and then we face the outcome, we decide to which school we put our child. â¢ Multi-stage decision problem. E.g. we decide if we pay for the advice of a financial advisor, and then after his advice, we decide if we buy the share or not, hence we are making our second decision. Here we can use Decision Trees (see Chapter 6)."
360,292,0.99,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"Despite the fact that we can safely rule out reference shift as an alternative explanation of the results, obviously there are many other factors that are worth further exploration. The correlation that was found in this study was high (r = 0.66, n = 36, p < 0.001), though obviously not perfect. This means that there must be more factors that affect interpretation besides the one tested here. An important next step is to delve deeper into typicality effects for complex predicates. In the current chapter, I report an experiment that indirectly measured one particular typicality measurement with one particular dependent measure, namely the typicality of two simultaneous actions, rated on a scale. One can imagine that in fact the typicality of the opposite event, i.e. two predicates applying to two separate individuals, or perhaps sequentially to one individual, might also affect the interpretation of a plural sentence with those predicates. Moreover, as pointed out by a reviewer, perhaps not only the verb concepts but also the head noun of the sentences play a role. It might be that the compatibility of two predicates is quite different in the context of humans than it is for example in the context of dogs: people can run and scratch their heads simultaneously, but dogs cannot. In order to fully understand the factors that influence sentence interpretation, an intricate combination of typicality measures is necessary. Also, it will be good to correlate rating measures with different kinds of dependent measures such as categorizaton speed or error rate to have a more robust resultâsimilar to the investigations into typicality effects for nouns. However, the fact that even one measure can distinguish different types of verb pairs so clearly, is a promising starting point for this enterprise. Another related issue is the deeper question of how typicality effects come about: What exactly makes a particular instance of a concept typical? A potential candidate factor is that typicality is formed by prior experiences or likelihood of a situation. An anonymous reviewer, however, pointed out example (16). (16) The boys are unicycling and juggling The reviewer claims that despite the fact that we probably rarely see a person simultaneously unicycling and juggling, we still probably interpret the conjunction in sentence (16) intersectively (though of course a full sample of participants would need to be consulted to be sure). Such an example points out that typicality is not simply a matter of frequency, but a far more complex notion that needs to be studied further. The question of what makes something typical does not affect the results described in this chapter per se, but knowing what affects typicality would give them more explanatory power, as pointed out by this reviewer."
113,320,0.99,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"Ahamb people understand a good person to be someone who has love, concern, and sympathy for others. These are the same values that also characterize a good Christian. The antithesis of the good person, however, is one who is selfish and proud. Such a person is typically talked about as âdifferentâ (difren in Bislama) and doubts are continuously raised about such a personâs Christian moral as he or she seems to acknowledge neither God nor kin in his or her life. Christianity is in this sense taking the role of an all-encompassing system on Ahamb, incorporating the main moral framework for social action as well as the cosmological powers of God that are regarded as stronger than any traditional spirit used in sorcery. Christianity thus acts as an umbrella for the good and what is worth aspiring toward, while sorcery, which brings destruction, is the most potent manifestation of the bad and evil. As with other Pentecostal movements, the revival was particularly clear in marking out this distinction, and brought about a more aggressive confrontation against the evil than had been normal. As I have argued, the opposing role of good and evil seem to some extent to be mutually reinforced and reproduced through the existence and cultivation of the other. For Ahamb people, however, this mutual reinforcement has not merely been discursive but is experienced in social practice: the more of the good (especially success), the greater the chance of an envious person (typically a sorcerer) coming to destroy it. The more evil, the more important it is that the church is strong to encompass it. This mutual reinforcement resonates with examples from Africa where Pentecostal Christianity has been argued to take on the logic of witchcraft and make the church into part of the witchcraft problem itself, as well as a solution to the problem (De Boeck 2006: 173; Newell 2007). In the Pentecostal churches of the Ivory Coast, for example, Newell reports on the elaborate belief in witchcraft and a simultaneous assertion of the ability of the church to transcend it. But some Ivoirians claim that the church is also a haven for the witches, as it asks people to detach themselves from the âcorruptingâ influence and obligations of kin and rather focus their attention (and money) on the church (and their leaders). The church is thus promoting activities that resemble the self-centered actions of the witch (Newell 2007: 484; Meyer 1999: 170). Pentecostalism is therefore sometimes equated with witchcraft as it encourages exactly the kind of antisocial behavior that Ivoirians understand as witchcraft. As churches recognize the efficacy and reality"
192,76,0.99,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Although in modern science the Masterâs discourse has been replaced by university discourse, in which an (allegedly autonomous) subject focusses on an (allegedly domesticated) object, this process is nonetheless spurred on and guided by latent basic concepts and convictions (âphilosophemesâ), by an unconscious metaphysics as it were (S1 in the lower-left position). In terms of Lacanâs symbolic algebra, the relationship between scientific discourse (S2) and its guiding imperatives or instructions (S1) can be represented as: S2/S1. The guiding imperatives remain implicit, are pushed beneath the bar, so that they cannot be explicitly articulated within the emerging flow of normal scientific texts. This was what Heidegger referred to when he claimed that science does not think (1954, p. 4). On the manifest level, academics are involved in various processes of text production: they speak and think continuously. But, as Heidegger argued, genuine thinking basically means to be addressed, namely by the voice of the Other, whose revelatory thoughts present themselves as genuinely questionable (1954, p. 1). Academics publish in journals and contribute to academic conferences (Heidegger 1954, p. 2). Thus, they are involved in what Lacan refers to as university discourse. But in normal science they are barred from addressing that which is genuinely questionable (S1 in the lower-left position), namely their basic Begriff, their answer to basic questions such as: what is nature, what is life, what is science, what is truth? S2 builds on certain basic categories or premises, but is at the same time barred from explicitly addressing these apodictic claims (S1), even though they actually guide the knowledge production process (S2). In principle it is possible to present such basic imperatives in a top-down, apodictic, authoritative and ex cathedra fashion. In that case, S1 is posited at the topside of the bar (upper-left position), resulting in what Lacan (1969â1970/1991) refers to as the Masterâs discourse. An authoritative voice (Hippocrates or Aristotle, for instance) is regarded as infallible. His instructions and imperatives provide"

However, media resistance is not just about disappointment, but also about hope. In the ï¬ctional as well as non-ï¬ctional works discussed in this book, there is not so much hope that media or society will really change, but some hope that each and every one of us can improve our lives by freeing ourselves from media entrapment. By replacing media use with non-media activities, it is suggested that one can build a future that is happier, more genuine and authentic, and based on more real-life encounters and pursuits. A third and ï¬nal explanation as to how media resistance is sustained is that it does not to any great degree depend on speciï¬c, detailed or even empirical evidence, and also remains at a signiï¬cant distance from most academic media studies. In early protests against the mass media, there were strong expectations that expert evidence would come out in favour of resistance, that uncertainty and apprehension would give way to a solid scientiï¬c foundation. Although momentous amounts of research about harmful consequences of media have been initiated, evidence remains ambiguous and often do not ï¬t the concerns of resisters; those critical and sceptical of the way media transformed society did not get precise answers from science. Some material discussed here draws â selectively â on evidence from media effects research, some point to so-called medium theorists to argue that mediaâs harm go beyond content and involve technology and functions, but, in general, the references to ï¬ndings and perspectives from (empirical) media studies are scarce in the texts and arguments discussed in this book. To the degree that books and articles touch on media studies and media experts, sceptics often express disappointment in what they see as the disciplineâs pro-media stance, and disappointment with the way media scholars have contributed to legitimize controversial media, genres and technologies. Although media criticism may well be taught in a media studies class, many media sceptics â and especially those who expressed resistance to television â have expressly distanced themselves from the efforts by media educators and scholars to teach media literacy. As one website cited in Chapter 4 points out, âIf the âoffâ button is the answer, then no media studies course will ever help students ï¬nd itâ (White dot 2000b). To the degree that media literacy is explicitly discussed, the sentiment expressed is that this does not point people towards nonmedia activities, but rather increase media fascination and use."

This understanding of the problem has been applied to ï¬eldwork in Tokai village, where group interviews were conducted with the cooperation of young citizens, to ask for ideas on âWhat would be a desirable means of âdisposalâ of high level radioactive wasteâ. The results centered on ideas to tackle the âfundamentalâ problems of the waste, such as its presence, amount, radiotoxicity and âuselessnessâ or âunwanted-nessâ, rather than just cope with the safety risks the waste imposes. There were also opinions on what sort of environment would be best for storing the waste, which shared points in common with the present policy but also added that the âunfairnessâ of concentrated siting should be reconsidered. Other opinions opted for persisting in R&D and maintenance, for reducing or reusing the waste, hauling it to outer space, etc. These opinions on the desirable means of dealing with the waste hold respective implications for those with the know-how to consider how they may be realized, or to evaluate their technical feasibilities into the future so that they can be reconsidered as alternative options. A consideration of what it means to âengineer resilienceâ led to the idea that resilience can be considered as the âadded valueâ of enduring efï¬ciency during crises, added to the societal value realized in an engineered solution. The approach in this study of asking citizens for input on discussions of value also applies to âresilientâ solutions, perhaps in the same way. One marked research agenda would be to obtain input of âwhat matters and whyâ in reconsideration of how societies have addressed passed disaster situations, especially to grasp what has developed in Fukushima. Another point made was that obtaining input from ânon-expertsâ as the"

Many gifts imply that the donor has resources that has been or will be used. There is a fine line between this position and receiving too much without reciprocating: if society considers the reciprocal action to be too slow or not reaching expected levels, esteem will turn into contempt. The recipientâs superiority as net provider is no more; instead the reputation of a net receiver is acquired and a status of dependence manifests itself (Cuco i Giner 2000: 315). Pure charity hurts a recipientâs pride and his/her status in society diminishes if there is no possibility of reciprocating the gift (Mauss 2002 [1990]: 83). Politics of welfare can simultaneously foster solidarity between societyâs members but also exclude net receivers, in their own and otherâs view, as they have no means of reciprocating (Komter 1996: 7). But what is it that creates the relationship? Is it what is given or who the giver is? Mauss described the reciprocal relation created by the gift as a spirit, the hau, which he borrows from the Maori in New Zealand. This spirit of the gift-giver resides within the thing given and stays with it until reciprocated; âto accept something from someone is to accept something of his spiritual essence, of his soulâ (Mauss 2016: 73). This was criticized by Raymond Firth, who instead showed that this spirit was within the gift given, not with the person who gave it (Firth 1959). There are thus various views of who carries the spirit; whether it is the something that is given which is of importance, or the person who gives it. The most common exchange in modern society is the market exchange.11 Both Mauss and Marshall Sahlins in his study of stone-age economics (see below) left this out of their analysis, and the existence of a market transaction in primitive societies is contested. A market transaction was originally defined as being exempt from creating reciprocal relations; it was supposed to be a spot exchange performed through profit maximizing and by unsocial actors (Swedberg 2003), but has in later studies been shown to result in different types of reciprocal relations as well (e.g. Befu 1977; Davis 1992; Offer 1997). I will delve into the market transaction in what follows as it plays a fundamental role in taxation. It is market exchanges that first comes to mind when we think about exchanges subject to tax. The modern market trade has money as a means of settlement in return for a product. The exchange is usually based on a predefined price. The"
82,102,0.99,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"It might be true that more people are inclined to interpret (2.1) along the lines of internalism and evidentialism.43 Under that interpretation, Ai and A j are both beliefs or propositions, and P is construed as subjective or epistemic or logical probability. The point we want to make here is that (2.1) can just as easily be understood in accordance with externalism and relabilism. Under this interpretation, Ai and A j can be beliefs, perceptual appearances, memories, and so on. For example, if Ai is my belief in the proposition that a cow is grazing in front of me, and A j is my seeing a cow grazing in front of me, then (2.1) states that it is more likely that my belief in a grazing cow is true, given that I have this perception, than when I do not have this perception. Here P is an objective probability, depending on the frequency of events, where the events are âseeing a grazing cowâ and âbelieving that there is a grazing cowâ. Whether or not (2.1) holds here is determined by empirical research or, more generally, by past performance. Is it the case that my seeing a cow grazing is more often followed by a belief in a cow grazing than that my perception of a horse jumping is followed by a belief that a cow is grazing? The answer is presumably in the affirmative, so (2.1) is satisfied. The thing justified need not be a belief of which the probability is determined on the basis of perceptual appearances. It can also be the other way around. In cases of wishful thinking or of harbouring strong suspicions, my beliefs or my desires can cause in me certain perceptual appearances. Here the causal course runs in the opposite direction. Again, we determine empirically whether or not a causal process is in fact taking place, and thus whether or not (2.1) is satisfied: some people are more prone to wishful thinking or to being suspicious than others. It might happen that a causal process gives rise to a false belief. Optical illusions are a classic example. When I am walking in the desert, the refraction of light from the sky by heated air can cause me to believe that there is a sheet of water in front of me. This causal process is probabilistic (at some times I am more vulnerable to this optical illusion than at others), but it is assumed that (2.1) is fulfilled (I mostly fall prey to the illusion when walking in the desert). Goldman will presumably say that this is not a reliable beliefforming process, and that my belief that there is a sheet of water in front of me is not justified. As we will explain in the next section, however, we are not proposing to define justification as the condition of probabilistic support 43 Thus ReneÌ van Woudenberg and Ronald Meester have argued that âthe tradi-"

The learning experience can only be influenced through interactions, and it is at these points of contact that we seek to identify the opportunities for creating and facilitating engagement. These opportunities are summarised in Fig. 4.1. Typically a learner interacts with a coach (usually the teacher), a subject expert (usually the teacher), co-learners, education material, the world outside the closed educational environment, and with the traces of their own earlier activities. In this context of interactions, iTEC exploited the fact that ICT provides the means to go beyond the classroom setting. For example to be able to chat with an astronaut about space travel, participate in a distant experiment in CERN, get coaching support from a grandmother living a 100 km away, have access to simulation and serious games, and consult same-age learners abroad about how to pronounce a foreign language. As such, engagement can arise from the person, material, or environment one interacts with and/or the interaction conduit itself. Again from the early Web for Schools project up to recent TEL projects such as the Stellar project, research has pointed to the engaging potential of ICT.2 iTEC therefore explores to what extent interactions other than the traditional classroom interactions can possibly enhance engagement."

Research indicates that in the case of immigrant children and children of immigrants, identity issues are more complex (Huang 1994; Chow 1999; PortÃ©s and Rumbaut 2001; Kibria 2002; Min 2002). Young people who participated in this study are not an exception. Most of them have, at one point in time or another, asked themselves: where do I belong? Am I more Vietnamese or more Czech? Even if some of them cannot answer these questions, it is incorrect to say that they are âstuck somewhere between two cultures.â As the presented research shows, the period of struggle to identify with the culture of their parents or the culture of the country where they grew up is just one of the stages in their lives where their feelings and opinions about themselves evolve and change over time. The understanding of identity as something socially constructed, fluid, and changeable in time and space corresponds with the constructivist perspective on identity development (Berger and Luckmann 1999). This perspective is very often presented in opposition to the essentialist perspective, which perceives identity as"

This choice lent itself to a permissiveness during the liberal and experimental sixties and seventies that now seems surprising, even to me. He believed in letting us follow our instincts and trusted that we would learn and grow from the experiences. To protect us from that process with strict rules would interfere with our growth and may not have prevented us from doing what we wanted anyway. Only later did I discover this choice was absolutely at odds with his conservative Mid-western upbringing, and it sometimes kept him awake at night. My sister and I were beneï¬ciaries of this heady freedom, as it was grounded in the rock-solid foundation of ethics and morality present in my fatherâs work. He was no hypocrite. This is important to say because I think my father can look like a hypocrite. His lifeâs work was spent researching the causes of war. His last brag was that he gave the world a potential solution for world peace. He hated violence, yet supported the Vietnam War, both Iraq Wars, and a host of other US military actions abroad. He believed absolutely in our military buildup during the Cold War and continued to support it even after the Berlin Wall came crashing down. At various times, heâs been accused of being a war hawk. Thereâs still a framed cartoon from the 1970s on the wall in our family home where my Dad is lampooned as a war hawk, standing next to a colleague shown as a peacenik. He found it so absurd as to be funny and worth memorializing. He could be confusingly contradictory. I used to think of him as a ï¬scal Republican and a social Democrat, but then he really deï¬ed all labels. Iâve always believed weâre a complicated species in a complex universe we barely understand. Our world is organic, with messy boundaries and beautiful colors. Itâs impossible to impose upon it our black and white organizational grids without running into contradictions of their very purpose. Iâve never met someone with strong opinions who didnât sometimes look like a hypocrite. In that way, my father was like any other. He had layers of rationalizations for his hierarchy of beliefs. He wouldâve called it all logical and scientiï¬c, but the rationalization of beliefs is a skin-deep penetration into my Dad. In truth, I think there are deeper reasons for his contradictions that lend insight but can never fully explain them. He understood gestalt and that âYou simply canât divorce â¦ personal elements from your work.â In the end, he did manage to separate aspects of himself, very private personal elements that he didnât want to look at or reveal, proving we are all mysteries and contradictions unto ourselves. My parents grew up in broken families ï¬lled with pain and sorrow, both suffering through trauma at a young age. My motherâs formative years were indelibly scorched by the horrors of World War II in Japan, particularly the US ï¬rebombing of Tokyo. Her earliest memory is jumping into a ditch to avoid ï¬re, her house aflame. Her father was a violent alcoholic who abandoned her and her mother when she was young. My fatherâs parents were poor and irresponsible, and their relationship was equally conflict-ridden. He remembered being so hungry he searched for food crumbs in his pocket. Out of desperation, he ran away from home in his teens, living in the streets of slums. Other than these publicly related facts, I donât know much more about either of my parentsâ upbringings.

Rummel, like Marx, argues that class conflict is important in most societies; however, for Rummel the two most fundamentally important classes are the rulers, on the one hand, and the ruled, on the other. He feels that cross-pressures among groups can mitigate such conflict in exchange societies, but in others class conflict between the rulers and the ruled is also potentially, and often in fact, dramatically violent. Only decentralization, or âdemocracyâ, can solve this problem. It is in the fourth volume, War, Power, Peace that Rummel deals most speciï¬cally with international relations in general and international conflict in particular. He offers propositions, as opposed to hypotheses about conflict, which he deï¬nes as âdeï¬nite afï¬rmations about conflict grounded in a perspective on manâs psychology, society, and conflictâ (Rummel, 1979: 211), that is, statements that are more deï¬nitive and less tentative than hypotheses. There are 54 propositions in all, 33 of which focus speciï¬cally on the causes and conditions of conflict. It is in this volume where the democratic peace, or the interdemocratic peace proposition, is ï¬rst presented. The Just Peace, the ï¬nal volume, is devoted to an effort to demonstrate how Rummelâs theory of conflict can have a profound impact on the future of international politics. âMy answer â¦â, he asserts at the outset of the volume, can be put simply: âpromote freedomâ (Rummel, 1981: 15). He defends this answer through the development of a social contract model. That model relies importantly on a ï¬rst principle of John Rawls, which is that a society should be devised and structured in such a way as self-interested people would have it structured if they are ignorant of their own interests and the positions and advantages they would have in that society."

A critical use of information technology then becomes an âascetic practiceâ, in which human beings explicitly anticipate technological mediations, and develop creative appropriations of technologies in order to give a desirable shape to these mediations. At the same time, the design of information technology becomes an inherently moral activity, in which designers do not only develop technological artifacts, but also the social impacts that come with it. And policy-making activities regarding the implementation of new technologies then become ways of governing our technologically mediated world. Let me return to one of the examples I gave at the beginning of this contribution in order to elaborate how this critical accompaniment of technologies could be a fruitful form of ethical and political reflection on technology. As indicated above, one of the most salient aspects of Google Glass is its impact on interpersonal relations. The âdoublingâ of the relations between humans and world that it brings about adds a second layer to the communication between people, which remains invisible to the other person. When two people meet, they cannot see which information the other has available about them. Googleâs search engine might reveal private information on the basis of face recognition software, or it might confuse the person with somebody else.

315,378,0.99,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"This group of second-generation, Gujarati-origin, Indian American women locate themselves largely in the context of the US: American institutions, culture, diversity management regimes and history exert the strongest influence over how they identify religiously. While they may have visited their ancestral homes or other places where co-ethnics reside, these locations do not exercise the same magnetic pull as the Indian ethnic community in the US. Christianity is also a strong force and a key marker against which they measure themselves. Some among this group we call American-centric classify themselves as religious, while others identify thoroughly with the American secular world. Ekata, our first example, is a 22-year-old Hindu who grew up in Oklahoma during the 1990s surrounded by few other Indian American families. She did not learn to speak Gujarati or perform Indian dances like so many other Indian American friends, but she did learn about Hindu mythology by watching religious videos and reading the comic books that an aunt sent. She also learned about Hinduism and what it meant to be pious by watching her mother do pujas (religious rituals and prayers) with family members and friends, listening to her lessons and stories about faith, and observing the priest who came to their home to say blessings on important occasions. Ekata explained, â[My] parents raised me to believe Hinduism is a way of life and not [just] a religion. I feel the most stuff I learned was from watching my parents or listening to them say prayers and learning what it meantâ. Her Christian friends and neighbours also strongly shaped her faith. Attending an Episcopal school as a teenager exposed Ekata to Christian theology and values but also pushed her to clarify what Hinduism meant to her. This prep school was an Episcopalian school. I would go to chapel every day, for years and years. I think that was kind of a good part, figuring out stuff for myself. In some ways, one would think that would be confusing. But kind of having to be surrounded and learning about Christianity is a big thing. The Episcopalian environment helped me realise what I liked about that or what I didnât like about Christianity and then what I liked about Hinduism. Things I was so unclear on, or unsure of."

The relationship breakdown between their parents has come like a bolt out of the blue for many of the children, something which they are unhappy about and wish to communicate back to their parents. Some children express anger, but the most prominent feeling in this category is sadness. They spend a lot of time thinking about what has happened, and many say they sometimes cry. Many ask the mediator to tell their parents that they need more attention and to be comforted.

Thus, the kinds of concerns Gostin and communitarians more generally have about preventing the spread of infectious diseases, responding to bioterrorist attacks, protecting the environment, balancing preventive and acute medical treatments, and determining the extent to which one can foster or force limits on individual choices for the public good do not find a comfortable home in the most widely followed bioethical texts.

28,70,0.99,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"logic that undergirds the post-war epidemic, arguing against ideas of attempted suicide as bungled or incompetent. The idea of repeated suicide attempts certainly emerges in the post-1945 discussions, but as noted above, this repetition is cast as a repeated response to social situations, an habitual coping mechanism, rather than as an immediate attempt to rectify the failure of the first attempt. The violence largely disappears, and the repetition is fundamentally reconstituted. However, one aspect of these disputes flags up a subtle link between the attempted suicide of the 1920s and that of the late 1950s and 1960s â in addition to the idea that both emerge in the borderlands between mental and physical medicine. This concerns friends and relatives. Throughout the debate, the police consistently state that they are to employ watchers only until friends or relatives can be found to take charge. An order for East Suffolk Police from 1902 states that they will only pay for watchers âwhere the person has no friends or relatives able to take care of him, or when such friends or relatives are unwilling to perform or pay for such a serviceâ.28 A Staffordshire Police order from 1904 states that â[i]t is always open, to friends or relations ... to make such provision as they think fit for the care and medical treatment of these personsâ.29 In 1916 the Metropolitan Police commissioner states that the discretion over a charge for attempted suicide is âbased partly on the question whether the offender had any friends or relations willing to take charge of himâ.30 The consistent use of family and friends â and indeed the idea of watchers being a substitute for them â is a convenient administrative response to deal with legal ambiguity and supposedly nervous medical superintendents. So whilst the notion of attempted suicide as cry for help has broad ancestry, it seems possible that the understanding of attempted suicide as primarily a communication with a social circle becomes more obvious if the first response of the police is to contact members of that social circle to come and watch over the attempter (a practice that does not totally disappear until 1961). This is not a case of one state of affairs being a âprototypeâ of a later version of attempted suicide. During this period, ideas about the causes of psychological illness move away from concerns about heredity, the nervous system or brain lesions, and begin to focus more upon social relationships, emotional attachments and adequate adjustment (in infancy and adulthood), all things that place other people in a vitally important position in relation to a personâs mental health. It is also the case that concerns about social issues â such as child guidance, marriage guidance and mental hygiene â emerge between the wars (see also Chapter 2). These concerns, which are decisively adopted"

Without animal experimentation, the course of medicine would have been radically different (one can admit as much without making any presumption about the validity of animal models). Since the nineteenth century, laboratory experimentation has become the gold standard of academic medicine, shaping not only its approach to solving problems, but also the moral conduct and education of doctors. To experimentalists, it was axiomatic that medical science must be objective, rational, and dispassionate: if its advancement required the infliction of pain on laboratory animals, then it was unprofessional, even unethical, to allow squeamishness or sentiment to get in the way. Thus there arose a tension in medicine between the scientific spirit of cool indifference to suffering and the clinical tradition of compassion and caring. When the Continental fashion for vivisection first touched Britain in the 1820s, many doctors chose to distance themselves from it for the sake of their reputation, and the few who did undertake it felt the need to defend a choice that seemed at odds with the ethos of their profession.

None of this is accidental for our project. As I have documented earlier, Luciano Floridiâs information ontology, as he himself emphasizes, âdraws on the emphasis on the interconnection between all things familiar from recent environmental and feminist philosophiesâand, importantly, from such non-Western views as Buddhism and Confucian thoughtâ (Ess 2009, p. 161). This is to say: Floridiâs information ontology, among its many other virtues, brings forward precisely the ways in which computational technologies and computer networks facilitate and enable our sense of selfhood as relational beings first of all. But as it does so, it thereby reiterates at least parallel understandings of selfhood qua relational found in both modern (Western) feminism, ecology, and phenomenologyâif not in at least some version of Kantâas well as in both ancient Western and Eastern frameworks. Insofar as this is true, then our focus in the (analogue-) digital age on interactions and relationality rightly highlights these as brought forward in striking new ways. But it may be more accurate to say that this is a renewed focus, one that has been brewing for quite some time in modern Western philosophy (if not in Kant, then certainly in phenomenology)âand one that would not seem unfamiliar to ancients in either Western or Eastern worlds."

Because epistemological justification is about giving reasons, and not about making calculations, the finite mind objection applies in full force. A similar reaction to our views has been voiced by Adam Poslaskowski and Joshua Smith.15 They argue that, although âvaluable lessonsâ can be drawn from our formal results, it is âentirely unclearâ that these results meet a basic requirement, namely âproviding an account of infinite chains of propositions qua reasons made available to agentsâ.16 Podlaskowski and Smith call this âthe availability problemâ: Given the distinctive emphasis that Peijnenburg, Atkinson, and Herzberg place on calculability, we have doubts about the extent to which (on their account) an infinite chain of propositions can serve as reasons that are available to an agent. (This is what shall be called the availability problem facing the distinctive brand of infinitism under consideration).17 . . . it is hard to see, more generally, how the emphasis on calculability yields a notion of available reason (or availability) that can serve the infinitistâs purposes.18"

It is a whole system including patientsâ data, physicianâs decision and systemsâ elaboration/recommendations. The most important part of this scenario is the fact that the surgeon is responsible for deciding whether or not he/she will take the advice of the machine. The moment this changes and the surgeon must do what the machine tells it (whether this is an explicit formal policy at the hospital or an implicit one) the scenario changes and the relation is no longer ethically acceptable or desirable. The second scenario is one in which the surgeonâs freedom to choose has been limited.

The idea that changes can happen on any level of society is particularly relevant to my argument about the generative role of feelings of gender. No structure has priority and subtle changes may take place before they are properly understood. Williams offers the example of gradual changes in literary style. Such small elements of qualitative changes are not necessarily epiphenomena to institutional changes or just accidental variation. They are social in two ways: they are âchanges of the presentâ and they are effective before they are classified and understood (Williams 1977: 132â133). Williamsâ concept of structure of feeling, his take on incremental changes and how they can happen anywhere in a system are highly generative ideas for my analysis of how patterns of feelings in different generations, genders and classes represent an agency that may contribute in creative ways to the gradual change of gendered practices. However, the concept of feelings needs more psychological elaboration in order to become operative in a study of lived lives."

Sellars was a compatibilist about free will, like the vast majority of scientists and philosophers of that era, and he did not believe that a libertarian free will requiring indeterminism could be accounted for without appealing to obscure forms of agency of the kinds Strawson had called âpanicky metaphysics.â Appealing to an influential distinction that Sellars had himself introduced into contemporary philosophical discourse, he granted that free will in some sense was an integral part of what he called the manifest image of humans and their world. But he did not believe that a traditional indeterminist or libertarian free will could be reconciled with what he called the scientific image of the world; and he challenged me to show otherwise. With the naÃ¯vetÃ© characteristic of a young graduate student, I suggested that I would return in a few weeks with an answer to this challenge. It has turned out to be a project of somewhat longer duration, still ongoing. It was a surprise therefore some 40 years later when I received in the mail a complementary copy of Facing the Future, sent to me by Nuel Belnap. It was not sent to me as a former student, but rather as someone who had in the intervening years written extensively on the free will problem, attempting to make sense of the libertarian free will, who might find the book congenial and a significant contribution to that project. (He had in fact forgotten I had ever been a student of his so many years ago and I had to remind him of the fact.) That our intellectual paths should cross this way after so many years was indeed fortuitous. For, as noted above, I do believe that FF provides a logical framework that is congenial to the project of making sense of a free will requiring indeterminism and hence to addressing the Intelligibility Question."

However, it was derailed by the self-interests of a handful of public servants. They were veterans of the system and were able to ignite squabbles between the two public service departments and continue with their âbusiness as usual.â However, all of this offers a great lesson, in that when there is resistance to change and innovation, one must be flexible and react accordingly. One mistake we made in executing a presidential policy was the fact that we dealt with those at the strategic level, ignoring and hurting the feelings of the mid-level managers who usually execute policy. Self-interest and other ulterior motives are often responsible for creating paralysis in policy formulation and implementation. In retrospect, there are many things that we ignored and that led, as a result, to our policy failure. We should never have assumed there would be no resistance from Postal Corporation. Had we applied interactive decisionmaking theory to the Postal case as in the other cases, we might have succeeded. Without making any assumptions, we should have involved many more stakeholders, who would have prevailed on the officers to let go of their personal motives. And we should at least have involved not just people at the strategy levels but the senior officers and other field staff."

In this section, we explain this conventionâs high-level approach, the security measures to be taken in a number of situations (motivating each separately with a summary table at the end). After that, we define a number of reusable macro-instructions that can be used to conveniently apply the proposed convention in subsequent examples. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we stick to a single, rather standard, C stack and register-passed stack and return pointers, much like a standard C calling convention. However, to prevent various ways of misusing this basic scheme, we put local capabilities to work and take a number of not-alwaysobvious safety measures. The safety measures are presented in terms of what we need to do to protect ourselves against an adversary, but this is only for presentation purposes as our code assumes no special status on the machine. In fact, an adversary can apply the same safety measures to protect themselves against us. In the next paragraphs, we will explain the issues to be considered in all the"
48,68,0.99,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"is likely to be one of those overoptimistic persons pursuing the near impossible. Now the optimists, or at least one of them, have an advantage in the battle of survival. Similarly, if all the costs, efforts, delays, and frustrations of a companyâs ambitious projects were known beforehand, the projects might perhaps never have been initiated. When completed, most of the ambitious projects may have become complete failures, but perhaps one of them became a great success, giving the company a tremendous advantage that more than compensated for all the failures. Preceding many great successes are usually a high number of failures with strongly overoptimistic costâbenefit predictions. The economist Albert O. Hirschman proposed an argument in favour of being overoptimistic [14]. He argued that people tend to underestimate their creativity and ability to find solutions to problems that emerge. Overoptimistic time and cost predictions may compensate for this overpessimism. Thus, overoptimism is the hiding hand that helps us conceal difficulties and encourages us to complete worthwhile projects that we never would have initiated had we known how problematic they would become. The researchers Flyvbjerg and Sunstein [15] showed that in most large infrastructure projects, difficulties were indeed underestimated, as evident by the strong tendency to experience cost overruns. The benefits, for example, in terms of the number of users of a service, were, on the other hand, typically overestimated. If we overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, we may tend to start projects that are not worthwhile, and the hiding hand will not be as helpful as Hirschman assumed. Flyvbjerg and Sunstein claimed that the negative hiding hand, which they termed the malevolent hiding hand, applied in 78% of the projects they studied, while Hirschmanâs positive hiding hand, which they termed the benevolent hiding hand, applied to only 22% of the projects. Even if negative effects of overoptimism should be more common than positive effects in infrastructure and other types of projects, there may still be more benefits than costs across all such projects for society at large. With a few projects yielding immense benefits and fewer projects being detrimental, it would not be that bad to have a high number of overoptimistic costâbenefit analyses after all. However, we have yet to see systematic studies on the distribution of benefit outcomes for large projects. A tendency towards overoptimism may be a result of a supportive and friendly environment that does not punish failures too much. Overpessimism, on the other hand, may be a result of a more unfriendly environment. There is a fascinating line of research that shows how humans and animals, for instance, dogs, rats, and starlings, seem to develop more overoptimistic expectancies in better environments [16]. In a study of birdsâ behaviour, the researchers exposed starlings to both bad and good cage conditions. The bad conditions included unpredictable feeding and cleaning times in a small, boring cage. The good cage conditions included continuous access to water baths, perches made from natural branches, and bark chipping on the floor. The birds first learned that they could receive food pellets if they pressed one lever when they saw a light for two seconds and another lever when the light appeared for 15 seconds. From previous studies, the researchers knew that the birds"
2,340,0.99,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"Regarding informal contact, there are smaller differences between public and nonpublic schools. Both have structures in place to allow studentsâ and parentsâ voices to be heard, and there is a shared understanding among interviewees from different groups that these structures are useful and available. In the public schools, users and staff do not experience any lack of user involvement. They stress that personal contact between teachers and parents is fluid, and that the school is receptive to input from parents. The relationship between teachers and parents is important, and personal chemistry is not dependent on one type of institutional sector. Yet, the flexibility of the structures can be different. Nonproï¬t schools are based on an ideology that entails more user input and different teaching methods than in for-proï¬t and public schools. A teacher at a nonproï¬t school explains the difference: That is the major, decisive difference from the public school. The children are involved in what goals we have for them and what ambitions we have for their development. We continuously set goals on three levels: the professional, the personal, and the social. They are themselves involved, so the old concept of self-management exudes from our school. (Interview, staff member, nonproï¬t school, Denmark)"
14,308,0.99,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"In addition, the children themselves said they did not care about skin colours in their school. Therefore, on the surface, it appeared that skin colour was not an issue. However, observation of various events, one of which I will present below, challenges the assertion of colour-blindness (see also Seeberg 2003). As part of the ï¬eldwork, I was with the children in a gym and saw Robert lying on the floor, apparently very upset. It turned out that Adine had called him âniggerâ (svarting, lit. âblackieâ). Both Adine and Robertâs families come from Africa. Adineâs family is from Morocco, while Robertâs parents come from South Africa. Adine called Robert svarting for no apparent reason; they were not quarrelling or ï¬ghting. Her use of the derogatory word may contradict the teacherâs assertion that the students used racial terms only in cases of conflict. The term angered the other boys in the gym. They started whispering excitedly and soon a loud, uniï¬ed, aggressively repetitive âRacist, racist, racist!â was heard throughout the gym. The boys, led by Abdullah, approached Adine. She tried to hide behind me while I was trying to calm the angry boys down: âStop, stop, donât make a fuss out of this, just leave it!â âBut, listen, she is a racist!â they insisted. I told them to calm down and continue with their games, because I considered this an issue to be dealt with by the teacher, not by a researcher doing ï¬eldwork. The above event indicates that skin colour did have importance in their everyday life. This is supported by a comment made by Lisa, the teacher, who asserted, âAfricans, they are black, they are labelled blacks, they can be called that by Pakistanis, who are labelled brown.â It is my impression that the label âblackâ is more an expression of serious insult, as in the situation with Adine above, than the âbrownâ label. âBrownâ is more of a descriptive classiï¬catory term and it is not part of a legacy of racist terminology in the same way as âblack.â These colour distinctions may be interpreted as an indication of racialized ethnic hegemony and are also indications of a contested childhood. At Dal school, this hegemony is represented by (light) brown-skinned Asians, for instance the majority group of Pakistanis, together with ethnic Norwegians. This example indicates that skin colour is important for identity construction among the studied children. The following conversation between Nasreen and Saira, two girls whose families are from Pakistan, further attests to this hypothesis: Mari: I suppose you often get the question: where are you from? Nasreen: They see it by the way we look! But people can mix up whether we come from India, Bangladesh, Pakistanâ¦ People can see whether you are Norwegian by the way you dress, they dress in âshortâ clothesâ¦[to be discussed later]. Saira: Because we donât have different skin colour [the nationalities just mentioned]. Mari: But what do you think yourself, you are born in Norway, go to a Norwegian schoolâ¦"

Sometimes, such information is really of no interest to us, so we just ignore it.

It becomes more difficult when they do give us information that is important, and is either new, or corroborates other evidence. Our India researcher has literally had the experience of a respondent who had given permission for a recorded interview changing his mind and asking for the recording to be erased. When such a request is made, whether we think it is reasonable or not, no visible trace of the information should remain in our published work. But what cannot be asked of us is that we erase the information from our minds. If it is indeed important, it will inform our analysis, and we may look for other sources for the same information.

21,185,0.99,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"Devoting time to serious bibliographical matters as a tribute to Ted Nelson may seem like a quaintly out-of-tune and bookish, if not totally misguided project. It is easy to pigeon-hole Tedâs work as belonging to a generation of adventurous and creative writers and editors active during the 1960s who began to find that traditional print media constrained the expression of their ideas. Marshall McLuhan and the Whole Earth Catalog come to mind. Indeed, Literary Machines opens with the declaration that it is âa hypertext, or nonsequential piece of writing.â Each reader of this book has confronted the difficulties imposed by non-linear writing on the linear medium of print. And yet, there is no way around the fact that most of Tedâs work has been published on paper. This fact alone does not produce a particularly difficult problem for bibliography. The difficulty is rather that many of his important writings appeared in ephemeral or semi-published formats, ranging from conference proceedings and magazines of every ilk to self-published books that were produced anywhere and nowhere â at least from the perspective of libraries such as my own that tried desperately to acquire copies. As a result of the vagabond nature of the Nelson oeuvre, few libraries own more than a few of his published works, and several of his most important texts, such as the earliest editions of Computer Lib/Dream Machines and Literary Machines have achieved almost legendary status for being difficult to lay hands on. So where are we to turn for the texts? Thus, this bibliography. At least it is a start. My goal has been to put together a complete picture of Ted Nelsonâs body of work as expressed in publication, including selections from ephemeral and non-print media. It has not been easy. As the"

Considering lifetime we have to take into account characteristics, which are stored in the user model. User characteristics together with their classification are described in section 6.2.1. Hence, we can assume that if the majority of the characteristics belong to the long-term group it is unlikely that lifetime of the user model will be short-term and vice versa.

Has Brexit shown this to be the case? Is Union citizenship, after all, nothing but a concession made by the Masters of the Treatises that can be called back at political convenience? Is EU citizenship somehow âmeaninglessâ? A positive implication of adopting the functionalist theory is that answers to these questions are of no consequence for the analysis conducted. It does not matter for the functionalist theory whether the citizenship is ârealâ or a case of rhetoric. The theory is only committed to the fact that citizenship is a status, putative or not. The theory is agnostic towards âthickâ concepts associated with citizenship such as identity and recognition. This is due to the fact that it is not a theory suggesting a conception of citizenship. There are arguably many such conceptions, the pros and cons of which have been debated in great detail over the last decades by citizenship scholars (Mindus 2014). The functionalist theory offers a concept of citizenship, not a conception. The concept of citizenship that the theory develops only requires a very minimal ontological commitment: That status civitatis is, conceptually speaking, a middle-term. As such, it is not true, nor false. As such, it does not âcorrespondâ to any empirical fact. It can, nonetheless, be investigated from an empirical perspective. There does not need to be anything âout thereâ to which the concept corresponds for it to work. What is required of status civitatis is to connect grounds for acquisition and loss with legal positions. This characterisation does not only ï¬t the legal facts. It is fully able to explain the constitutional dimension of citizenship policy. No ontological commitments to peopleâs identity or ability to identify with others are needed for this purpose. The theory is in line with the tradition of Scandinavian legal realism, a corpus of philosophical literature concerning this very point that has too often been neglected by legal scholars to their detriment.1 In keeping with this tradition, there is no need to believe that the legal concepts used somehow exist to provide insightful analysis into how they work. As Alf Ross famously argued in relation to the concept of ownership, it might be the case that it is in reality a meaningless word, a form of rhetoric, without changing the fact that, by looking at how it connects the conditioning facts and the conditional consequences in the law, we can understand perfectly well how the concept works â et pour cause, scrutinise it critically.

These and many other bioethical considerations are best first subject to moral dialogues, assisted by bodies such as ethics committees in hospitals or the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, butâespecially given the growing volume of such policy mattersâsome ought to be worked out by courts and legislatures. Finally, communitarian bioethics leads one to suggest criteria that moral dialogues, judges, and lawmakers may draw upon. One is the relative adverse impact on the two core conflicting values that flow from the adoption of a given policy. That is, when autonomy must be much curbed for minor gains to the common good, responsive communitarianism suggests autonomy should be given the right of way, while public policy should lean in the opposite direction if the gains to the common good are substantial and the sacrifice of autonomy is minimal (Etzioni 1999). These criteria would help explain the position articulated by Tom L. Beauchamp (1994, pp. 18â19), who argues that society should switch its conceptions of the public and private good in terms of euthanasia and organ donation. Euthanasia, currently considered an issue where the public determines its application, ought to be a private matter, according to Beauchamp, because that is the logical conclusion of a culture that allows patients extreme latitude to determine their treatment up to (but currently not including) death, with the assumption that personal care choices have more impact on personal autonomy than they do on society at large. At the same time, organ donation, with its widespread implications for the well-being of the community, ought to be moved out of the realm of personal decision making and into the public arena, putting the focus on the public good, which is more impacted by organ donation decisions than is individual autonomy. Other criteria indicate that one ought to find ways to absorb the side effects. For instance, if one introduces a policy that calls for testing newborn infants for HIV, special care must be taken to keep the results confidential, lest the mother lose her job, housing, or insurance."

277,538,0.99,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"Both the EMN and MIPEX can be understood as forms of social learning that, in different ways, seek to break down barriers between the domestic and the international. Both are located within the EU field and address âproblems of Europeâ. They can also be understood as displaying characteristics of what have been called âcommunities of practiceâ, which are âgroups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularlyâ (Wenger 2010). Participating in a community of practice is an essential element of learning as it is the âsocial containerâ that brings people together by a sense of joint enterprise, mutual engagement and a shared repertoire of communal resources (Wenger 2010: 229). The social definition of learning that is central to the operation of a community of practice has two components (competence and personal experience) combining with three modes of belonging (engagement, imagination and alignment). Competence is historically and socially defined: âTo be competent is to be able to engage with the community and be trusted as a partner in these interactionsâ (Wenger 2010: 229). Competence and experience are not necessarily congruent but when they are in close tension and either starts pulling the other then learning takes place. A practical example of this dynamic in the context of learning about migrant integration policies within the EU would be between older/new member states/countries of immigration with asymmetries in experience that affect the historical and social definition of competence. The three modes of belonging are typically seen as co-existing. Engagement involves people working together in ways that can shape experience. An imaginative leap can also be required to think of oneself as a member of a community of practice and to see some basis for shared membership. This leap may be large if the community is big (a national community) and members donât all meet, but is not such a large leap if members do meet on a regular basis (as they do in both the cases that are analysed in this chapter). The third mode of belonging is alignment, understood as a mutual process of coordinating perspectives that may, at first glance, appear quite pluralistic, but will be embedded within social structures that do not evenly distribute resources. A community of practice has three key characteristics. First, a shared domain of interest as membership implies a commitment to the domain. Second, the existence of a community as evidenced by joint activities, discussions and information sharing. Third, a community of practice is also a community of practitioners with a âshared repertoire of resources â experiences, stories, tools, ways of addressing recurring problems â in short a shared practiceâ (Wenger 2010: 229). Practices can develop through problem solving, requests for information, seeking experience, reusing assets, coordination and synergy, discussing developments, documentation projects, visits, mapping knowledge and identifying gaps (Wenger 2010). All these are evident in the EMN and MIPEX. Boundary interactions can then be stimulated by individuals acting as brokers across boundaries while âboundary objectsâ such as the development of data and information can also facilitate boundary interactions as comparable data can also help to generate a sense of shared meaning (Star and Griesemer 1989)."

If the models have random mistakes and their biases are uncorrelated, then the average of the models (the multi-model mean) tends to be better than most of the models. This is a big âif,â and many models have dependencies, but in practice (and in synthetic statistical tests), because the climate system is complicated, and most models meet basic measures of representing the system (conservation of energy and mass), the multi-model mean is usually a pretty good statistic. This makes ensembles quite valuable. One thing to remember is that there is lots of chaotic internal variability in the climate system, and the observed record is only one possible realization of that internal variability. There may or may not be an El NiÃ±o event this year, but the possibility is that there could have been. So with the real climate system, we have only one ensemble. We expect models to be different from observations in any given year, or even decade, if they are fully coupled and internally consistent. This also confounds prediction and evaluation. It is one reason why the present and the past do not fully constrain the future (see box). Why the Present and Past DO NOT Constrain the Future It is often assumed that a model must be able to represent the present (or past climate) correctly to represent the future. This is true. However, while necessary, it is not a sufï¬cient condition to constrain the future. Suppose that a model represents the present for the wrong reasons. Perhaps there is a large compensation of errors: Maybe an error in the radiation code letting in too much energy is compensated for by an error in the sea-ice model that reflects too much energy. If the planet warms up, the sea ice will go away, but the error in the radiation code will remain. It is also assumed that the more accurate a model is at representing the present (or the past), the better it will be at representing the future. This is also true, but it requires that âbetterâ representations be for those areas that matter for future climate, and this is not necessarily the case. What does that mean in practice? Letâs say you have two measures of model performance. One is based on clouds, and one is based on temperature. If model A scores 80 % on both temperature and clouds relative to observations, and model B scores 100 % on clouds but 20 % on temperature, then a simple average score says that model A scores 80 % and model B scores 60 %. But if present clouds are more important for future climate than temperature, model B may be better. In the previous example, the present-day model may score well on sea ice and lower on the radiation code, but the radiation code is more important for the future. Also, knowing the mean state today does not imply that you can predict the change in that state accurately in the future. It is usually a good indicator, but not guaranteed. That covers why the present does not necessarily constrain the future. Because with present climate we do not know what the response to a forcing (i.e., feedbacks) will be. But what about using the past: If we know"

It is then not the more or less technical nature of an innovation, nor the degree to which its final (by)effects are beneficial, but the offspring from the realms of society and social interactions that might make a difference between innovations at large and social innovations. He also tries to show that in the last centuries, there has been a swing from individual and business based to what he calls ânon-market/networkedâ based (social) innovations. It would be tempting to discuss then in which ways there is a link between more social innovation and more civil society as a fertile ground for processes that generate and give room to such innovations. The view proposed by Johnson may allow a more subtle understanding of the prevailing broad consensus on the positive definition of the âsocialâ aspect of social innovation (see BEPA 2010; Mulgan 2006). They may not always be seen unanimously as good, but possibly as more promising or attractive than previous arrangements, or in comparison to the lifestyles created by the innovative products, services or regulations of big business and big government. While this allows us to feel sympathetic towards social innovations, we must still remain critical about statements and definitions that declare them as inherently good. Interpretations of the added value and success of social innovations, which reflect what is seen as good and better for society, will often be widely contested. By definition, innovations differ from prevailing routines, forms of thinking and acting. It is possible that they may become a mainstream practice, but this is never the case at the outset. They can be linked with a diverse range of goals and come to take on different meanings over time. Just as important as the initial goals of social innovation are wider political concepts and institutional systems in which they become embedded (see e.g. Osborne and Brown 2011), reactions of the social and economic environments, and the hopes for better coping strategies and solutions that they attract. The enormous impact of social environments for the shape and directions innovations take is a well known topic from the older and more established research and debates on technological innovations (see e.g. Chesbrough 2003). Basically all innovations, technological and social innovations, are, as convincingly argued by Nowotny (1997), marked by a high degree of risk and uncertainty in the course of their development. Altogether, this shows that defining innovationâand more specifically social innovationâis an issue in an evolving area of study undergoing a great deal of change and often linked with normative assumptions. Against this background, our definition avoids objectifying what is a matter of processes involving not only proponents and activists and their initial goals but also the ways contexts react and shape the ways and directions social innovations develop. We employed the simple criterion that social innovations are those that, created mainly by networks and joint action in social realms beyond business and government routines, at any given moment, raise the hope and expectations of progress towards something âbetterâ (a more socially sustainable/democratic/effective"

Focusing on Hubbubâs different projects, the social interactions that make it up, its public statements, the strategies of its management team, and so on, this project resituates Hubbub within a broader field of early twenty-first century interdisciplinarity â and the projects within it as projects suspended within Hubbubâs own collaborative logic. We are also using a qualitative and quantitative questionnaire (designed by Angela Woods, and drawing on her work in âHearing the Voiceâ (see Robson, Woods, and Fernyhough 2015 )), which is taking the pulse of the 50 or so collaborators in Hubbub at two different time-points. This questionnaire includes a social network analysis, which will be used to track the density and dynamics of the projectsâ collaborations over time â and which, incidentally, draws on our neuroscientific collaboratorsâ expertise in topological methods that they employ in functional connectivity analyses of the brain (e.g. Margulies et al. 2013). We are also designing and trialling a new method called âIn the Diary Roomâ â which will be an automated collective reflection and self-tracking process, loosely inspired by âThe Diary Roomâ of Big Brother fame. Collaborators who volunteer will be randomly called into a small room just off our main project space, and will therein be asked a series of recorded, randomized questions about their day, how they feel the project is going, different feelings they have around collaboration in that project space, and so on. This is one of the ways in which we are gathering data about relations of power (see Chapter 6), and about the dynamics of affect (see Chapter 7). (For further details of all of these techniques, see Callard, Fitzgerald, and Woods 2015.) The important point is that all the different elements of building an interdisciplinary career that we have discussed â finding collaborators, getting training, meeting people, applying for grants, having interdisciplinary papers published â are worth tracking and reflecting on in their own right. And this is not simply out of a narcissistic sense that oneâs own and oneâs collaboratorsâ research trajectory is intrinsically fascinating, but rather because these mundane actions, spaces, and efforts make up what we might call, following Bruno Latour, the âplasmaâ of interdisciplinarity, viz. the âcirculations of totalizations and participationsâ of interdisciplinary collaboration that are still âwaiting for explication and compositionâ (2012, 93).

77,321,0.99,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Understanding what combination of APC causes changes in health is of importance to many researchers, especially since different combinations of APC can have different public health policy implications. Unfortunately, meaningfully partitioning change into these three dimensions with statistical methods is far from straightforward, because age, period and cohort are exactly linearly dependent. This chapter considers the very serious implications of this âidentification problemâ for longitudinal and life course research. Whilst the focus will be on health, the methodological and conceptual issues apply across the social sciences and beyond. The chapter is structured as followed. We first outline the APC identification problem, and why simply controlling for age, period and cohort, as you might for imperfectly co-linear variables, does not work in the case of age, period and cohort. We show that the identification problem needs to be carefully considered whenever life course or longitudinal change is modelled, and that naÃ¯ve models can radically reassign effects between age, period and cohort, producing misleading results. Next, we outline some proposed solutions to the identification problem, focusing on Yang and Landâs Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort (HAPC) model (Yang and Land 2006, 2013), and, using the example of the obesity epidemic, show how they often do not work. Finally, we outline what we consider to be best practice when considering APC effects, by extending the HAPC model, and demonstrate this with an example examining APC effects on mental health (measured by the General Health Questionnaire) using the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We argue that whilst there is no method that can mechanically separate APC effects in all scenarios, when good theory is used to make robust assumptions regarding APC effects, researchers can often make useful and non-arbitrary inference."
360,319,0.99,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"The average oddness rate for this pair of verbs was 3.39 on a scale between 1 and 6, where 1 meant ânot odd at allâ and 6 meant âphysically impossibleâ. We conclude that such a situation is atypical for the concepts WALK and WRITE. Nevertheless, the situation is highly acceptable as a legitimate instance for each of those concepts: when Lucy happens to be walking and writing at the same time, we do not expect many speakers to reject the description âLucy is walkingâ just because the event is atypical for the concept WALK. Similarly we do not expect the sentence âLucy is writingâ to be rejected if she happens to be walking at the same time. To describe the dissociation between judgements about vagueness and typicality, it is common to associate concepts with typicality functions. Similarly to our treatment of acceptability functions, we will use typicality functions that map situations to a value between 0 and 1.9 The typicality value assigned to a situation may be different than the value assigned by the acceptability function. Summarizing the judgements in Examples 1â3 above, we make the following assumptions on the typicality and acceptability functions. For the concept HAIR in Example 1, let S1 be a situation with a focally red hair. Based on the observations above, we denote: ACCHAIR (S1 ) â 1 and TYPHAIR (S1 ) âª 1. For the concept SHAKE in Example 2, let S2 be the situation in Fig. 2b. We denote: ACCSHAKE (S2 ) â 1 and TYPSHAKE (S2 ) âª 1. For the concepts WALK and WRITE in Example 3, let S3 be a situation where Lucy is walking and writing simultaneously. We denote: ACCWALK (S3 ) â 1 and TYPWALK (S3 ) âª 1, and similarly for WRITE. With this background on concepts, their vagueness and typicality effects, we can move on to the question of concept composition."
247,173,0.99,Humanities World Report 2015,"way research has become much more internationalised over the past few years. One interesting answer, which occurred a few times in quite different regions, is that internationalisation is not particularly new. Scholars have long been international in their choice of topics, in what they read and refer to, and in the conferences they attend. What is new, however, is the growth of international networks, funding initiatives, publishing and ranking systems. According to many of our respondents, all this brings with it the risk of homogeneity. This, at least, is the view of around half of the Asians we interviewed, as well as half the Africans and half the non-Anglophone Europeans (excluding the Russians). Only one Anglophone scholar referred to the issue (an American working frequently in Asia). Although this does not constitute a majority it is still a very significant minority, not least because this same message is consistently voiced in quite different parts of the world. In what follows we shall distinguish three different forms of internationalisation, which are thought to lead to homogeneity: networks, publishing and ranking. International networks Let us start with the increase of international research networks, collaboration and overseas funding. One respondent from Norway noted the phenomenon, but remained neutral about its effects: E6: The main national funding body, the Norwegian Research Council, puts great stress on internationalisation when applications are evaluated. This means that projects which can show that they are part of international networks, have a greater chance of being funded, other things being equal. But the following respondents were far from neutral. They all thought that such internationalisation leads to the Westernisation or Northernisation of research agendas, even though it has other benefits:1 ME1: In addition to EU projects ... there are many cooperation agreements between Jordan and Western universities, for both faculty and students. Since 9/11, Western countries are getting more interested in the Middle East, and a lot of people are coming to Jordan. Also, some agencies are working in Jordan, e.g. US agencies and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In most cases they determine the research topics and impose them on us"

But an important element in the logic of integration processes is the time factor. Integration of newcomers is a long-term process by its very nature. This immediately becomes apparent if we look through the lens of newcomers. At the individual level, adult immigrants may adapt cognitively and adjust their behaviour when they learn how things are done, by whom, and so on. This part is relatively easy and pays off quickly. However, their adaptation in the aesthetic (relating to the five senses) and normative realms takes more time. Feelings, likes, dislikes, and perceptions of good and evil remain rather persistent"
271,621,0.99,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"concept of figuration. What is the boundary of a figuration? What separates one figuration from another? How do people switch from one figuration to another? Can they be part of several figurations at the same time, and how does this work? These questions were difficult enough to answer before deep mediatization. Today, the ramifications are almost impossible. The concept of a frame of relevance offers us a way to understand the increasingly complex linkages between people, in a way that no paradigm I am aware of can do. Let us return to the game of cards. The four players share a frame of relevance: the game. However, they may be playing their game in a placeâ say, a barâwith other people. Presumably, they also share a frame of relevance, though less intensely, with these people. Possibly, their relations with the people in the room vary. Maybe the husband of one of the players is there. Marriage is typically a two-person figuration. The other players may have other shared frames of relevance with this person: family, friend, neighbour. These nested and overlapping figurations can all be captured and analyzed with the concept of the âframes of relevanceâ, which can be expanded endlessly upward, downward and outward. Now imagine a game of cards that is played online. Maybe all four players are in different corners of the world. One may be home alone, one in a train, one in a bar, one surreptitiously playing a game at work. In a mediated situation, the permutations are endless. To make up a figuration, physical co-presence is not necessary at all. Especially in such complex mediated cases, thinking of figurations as delineated by shared frames of relevance is a fruitful innovation. The consequence, of course, is that everybody is always part of many figurations at the same time, spread across different locations. But this âcomplex and also contradictoryâ situation, as Hepp, Simon and Sowinska observe (Chap. 3), is the normal state of affairs for most people today. With this budding new paradigm, we at least have the words to describe it."

It also conveys a deeper script about the quest to transform not only state praxis, that is, how the state functions, but also to change the meaning of the relationships between society and the state. Scholarly inquiries into the state throw up a host of theoretical implications. Of particular relevance to our context is, how can we understand the relationship between the state and society, and how do we understand power and resistance both inside and outside the state? Anthropological theory-production about the state has problematized and criticized Foucauldian and Weberian approaches to the state that pose state and society in a dichotomist relationship. For Foucauldian-inspired scholars, the state derives its power and its appearance as a bounded totality through the aggregated diffusion of impersonalized rule, institutions and proceduresâthat is, governmentality (e.g., see Foucault 1991; Mitchell 2006). To Weberian scholars, âthe state appears monolithic to society because its work follows certain impersonal, rational and standardized routines which give it a sui generis qualityâ (Neuman 2005:195). In both cases, the state appears as a bounded locus of power, set apart from society. Anthropological scholars on the other hand, have argued that how the state appears, and how people view the state and position themselves in relation to it, is essentially a case of empirical inquiry. Gupta (1995), for example, asks whether the Western legacy of universalizing a dual cultural construction of stateâsociety relations stands up to scrutiny in the face of âincommensurable cultural and historical contextsâ (Gupta 1995:214). Drawing on ethnography from India, he argues that âwe should leave open the analytical question as to the conditions under which the state does operate as a cohesive and unitary wholeâ (Gupta 1995:229). Nuijten (2003) makes a similar argument when she teases out a duality in the way Mexican peasants both engage with and imagine the state. Power is not an abstract formalized rule, but rather a myriad of changing strategies that are personalized and continuously reinvented (Nuijten 2003:120). At the same time, she argues that governmental techniques such as stamps, maps"

303,164,0.99,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"seems to be due to the assumption that internationalization occurs when Japanese people go abroad, that is, when the direction of internationalization is outbound. Japanese people have an image of their going abroad, and thus they come to a conclusion that they need English outside Japan. However, as we saw above, internationalization does not occur unidirectionally. The opposite form of internationalization occurs when foreigners come from outside Japan. In this type of internationalization, which is called internal internationalization (Tsuneyoshi, 2004), the direction is inbound, and knowledge of the first languages of the foreigners will enhance communication between them and Japanese people. In other words, there is a sizable conflict regarding internationalization for Japanese people. In internationalization in its traditional sense, they believe they have to use English, although this is not always true, and thus they try to learn and use it for communication with foreigners, even when they go to countries or regions in which English is not primarily used. Thus Japanese people may believe that learning English is important, and English education as the de facto foreign language subject in compulsory education in Japan supports this view. In contrast, in internal internationalization, Japanese people believe they have only to use Japanese, and English if necessary, and thus they do not try to learn other foreign languages even if the foreigners who use them as their first language outnumber those who use English as such. This may be partly because Japan tries to assimilate foreigners into Japanese society by making them learn Japanese on one hand and neglecting foreign language education other than English in the compulsory education system on the other. Implementing foreign language education other than English in compulsory education may lead to resolving this conflict."

Thereby journalism neither succeeds in depicting the âbig science pictureâ of policy, ethics, and economics holistically, nor the real complexity of a knowledge-creation process authentically, which is everything but linear, being a process in which knowledge is permanently being contradicted or falsified, and is therefore never final. However, the notion of what the essence of science really is could perfectly well be vulgarised through web technologies, in the sense of making the different steps within this process of knowledge-creation transparent, for instance by means of a continuous blog or other messaging or sharing platforms. Yet there are still only very few examples for such formats (see below), and they are particularly sparse in journalism. The tendency to reduce science to supposed success stories is certainly also a result of its mediatisation, i.e. science and science policies reacting and adapting to the mass media logic by which it is increasingly being shaped and framed (Krotz 2007; Fuller 2010; Weingart 2001).

252,40,0.99,The Ethics of Vaccination,"Establishing Ethical REsponsibilitiEs in thE contExt of Vaccination This chapter is about the ethical obligations or responsibilities1 pertaining to vaccination of three different actors. As we shall see in more detail later, there are three possible bearers of ethical obligations: individuals, collectives, and institutions (such as states). Thus, one could ask whether any individual has a moral obligation to have themselves or their children vaccinated against common infectious diseases, such as the seasonal flu, mumps, measles, rubella, and any communicable diseases that pose major threats to the health and even survival of individuals. Alternatively, one could ask whether our community, as a collective, has a collective ethical obligation to realize herd immunity and what it means to have a collective obligation. Or, again, one could ask whether institutions have an ethical obligation to enforce policies that ensure a communityâs realization of herd immunity against certain diseases. Since I am looking for a philosophical justification for any such ethical obligation, the central parts of this chapter will be rather technical in philosophical terms. Unsurprisingly, the fact that vaccination decisions need to be taken at three different levelsâindividual, collective, and institutionalâgenerates conflicts of values within and between these levels. In particular, when grounding any ethical obligation to be vaccinated or to vaccinate oneâs children, and when legitimizing any coercive policy that forces individuals to vaccinate themselves or their children, a first ethical problem may arise from a conflict between individual best interest and individual autonomy. A second ethical problem may arise from a conflict between individual autonomy and public health. If my arguments are sound, I will, by the end of the chapter, have solved both problems and provided a philosophical justification for certain ethical obligations at each of the three levels. Before presenting this philosophical justification, however, let me say something more about the two ethical problems I have just mentioned, so as to give the reader a clearer view of the challenges ahead. Let me start with the first problem, namely, the possible conflict between autonomy and best interest. With regard to child vaccination, one might think that it is quite uncontroversial to say that there is an individual ethical obligation to vaccinate oneâs children in order to protect their health: after all, being protected against an infectious disease seems From now on, I will use the terms âmoralâ and âethicalâ, as well as the terms âobligationâ and âresponsibilityâ (when referring to forward-looking responsibility), interchangeably."

Qualitative representations can then be iteratively improved. Modeling phenomena with mathematics includes setting up an equation that describes the phenomena. It is important to note that effective problem solvers do not solely model problems qualitatively or quantitatively; rather, they use both sorts of representation, as each informs the other and together can lead to a more effective solution and solution process (Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Van Heuvelen & Zou, 2001). For example, after creating a qualitative model, one may proceed to create a quantitative model. The finished qualitative model will influence how the quantitative model is set up. One should then see where the models are consistent, and where they contradict each other; in this way, the models can be progressively improved. By spending adequate time modeling, one can engage in more effective problem-solving, as it guides subsequent investigations, can activate solution schemas, and can provide the framework by which one can simulate what would happen when a variable is manipulated (Anzai & Yokoyama, 1984; Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Sins, Savelsbergh, & van Joolingen, 2005). Just as it is important to learn to create models, it is also important to be able to interpret the models created by others, especially in terms of what these diverse models say differently about the underlying problems (diSessa, 1988; Seufert, 2003; Wu, Krajcik, & Soloway, 2001). Doing so can lead to enhanced understanding of the problem (Seufert, 2003). This is particularly challenging for K-12 students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011; Seufert, 2003). Indeed, learners often simply adhere to the model that is closest to their own early experiences, or the simplest explanation of the underlying phenomenon, even when presented with a more accurate model (diSessa, 1988; Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). This may be explained in part by most K-12 studentsâ lack of familiarity with complex causal models, such as those that explain changes in a factor through indirect action from a combination of factors A and B (Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). While some evidence indicates that reluctance to consider an alternative model is widespread among learners of differing levels of prior knowledge and skill, other evidence indicates that it may be more prevalent among lower-achieving students (Seufert, 2003). Thus, it is especially important to endeavor to increase modeling skills from a social justice vantage point and to broaden participation in STEM (Lynch, 2001). 4.2.1.4.2.3 Argumentation Science is very much a social endeavor, as no scientist works in a vacuum (Ford, 2012). Rather, scientists work in a large community of practice in which they share and defend findings to one another, and build off of othersâ work. At the core of this is argumentation, defined as both backing claims with evidence and models, but also effectively evaluating claims on the basis of evidence and models (Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010). The argumentation process allows scientific models and theories to be iteratively improved (Ford, 2012). To be able to engage in STEM effectively as citizens, individuals also need to be able to engage in clear argumentation (Aufschnaiter et al., 2008; Jonassen, 2011; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958).

One cannot expect to teach students all of the strategies and content that they need through lecture or other approaches ahead of studentsâ engagement with the central problem (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980; Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Rather, support provided to students engaging in problem-centered instructional approaches needs to incorporate scaffolding, defined as interactive support that leverages what students already know to help them meaningfully participate in and gain skill at tasks that are beyond their unassisted abilities (Belland, 2014; Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2011; van de Pol, Volman, & Beishuizen, 2010; Wood, Bruner, & Ross, 1976). Such support leverages what students can already do to help them accomplish things that they would not be able to do otherwise, such as solve the central problem, design an artifact to address the problem, or complete a project (See Fig. 1.1). Scaffolding can be provided by teachers, peers, or computer tools (Belland, 2014; Pifarre & Cobos, 2010; van de Pol et al., 2010), but implementing problem-centered instruction in K-12 settings requires the use of computer-based scaffolding due to the high student-to-teacher ratios in most K-12 schools (Crippen & Archambault, 2012; Saye & Brush, 2002). Instructional scaffolding differs from other instructional support strategies and tools in terms of what students are intended to get out of it, the timing of the support, and the form of the support. First, scaffolding needs to support current performance but also lead to the ability to perform the target skill independently in the future (Belland, 2014; Wood et al., 1976). Thus, a calculator does not qualify as a scaffold because while it supports current performance, it cannot be reasonably expected to help users calculate independently (i.e., without the use of a calculator) more effectively in the future. Second, scaffolding is used while students engage with an authentic/ill-structured problem (Belland, 2014; Collins, Brown, & Newman, 1989; Wood et al., 1976). Modeling a strategy, lecturing to students, or otherwise instructing about strategies or content before engagement with problems does not qualify as scaffolding. Third, scaffolding needs to (a) build off of what students already know and (b) be tied to ongoing assessment of"
72,336,0.99,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Thus arises the figure of the social innovator or social entrepreneur, the civic activist â the missing and self-created agent of the social innovation movement. He seizes on a role already established in business, politics or any other part of social life. However, in seizing on it, he uses this role incongruously. He bends and stretches it. He must be both an insider and an outsider, a practical visionary. He offers tangible down payments on another future. He envelops his tangible initiatives in a discourse promising more and anchors his promises of more in something that people can see and touch now. It is a remarkable feature of a wide range of contemporary societies that they produce an unlimited stock of candidates for this role: men and women who are unresigned to âthe long littleness of lifeâ and determined to place their practical powers at the disposal of a larger aspiration. These people are the lifeblood of the social innovation movement. They exist as who they are before they have a programme or know what to do. Most of them come from a faction of the professional-business class in both richer and poorer countries. Their outlook combines unwillingness to spend their lives rising through the ranks of established business and political organisations with disbelief in the dogmas that have served progressives and leftists in the past. Their public quarrel is with society. Their private quarrel is with the passage of time and the waste of life â of their own lives as well as of the lives of others. As they struggle and search, they face two initial and connected problems. The first problem is that the empire will strike back. Their endeavours will be either suppressed or accommodated, and, if accommodated, reconciled with the established regime, unless the small changes result over time in bigger changes and the many focused actions converge and cumulate. The second problem is that they require if not a programme, at least a direction. Ingenuity is indispensable. There is, however, no substitute for vision."

In this essay, however, I would like to focus on two points: one is an answer to the question posed by Professor Kastenberg, and the other is an extension of the discussion among the students. The construction of this essay is as follows. Firstly, a response to the question is proposed. The question is about improvement of risk analysis and avoiding loss of public confidence. Secondly, further thoughts about the discussion are suggested. The main point of the argument is the relationship between social decision-making and nuclear engineers. One of the students said that it was society that would make a decision about whether to stop using nuclear power, and he would obey the social determination as an engineer. However, this essay suggests that the social/technical dichotomy is meaningless. Finally, an integrated idea of the whole is demonstrated: to construct or reconstruct public confidence, arguments in more detail among nuclear engineers are needed. Professor Kastenberg posed some interesting questions, and one of them is, âWhat would it take to improve the quality of risk analysis and emergency planning"
270,81,0.99,The Huawei and Snowden Questions : Can Electronic Equipment From Untrusted Vendors Be Verified? Can An Untrusted Vendor Build Trust into Electronic Equipment? (Volume 4.0),"What computers can and cannot do has been a long-standing topic in the foundation of computer science. Some of the pioneers of the field had a strong background in mathematics and, in the early days of computing, worked on the mathematical formulation of the limits of computation. The work led to the notion of decidability. Informally speaking, a question that can be answered by either yes or no is decidable if a computer can compute the correct answer in a finite amount of time. The relation that the notion of decidability has to our problem of vendor trust should be obvious. If the question of whether an executable program performs malicious acts is decidable, we can hope to devise a program to check the code made by an untrusted vendor. If it is known to be undecidable, this conclusion should impact on where to invest our efforts. In this chapter, we review and explain some of the key results on decidability and explain how these results impact the problem of untrusted equipment vendors."

However, the most frequent reason for postponing having children is the fear of what they, consistent with modern feminist lingua, name âthe gender trapâ, referring to experiences as well as research that indicate that gender equality in the family only lasts until the arrival of children (Kjeldstad and LappegÃ¥rd 2009; KitterÃ¸d and RÃ¸nsen 2012). They discuss it with their partners, many of whom think it is time for children; they set terms and conditions, but still feel troubled by the prospect of losing freedom and control of their lives. Pia, who at 18 was one of the few who said that she would like to marry a stay-at-home dad, is now very aware of how income inequality plays its part in reproducing a traditional gender division in the family: Iâm very happy that he and I earn the same amount, oh god! Iâm happy about that! And I donât want him to race ahead of me in salary. And had I known ten years ago what I know today, I might have thought more about money than I did when I chose my education. (Pia, 30)"

But we all know that that is not all there is to sex â far from it. Notably Spreadsheets cannot perceive aspects of sex that do not involve thrusting or loud vocalisation, such as caresses, kisses or whispers. And importantly, Spreadsheets can do nothing to measure our emotions during lovemaking. Following Anders Brennaâs example of the weather stations, we might argue that all Spreadsheets needs to do is to install more measuring stations and measure more. It is certainly possible to imagine specialised appendages that could be plugged into a smartphone and worn on or inserted into bodies to measure other aspects of sex than thrusts and decibels. They could use the âhappiness blanketsâ that British Airways used to market their flights in June 2014: in a video advertisement, passengers wore headbands that measured their brainwaves, and the blankets, which had threads of LEDs woven through them, glowed red when passengers were anxious and blue when they were calm and happy (British Airways 2014). A device could even analyse usersâ blood to gauge something of their emotional arousal. No doubt such devices are already used in medical research. Last year, a Dutch team of researchers developed a tool to automatically log unconscious emotions by analysing physiological data, arguing that âTo offer capabilities that are superior to diaries, lifelogging applications should try to capture the complete experiences of people including data from both their external and internal worldsâ (Ivonin et al., 2012). But could even a fastidiously detailed computational analysis of a sexual encounter represent it in a way that felt meaningful to the people involved? If we see ourselves and expect to be seen as data bodies, as quantifiable selves, what do we see? What is left out? Would we want a âhappiness blanketâ to tell everyone around us whether we are calm or anxious? Do we want automated diaries to tell us about emotions we arenât even aware of?"
114,145,0.99,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"The broad capacity of adapting and responding has been discussed extensively in the safety literature and made the cornerstone of some approaches to safety such as resilience engineering (Hollnagel et al. 2007). The term resilience is used in very different ways (Macrae 2014), sometimes very broadly in an attempt to describe and articulate the qualities of a safe organisation and sometimes in a more restricted sense of a capacity to adapt and recover from extreme or unusual circumstances. We believe that resilience is an important concept that needs serious consideration and further research and exploration in practice. However to avoid potential confusion we use the more everyday terms of monitoring, adaptation and recovery to denote occasions where or hazards or failures have been detected and are being actively managed or corrected. We will describe a number of interventions associated with this approach in the following chapters and will just give some brief examples here (Table 6.4). An emphasis on the open discussion of error and system failures by senior leaders is enormously important in fostering a willingness to speak up and intervene if a patient is at risk. Clinical teams use many adaptive mechanisms, both formal and informal, to manage safety on a day to day basis. Anaesthetists for instance have a standard repertoire of prepared emergency routines which are called upon in certain situations. These routines are only seldom used and are deliberately honed and standardised so that they can be adhered to at times of considerable stress. At an organisational level we could see preparations for a possible infection outbreak in a similar way (Zingg et al. 2015). Briefings and debriefings can be used by ward staff, operating theatre teams and healthcare managers to monitor day to day threats to safety. For example, briefings carried out by operating theatre teams provide an opportunity to identify and resolve equipment, staffing, theatre list order issues before a case starts. Debriefings carried out at the end of the theatre list support reflective learning on what went well and what could be done better tomorrow.

212,375,0.99,Life Cycle Management,"Moreover, it should be highlighted that needs fulfilment is often done rather by complex activities, that involve different products in a specific combination that create a new quality, rather than by simply consuming each of them: a simple walk in the park may involve a combination of outdoor clothing, maybe an umbrella, a bus trip to reach the park and for the way back, using the restaurant service to have a cake or ice-cream etc. and â important in the context of secondary consequences â involve an individually decided period of time. While the distance walked and the life time of the shoes have some relevant causal relation, otherwise the duration of many activities can be largely independent from the actual consumption of goods. Particularly the fulfilment of higher needs are less directly related to product consumption, other than more basic needs such as food and shelter. In view of efforts to a more sustainable consumption and lifestyles, it is important to consider that very different activities â using possibly also the same amount of the household resources, but with a hugely different environmental impact â may still contribute to the same degree to the needs fulfilment and happiness for the same individual person. Using leisure time and money for meetings our âsoftâ needs can differ as much as taking a longer motorbike ride, playing a game on a smartphone, or practicing yoga, depending on the personâs preference. Also meeting our physical basic needs can be done in different ways, while again using the same amount of the other household resources. One of the possibly most widely discussed component of sustainable consumption is eating vegetarian versus a meat-rich diet. As another example, for the need shelter/housing, zero-energy houses have much lower overall life cycle impacts than less well designed and insulated houses, possibly at the same total cost of ownership. On the next more complete level, we look at the entire consumption of a person or itâs household. We agree with the literature that the individual will aim at optimizing the use of his or her household resources to achieve a maximum fulfilment of the needs. Which needs are considered how relevant and how well the individual understands which products best contribute to fulfil these needs, is obviously different for each individual."
269,116,0.99,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"In presenting, here, particular narratives of how things emerge, we might have given the (false) impression that the hard work of establishing, and persisting with, interdisciplinary collaborations was largely in the (pre-Hubbub) past. Let us emphasize, then, in closing, the ongoing challenges that characterize any space in which collaborators with very different sets of expertise, as well as different understandings and practices of interdisciplinarity, work together. There is, we both believe, no singular direction of travel within Hubbub. Our collaborators do not have a shared vision of what the purpose or telos of interdisciplinarity might be, nor what the appropriate working methods are for engaging in such interdisciplinary collaboration. They â and we â are undoubtedly working with a variety of needs, logics, ontologies, and practices (Barry, Born, and Weszkalnys 2008).

124,89,0.99,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"account of classifying states of affairs as right or wrong, while utilitarianism was concerned with classifying actions. Hortyâs dominance ought clearly goes a long way towards closing another gap as well: the one between deontic logic and decision theory. Because of the weakness of dominance reasoning, however, Hortyâs account seems of limited value as a theory of choice. This chapter suggests how, with modest extensions, Hortyâs framework can move beyond dominance into the three main branches of the theory of decision: decisions under ignorance, decisions under risk and game theory. This leads to a motivational question: what is the point of trying to bring deontic logic âup to speedâ if we already have a successful decision theory? I close by suggesting two main ways in which deontic logic provides return benefits for decision theory. The first, noted at the outset of this chapter, is by offering rigorous analysis of foundational notions: causation, choice, counterfactuals and background states. That such analyses matter should be clear to anyone who has followed the history of decision theory as formulated by Savage, modified by Jeffrey, and re-formulated by causal decision theorists. For example, we claimed here that the states of decision theory are causal background contexts and provided an analysis of causal independence and background contexts within stit models. By contrast, Joyce (1999, 61) writes that states include all âaspects of the world that lie outside the decision makerâs controlâ. He tells us that future choices and events, if relevant to our present decision problem, must be incorporated into the background states for that decision. Now it is harmless to incorporate future choices and events into the background states if they are causally independent of the agentâs present choice, but not so harmless if their future occurrence is contingent upon present choices. Stit frames take care of this automatically: histories belonging to distinct states at m must be divided at m. This rules out treating future choices or processes as constituents of states at m. Future chance processes must be incorporated into decisions via conditional chances for outcomes (as described in Sect. 6). To handle sequential choices in the stit framework requires something like Hortyâs strategic ought (2001, Chap. 7), which takes us beyond the present discussion. As a second benefit, deontic logic offers a model for thinking about problems where decision theory and game theory cannot offer clear, uncontroversial solutions. One source of such problems is infinite decision theory, comprising decision problems in which an agent has to deal with infinite utilities, an infinity of possible acts, or both.30 Some of these problems are genuinely paradoxical and have no clear solution. In other cases, however, there are clear prescriptions, yet decision theory is silent because there is no optimal act. Because deontic logic is concerned with the truth of obligation sentences O[Î± cstit: A] even where A does not describe an act, it has the resources to offer advice in such cases. One example of this kind, noted earlier, is the greatest integer game. Decision theory cannot recommend the choice of any particular integer, but our deontic logics tell us that â[Î± cstit: An ] and Om [Î± cstit: An ] where An is the proposition âÎ± 30 See (Sorensen 1994) for examples."

383,479,0.99,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"Lastly, a risk expert (or risk team) must be doing a self-reflection. This means evaluating how the risk communication went and improving on it in future. There are several strategies that a risk expert can use to evaluate the quality of risk communication. The first strategy is monitoring and evaluation metric. This means assessing audience understanding and perception, e.g. via a questionnaire or a dialogue. This also means analysing media coverage and public discourse. And it can also include a measurement of the behavioural change and adherence to the change (e.g. if a doctor recommends a diet to lower cholesterol, then there are ways to measure the cholesterol level several weeks after the recommendation). There are some ideas on how a risk expert can engage in continuous improvement of his/her risk communication. The natural ideas incorporate feedback and lessons learned, adapting strategies based on emerging risks and incorporating new technologies and tools. The risk analyst Ariel from the example at the beginning of this chapter, did reflect after the heated discussion. She read several papers and books on risk communication, and she consulted other risk experts. She arrived at answers that were satisfactory to the clinician and cybernetics specialist. The first question, âWhat do these probabilities (91% with a credible interval 75% to 93%) really mean?â she answered: âIt means that if we have 100 patients with the back of the eye looking similar to the patient in front of us, then we expect that 91 of them do have a sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy,"

This statement is true as far as access to textual sources of knowledge is concerned, and yet it sounds rather naÃ¯ve. The reason is that Stiglitz is not speaking of the social and cognitive framework that helps one choose the right sources and make sense of them, nor does he mention possible contexts of use. Even if the child, by chance or by genius, finds the right track to develop sophisticated knowledge in genetic engineering, or investment banking, or the construction of microchips, she or he will still need other favorable conditions in order to put this knowledge to any use or even make money with it. The ensemble of such conditionsâsuch as nationality, language background, travel opportunities, established contacts, educational credentials, and material meansâis what I propose to call (with loose reference to Bourdieu, 1985) the social location of the knowledge protagonist. Of course, globalized access to knowledge sources will enable additional people to repair cars, build bombs, or engage in software programming, but in many cases the limits of their social location will replace the former effects of spatial distance. Further reflection on the economic uses of knowledge shows that social location may even become more important than it has been in industrial capitalism. General knowledge that can be technically distributed at little more than zero cost is not well suited as a source of private wealth. Standard economic approaches show that treating it as a nonpublic good incurs general inefficiencies in both immediate consumption and the chances of creating further knowledge (Arrow, 1962; Stiglitz, 1999). Things look different, however, for the situated knowledge of experts. Tasks such as adapting software to a firmâs special needs, installing new microchips in a car modelâs control system, finding the cheapest possible labor force where supply chains are still sufficient, and identifying the passages in U.S. patent law that keep competitors off the market involve profitable expertise. As the examples suggest, such expertise can be needed either in productive settings or in settings marked by conflicting interests, to the benefit or detriment of general welfare. In both cases, it is the unique social situation of use that determines the structure of valuable knowledge. In light of the previous discussion, this new impact of social location can also be seen as a factor that tightens social control. Instead of socially overdetermined spatial distances, mere social power relations now sort out who can successfully act as a knowledge agent. At the same time, reduced generality, or increased sensitivity to individual capacities and specific situations, affect the concept of knowledge itself. The marginal case is that knowledge is reduced to intransparent expert reputation, or mere knowing how to do things at a certain (social) place.7 In rather unspecific and impersonal settings, other reasons raise the question of whether knowledge is still appropriate as a name. As observation (b) suggests, the old practices of keeping information available for future use have been duplicated by a process not easily"

341,318,0.99,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"An inclusive, systemic approach to freshwater governance begins by making the distinction between situation and system; no one governance situation is the same so contextual design and application are needed even if some of the principles and practices employed are held in common across contexts. When individuals, groups, organisations and governments engage with freshwater situations, almost overwhelmingly they bring their historical framing choices to the situation. Too often new terms are quickly adopted uncritically and used in ways that do not make clear the underlying conceptions held by different users of the language â in our research this applies to the concept âsocial ecological systemâ, âcomplex adaptive systemâ and the emerging discourse about natural capital, environmental assets or assetbased management (Coffey 2015). Language and concepts used unreflexively undermine inclusivity by capturing a particular framing at the expense of othersâ framings, or by undermining effective collaboration because people speak at crossed purposes. It is because of the importance of initial starting conditions in a given context, and the need to know what these are, as well as paying attention to what will help create an effective governance performance (Ison and Wallis 2011), that we have devoted considerable attention to framing issues and the role of language in this chapter. In achieving sustained systemic governance, these are important practical considerations, not unimportant theoretical musings! As we noted at the beginning when citing Lakoff (2010), all metaphors bring forth an associated system. In other words, language precedes system; in fact the choice to see a freshwater river as a system is a framing choice â the system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter and in our research, we hope to have presented a narrative that supports our normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance."

It also answers to one of the most universal myths, which has both its left-wing and right-wing variants, the notion that once upon a time things were simpler and the people were at one with themselves. (Samuel, 1992: 18) Thatcherâs Victorian idyll was peopled with industrious, honest and morally upright citizens; hard-working artisans who rose slowly through diligence. The âVictorianâ values she extolled were those of thrift, charity, independence and hard work. In a much-quoted interview with Peter Allen she praised the upbringing she was given by a Victorian grandmother and used it to delineate Victorian values as she wished to exploit them: you were taught to work jolly hard, you were taught to improve yourself, you were taught self-reliance, you were taught to live within your income, you were taught that cleanliness is next to godliness, you were taught self-respect, you were taught always to give a hand to your neighbour, you were taught tremendous pride in your country, you were taught to be a good member of your community. (Thatcher, 1983b) Arguing that Thatcher was highly selective in her invocation of âVictorian valuesâ, Samuel contrasts the Victorian Britain of Thatcherâs rhetoric with that described in the oral histories and accounts given by those of her generation and earlier. Rather than focusing upon frugality, hard work and discipline, these accounts emphasise a sense of joy, of fun and of community: in working-class accounts of the âgood old daysâ, â¦ it is the images of sociability that prevail â the sing-songs in the pubs, the funeral processions, the âknees-upâ street parties, the summer outings. The canvas is crowded with characters; street performers will sometimes get a page or two to themselves and there may be a whole chapter for Whitsun or Bank Holiday. Shopping is remembered for its cheapness â¦ People are forever in and out of each otherâs housesâ¦ (Samuel, 1992: 18) In these accounts, too, the Victorian era is celebrated in contrast to the present, and painted as an idyllic, simpler time. Yet Thatcherâs Victorian idyll is very different to the Eden constructed by these oral histories. Her version, Samuel observes, is âaltogether more severe. Her lost Eden"
13,436,0.99,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"liberatorâthis is a role that the mother now manages wellâbut he represents the exciting âdifferenceâ compared to the more taken-for-granted âsamenessâ of the mother, as Benjamin (1995) suggests in the model of gender ambiguity. For the men the identification is with the fatherâs positive masculine qualities, whereas the warm relationship described by the women may indicate that the father for them rather is important by giving a possible, but not always gained, access to the position of being âa subject of desireâ (Benjamin 1995). The mother tends to be more taken for granted, yet both sons and daughters also see her as an independent subject and identify with both her âmasculineâ and âfeminineâ qualities. Thus, we see contours of the more over-inclusive patterns where both mothers and fathers can be âlove objectsâ and âlike subjectsâ. The crossgender identifications are used to formulate important parts of the selfpresentation as well as to elaborate on sexual relations (Benjamin 1995: 126; Corbett 2009: 213), which suggests the possibility of a male generational bond beyond defensiveness as a source of enjoyment of play, competition, excitement, desire and mutual recognition between men. This matches our youngest generation and may constitute the psychological background to opening up to homoerotic impulses: love and identification with parents of either sex are no longer so clearly separated. We do not see the same playfulness in the female generational bond, however. In the model of gender ambiguity, the post-Oedipal gender complementarity also preserves a certain emphasis on Oedipal difference, both in women and men of this generation, especially in connection with bodies and sexuality. In the youngest generation gender has become more multipleââdifferent moments of the self â, as Dimen describes it (2002: 57). As we have already seen, this does not necessarily or magically remove traditional gender practices, yet these practices seem to be based less on a feeling of gender in the youngest generation compared to the two older generations. Maybe it is convenient that the woman do more of the housework and care for the children, but it is neither because housework is particular feminine nor because it is unmasculine.5"

However, a surprise came at the end, when the expert was asked for the total magnitude of white-collar crime. The expert responded that to keep consistent with previous answers, the answer would be 3 billion NOK. From a methodological point of view this is fine, as there is no reason to argue that respondents should be able to keep track of previous estimates to keep consistency during the interview. As illustrated by the two bank executives who first refused to participate, and then changed their minds as they were contacted by someone they knew on the project team, recruitment of experts can be influenced by previous relationships. The one researcher on the project team who they knew, is also quite well-known in Norway, because he frequently comments on white-collar crime cases in the media. This phenomenon caused even more experts to change their minds or to contribute the name of an alternative expert. For example, one bankruptcy attorney responded: Nice to hear from you, and I hope we can have a chat over a coffee or lunch about your stay in the United States. I currently receive inquiries from both home and abroad to participate in various surveys and the like, and I have therefore set a limit to what I can participate in. I was not aware that the inquiry received regarding white-collar crime is something you are involved in. Of course I want to prioritize this and will set aside time for the interview."

The 2012 Banana Skins report highlighted the rise of the (perceived) overindebtedness risk for clients and providers. The challenge is to restore confidence and to ensure good practice standards are being observed in the industry. Sustainable microfinance in this context requires both transparent and fair treatment to clients and a strong commitment from microfinance funders of the public and private sector. While all evidence suggests there is no worldwide microfinance crisis, the critics are right to point at some of those bad practices we have seen, and these need not only to be taken seriously but also to be firmly addressed. 2. Different kinds of clients â from smallholder farmers to small businesses â are yet to be served. There are still many people in need of financial services; according to CGAP estimates, more than 2.7 billion people living on less than 2 USD per day lack access to finance. And these people have tangible yet different needs to improve their living conditions. This raises the question of how these needs translate into an effective demand for financial services, and how this demand can be served by adequate financial products in an appropriate way. The challenge is to go beyond the classical microcredit and offer other credit services as well as non-credit financial services. Other credit products include loans tailored to the needs of small businesses that sometimes have been graduating out of the âmicroenterprise world.â Many of them have proven to attract the attention of a growing number of MFIs, partly to tap an important business and development impact potential (employment generation) but also as a response strategy to overheated âclassicalâ microcredit markets. On the other hand, the need for social and financial protection translates into different financial services, including credit, savings, and insurance. This must be accompanied by sound regulation (see more in detail in section 3.5), which has seen progress but is far from being accomplished. 3. We need to get clear about what microfinance can achieve and what impact and outreach it can have for promoting development and poverty reduction. Related to this is the allegation that microfinance has not delivered on the widespread promise to lift people out of poverty. However, we know many stories which prove that millions of people have been better off with microfinance services. Yet, the questions of âhow do we knowâ and âwhat impact are we talking aboutâ are legitimate. The challenge is to find a consensus on the appropriate methodology to measure impact, while stripping off the âpanacea myth,â and to be clear about the dimensions of impact. âKnowing your clientâ and understanding the âpoor economicsâ are promising paths to get a balanced view on microfinance impact. Rather than asking to what degree clients have been lifted out of poverty the question should be how"
275,539,0.99,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"17.3.3 Autonomy The term âautonomousâ is now routinely ascribed to various artifacts that are based on computing machines. Unfortunately, such ascriptions are â as of the typing of the present sentence in late 2016 â issued in the absence of a formal definition of what autonomy is.10 What might a formal definition of autonomy look like? Presumably such an account would be developed along one or both of two trajectories. On the one hand, autonomy might be cashed out as a formalization of the kernel that agent a is autonomous at a given time t just in case, at that time, a can (perhaps at some immediate-successor time t â² ) perform some action Î±1 or some incompatible action Î±2 . In keeping with this intuitive picture, if the past tense is used, and accordingly the definiendum is âa autonomously performed action Î±1 at time t,â then the idea would be that, at t, or perhaps at an immediate preceding time t â²â² , s could have, unto itself, performed alternative action Î±2 . (There may of course be many alternatives.) Of course, all of this is quite informal. This picture is an intuitive springboard for deploying formal logic to work out matters in sufficient detail to allow meaningful and substantive conjectures to be devised, and either confirmed (proof) or refuted (disproof). Doing this in the present chapter is well outside our purposes here."

Talking with these friends about recent happenings in the IT sector can help the entrepreneurs develop new product ideas or validate work ideas outside their normal work-related context. The larger the number of ideas entrepreneurs who feel obsessive passion generate from exchanges with their close personal environment and the better the validation of current ideas within this environment, the greater will be their tendency to act on new opportunities. Obsessively passionate entrepreneursâ problems to find balance between their roles related to business and outside the business context (e.g., family) could lead them to allocate greater amounts of time to business issues. Indeed, role theorists argue that engaging multiple roles at the same time can cause role conflict that consumes peopleâs coping resources (Allen 2001). As a means to lessen this role conflict, obsessively passionate entrepreneurs often focus their energy on their role in business, neglecting their family life and other non-work-related activities. In addition, these entrepreneurs generally utilize the available work time and energy to focus attention on exploiting new opportunities. As such, the more obsessively passionate an entrepreneur is, the more likely he or she will choose to exploit an opportunity. The Moderating Effect of Non-work-Related Excitement Although passion for work alters entrepreneursâ emotional state when they undertake work activities, entrepreneurs can also experience emotions stemming from sources external to the work context. Specifically, entrepreneurs may experience affective changes that areâunlike passion for workâ triggered subconsciously or unconsciously by happenings outside the business context (Cardon et al. 2009). These emotions can then also be experienced in the entrepreneurâs business context (Isen and Geva 1987). In one study of innovative owner-managersâ decisions, we and our colleague (Klaukien et al. 2013) explored non-work-related excitement. Excitement is a strong and positive emotional experience that is likely to influence entrepreneursâ judgment and decisions (Baron 2008; Russel 1980). For instance, excitement outside the work environment may stem from anticipating seeing a new movie or doing another pleasurable activity after work, winning a sports game, looking forward to an upcoming party, or celebrating childrenâs graduation.1 If this non-work-related excitement spills over to the entrepreneursâ business context, it could"

A third motivation stems from residentsâ concerns over the quality of treatment for chronic, non-emergency care back home, and the availability of medicines. Nonetheless, this raises a key question: what are the impacts on health of the vaet-vient itself? Can it be considered a sound healthcare strategy? I asked this of all the healthcare professionals I interviewed, and opinions were mixed. Conflicting messages also emerge from the literature on the subject. A minority answered in the affirmative: âThe regular return trip is the best way to care for oneself.â (Barou 2007: 1; authorâs translation). Similarly, in response to my question whether the vaet-vient could be considered as a healthcare strategy, BÃ©atrice (health advisor, migrant welfare association), answered: Yes [emphatic], for two reasons. Some treatments cost less back home. Teeth and glasses. That costs a lot here, it costs much less back home. So they go home for these treatments. There's also the fact that they need to return home, to see the country, to see their wife, to see the children and grandchildren â that helps their morale. And then also when they go, they can see their traditional doctors. So, yes, it's easier â they return home, they can see their traditional doctor, the marabout, etc, so it is part of a healthcare strategy, yes, both medical and psychological."

Peirce argued that there are three and only three categories: âHe claims that he has look[ed] long and hard to disprove his doctrine of three categories but that he has never found anything to contradict it, and he extends to everyone the invitation to do the sameâ (de Waal 2013, p. 44).

At present, the necessary sensitivity for the problems of adults with autism still does not exist. Although attention to the study of autism in childhood is relevant; sensitivity towards family members is completely lacking, for whom the end of school signifies the most critical moment.6 The parents themselves, in fact, are faced with the complexity determined by the disorder which, over time, becomes increasingly difficult to manage: the lack of independence, more frequent and intense aggressive actions towards self and others, autistic symptoms in general occurring ever more clearly, without further improvements after those achieved during childhood and adolescence.7 Therefore, it is urgent that measures and effective procedures are developed from a careful survey of the currently available and reliable scientific data; in this respect, the synthesis proposed by some scholars is interesting: At the present state of knowledge it is possible to indicate some âalmost certaintiesâ: 1. The vast majority of autistic people will never be independent. Many will make even significant progress in mental and social functioning, but very few will become autonomous. Almost all adults with autism will therefore need a safe living environment. 2. It is difficult to establish a relationship between types of treatment and outcomes. The type of measure affects the appearance of the skills and competencies facilitated. In any case, the handicap should never be treated as a statistic, under the banner of âall or nothingâ, but as a set of functions in which, however, traces are to be found, so one can try to stimulate where and how it is possible.8"

For the purposes of this book, we have opted to use a very broad understanding of peacebuilding. If not, we would have undermined our attempt to understand how the rising powers view peacebuilding by imposing a definition and approach to peacebuilding influenced by the traditional understanding and approach to peacebuilding. We have thus opted to use a broad understanding of peacebuilding to mean any deliberate programlike effort that has a conflict-resolution theory of change that is meant to influence preventing a lapse into violent conflict or to sustain peace. We have considered using the UN definition(s) and approach to peacebuilding, as it represents a globally agreed concept, but we have found that there is a considerable gap between what many Member States view as the role of an international body like the UN when it comes to peacebuilding, and how they choose to deal with such issues domestically. For instance, whilst the USA engages in debates on peacebuilding at the UN, the concept is not prominently used domestically in the policies or approaches of the US government. We have thus opted against using the UN definition for fear of contaminating our study of peacebuilding in the rising powers by imposing an external concept. Instead we have tasked our contributors to take a âbottom-upâ approach and to seek out national concepts and understandings that approximate this broad theory of change approach to peacebuilding. Even this broad approach to peacebuilding has proven challenging at times. In our concluding analysis, we discuss these definitional and conceptual challenges in greater detail."

Whereas Cantor initially seems self-composed but gradually âcomes ungluedâ, as Paula Curry phrases it, Jerry Stafford increasingly manages to pull himself together and recover his integrity. Initially there is an embarrassing tension between his actual practice (the sloppiness of his research, his notebooks, etc.: the context of discovery) and the exacting expectations of Cantor as his super-ego. The latter is not really interested in the actual work conducted by Stafford, he is focussed on the results (the surplus value, in Marxist terms), but when the Harvard lab fails to replicate the experiment, he decides to photocopy and xerox Staffordâs notebook to Krauss. For Cantor, there is nothing improper in copying Staffordâs notebooks, because a scientistâs laboratory journal is not a personal diary, but rather intended for inspection by others on demand. But as he himself examines Staffordâs notebooks just before sending them off, he is disconcerted by what he finds in them, or rather: by what he does not find in them, for the actual details are surprisingly scant (p. 86). Too much is missing. Therefore he refrains from sharing them with Krauss (realising that he failed as a supervisor) and decides that they should do an experiment together, so that he can monitor Staffordâs doings, and supervise him in situ (as an embodied conscience): Weâll repeat your [sic!] experiment togetherâ¦ In my private labâ¦ Everything will be under controlâ¦ A minor but crucial experimental variable must be responsibleâ¦Youâll do every step in my presenceâ¦Weâll find what was missing in the reportâ¦ Right into the lab and startâ¦ [Stafford] had now been ordered to repeat his spectacular experiment under the watchful eyes of the master (p. 92)."

346,267,0.99,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","COMMUNICATION SPACES IN HISTORY TEACHING Teacherâs Action Space There are many ways how a particular teacher can position themselves with regard to the aims and functions of history teaching. The curriculum is often not a sufficient landmark for the orientation of teachers, textbook authors and other educators because, as with any text, it needs interpretation based on some external framework. Even if the national curriculum has legal force, it is not usual for it to be thoroughly law-like. Neither are lawyers normally there to help users read it. Often, in order to gain a broader acceptance, either it is generic, or it contains âsomething for everybodyâ (cf. Simpson and Halse 2006), presuming that the teacher or textbook author makes his or her own choices and sets his or her own emphases. Not to mention that from a quite practical point of view the teachers need to choose foci and decide on time allocations here and now. Individual teacherâs positioning is probably most obvious in the case of socially and politically sensitive and controversial issues that are connected to different social memories and political interests. In the case of such issues, it becomes particularly visible that history teachers are positioned as mediators between different fields or perspectives (academy, science, politics, different nations, different worldviews or ideologies, etc.), or between different group-bound social memories. Teacher positions are shaped by their location, both perceived and actual, on the landscape. Teachersâ representations of their subject reflect both their social positions and their individual perceptions. On the one hand, the teacherâs action space is made up of âobjectiveâ or âexternalâ limitations such as national final examinations or the teacherâs ethnolinguistic belonging. On the other hand, their action space is made up of more subjective, dynamic and situational things such as pedagogical repertoire, epistemological position, self-confidence and sense of professional autonomy and legitimacy that are connected to their image of the social, political and academic space that surrounds history teaching.

Without the constraints of distal goals, the failed entrepreneur can freely generate and strive for near goals, such as creating and trying on provisional identities developed through identity play. Finally, while fantasy in a cognitively deconstructed state may be detrimental (Baumeister 1990), as part of identity play it may be very useful. Identity play âgenerally unfolds at the threshold between fantasy and reality, or the boundary between dreams (i.e., the possible selves in our heads) and reality (i.e., concrete possibilities available in the given world at any given time)â (Ibarra and Petriglieri 2010: 15). Thus, fantasy is insufficient for identity play as it requires flirtations across the boundary between dream and reality. Fantasy in a cognitively deconstructed state is problematic because it is free of any reality, thus making it rather ineffective in generating identity alternatives. However, when individuals play out identity fantasies, they are able to creatively explore (Brown and Starkey 2000) or flirt with ideas of a provisional future self that actually have meaning in reality, which can improve the chance of forming an identity that is positive (Shepherd and Williams 2018). For instance, the failed entrepreneur may play out his or her fantasy of working in a non-profit organization as an alternative new identity by working with a local non-profit for two weeks."

For example, if a proposal is advanced to dam a river to produce power, citizens need to be able to weigh the proposed benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore, they need to be able to judge the extent to which an arguerâs stakeholder position influences his/her biases, and by consequence, his/her claims and evidence advanced in support of his/her position. As part of this process, they need to be able to evaluate the credibility of evidence, something with which K-12 and college students often struggle (Britt et al., 2014; Nicolaidou et al., 2011). 4.2.1.4.2 Engaging in the Culture of STEM Key to helping students engage in the culture of STEM is helping them learn the iterative nature of STEM, as well as the importance of modeling, argumentation, and epistemology. 4.2.1.4.2.1 Iterative Nature of STEM Engaging students in the culture of STEM does not mean getting students to engage in the âscientific method,â as the latter is in fact heavily simplified (Abd-El-Khalick, 2012; Lawson, 2010; Tang, Coffey, Elby, & Levin, 2010). STEM professionals do not always start an investigation with a hypothesis, but often engage in an exploratory investigation to identify pertinent variables or to simply observe and describe a system (Franklin, 2005; Klahr & Simon, 1999; Lawson, 2010). For example, exploratory investigations helped scientists uncover the phenomenon of gene expression (Franklin, 2005). Such exploratory studies often do not involve a control condition, and yet they can lead to very important scientific discoveries, and guide further inquiry (Klahr & Simon, 1999). That is, they can indicate and lead to descriptions of important phenomena. As such observations accumulate, STEM professionals can begin to build theory to explain the phenomena. Further investigations can explore whether the new theory explains and predicts other instances of similar phenomena (Klahr & Simon, 1999; Lawson, 2010). This accumulation of studies along a line of inquiry does not proceed in a linear manner. Rather, it proceeds in fits and startsâin a very iterative manner. Students should have the opportunity to experience the iterative nature of STEM (T. S. Kuhn, 1996; Lammi & Becker, 2013; Nersessian, 2008). The iterative nature holds at its core theory; theory drives the creation of problem representations (modeling; described below), the design and conduct of investigations to understand problems further, the creation of claims, and backing claims with evidence (argumentation; described below) (Giere, 1990; Klahr & Simon, 1999; Nersessian, 2008). The initial model of a problem situation will necessarily be idealized; it can be improved through such processes as establishing limiting cases (Nersessian, 2008), reacting to phenomena that cannot be sufficiently explained through existing theory (Klahr & Simon, 1999) and engaging with other STEM professionals who often apply different perspectives to problems (Giere, 1990). Not all citizens will engage in the entire process of model-building, but they need to understand the process such that they can engage in authentic scientific discourses centered on locally relevant scientific problems (KolstÃ¸, 2001; Sadler et al., 2007)."
75,149,0.99,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","As with blogs, the potential uses of microblogs for scholarly communication are highly varied, ranging from virtual journal clubs (Reich 2011) and debates about current, science-related events, to self-help for graduate students (for example, under the #phdchat hashtag). Microblogs are also a way for scientists to stay up to date about what their colleagues are working on, while at the same time providing a window into current scientific research for science journalists and facilitating interaction between scientists and the general public (Puschmann and Mahrt 2012). The lack of a dividing line between scientists and non-scientists, as well as the great variety of topics that even scientists tweet about mean that Twitter is not comparable to the orderly world of science publishing, where every piece of information is assumed to be relevant. Instead, a typical userâs timeline is likely to be populated both by scholarly content and personal remarks, more or less side by side. As the size of the network and the thematic broadness of Twitter is what makes it interesting to most users, it seems unlikely that this ââproblemââ will ever be remedied at its core, but the ability to filter information from Twitter and similar services is likely to resolve the issue.7 Tweets and other social media information can congregate around a journal article or piece of dataâan approach that may also be beneficial for the development of dedicated science services. Such services could eventually become a reality as the strengths of services like Twitter are at once also a weakness: while timely, tweets are not accessible in the long term, and increased brevity also means less nuanced information in each tweet."

Both our Morocco and our Iran researcher nowadays rely on a few people they know well, who will not only share contact details but help assess who will be useful to talk to, whether they are easy or difficult to approach, and whether approaching them might have consequences for the rest of our research, making it better to meet them towards the end of their stay. They also give their advice on security issues, on wording, or on how to interpret some initial impressions. Some of these people come to work with us on a more sustained basis, because they are interested in learning social science methods, because they want to put their work for us on their CV, because they are simply curious or willing to help, or because they have become friends. Others are paid by us, as research assistants, translators, survey experts, or local supervisors. Mostly, the relationship is beneficial to both sides. Our Kazakhstan and Malaysia researchers have both had great experiences working with local survey companies, the staff of which were very skilled and professional as well as genuinely interested in the research projects in question. The Kazakhstan researcher also worked successfully with paid research assistants. Apart from simply saving time, she finds that they can help with wording things appropriately (see Chap. 3) and have their own networks and knowledge that facilitates the accessing of information. Apart from payment, she has helped them by discussing and commenting on their PhD theses or job applications. The seniority relation was the other way around when our India researcher did his first fieldwork: in accordance with the customary procedure in his masterâs program, he had a paid local supervisor. This payment allowed him to make use of the local academicâs contacts, and use him as a sounding board, without feeling that the relationship was exploitative (see Carapico 2014, 27â28 on the sometimes shameless imposition by foreign scholars on local researchers). Since then, he has had occasional help with translating, both in India and Mexico, from people his own age who offered their help, and for whom he has paid travel expenses but no fees.

A proposition is true at a moment m according to a denotation assignment in a model when it is true at moment m in the history hm of that moment according to that assignment. Two moments of time m and mâ are coinstantaneous when they belong to the same instant. Coinstantaneous moments are on the same horizontal line in each treelike frame. One can analyze historic necessity by quantifying over coinstantaneous moments. The proposition that P is then necessary (in symbols P) is true at a moment according to a model when P is true at all coinstantaneous moments according to all histories in that model. The notion of historic necessity is stronger than that of settled truth. The represented fact is then not only established but inevitable. According to traditional philosophy there are no inevitable actions and intentions. Moreover the possible causes and effects so to speak of actions of any agent at a moment are limited to those which are possible outcomes of the way the world has been up to that moment. As Belnap and Perloff (1992) pointed out, in order to explicate historical relevance we must consider coinstantaneous moments having the same past. Such moments are called alternative moments. Thus m1 and m2 are alternative moments in the last figure. Logical or universal necessity is stronger than historic necessity. The proposition that P is universally necessary (in symbols: P) is true in a circumstance according to a model when P is true in all possible circumstances in that model. In that case the fact represented is always inevitable. A proposition P is obviously tautological according to a model when it is true in every possible circumstance according to any possible denotation assignment. The notion of obvious tautologyhood is the strongest modal notion. The represented fact is then analytically inevitable subjectively as well as objectively."
108,47,0.99,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"form of warfare. The answer is affirmative, with the finesse that the enemy does not need to be completely identified but just by his methods and goals. The aim is to attack a critical vulnerability of the enemy by altering the social, political and economic reference system. In a paraphrase of a famous saying by Mao, one might say that it is a question of changing the water in which the fish are swimming. The critical vulnerability of the enemy is his political legitimacy in the mission area. The attack is conducted by changing the conditions of the field so that even unidentified political actors may also find themselves under attack. If the vulnerable point is attacked, the enemyâs centre of gravity will have to be adjusted accordingly. For this approach to be effective, the actor must be a genuine political actor, an actor interested in political gain. If the actor has no political ambitionsâperhaps in the case of organised crime for financial gainâthen there is also no reason not to countermine the actorâs position as a player on the field. However, it is important that there is a general perception that the actor is not a political actor. It is the judgement of the field, not that of the actor, that determines whether an actor is political or not.2 It is worth stressing the importance of qualitative knowledge of the actors on the field, in the same way that knowledge of the fieldâs own structure is key information. A field theoretical approach to operations should strive to give the enemy information of a type that is not disinformative. As it is a long process, it is important to not undermine the trust in the process with disinformation. The information presented should fit with the stated aim of influencing the actor to change his strategy. It involves information in the form of action rather than words, to clearly show the disadvantages of a strategy of violence by confronting him with a well-armed and wellequipped military force. It is also important to clearly show the alternative strategies that are possible. The latter should be combined with making it obvious that the positions of non-violent actors will be greatly enhanced, whatever their political standpoint. In this way, it will become clear to all that those with a non-violent political agenda will experience a considerable enhancement of their power, while the increase in power for the actors using violent means will be obstructed or will suffer a reverse. It is thus important to inform the enemy in the correct manner. As this will change the distribution of power on the field, one might see different and new"

Since many reports are produced using both R and LaTeX, it might be useful to be able to automatically convert mathematical expressions from one language to the other. Because we need to convert both functions and names, this mathematical DSL will be more complicated than the HTML DSL. Weâll also need to create a âdefaultâ conversion, so that functions we donât know about get a standard conversion.

46,200,0.99,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"child poverty in welfare states: other persons in the global community of humans. We gave these agents of justice a rather low ranking in regard to child poverty in welfare states because most members have only limited capacities to change something and have only limited responsibility for the existence of child poverty. We took into account that the majority of agents in this global community are themselves poor or have a low status of well-being because they live in poorer countries. This is still true in the case of global child poverty, but nonetheless, many agents in the global community, people who live in welfare states, who are therefore much richer and have much more resources, can make a real difference. If a middle-class adult in a welfare state adopts a poor child from another welfare state, this childâs situation will probably improve; this improvement, however, has to be weighed against possible harms; for example, when a child is removed from her biological parents and has to move to another country or the burden that is put upon the parentto-be. In the case of global child poverty, our skepticism regarding a responsibility that can be translated into a duty to adopt poor children without sufficient means seems less reasonable. Daniel Friedrich has recently defended such a duty to adopt (Friedrich 2013); as applied to the case of child poverty, it is true that moving a child likely to die or suffer severely over her whole life in her home country â perhaps even against her will and the will of her parents â to a middle-class parent or family in a welfare state would certainly improve her condition to such an extent that our counterarguments become less valid. This implies that there might indeed be such a duty to adopt, maybe with some caveats; for example, that this duty apply only to those who wish to have children in the first place or only as long as child poverty is as severe as it is now. We note again that a concept of global justice for children should also make use of an ecological approach, such as the one proposed, and differentiate between different agents and their responsibilities. This implies giving the poor themselves and poor children, as they reach a certain level of competencies and maturity, a role in the alleviation of poverty and in the design and implementation of measures of justice (Deveaux 2013). Reasons for doing so are not limited to the fact that the poor have a right to be heard and included in decisions affecting them; there are also pragmatic reasons built on the knowledge that measures that take the poor seriously and are developed on the basis of real knowledge about them and their situation work better. Besides, taking the agency of the poor seriously is empowering (Drydyk 2013). This aspect of participation and empowerment of poor people is both relevant for"
163,51,0.99,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"rules and regulations. There ought to be a reciprocal relationship, despite the fact that there is an uneven distribution of power between the collector of taxes and the providersâthe taxpayers. This is not only because of enforcement; tax law is by definition complex, and the tax authority has immense powers through its knowledge of tax law, which should not be abused. What follows is an exploration of the concept of reciprocity played out in different ways in the Swedish tax arena. Reciprocal relations are taken seriously, yet they are perceived and imagined relations pronounced by the very actors that deal with taxes in practiceâtaxpayers and tax collectors. You will meet some of the Limningers, a group of middle-aged Swedes, and hear their reasoning about taxes in terms of reciprocity. You will also become acquainted with employees at the Agency in order to hear their views of reciprocity as played out in taxation and how they see the challenges facing Swedish taxpayers in contributing their fair share. The book ends with the proposal of a fifth type of reciprocity that has to be considered when understanding tax compliance, taking account of peopleâs propensity to exchange. It is the quid pro quo exchange, the common, everyday transaction between people where the state is left out of the deal. In Chap. 2, Taxpayersâ Relation to their State, we will deal with taxation as a reciprocal relationship between taxpayers and the state they live in. We will explore taxpayersâ perceptions of contributing with taxes, or receiving from the common treasure chest, and what this has do to seeing taxation as part of a reciprocal relation. Chapter 3, Taxpayer to Taxpayer Relation, moves the focus to explore the reciprocal relation that taxpayers create among themselves as an implicit result of taxation. As Sweden has a law that says all exchanges have value, regardless of how they are compensated, they ought to be subject to tax assessment. We will see how Swedes exchange in private and how reciprocity is invoked to keep out the state. Chapter 4 highlights the tensions that are created between perceptions of who pays and who receives in society. The focus is on balancing a reciprocal equilibrium. Swedes assess the taxes they pay not only in relation to what they receive, but also in relation to other residentsâthey compare their contribution with perceptions about what fellow citizens pay and receive. In Chap. 5, I conclude by proposing that the quid pro quo exchange should be included in the array of reciprocal relationships that impact tax compliance. The final take home from all the expectations is that if we are to actively create a legitimate taxation regime, all taxpayers need to contribute."
165,84,0.99,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"This is not a trivial concern. Accordingly I give it extended attention at several other points in this monograph as well as here. The reason it is not trivial can be put in simple terms. It is logically possible for D to take high values when Whites and Blacks live in areas that are fundamentally similar on area proportion White. In this circumstance, residential redistribution leading to integration would indeed require a high proportion of one group to move, but the movement will not lead to important changes in their residential outcomes or in their comparison on these outcomes with the other group. This important possibility appears not to be widely recognized and appreciated by segregation researchers. It is safe to say it is almost never recognized by broader consumers of segregation research. In my experience non-specialists and researchers alike overwhelmingly interpret D in a way that is oblivious to this quality and as a result leads them to be prone to make mistaken inferences about the nature of segregation. Specifically, researchers as well as non-specialists are prone to assume that high values of D necessarily indicate that most members of both of the groups in question live apart from each other in areas where their group predominates and as a result elimination of uneven distribution will lead to important changes in racial mix and associated residential outcomes for at least one group. This, of course, is sometimes the case. But it is important to recognize that it is not necessarily the case. Furthermore, this latter outcome is not an esoteric or unusual hypothetical possibility that can be safely"
242,1131,0.99,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","In a context of anti-immigrant hostility, one of the challenges facing academic research and social organizations is how to respond to it, both in terms of content and in the cultural forms and means used. This section examines some of the arguments with which an attempt is made to respond to anti-immigrant hostility. A first argument is the ânumbers game,â where it is often suggested that if the number of immigrants drops, the hostility will decrease as well. A second repertoire is instrumental: we must accept the immigrants given that they undertake work the local population does not do. A third way of responding, common among the critical social sciences, is to assume that the hostility is a product of unfounded images about the relationship between the presence of immigrants and insecurity or lack of facilities in the institutions. A fourth way of responding refers to the application of values such as hospitality and solidarity to try and transcend the hostility and exclusion associated with migratory legislation. The ânumbers gameâ (Hall 1981) is usually used from conservative positions, not so much to refute the hostility as to justify it. Thus the main thesis is that if there werenât âso many migrantsâ there would be no hostility. That makes the immigrants responsible for their own discrimination. Ghassan Hage (1998: 92) notes something for the case of Australia that could also be said in the Costa Rican case: when it is considered that there are âmany immigrantsâ, it ârepresentsâ¦the possibility of becoming beyond control and"
14,49,0.99,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"consequences, according to Anthony Giddens (1993). Trafï¬cking was certainly an unintended consequence of the girlsâ and boysâ decision to migrate in search of work. Had they known that they would be maltreated, insufï¬ciently compensated, and isolated from the outside world, they most likely would not have agreed to leave even the most poverty-ridden native village. Without a crystal ball to show them the future, they made the best decisions they could under the circumstances. They owned these decisions even when they desperately wanted to leave the trafï¬cking situation. It is worth mentioning that some of the adolescents did not ï¬nd their circumstances as dire as child advocates would have the public believe. Several of the Peruvian boys trafï¬cked to work in the construction industry wanted to stay with the same employer, but hoped that service providers would be able to ensure that the boss paid them what he promised, gave them cigarette and lunch breaks regularly, and treated them with respect. Law enforcement alleged that sixty per cent of the adolescent girls were trafï¬cked for sexual exploitation despite the fact that many of the girls were adamant that they were neither involved in sex work nor sexually abused. One ICE agent told me: âLook, when I see young girls with lots of make-up wearing low cut blouses and the shortest skirts you can imagine, of course I am going to conclude that they were trafï¬cked for sex. Maybe nothing happened yet, but whether they realize it or not, the intent was obviousâ¦â In interviews, the girls presented different assessments of the situation. Magdalena said: âA short dress accentuating my ï¬gure does not mean I am a prostitute!â They liked pretty and revealing clothing. Tight and low-cut blouses made them feel sexy and sophisticated, they said. I thought that there was a lot of cultural misunderstanding, both on the part of the law enforcement and on the part of the young girls, about what was age-appropriate attire and what was not. The girls also said they had certain freedoms to make decisions. Naya claimed: âIf I wanted to go upstairs with the men, I could earn a lot more money, but I didnât want to sell myself. I made the boss lots of money dancing with the customers and selling them high price drinks.â The police did not believe the girls and the girls said the police lied. Both parties contested each otherâs perceptions of the situation. While many anthropologists theorizing agency (Tsing 2000; MacGaffey 2000) have a very celebratory view of the concept, Julia Meredith Hess and Dianna Shandy (2008) suggest that, at the juncture of migrant children and the state, this view is more constricted. The same can be said about trafï¬cked children. The politics of compassion governing the lives of trafï¬cked (and other unaccompanied) children tempered the agency of the trafï¬cked girls and boys in my study. The decisions law enforcement and service providers were making were glossed over as âbeing in the best interestâ of the youth. Perhaps it was in the best interest to classify the trafï¬cked girls and boys as âvictimsâ in order to provide them with the legal assistance and social services they needed to stay in the United States."
14,233,0.99,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"It Is Not All About Ethnicity: Contesting the Ethnic MajorityâMinority Framework We have shown that the question of ethnicity plays an important role in the ways the interviewed youth perceive and construct their identities. However, there are other equally or even more important factors, common to all young adults irrespective of their origin, that in the eyes of the research participants shaped them into who they are. First love (reciprocated or not), ï¬rst âseriousâ relationships, friends, physical distinctions or defects (congenital or caused by injuries), or even travel experiences, experiences of living abroad, and hobbies that turned to passions all had a big influence on the lives of the study participants and their identities. Furthermore, the turbulent relationships with their parents should not only be seen as something connected solely to struggles caused by cultural gaps, but as something that normally occurs in the relationship between child and parent, irrespective of ethnic background. One of the themes that appear through Karelâs narrative is that of his ï¬rst serious relationship. His love for this Czech girl and the things that he learned from her, as he put it, introduced him to a radically different perspective and led him to re-evaluate his outlook on life and ideas about himself. Marek (twenty-seven), who came to Czech Republic at the age of nine, also mentions how his love for a girl while he was in primary school presented the main âmotivatorâ behind almost all his actions. In the case of forming my own âme,â I fell in love with a girl, I was into her from the age of nine and it took me more than three years to keep lying to myself about that I was not good enough, like I was telling myself that I am not sportive enough, smart enough and so on. This actually kept me going, kept me motivated in perfecting myself. Every time she declined my âoffers,â I was partially sad, partially pissed off and because she turned me down thirty-ï¬ve times in all, I at that time realized that you cannot get everything even if you really try hard. Because that was what I was thinking before, before I met this girl. So she really influenced me and I changed in the way that I wasnÂ´t that ambitious, choleric guy anymore but became more relaxed."
137,266,0.99,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"All the respondents acknowledged that they perceived that they had bonded more closely with their children by spending time with them, a which was consistent with the findings of earlier surveys (Haas and Hwang 2008; Seward et al. 2006). Some fathers even pointed out that being on leave alone helped them create a bond which in men, contrary to women, does not come naturally. Leave-taking was, then, construed as a substitute for the motherâs alleged biological advantages for bonding with children. This transcription from Danielâs response is representative.

The reasons for choosing to check in are varied. Some checkins are purely pragmatic, to coordinate with friends, but there are many other reasons for checking in, such as self-representation, boredom, playing a game, wanting to bookmark a place for future reference (Cramer, Rost, and Holmquist 2011), or âdocumenting habits and sharing new experiencesâ (Hooper and Rettberg 2011). Venues on Foursquare are user-created and do not always have a one-to-one relationship with ârealâ places. Sometimes checkins are deliberate rhetorical or communicative acts rather than statements of presence. For instance, during the heat wave in New York in the Summer of 2010, the âHeatpocalypse NYCâ received 9426 check-ins (Cramer, Rost, and Holmquist 2011, 62). In the Netherlands, game scholar RenÃ© Glas describes how an abandoned high school inhabited by squatters was given the Foursquare name âHangout for idlers, potential criminals and people whoâve lost their waysâ (2011, 12). When you use Foursquare you are invited to add âtipsâ about venues for other users, and the prompt when you click on the âAdd a tipâ button gives advice on how to write a tip: âFor example: Get the table by the front window for some of the best people watching in the city.â Tips users have left for the abandoned high school instead discuss how the local government has allowed the neighbourhood to become impoverished (Glas 2011, 13). Individuals can create lists on Foursquare, and this can also be used as a form of self-expression. A literary example is Derby [2061], a science fiction story created by the UK design agency Mudlark that is told through Foursquare. 50 fictional future Foursquare venues were created in the same geographical locale as present-day places in the town of Derby, and the storyâs protagonist, âGirl Xâ, has left tips in each place that taken together give an impression of a future society, set in the year 2061. Following our Foursquare friends we can similarly glean a partial story of their lives, though usually the story is far less cohesive than that told in Derby [2061]. In 2014, Foursquare moved to âpassive location-sharingâ with the new app Swarm. Rather than needing to check in, Swarm shares your approximate location with friends. A few months later, the Foursquare app also changed, rebranding itself as a recommendation engine primarily for restaurants rather than as a social travelogue. Although Swarm does still allow users to check in manually and to create new places, the changes signal a shift from human-generated to machine-generated selfrepresentations, which we also see in other areas.

The use of these media can be very demanding for some, who âin their worldsâ apply different media or media in a different way. Due to the diversity of viewpoints and ways to use media, there is a considerable chance that communication might fail. Project participants may not understand each other and get frustrated or conflicts may evolve. This interpretation of a transdisciplinary project gives some hints, what kind of issues should be addressed and how results should look like. Firstly, the group has to acknowledge and accept the differences. The process is about understanding the diversity of viewpoints, knowledges, languages and motivations. After the project, everybody will return to his or her own world and must live with the outcomes. Thus, solutions must be designed in ways that they create connectivity between formerly separated worlds, without changing (too much) the worlds (business people will continue to seek for profit, academics for higher reputation and policymakers for voters) (cf. Sect. 4.4). Summarising, it can be concluded that systems theory is a powerful and extremely productive conceptual approach in the sense that it set manifold impulses for the creation of linkages and the integration of knowledge among various disciplines and groups of professional actors. Hence, systems theory is considered as a key ingredient. Systems-theory-based conceptual frameworks can provide a solid basis to interand transdisciplinary research. In the next section, we demonstrate how system concepts are applied in interdisciplinary research practice, making use of two prominent examples."
137,565,0.99,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Switzerland, Japan, France). Men who are more weakly invested in or demoralized in relation to their jobs may also be motivated to take up full-time responsibility for childcare, even if compensation is low, and to privilege the strengthening of fatherchild bonds in relation to work (cf. Switzerland). On the other hand, when there is explicit legal support for fathersâ leave, there is a wide range of motivations that drive fathers to share parental leave, thereby making for more potential diversity in terms of pathways into solo caring. Beyond the strengthening of co-parenting and father-child relationships, the qualitative studies in this book highlight the following motivations: concerns related to the motherâs work/career or allowing her to return to work earlier or to take up a job; the awareness of babyhood (first year of life) as a crucial and unique life-stage for father involvement that cannot be postponed; the need or wish to ensure the care of the child at home for a few more months (e.g. no crÃ¨che immediately available, parental care considered as better for a small child and to be prolonged in case of institutional support). Previous life transitions and events also emerge as drivers: fathers who had positive care experiences during paternity leave, after the birth of another child, or during earlier life stages (e.g. caring for a younger sibling) often reveal strong motivations to experience leave as a time of opportunity. In contrast, highly invested professional men taking leave at a life stage when their career is not yet consolidated tend to reveal less confidence in sharing parental leave on an equal basis. Fathering may therefore be seen as a process which occurs over time, making for heterogeneity in leave motivations and experiences. This diversity of drivers means that the introduction of new policies in some countries is reaching out not only to men who are expecting to become highly involved parents and solo carers but also to some fathers who do not see themselves as equal sharers or primary caregivers at the outset. Experience of leave alone will not necessarily then always be the same, depending strongly on the couplesâ and the fathersâ motivations, their socio-economic position and previous work and life trajectories as well as the fathersâ capacity and agency in becoming independent carers and setting up individualized routines. Lastly, at the workplace level, many organizations are changing to support dualearner couples and fatherâs leave in response to national policies or by introducing âfamily-friendlyâ policies within the organization (Den Dulk 2001; Haas and Hwang 2009). Here, too, change is uneven. The male model of full-time, long-term dedication to work, based on assumptions of gendered work and family spheres (Lewis 2001), often prevails and may even be intensified in contemporary settings of increased work demands, unemployment and economic austerity. Nevertheless, some workplaces are clearly more supportive of fatherâs leave than others. Supportiveness differs across sector, specific type of workplace, workplace units and for different occupations. Public and female-dominated workplaces, as shown in other studies, continue on the whole to be more supportive. But the qualitative studies reported in this book also demonstrate that there are may be differences in work units and in managersâ attitudes as well as differences related to the leverage which some men can bring to bear on their colleagues and managers, both in private and in public sectors. In this respect, highly qualified men in very different national"

Within this EU setting, the meaning and value of âexpertiseâ is very important. An interviewee cautioned that it would be wrong to assume that even this category is straightforward, particularly in an area as contentious as migration policy: Who is an expert? Even, who is an academic? The problem we are seeing not only in DG Home, but also in the European Parliament is the same. So that you have an academic : : : issuing a paper : : : basically serving a certain political interest : : : and this is something that is developing more and more.

21,77,0.99,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"Computer Lib, he would write, âif computers are the wave of the future, displays are the surfboardsâ [8, p. 22]. The second part of Nelsonâs vision took shape in the early 1960s, when there was âa lot of talk around Cambridge about Computer-Assisted Instruction, for which there was a lot of moneyâ according to Literary Machines [9, p. 1/26]. At this point, Nelsonâs project was not so much a design, he stressed when I asked for records once again (I must annoy him with my desire for bits of paper), he said, âit was an idea that may have been on only one file cardâ (Nelson 2011). At this stage he devised what he called âthe thousand theories program,â an explorable computer-assisted instruction program that would allow the user to study different subjects by taking different trajectories through a network of information. In Literary Machines he writes, âThis idea rather quickly became what I would eventually call hypertextâ [9, p. 1/26]. He thought of the system as incorporating many separate, modularized paragraphs, each with branching choices: writing as a graph, not a single line or sequence. This led to another idea, which Nelson drafted as an academic paper while teaching sociology at Vassar College in 1965. That would become the transclusive relationshipâand eventually ZigZag. It also got him published for the first time, which is why historians like to use that date. In his 1965 paper for the ACM, âA File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminateâ [5], Nelson proposed a display-based computer system that permitted linking between documents and the re-use of elements called Zippered Lists. Again, this was at a time when the whole idea of text on a screen was seen as a waste of processing power, let alone bizarre ânonsequentialâ text. In 1965, unless you were working on Doug Engelbartâs team or could afford a system with video-type display (Nelson reasons it âwould cost less than a secretaryâ in his paper, at $37,000 in 1965 money, which would be a well-paid secretary), computers were expensive things with more important jobs to do. For most organisations they still didnât have screens. I should also stress that, in 1965, text was not dataâit was something academics and journalists manipulated with typewriters. As Doug Engelbart told me in 1999, the whole concept of a human being sitting in an interactive feedback loop with a computer, manipulating symbols on a screen, was foreign to most people in the 1960s. It was wacky even in the seventies, when we had it workingâreal hypermedia, real groupware working. (Engelbart 1999, personal communication)"
252,47,0.99,The Ethics of Vaccination,"The idea I have just formulated is sometimes referred to, more simply and more intuitively, with the term âduty of easy rescueâ: positive duties of âeasy rescueâ can be as compelling as negative duties, both ethically and legally (Savulescu 2007). For the moment, let us confine ourselves to the ethical dimension. To recall Peter Singerâs famous thought experiment, if I see a child drowning in a pond whom I could easily save at a comparatively small cost to me (e.g., at the cost of ruining my new pair of shoes), then I have a moral obligation to save the child (Singer 1972), even if the obligation is an instance of a positive, and not of a negative, duty. The child has a positive right to be saved, considering how comparatively easy and costless it is for me to save her. Tim Scanlon made the duty of easy rescue even less demanding by stating that we have an uncontroversial moral duty to do something that involves a slight or moderate sacrifice (in absolute, not in comparative terms) and that can prevent something very bad from happening (Scanlon 1998, p. 224)âa formulation that, unlike the Singerian one, does not entail that we have a moral duty to do something that is very costly to us if the outcome to be prevented is comparatively very bad. Here, to make my point as uncontroversial as possible, I will stick with Scanlonâs less demanding formulation. What I want to point out is that since vaccination entails a very small cost to individuals and a very large benefit to others in terms of disease prevention, there is a duty of easy rescue to be vaccinated, even if it is a positive duty, in order to protect the categories of vulnerable individuals I have mentioned in the previous chapter. If non-vaccination harms or risks harming others, then failing to vaccinate is as bad as positively doing something that harms or risks harming others, as Flaniganâs analogy suggests. But we need to be careful here. As I have noted earlier, the contribution of each individual vaccination to herd immunity is negligible. It is true that if a non-vaccinated individual does infect another individual, then the non-vaccinated individual would be causally and morally responsible for the harm caused to the other (Giubilini et al. 2018) or at least the individualâs carers would be. However, as suggested above, where herd immunity does exist, it is very unlikely that a non-vaccinated individual would infect another one; and where vaccination rates are extremely low, a nonvaccinated individual would not make a significant difference to the risk of another individual being infectedâif she does not infect a specific individual, someone else probably will and epidemics will occur. The risk that a non-vaccinated individual would actually make a significant difference to the chances that another individual is harmed is therefore significant only if vaccination rates in oneâs community are within a certain specific"
271,160,0.99,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"A second characteristic of communicative figurations is communicative practices (see Hepp and Hasebrink in this volume), which are often mediated and are therefore media practices. Analyzing the communicative and media practices in the communicative figurations in Repair CafÃ©s, it first has to be described what people actually do at these events. In Repair CafÃ©s, people join forces to repair their media technologies (among other things). They bring along new technologies such as laptops and smartphones, and old ones such as slide projectors and old radios. They open the devices, clean them, mend them and screw them back together. Helpers explain the defects the devices have, what could be done, what they can do and what the owners could do in future when similar problems occur. Sometimes the repair is successfulâand sometimes not. Moreover, people in Repair CafÃ©s chat together and partake of the beverages and cake which are served during the repair events. Analyzing the communicative and media practices in the communicative figurations in Repair CafÃ©s, it is important to distinguish between the practices in which people communicate (face to face or mediated) and the repair practices. Taking the latter into accountâthe repairing of media technologiesâI will discuss here why the repairing of technologies can be characterized as media practice.9 Practice theory has a long tradition in media and communication studies (for an overview and the discussion see e.g. Couldry 2012: 33â58, Genzel 2015, Pentzold 2015). Nick Couldry defines media as âthe open set of practices relating to, or oriented around, mediaâ (2004: 117). He stresses that we need the perspective of practice to help us address how media are âembedded in the interlocking fabric of social and cultural lifeâ (Couldry 2004: 129). A practice perspective helps us to understand how people actually appropriate media (technologies) in everyday life and which meanings they construct regarding media. The central question"

In Kenya, again, you can see the two parties in it, the government with its politico-economic agenda and the peopleâs relationships with this as they go along doing their business. As the initial media spotlight continues to dim, a number of fundamental issues about business anywhere are becoming apparent. Kenyan entrepreneurs do not yet have the requisite knowledge and commercial infrastructure to build globally recognized technology companies when compared with their Western counterparts. What is being asked of them is equivalent to fixing an aircraft while yet in flight. Not only is the global technology landscape changing rapidly, but African entrepreneurs are being asked to stake their claim as it changes. And if that is based on the timeline of Californiaâs Silicon Valley, then we are 50 years late to the party. Being late to the party is one thing. But what are the underlying issues at play? Africans seem to have a penchant for accepting foreign ideas and absorbing them without critically investigating their source, history, necessity, and workability in the context of the African space. Look at the words being used in the African technology environmentâwords like Silicon Savannahâand you can see that not a lot of thought was put into the connotation, as if the perception of the American Silicon Valley had been taken wholesale and simply plastered onto an African scenario. This way of thinking started some time ago, and Silicon Valley is just the most visible part of that iceberg. Stepping back a bit, Africaâs destiny in the world began much earlier and changed significantly in the 1500s, when the Portuguese began sailing to Africa. At that time, Africa south of the Sahara could stand toe-to-toe with Europe in social, commercial, and military prowess. The Portuguese became the most active Europeans in Central Africa and met the Kingdoms of Kongo and Ndongo, among others, that were as good as the Portuguese were in diplomacy, war, and commerce. The Portuguese carried out the business of slavery in earnest to provide for the labor necessary to conquer the new colony of Brazil."
308,155,0.99,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Integrity Some healthcare professionals refuse to comply with the requests of their patients or with the decisions of their colleagues on grounds that to do so would compromise their core belief. The physician may refuse to do abortion, on grounds of religious beliefs, or he/she may refuse to change the gender of his patient (transsex), which he/she insists to do. The current system of medical rules allows the physician to abstain from such managements, but he is required to transfer the patient to another physician who will comply with the patientâs requests of such operations. The value of moral integrity is beyond dispute. It means soundness, reliability, wholeness, and integrations of moral character and being faithful to moral values and standing up in their defense if necessary. The medical profession and its constant demands may deprive us of the liberty to structure and integrate our lives as we see ï¬t, and that will affect our integrity. Persons may lose their integrity if they lack sincerity and steadfastness in keeping their fundamental moral convictions, especially if the exigencies of their ever-demanding job enforce them to practice things which they do not believe. Such exigencies may be rare in Western countries, but they are not so rare in third world countries. A gynecologist in a third world private hospital may be sacked from his job if he adamantly refuses to perform any abortion, not indicated medically. Such a person usually believes in the sanctity of life and, hence, he may also stand against do not resuscitate (DNR) policy agreed upon in certain codes where any further management becomes futile. The question of euthanasia is deï¬nitely beyond these boundaries, as it is still being considered a type of homicide by all governments except Holland, Belgium, and a few states in the USA."

This presents a different picture from the one we saw for the family-oriented men in this generation, who see themselves as participating equally in housework and care. There may be different reasons for this discrepancy (apart from the obvious one that the stories we have from both parties are one-sided, as we do not have their partnersâ views). One is that the men may be less aware of the housework done by their partners or that they disagree on its importance. The other is that the general level of expectation of equal sharing has probably increased compared with the previous generation. In this case it is possible that men actually do more, while women are still disappointed by their contribution."
269,173,0.99,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"And yet, at the heart of our different projects in this area, there has always been an intuition that a potent, (potentially) emancipatory politics of race, gender, class, or sexuality might not have to be always independent of the biological sciences. In pursing that intuition, we have been inspired, for example, by the work of the NeuroGenderings research collective, and by the potent forms of neurofeminism that many of the scholars within that loose agglomeration have insisted on locating at the heart of empirical brain research (Bluhm, Jacobson and Maibon 2012; Schmitz and HÃ¶ppner 2014a, 2014b). We have learnt a great deal from scholars such as Gillian Einstein and Margrit Shildrick, who, in their reinvigoration of the politics of womenâs health, have always insisted on the complementarity of feminist theory and biological research on womenâs bodies (Einstein and Shildrick 2009). And we continue to be propelled by broader movements, within feminist theory, that are working to destabilize (to de-nature, we might say) the suturing of politics to critique, showing how feminist (and other social) theories might yet be traced through neurobiological histories and practices (Barad 2007; Rose and Abi-Rached 2013; Wilson 2004). If our own projects maintain a committed attention to the ways in which epistemic and cultural privileges can be put to work in the generation or sustenance of some deeply worrying relations of power, still, we have tried to show, in the empirical work that we have produced, that an interdisciplinary attention to brain and mind can also unsettle these relations in sometimes unexpected ways; that neuroimaging studies, themselves, can sometimes themselves be the bearers of critical practices."
31,86,0.99,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"Des Browne tried to find a reasonable common ground that recognised why most of those shot at dawn could be pardoned, without granting all of those shot at dawn a pardon. Browneâs statutory pardon deliberately excluded the most difficult cases, such as murderers and mutineers. Moreover, he included a caveat that recognised the importance of historic justice, which deliberately did not bring into doubt the standards, procedures and judgments that condemned these men in the first place. In other words, it could be argued that Browneâs blanket pardon cleverly sidesteps the difficult legal ground, focussing more on the moral case that re-evaluates âjust desertsâ in terms of how we understand the stresses of the First World War today. In doing so, Browne emphasised the importance of posthumous pardoning in the lives of the families who continue to suffer because of what happened to their relatives. Again, in Browneâs own words: Although this is a historical matter, I am conscious of how the families of these men feel today. They had to endure the stigma for decades. This makes this a moral issue to, and having reviewed it, I believe it is appropriate to seek a statutory pardon. (Cited in Fenton 2006)"

132,176,0.99,AiREAS: Sustainocracy for a Healthy City: Phase 3: Civilian Participation â Including the Global Health Deal Proposition,"(matter) that human life needs to support itself, it keeps developing ups and downs without the harmony that nature always experiences, simply because it combines various value systems at once. The focus on a single currency with no other collateral than debt makes the human and ecological drama even larger. In nature, a diversity of lifeforms mingles in permanent pursuit of harmony, using different resources to develop. During a workshop at the Zoo of Emmen, the imagination of entrepreneurship was triggered through looking at the diversity of butterflies living together in a relatively small space, and peacefully at that, due to the non-competitive differentiation of size, food, reproduction, etc. Creating an ecosystem in economies can overcome problems of current models that live through single cyclic patterns. This also has its logic in the ï¬eld of human complexities. Not everyone goes through a crisis at the same time or in the same phase of their lives. Many people do this on their own and develop awareness and innovative patterns ahead of the mainstream. If their leadership is blocked by a formalized mainstream, then progress is blocked out of the systemâs self-interest. Negative tension then gradually builds up. However, if the leadership receives freedom to deploy itself, it generates a positive tension between the robustness of the mainstream and the argumentation of renewal. When we deployed AiREAS, we addressed the awareness level of human beings at different levels of society ï¬rst. When asking a deeply aware human being about the need for core human values, hardly any resistance is felt. If this is seconded by the proven vulnerability that builds up in the institutions, then the professional position of that same human being involves making a choice: contribute to the core values through the authority of the position, or negate awareness by supporting the mission of the institution, even if it proves damaging to the core values. Awareness and guts are human factors that become decisive for taking individual entrepreneurial action, but when these factors are combined in a multidisciplinary, awareness-driven co-creation, change is a fact. The human being comes ï¬rst, awareness places the core values as a permanent goal, and leadership produces the required change for harmony. We use our institutions, knowledge and technology as instruments for progress, rather than submitting to them in dependence. We have been attempting to prove this by going through our own value-driven cycles. Every exercise in AiREAS has been developed through this method of combined entrepreneurial approach by bringing people and authorities together behind the awareness switch. A whole new dialogue appeared, including new vocabulary to express ourselves without continuous disputes about the meaning of words in the different contexts."

50,49,0.99,"Seeing Ourselves Through Technology : How We Use Selfies, Blogs and Wearable Devices To See and Shape Ourselves","Choosing what technology can do Filters can appear to be deeply technological: a new iPhone can count our steps with its M7 or M8 motion sensor and its accelerometer, gyroscope and compass, and it can use its microphone to measure how loud our surroundings are, but it cannot measure â at least not directly â our emotions. Our cameras know when we point them at a face, and can even wait until the person smiles before shooting a photo, but they cannot measure whether we love that person or not. Our bodies themselves are technologies with their own constraints and affordances: we can see colours and use language but cannot hear as well as dogs or navigate using biomagnetism and sonar as whales and dolphins do. Our brains and senses filter our perception of the world. In addition to technological and cultural filters, we have these cognitive filters that we cannot completely escape, although drugs, diseases, surgical implants and body modifications can alter them to some extent. Individual devices have technological filters that are themselves influenced by cultural filters. For instance, an iPhone can track motion but not heart rate or the sweatiness of the palm holding it. It could have been designed differently, and we can study reasons why the choice has been made to build it only to perceive certain inputs. Of course cost and technological development are very important factors in determining what kinds of technological filters are built into a device, but many technological filters, whether they are built into hardware or software, are very deliberate cultural choices. For instance, the creators of the app SkinneePix, which lets you take selfies that show you looking skinnier than you are, wrote in a comment to an article about the app in The Guardian on 4 April 2014: âWe developed SkinneePix as a result of friends (mostly DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0004"
13,93,0.99,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Reading Feelings A last methodological issue to be considered is how it is possible to read âfeelingsâ out of research interviews. This question is especially pertinent when the theoretical perspective on feelings draws on psychoanalytic theory, which is developed for and validated in a clinical setting. An in-depth study of emotional meanings is admittedly hard to accomplish in empirical research outside of clinical practice. This has been a target of much debate in the field of psychosocial studies, where some argue that it is not only a possible but also a vital resource for social researchers to make use of transference/countertransference processes in the reading of the informantsâ unconscious processes, while others have been critical to this (for the discussion on this, see, for instance, Walkerdine 1997; Hollway and Jefferson 2000; Bornat 2004; Frosh and Emerson 2005; Roseneil 2006; Frosh and Baraitser 2008; Hollway 2015; Woodward 2015). My position on this is that using psychoanalytic perspectives in social research does not imply that the researcher should relate to their informants as psychoanalysts to their patients. One issue to consider is that even though qualitative interviews as compared to surveys, experiments and tests may be seen as rich materials and âthick descriptionsâ, they are indeed very âmeagreâ, as Chodorow (1999) puts it, when compared to clinical data that stems from often many years of clinical encounters between the patient and the analyst. Another issue is that most social researchers lack proper training in handling and interpreting what goes on in the transference in the interview situation, so the danger of âwild analysisâ cannot be excluded. A third issue is that the analyses of interview transcripts are not (and in my opinion should not be) validated in an interpersonal space that includes the informant. What social researchers basically work with are texts, and texts are not persons (and definitely not when analysing interviews that are 25 years old). However, when psychosocial methods are implied in social research, it is not primarily the psychobiographical specificity of individual stories"
234,100,0.99,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"Initial (diploma or degree-level education) is a longer-term investment and offers less potential for measuring speciï¬c and attributable systemic outcomes. A second factor relates to the supply of professional volunteers. The majority of professional volunteers are motivated, at least in part, by their personal needs for learning and âmobility /career capitalâ. International exposure has increasingly become a ârite of passageâ in medicine and other careers. Non-clinical placements are of little interest to many career track professional volunteers (Chatwin et al. 2016). As with funding bodies, professional volunteers are very keen to see change within the time frame and, wherever possible, directly attributable to their own activities. Whilst cautious progressive and collaborative incrementalism may be the most appropriate and effective mechanism for change in health systems, this approach may not appeal to funding bodies or volunteers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is widely accepted that education and training requires more than formal classroom teaching. Whilst classroom teaching may form a critical element of theoretical/ explicit knowledge acquisition, ensuring the learning of more tacit knowledge and implementation skills requires co-present learning âonthe-jobâ through supervised placements and mentoring. The emphasis on âlifelongâ learning in the UK also places ï¬rm emphasis on structured continuing professional development to update and reinforce learning. This is the regime that professional volunteers and professional organisations (including the Royal Colleges) are accustomed to and therefore seek to replicate in Uganda. In other words, CPD is part of the culture of professionalism in the UK linked to professional development review (PDR). And, in that context, it does not translate, literally, into a more general interest in lifelong learning but implies short courses and an almost box-ticking exercise. Chapter 3 responds to the following questions; â¢ What do you do with co-presence when you have achieved it? â¢ How do you deploy professional volunteers optimally as knowledge intermediaries? â¢ How do we encourage systems change relevant learning in this environment? Or, put more simply: â¦ Who do we train? â¦ What do we train? â¦ How do we train?"

Neither success nor failure can help him over this hurdle, and it is something that plagues his whole career, not just its beginnings.9 Make no mistake about that. No matter how long an actor practices his art, no matter how much ability he acquires over time, no matter how well he masters the craft, he will never lose his own shadow. Whether or not his acting is felicitous will always be up in the air. The eventfulness of playing in the theater necessarily leads the actor to oscillate between power and impotence,10 between activity and passivity, between being perpetrator and victim. In-between.

Itâs a bit difficult to see how to interpret such a situation. This perhaps argues for the introduction of such a constraint, particularly for the usual systems whose models are single Belnapian worlds.

However, we see that some of the action items in the other categories are related to scale. One example is the item âorganizing an introduction round for new team membersâ in the category people and relations, which describes an action item which would not be necessary on a single-team project. However, our impression is also here that most action items concern issues at the team level. We have not been able to conduct an analysis of the effect of retrospectives at team level. We consider that such meetings give room to develop a common understanding of development process, tasks and what knowledge people in the team possess, what in organizational psychology is referred to as shared mental models [13] and have been shown to relate to team performance. A common critique of retrospectives is that teams meet and talk, but little of what is talked about is acted upon. We have not been able to assess how many of the 36 identiï¬ed action items were acted upon, but found in one minute that âall action items suggested to the project management has been implementedâ. The 36 action items identiï¬ed can be considered small improvement actions. Given the short time spent on retrospectives, they do not seem to facilitate Â«deepÂ» learning (Â«double loopÂ» learning in Argyris and SchÃ¶nâs framework). Having minutes public could also lead to critique being toned down or removed completely. This leads us to discussing our second research question - what could be done to improve the learning outcome of retrospectives in large-scale agile projects? In the background we pinpointed particular challenges of large-scale agile development such as dealing with a high number of people and many dependencies [7]. A retrospective can be used for a number of purposes. Prior studies in organizational psychology suggest that in projects with many teams, the coordination between teams are more important than coordination within teams [16]. It is reason to believe it would be beneï¬cial to focus attention on inter-team issues in large projects. The LeSS framework suggests organizing inter-team retrospectives directly after the team retrospectives. Alternatively, teams can be encouraged to particularly focus on inter-team issues as part of the team retrospectives. A challenge in the project studied is that the contract model used may hinder changes, for example the contract model speciï¬es handover phases between companies involved in the analysis of needs phase and the solution description and development phase. However, given the limitations, it is important that the project adjusts work practice also on inter-team level to optimize use of limited resources. This exploratory study has several limitations, where one is that we have only analysed minutes available on the project wiki from two of four teams."

I present these personal recollections of him, both light and dark, in an effort to paint a more complete picture of the man behind the data and theories. If you imagine all knowledge as a big dark room, and that we all have flashlights to illuminate, teach, learn and grow from, then my Dadâs light shone bright and wide. Yet he couldnât illuminate the whole room. No one can. He was but one man, beautifully imperfect, brilliant with the vitality of his unique life force. Progress in humanity is comprised of individuals building on the discoveries made by those who came before. Itâs a collective and cooperative synthesis of information and ideas, involving both the head and heart. This may eventually light up the room. The human journey isnât ï¬nished. My fatherâs prime legacy, his research and analyses, will always help enlighten that which is dark."
48,35,0.99,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"3.2 Communication of Time Predictions Assume that the car service tells you that the repair will be finished in four and a half hours. What does this information mean? Is the prediction meant to be a best-case prediction, assuming that the work is done by the most skilled service professional and with no unexpected problems? Is it a promise based on a worst-case time prediction? And if it is a worst-case prediction, how sure can you be that the car is actually finished in four and a half hours? If you really need your car back in four and a half hours, the meaning of the time prediction will matter a lot. Whether the prediction was based on a best-case scenario or on experience documenting that 99% of car repairs in similar situations required less than four and a half hours will make an important difference. If the estimate was a best-case prediction, you should have a backup plan, while a 99% likelihood prediction based on past repairs should make you sufficiently safe that the car will be at your disposal when you need it. Most people do not, as far as we have observed in various domains, explain what they mean by their time predictions. We cannot even assume that people in the same context and with similar backgrounds mean the same thing with their time predictions. We once asked software developers to give their time predictions for completion a programming task [4]. Immediately afterward, we asked them how we should interpret their time predictions. When summarizing their responses, we used the category ideal effort if a time prediction was based on the assumption of no unexpected problems, most likely effort if a time prediction was what they thought was the most likely outcome, median effort if a time prediction was what they thought was about 50% likely not to be exceeded, and risk-averse effort if a time prediction was considered very likely to be sufficient to complete the work."

This is not a limitation in the validity of surveys themselves, just an important point to keep in mind and to document before using data, and particularly when they have been collected in a complex, non-standard context. In other words, to take into account the characteristics of the data used and the way they were produced is a basic condition for their proper scientific use. It also means that it would be dangerous to separate the roles of methodologists and social scientists, as they are profoundly interdependent. This book as a whole demonstrates that the union of methodological and substantive issues is a prerequisite for a good scientific work."
306,4,0.99,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","abstraction. Assuming that the ï¬rst geometrical knowledge is passive, comprehensive, global, and, therefore, static, conferring dynamism to geometric reasoning starts to be an important need. This new trend should be interpreted broadly. For a long time, the role of manipulation in early geometrical tasks was not associated with reasoning but rather referred to childrenâs working style, age, and ways of gathering information about the world. The speciï¬cs of childrenâs work indicated the use of different items for manipulation. It seemed obvious that the childrenâs work in active environments would more suitable for them, and functioning at the symbolic level would not be available. This style of work rather was implied by the Piagetian approach, which deals with the necessity of interiorisation of actions in the process of building mathematical concepts. However, it was not connected with the approach suggested by Gray and Tall (1994), which pointed to the necessity of joining processual with conceptual understanding. The pro-ceptual approach was hardly accepted by either the theory or practice of teaching geometry. Currently, designing a manipulative educational environment is focused on building a scheme for deep understanding of geometric concepts. The emphasis here is set not so much on observing objects in motion nor on the ï¬nal results of manipulation, but on the ability to predict the result of the transformation. In this survey, the research on the understanding of geometrical concepts has been grouped around two main issues: the understanding of geometric ï¬gures and the functioning of these ï¬gures in space. The problem of understanding these ï¬gures that was indicated by Van Hieleâs theory is still worth considering and research has brought much information on how it takes place in childrenâs minds. The research reveals many limitations that give children trouble with the transition to higher levels of understanding. This research direction is dominant. Studentsâ understanding of ï¬gures has been repeatedly carried out by analysing the classiï¬cation of the ï¬gures they have made and their ability to describe objects and exclude counterexamples. On the other hand, research shows that children who are functioning in a static situation based on the recognition of a geometric object are doing it much less successfully than those that have the possibility of analysing the object given to them for manipulation. At this stage of research, it is worth dealing with the level that has often been referred to as the zero level (earlier than the level that was described as the ï¬rst level in Van Hieleâs theory). Four to six-year-old children can and do successfully discover the world of geometry in many areas, but they do it in their own speciï¬c way. To use those early experiences for creating further stages of understanding, knowing, describing, and understanding them is required. Such research is performed too rarely. Additionally, this type of research requires speciï¬c methodology and being skilful in making proper observation and in analysing childrenâs behaviour."

I then allow this appeal to become a matter of my concern. In accordance with this concern, I develop a volition: I want that which promotes the thrivingâeven to the smallest extentâof that which has appealed to us, that which concerns us, regardless of how I may establish what that entails. Eventually I take practical action. This connection is what I refer to as care.2 Perhaps I hold on to the object of my care in the future and the care becomes love (Freter 2016, pp. 351â363), or perhaps, as the case may also be, I immediately release the source of the appeal from my care again and send it on its way. In the following section, I will attempt to show how this basic phenomenological structure can indeed be derived from a famous literary account, namely the âGospel According to Lukeâ, in the so-called Parable of the Good Samaritan."

This year (2015), it registered as number ï¬ve on the world ranking of speed. Various people deliberately choose this particular marathon in their quest for personal achievement. And a number conï¬rmed that they did achieve personal records. Curiously, as the ozone increased during the day, more complaints were heard by athletes who did not achieve their expected personal record despite the beautiful day, while in the morning, when the ozone was low, the opposite trend was observed. Ozone is a gas that irritates the lungs, so the observation makes sense. The feedback was, however, subjective, and involved too few participants to make it scientiï¬cally valid. Logically, we may be able to get better feedback if we start concentrating on this particular issue based on this well-founded suspicion. This became something to think about in regard to subsequent events and next yearâs marathon."

TM: Then here is work in â97 building up to the deontic part of Facing the future. Did you have the idea of wrapping that all up in a book by then? It must have been at around that time. NB: It must have been. Mickey and I had the idea fairly early, that we were writing chapters of a book. TM: And you were getting them out as articles. There is another dstit paper with Jeff Horty; he had his book out in the same year as Facing the future. And there is this very nice paper on âConcrete transitionsâ in â98, digging out this notion of a transition in von Wright, which is not easy to find in his work, I think. Did he react to the paper? NB: I donât think so. I read it at his conference, yes. But I donât recall that he had anything to say about it. TM: In his work, transitions are really buried in the idea of âand nextâ, which is much less subtle then what you make of it. âTruth by ascentââ, from 1999, I think I havenât read that. Whatâs in there? NB: Intimations of the revision theory.

188,198,0.99,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Lessons Learned and Outlook The evaluation resulted in the following recommendations: 1. Investigate why some participants perceived the platform as good for supporting collaboration and others not, as this appears to be an important determinant of the general impression of the platform. 2. Keep the number of required interactions (like mouse clicks) at a minimal level. This can be achieved by exploiting the widget communication even more. The participants in the study did not have trouble understanding the automated behavior of widgets even though it conceptually appears rather complex. 3. Reevaluate the platform in a course where it is possible to fully implement the SRL pedagogy. Currently we do not know how users of the system would cope if they were required to choose widgets by themselves. In the current study, the students might not be aware of the intricate, self-establishing nature of the widget communication and it is necessary to find out how this will be perceived when users set up the learning space by themselves. 4. To address how complete SRL platforms are for students, future evaluation surveys should include questions about whether any other means of contacting group members were used in parallel, e.g., instant messaging (like MSN Messenger, Facebook chat), conference call (like Skype), collaborative documents (e.g., Google Drive). The aim should not be to create tools to replace existing, well-functioning communication solutions but to complement these. On the whole the results of the evaluation were encouraging and showed that continued work on the ROLE SDK and platform was motivated."
124,306,0.99,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"and in the discussions regarding determinism and indeterminism. One of his main interests had to do with the Master Argument of Diodorus Cronus and the search for the so-called Diodorean modality (Prior 1955). It was well-known that Diodorus had formulated his argument about 300 BC in order to demonstrate that the world is deterministic, and to argue for a reductive account of modal notions to temporal notions; specifically that possibility should be conceived as âwhat is or what is going to beâ (ÃhrstrÃ¸m and Hasle 1995, p. 15 ff; ÃhrstrÃ¸m and Hasle 2006). To Prior this gave rise to three interesting questions: 1. What is the formal structure of the modal logic in which possibility is defined in the Diodorean way, on the assumption that time is a linear and discrete sequence of instants? 2. How can a formal and valid version the Master Argument of Diodorus be formulated? 3. How can indeterminism be defended (in terms of tense-logical systems consistent with the assumption of free choice) against the valid versions of the Diodorean argument and similar arguments? Prior worked intensively with these and similar questions from 1953 to his death in 1969. In doing so he found it most useful to study the theories of temporal logic. According to Prior the use of temporal logic would make it possible to obtain a better understanding of the consequences of accepting the idea of free choice. In particular, he also realized that the notion of branching time could be most helpful in this respect. Question 1 above was fully answered during Priorâs lifetime. In fact, Prior dedicated a complete chapter of his Past, Present and Future to this problem and its solution (see Prior 1967, p. 20 ff.). As we shall see, the study of this question actually led to the construction of the first branching time models. Priorâs work with question 2 led him to the formulation of a reconstruction of the Master Argument (see Prior 1967, p. 32 ff.). Working with question 3, Prior developed some very important systems of temporal logic consistent with the assumption of free choice. In this chapter we shall mainly comment on his Ockhamistic system. When Prior died in 1969 many additional problems regarding temporal logic and indeterminism had been discovered. Since then several logicians and philosophers have continued Priorâs line of thinking. Clearly, Nuel Belnap is one of the most important writers who have contributed to the further exploration of tense-logical approach to the study of indeterminism and free action. Much of Nuel Belnapâs work has been carried out within a Priorean tradition. As we shall see Belnap has elaborated the Priorean view that, although we may formulate a so-called prima facie kind truth of contingent futures, such statements cannot be what Belnap has called âsettled trueâ. Belnap has described this inspiration from Arthur Prior in the following way: Although I suppose it is unscholarly, I have always thought that what I formulate using âsettledâ is indeed what he âmeantâ, and what he âwould have saidâ had he been aware of the mischief that could, alas, be caused by not making âsettledâ explicit.

334,258,0.99,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Following Rosenberger and Winklerâs (2014) terminology, the beneficiary can be described as the object of solidarity protest. This designation underlines their rather passive role in the protest, compared to the civil society actors qualified as protest subjects. Even if the beneficiary does not take part in the protest activities in the same way as the civil society actors, we argue that their role cannot be described as passive. Our results show that the beneficiary of the protest is equally its protagonist. Representing the case defended by the protesters, the beneficiary has to face the media, break the silence and accept to reveal his identity. The particularity of casespecific protests is indeed that the beneficiary does not remain anonymous. They leave the shadow in which other undocumented migrants remain, afraid of what might be seen as a strategy with an uncertain outcome (Antony 2010, 15). As described by one beneficiary we interviewed, beginning a public protest requires courage: That demands a lot of work, and then it requires a lot of organization. Not everyone can do it. At the start we were about ten people in Geneva in the same situation. [â¦] I called them all ten, and said: âWhat shall we do now? A team of ten or I go alone?â They answered: âOh no, I cannot declare my identity, they will understand that I am undergroundâ. I said: âGood well then stay, Iâm going aloneâ.

209,209,0.99,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"students engaged in critical thinking (versus when they did not), but these effects were not affected by whether the students engaged in discussions and usually suggested students became more moderate when encouraged to think critically. Further, when we manipulated the homogeneity of attitudes within groups during discussion, we did not find any differences in attitude change or extremitization in the aggregate, but we did find that this was somewhat dependent on individual-level openness. Specifically, we found some evidence that students low in openness were the most likely to exhibit extremitization in heterogeneous groups, and studentsâ high in openness were the most likely to exhibit extremitization in homogeneous groups. Our conclusion, partly reflecting others (for a review, see Delli Carpini, Cook, & Jacobs, 2004), is that attitude change via deliberation is dependent on context as well as personality, but we did not detect evidence of polarization related to discussing the ethical and policy implications of nanoscience materials (see also Gastil, 2017; Gastil, Kahan, & Braman, 2006). Finally, we examined the studentsâ policy acceptance, even when government selects a policy that is inconsistent with their own preferences (Chap. 5). Again, we did not find our experimental manipulations had many direct effects on this important outcome nor did they directly moderate the relationships between policy preferences and acceptance/support. Nonetheless, sometimes our manipulations did impact potential mediators such as perceptions of the process and of the information used. These mediators and moderators ended up being important for advancing understanding of why our manipulations may not have had effects. For example, one robust finding was that critical thinking prompts led participants to perceive the information materials more negatively. Somewhat less robustly, critical thinking prompts also sometimes led to greater conscientious (careful, thorough) engagement. Interestingly, this suggests multiple competing processes can be evoked by one feature of engagement: prompting critical thinking during deliberation evokes both conscientious engagement and negative assessments of the information provided. Note that for people to accept policies they do not prefer, it is required that the typically strong relationships between policy preferences and acceptance be reduced. Our analyses found conscientious engagement tended to strengthen the relationship between policy preferences and acceptance, while negative assessments of the information materials were associated with weaker policy preferenceacceptance relationships. This suggests the reason critical thinking prompts appeared to have no overall effect on the policy preference-acceptance relationship is because the prompts evoked both processes simultaneously. It also suggests that some of the features that engagement practitioners attempt to promote (conscientious thinking and high-quality information) are likely to increase preferenceacceptance relationships, thereby making it more difficult rather than less difficult for those who dislike policies to accept them. Through our multi-year research program, we learned that although it is possible to emulate some of the control features of laboratory science, the classroom does not necessarily emulate real-world deliberations environments (for a particularly interesting study of real-world deliberations, this in the legal system and the role of juries, see Gastil, Dees, Weiser, & Simmons, 2010).

72,10,0.99,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"natural sciences, most of the big 20th-century theoretical breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and biology did not arise in a detached ivory tower but as responses to the practical problems of the real world, and much of the theoretical distinction between basic and applied research, which became institutionally embodied in the late 20th century, misread that history â a point eloquently made in Jon Agarâs recent book (2013). Yet to describe the study of social innovation as a craft knowledge is not to imply any less need for research rigour. There is still a need for falsifiable hypotheses â the more clear-cut, or surprising, the better. There is certainly a need for data â time series data on the growth or decay of social organisations, their contribution to GDP, their social make-up, their geography, and so on â and we should hope that over the next decade social innovation can begin to catch up with the rapid progress being made in the statistical study of other fields of innovation. Examples of this include the progress being made in measuring intangibles, the pioneering work on measuring the creative economy (Bakhshi et al., 2012) and the use of web-scraping and other tools to show economic phenomena before they have been captured by official statistics (Bakhshi and Mateos-Garcia, 2012). That sort of rigour is bound to take research away from the immediate concerns of practitioners, and so a balance needs to be struck. The Italian philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci (1979) famously commented that we should cultivate pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will; perhaps what we most need here is to combine enthusiasm of the spirit and scepticism of the intellect. Striking that balance is a challenge both for the field and for individuals. Many individuals researching social innovation are also practitioners and activists; they are advocates as well as scholars, immersed in the mission as well as the measurement and analysis. This is bound to create tensions. But again, it is not so different from other areas of social science â from late 19th-century sociology to late 20th-century rational choice economics, many of the most apparently detached intellectuals were also in truth advocates for new ways of seeing the world and new ways of acting on it. Joseph Schumpeter, for example, was the finance minister of Austria in 1919 (Backhaus, 2003)."

Yet it is not only what the Agency does that has an impact on tax compliance among the Swedish population; it is also the behaviour of other bureaucracies. And this is something the Agency recognizes. âWhen other bureaucracies in societyâthose that have the task of spending what the Agency has collectedâapply values that resonate with those held by the public, it will, ceteris paribus, automatically increase the Agencyâs reputation,â said the manager of the analysis department at a presentation about the current standing of the Agency (cf. BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2017: 178). So the Agency recognizes that the willingness for citizens to pay up depends on whether the revenue collected is well spent and on services that taxpayers find relevant. It is a perceived reciprocity with the government and its institutions, and such behaviour will increase tax compliance. Recognizing reciprocity as a constituent of what makes for increased tax compliance is important at the Agency. It argues that it is logical to believe that citizens will pay more of their taxes if: 1. The taxpayer can trust that all other taxpayers pay more, and 2. That s/he can trust that the political institutions will provide more services (Skatteverket 2010: 12). The second argument was discussed in Chap. 1, where it was seen that reciprocity plays a role in getting benefits for what is paidâa tit-for-tat relationship. Important to note is that taxation is not a market transaction, which would bring an immediacy and a specificity to the resulting relation. It is naive to argue that a citizen wants to see what his/her tax money is spent on and compare what is received in return; there is just no way to calculate what the state provides. But the argument is very commonâ recall my former neighbour Henry. Now, in the first statement the Agency not only talks about a status quo of tax collection; the statement is also about increasing taxation. The keyword is more. Adding more is to my mind going too far too quickly. It would be too much to accuse the Agency of increasing the amount of taxes that ought to be paid, for example by changing laws. Such a statement risks moving us directly into the political sphere,3 and the level of taxation in society is not a task for the Agency. It is there for all citizens, not only those who sympathize with the idea of increased governmental services and thus an increased tax burden. It seems like a backlash from the"

334,275,0.99,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"From this personal tie, protesters derive arguments about the particularity of the beneficiaryâs situation and mobilize the integration-deservingness frame. This frame emphasizes the beneficiaryâs âgood integrationâ, an assessment relying on the official criteria of the Swiss administration, including privileged contact to Swiss citizens, lawful behavior and financial independence (Wichmann et al. 2011). Consequently, the beneficiary appears as deserving; the protestersâ claim for the beneficiaryâs right to stay is directly deduced from their achievements in terms of integration and their subsequent âcivic membershipâ (Ellermann 2014). This integration-deservingness frame is embedded in a general agreement with the Swiss immigration policies and a fundamental acceptance of the state authority. The questioning and challenging of a single administrative decision expresses a critique concerning the application of the law in this particular case and not of the law as such. As declared by an interviewee: Well, it was quite clear: we do not have to fight against the state, we just have to manage that they can stay. This is another content in a way. So, we accepted the state as being the state, we accepted that there are rules, but we just made sure that they respect these rules, that they find the gaps.

137,558,0.99,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"A major focus of this chapter has been an exploration of the factors that enable or encourage Japanese fathers to take parental leave as in the Japanese context this phenomenon is very rare. Moreover, the sampling criteria for this study were strict in that the participants had to be fathers who had taken leave for a month or more and done so on their own. Given these tough criteria, it was expected that the fathers would have needed to take leave so their wives could return to work. However, we found that half of the fathers interviewed did not face such imperatives, but took leave on their own for other reasons including the childâs best interest, their wish to spend time with the child, and their need to take a break from work. As for the factors that lead to taking leave, those described in existing studies (Fujino-Kakinami 2006; Morita 2011; Takeishi 2011), such as reduced economic stress because the parents were dual earners, the presence of supportive managers and colleagues, and a strong desire to do so in the fathers themselves, were found in this study. However, it was also found that these conditions were not always met. What all fathers had in common was a flexible attitude to gender roles and respect for the career of their partner. The mothersâ attitudes to gender roles and fathersâ taking leave also helped them take a decision that is uncommon in Japan. Moreover, the recent policy change appears to have increased the possibility for fathers to take leave in Japan. The lived experiences of the fathers were also examined closely. They became significant carers and did a larger share of housework during the period they were on leave on their own. Most of the fathers describe their difficult experiences in considerable detail, confessing to feeling isolated, busy and bored during leave. However, they also recalled some pleasant experiences, which were described as something that would have been impossible to have when they were working. Although they were sharing the housework and were committed to the care of the child even before their leave, their experience of leave alone seems to have had a great impact on their perceptions of childcare and housework, which they came to think of as their own responsibility. This change in perception affects both their family relationships and work, and some of them actually changed their work style. If we take a closer look at the data, we can understand that equal career opportunities between couples should be examined in the context of a life course perspective. Although taking leave on their own by fathers might not necessarily appear to"

In Chap. 6 we describe the constraints of the authoritarian field when âwriting upâ, and our practices concerning anonymization and off-the-record information. We make some concrete proposals on how to deal with the tension between protecting respondents and scientific transparency. In the final pages of the book, we give a carefully qualified list of âdoâs and donâtsâ, distilled from our reflections in each chapter."
82,41,0.99,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"In contrast to the first constraint, PAA is likely to generate a lot of discussion. For what does it mean to say that a proposition An is available to S as a reason for Anâ1 ? The answer to this question is clearly very important, for it involves what we mean by âepistemic justificationâ, and thus what we mean by the arrow in our justificatory chain: q ââ A1 ââ A2 ââ A3 ââ A4 . . . Although Klein acknowledges the importance of the question, he believes that the discussion about the pros and cons of infinitism can be carried out without delving into the matter. He argues that An is available to S as a reason for Anâ1 if and only if An is both objectively and subjectively available. Objective availability is about the relation between two propositions: An is objectively available as a reason for Anâ1 if and only if it really is a reason for Anâ1 . Klein remarks that what makes a proposition a reason âneed not be fleshed outâ, since âthere are many alternative accounts that could be employed by the infinitistâ; hence the âthorny issueâ of what makes a proposition a reason âcan be set asideâ.21 Subjective availability is about the relation between a proposition and a person: An is subjectively available as a reason to S if and only if An is âappropriately âhooked upâ to Sâs beliefs and other mental contentsâ.22 It need not imply that S actually believes or endorses An ; it only means that S must in some sense be able to âcall onâ An .23 For example, it is not necessary for S to know or believe that 366 + 71 = 437 in the sense in which S knows or believes that 2 + 2 = 4. It is enough for subjective availability if S is able to do the calculation when called on to do so. In Kleinâs words, âThe proposition that 366 + 71 = 437 is subjectively available to me because it is correctly hooked up to already formed beliefs.â24 Unlike Klein, we do not believe that an investigation into the viability of infinitism can evade the question as to what makes a proposition a reason for 21 Ibid., 136-137. 22 Ibid., 136. 23 Klein 1999, 300, 308-309. 24 Ibid., 308.

Entrepreneurship is no longer limited to money-driven business entities. Civil servants may also enter the same entrepreneurship of creating core values, not through regulation but co-creation. Civilians contribute through awareness-driven changes in their consumption patterns and productivity. The 1Ã proï¬t-based business practice is outdated and evolves into value-driven co-creation, affecting every participant. A product becomes an instrument, a user too, just like the ï¬nancial means, a policy or the application of knowledge. This is both a major breakthrough and a tremendous learning process for all involved. With this, we started to experiment in order to prove the evolution of entrepreneurship of which we ourselves were an example. We now needed to show how the To Be part became dominant over our To Do decisions and that the center of the pyramid was populated with multidisciplinary tables of co-creation efforts based on core PPP + P values. Core value-driven entrepreneurship was no longer conï¬ned to âbusiness peopleâ but expanded so as also to include civilians, civil servants, educators, executives, etc., all of whom contributed to progress through value-driven interaction. Entrepreneurship is no longer referred to as âmaking money through producing and sellingâ; it becomes âco-creating core values together through multidisciplinary interactionâ. With this basic understanding of the evolution of regional entrepreneurship, we could start ï¬nding our way in the complex duality of the existing reality, the old ï¬eld of speculative economics and the new ï¬eld of economic diversity through value-driven change and awareness-driven co-creation."
395,200,0.99,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"As provocative as it may sound, the discussions during the academic seminar led us to raise this fundamental question: can safety training contribute to enhancing safety? The initial doubt was expressed by FonCSIâs industrial partners, questioning the relevance of their safety training based on the perception or belief that their increasing investment in such training was no longer paying off as expected. However, in the light of the discussions, it appears that rather than asking how to deliver better or more efï¬cient safety training, a more relevant question would be: are safety training courses an appropriate way to actually enhance safety? This question emerges in reality from a deeper philosophical disconnect between two apparently opposite appreciations of safety:"
163,66,0.99,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"social fees and other indirect taxes which are added to more or less every economic transaction taking place in Sweden. Although we can add up how much direct tax we pay, indirect taxes are difficult to account for as they are not always clearly stated. On the receipt side there is obviously no way to estimate the pay-offâhow much welfare and other governmental services are given in return (for taxes paid). Exchanges, for example tax payments, between inhabitants and state are vast even on a daily basis, and are impossible to quantify or account for, and immensely complicated in a welfare state. Recognizing reciprocity, the receive side is as important to consider, as we also want to evaluate what we get for taxes paid. What is the worth of my daily welfare services? How can I evaluate the standard of the streets I walk? What is the value of the health services I receive in times of need? What is the worth of the schooling I have attended, or that my children have gone through? Is the state I pay tax to governed by values I share? In quantitative terms these are silly questions, but from a qualitative perspective they are important, as various nations have defined their servicesâsuch as the welfare they provideâdifferently. Such calculative endeavour is completely futile. What we get for taxes paid is rather a comparison in time and space; of a glorified past where things were rosier and the state more generous or giving services of better quality. It could also be the opposite, where we recognize improvement over how things were in the past. The same comparison goes for spaceâcomparing what we get with that which other municipalities/regions/nations provide for their members. Yet, as we will see, in Sweden there is a recognition of a such a reciprocal relationship. From a residentâs perspective, taxes paid do indeed have an impact on the expectations of what society should provide. To underline, it is a perception game. This is also why reciprocity is a better way to express the relation between states and their citizens instead of through an expected monetary outcome of a series of taxable market exchanges. Such a change of focus moves our scrutiny away from tax percentages as an explanatory factor for the propensity of citizens to pay their taxes (cf. Allingham and Sandmo 1972). A very simplified conclusion of Allingham and Sandmoâs article is that taxpayers are always maximizing their income in relation to tax payment and penalty fees. Accordingly, a taxpayer will report and pay just enough tax, weighing the outcome of successful tax avoidance against being caught and paying penalties. It is not only at the Swedish Agency that this seminal model has been used to create strategies against evasion in order to increase compliance (Skatteverket 2005). As we"

57,172,0.99,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","arChIvIng our TransCrIpTs As we explained in our introduction to this chapter, recent European policy initiatives aim to create a ânetwork of networksâ of digital data repositories. It is still quite unclear at what point a researcher would be expected to place data in a digital repository, and to what extent access would indeed be open to all. The notion in a recent policy paper that all data should be available to all, in all phases of the research cycle (Joint Policy Paper 2017) reflects a poor understanding of how scientists work, and governmental overreach in terms of transforming their ways of working. Nonetheless, social science researchers in Europe may soon come under institutional pressure to comply with mandatory data storage in digital repositories. Open access repositories are subject to exactly the same objections as the DA-RT and JETS initiatives, specifically but not exclusively from the perspective of the authoritarian field, so we need not rehearse our arguments here. But we want to go a step further and state our objections even to digital repositories with restricted and/or embargoed access. Again, our primary objection concerns risk to respondents. As Marc Lynch points out, âthe difficulty of guaranteeing confidentiality for materials deposited in a trusted repository are not hypothetical to those of us who conduct research in the Middle East and North Africaâ (Lynch 2016, 37), and the same is true for other authoritarian contexts. We discern three aspects to this risk of breaching confidentiality, and hence risking harm: political contingency, legal risk, and digital risk. The first aspect relates to the apparently very"

Since a mobile phone is a sign of wealth, in some situations, it can arouse jealousy from the other members of the community. Therefore, it is best not to âflashâ a mobile phone. In the words of one informant Soro Kolo: âIt is better to live hidden if you want to live long timeâ.

After the dogmatist has given his answer, for example reason A1 , the sceptic will ask further: what is your reason for A1 ? In the end it will become clear that the dogmatist has only three options open to him, jointly known as âAgrippaâs Trilemmaâ: 1. He goes on giving reasons for reasons for reasons, without end. 2. He stops at a particular reason, claiming that this reason essentially justifies all the others that he has given. 3. He reasons in a circle, where his final reason is identical to his first. In the first case the justificatory chain is infinitely long, in the second case it comes to a halt, and in the third case it forms a loop. The sceptic is quick to point out that none of these options can be accepted as a justification for q. The first option is impossible from a practical point of view, since we are ordinary human beings with a restricted lifespan. Moreover, even if we were to live forever, continuing to give reason after reason, we would never reach the origin of the justification, since by definition the chain does not have an origin. The second option is also unsatisfying. For why do we stop at this particular reason and not at another? If we can answer this question, we have a reason for what we claimed is without a reason, so we actually did not stop the chain. And if we cannot answer the question, then stopping at this particular reason is arbitrary. The third option is likewise unacceptable, for 3 Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of scepticism.

Most of the women in this generation say that they did not care about gender equality questions as young girls; the engagement came during the 1970s, after they were married and had children. Their positive attitude is not surprising when taking into account how little gender difference appears to be part of their own grown-up gender construction. Why shouldnât individuals be equals? The views of the women in this generation vary from a radical stand for womenâs rights and against individual discrimination to a general support of gender equality politics addressed at a group level, and to a more pragmatic individual approach where justice comes second to necessity. Whether the fight for gender equality should take place mainly inside or outside the family is also a dividing line. Educational level combined with their experiences in marriage influence their stand here. The overall pattern is that it is the women who share on an equal basis, or who divorced in frustration at not getting the husband to share, who take the radical stand. Many of them are class travellers. They all received higher education and were often radicalised as students. Few of them have been directly politically active; rather, it is the injustices in their daily lives at work and in the family they address, and they have been consciously communicating these lessons to their daughters. Olaug, for instance, has taken care not to make her daughter too good at housework in order to prevent her being stuck with this in her later relationships with men. Hanne says that she and her daughter Hilde âfight the womenâs struggle all the timeâ in the family. In this struggle they have constructed themselves as a new kind of women, different not only from their mothers, but also from traditional norms of femininity. This gives some problems with keeping up the solidarity with women as a group, an issue that will become much more pronounced but also much less guilt-ridden in the youngest generation. As middle-aged, they still identify with womenâs rights, but say that they are not as radical today as they used to be. Some of them admit that they became a bit extreme, for instance, in insisting on sharing everything according to a ruler. Other women in this generation, with or without higher education, but with more traditional gender arrangements in their families, or those who chose to stay in marriages with mixed practices tend towards formulating their support in terms of gender quality politics:"
381,26,0.99,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"communities; and children in most neighborhoods participated in sports and clubs. But over the past generation or two, social capital has become more strongly related to human capital; that is, those with limited human capital are even more disadvantaged because they often lack necessary social capital, and those with more human capital tend to have the networks, norms, and behaviors that provide the most benefit in todayâs environment. Educational Testing Serviceâs Opportunity in America initiative defines opportunity as pathways to the development of human and social capital. Those pathways may be more or less open for individuals based on the circumstances into which they are born and the trajectory of their lives. The presence or absence of opportunities to develop human and social capital, as well as the choices individuals make to take advantage (or not) of those opportunities, translate into distinctly different life outcomes and, as the generational cycle continues, lead to differential prospects for their children. This transmission of opportunity from one generation to the next is driven by the dynamics of advantage or disadvantage, with one advantage building upon another for some children, while one disadvantage is compounded by the next for others. The result is diverging destinies that are increasingly defined by circumstances of birth. While birth circumstances have always impacted an individualâs life chances, todayâs children are being born into an America that is increasingly polarized along economic, educational, and social lines, an America where it is harder to make up for early gaps in opportunities to develop human and social capital. This is not in anyoneâs best interests. It not only impacts this generation and the next, but also the very quality of our society and, ultimately, our democracy. This volume is an important part of the ETS initiative, which is designed to advance the national conversation about opportunity in America, as it serves as the empirical undergirding for the other parts. The chapters address a number of topics and perspectives ranging from education and demography to economics and political science. The authors shed light on a variety of issues and challenges regarding inequality of opportunity, but they also offer insights into policies and practices that could help us think anew about how to move in a direction that is more in keeping with our national values and ideals. Of course, it is obvious that a single volume, no matter how rich, cannot hope to capture the full complexity of the current situation. There are multiple forces and policies acting at different levels: supranational, national, regional, and local. Supranational forces like globalization, the accelerating infusion of technology into different workplaces, the increasing power and reach of information and communication technology, and even cultural shifts are not easily tamed at the national level. But other forces are driven by policies adopted by various levels of government. They range from national economic and social welfare policies to state laws governing education funding, collective bargaining and right to work, and local zoning ordinances. These forces interact in complex ways over time that shape trends in opportunity. Moreover, the dynamics play out in systematically different ways depending on location, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Thus, we should always bear in mind that oft-cited national averages can conceal"

When assessing the potential candidates for recruitment all information available was used, including formal applications and written testimonials from previous workplaces. However, written testimonials could have strings attached. A good testimonial, for example, could turn out to be an attempt to save the face of an incompetent employee and avoid problems which would have resulted from his firing: [Y]ou have to fire a person. He says OK, gets up, leaves his resignation of his own free will and saves his face. You will save his face. He could say that I wonât resign, fire me according to the laws. He takes the issue to court after which the real show begins. He will say that you are paying salaries under the counter. And you will say that I will send 13-year-old hooligans to your home to explain to him where to look for his salary (â¦) who needs this? You will write him a letter of recommendation (â¦) and he continues on the markets, shows the letter. (general director, p3) Moreover, in a formal testimonial the image given of the evaluation target is positive and flawless. The possible failures, conflicts, and other shortcomings at work have been excluded, whereas in an informal recommendation both pros and cons of the target can be dealt with. Because a testimonial as a rule is written to an anonymous reader, it implies a different kind of responsibility than an informal recommendation given in a brokerage chain to an old acquaintance or friend: If for example one of my former employees is looking for job in some firm and asks for a recommendation (â¦) if he does not ask anything supernatural, Iâll write a recommendation regardless of how our work relationship ended. And I donât feel any responsibility for it to other people (â¦) If I recommend to a friend, good acquaintance or my partner a person whom I know personally, then I will bear a certain responsibility for it. And therefore I think ten times, I weigh everything before I will give a recommendation. These are completely obvious things.

If the other politicians and not least the journalists do not work for the people, then whom do they work for? A foreign power or a secret elite? Conspiracy theorists turn up the distrust of the establishment, which could be run by the enemy, the others, and they use this distrust as fuel. Thus, conspiracy stories and theories have the same basic usversus-them structure as the populist narratives, but taken to an even more extreme degree. The others are hidden in conspiracy thinking, and there is also an even greater tendency to perceive the world unnuanced as a battlefield for an epic battle between good and evil that only those in the know can see. A conspirational conviction may be defined as being a belief that an organization consisting of individuals or groups is plotting and acting in the dark in order to reach a specific goal that is often malignant. Conspiracy theories are not necessarily wrong. Watergate is a prime example of a real conspiracy, and there are also more or less shady secret intelligence missions, corrupt actions, clandestine operations, and unsavory political deals that sometimes come to light but oftentimes go unnoticed. The belief in secret agendas may go into hyperdrive and become a paranoid perception of the world in which everything, give and take, are perceived as being run by the others. This turns critical thinking into conspiracy thinking, where motivated reasoning and fact resistance may thrive and misinformation is accepted uncritically as long as blame is attributed to the preferred quarters. An encompassing study looked into 2.3 million Facebook usersâ information consumption and established that people with conspiracy convic-"
124,507,0.99,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"4 The Question of Embeddability: States, Moments, and Histories Belnap developed BST as a formal framework to model an indeterminist world, making a significant step toward accommodating modern physics by adding resources to model spatial variation to the branching time framework of Kripke and Prior. The intuitive interpretation of our theory of possible ancestry presupposes a similar intuition of indeterminism.17 Hence the question arises of how its ontology can be embedded in a branching time structure. The task is not trivial, because typically neither a structure of possibilia nor any of its restrictions to an admissible set will have the requisite property of having no downward branches. A typical family tree is not a tree in the branching-time sense, and the same goes for any typical structure of possibilia. (If fission were the only means of reproduction, a structure of possibilia need indeed not have downward branches. But they will appear as soon as there can be reproductive acts that require more than one participant.) So, how can we construct a branching time structure from the means at our disposal? Here, the admissible sets clearly play a central role. We will motivate our construction by a look at how the possibilities they model correspond to elements of the branching time structure that is implicit in our intended interpretation. Facing the future, it is obvious that from the possibility modeled by an admissible set there typically will sprout many different historical paths towards later possible situations, depending on which possible children (modeled by direct descendants in terms of âº) of some of the inhabitants of that possibility come into existence. Facing the past, we encounter a small surprise because there may also be a plurality of paths branches leading up to the possibility modeled by an admissible set. E.g., towards the admissible set containing Eve, Adam, and their two sons Abel and Cain, there is one path via the admissible set {Eve, Adam, Abel} and a second path via the admissible (Footnote 16 continued) nature (cf. Sect. 2.5 of âIn Retrospectâ) so that there might be reason to understand postulate U in a metaphysical way. But in this special case there remains a pragmatic reason to group it with other specific requirements, namely its high degree of contentiousness. 17 This will be obvious in the examples of Sect. 5, where we admit, for some given possibility, that from then on things may take one of many different courses: Elizabeth and Peter have these children, but they might have had others, and so on."

On this front, interviewees suggested that being âwokeâ requires âcheckingâ oneâs privilege constantly, and recognising where their life experience exempts them from an understanding of racism, sexism, homophobia and other prejudices. In the following example, one interviewee reflects on how his privilege exempts them from experiencing hate speech: (47) I havenât experienced hate speech as a white cis male (Interviewee 3). There is general consensus in âwokeâ circles that white people cannot be subject to racism, as self-identifying men cannot be subject to sexism (Houlston 2017). For example, an interviewee described an incident where a student ofï¬cer at the notably âradicalâ Goldsmiths university provoked controversy by tweeting â#KillAllWhiteMenâ (Telegraph 2015). In keeping with âwokeâ conceptions of hate speech, she argued that as a woman of colour she could not be racist. With power and privilege in mind, the interviewee here highlights this incident as an example of imbalances in police protection and scrutiny on the basis of patriarchy and racism: (48) Itâs like that Baha Mustafa thing; someone will say kill all white men and then all of a sudden they are under investigation. (Interviewee 4) Interviewees strongly agreed on the importance of giving the victim the right to choose how to respond to experiences of hate crime off their own accord. One interviewee who had experienced hate speech argued that direct person attacks often prevent the victimâs ability to âcall outâ hate speech due to emotional distress and exhaustion. (49) I, as a woman of colour, really struggle speaking to someone I would deï¬ne as racist because I donât think itâs my job to make them less racist. (Interviewee 10) The interviewee here raises the issue of responsibility, and the concept of âalliesâ which is well-known in millennial âwokeâ circles. An âallyâ, in this context, is someone who claims no authority in understanding this discrimination, yet can call out and educate a perpetrator unaffected by an issue by virtue of their identity (Hess 2016). In turn, another interviewee elaborated on the importance of allies using their privilege in order to resist hate speech: (50) I donât think it should be hijab Muslim women who go and speak to BNP sympathisers, but your nice average white liberal man who just wants to do something could have that conversation. The work of having those conversations is left to the people who are most likely to experience the intolerance and allies in the room get to say nothing and not be awkward or disruptive.

BOOTs too are thus constantly looking for ways to innovate themselves, so they can somehow continue to offer their services in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The BOOT manager stressed the importance of mobilising and pooling different resources: At some point the city district is going to pull itself back more, simply because they are not getting any money for this anymore. And then you have to look at (â¦) how you can keep this going, without costing more money, but that you still grow. [â¦] So you have to look how you can create an exchange system with existing partners, so they can keep their costs low by using students. [â¦] We are especially busy with looking at how residentsâbecause there is of course a lot of knowledge also with residents, and time, unfortunately these days also with people who are highly qualified, but that are unemployedâto look at how they can guide the students for a part.

The typical person abandoning his farm is 60â70 years old and enters retirement rather than a new job. And the farm will usually not be abandoned if there is a son (or perhaps a daughter) who is willing to take it over. This completes our mental journey from inter-generational relations towards economistsâ concern about structural change in agriculture. In essence, structural change in agriculture is a story about successful or failed farm successions. And these successions usually occur between the different generations on a farm. In order to illustrate this system, it may be useful to enter the world of theoretical modelling. While this requires a degree of abstraction, it may clarify the very relationship between farm succession and structural change. Let us first focus on determinants of the personal decision to take over a farm. In line with Rosenâs model (1986), we assume two kinds of jobs to choose between: uia = Wia + ni"
306,31,0.99,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Various activities related to the manipulation of shapes affect their better recognition, and the need to determine the properties common for a âfamilyâ affects a better familiarity with shapes. This situation forces the use of language, which supports the transition to the descriptive level. In this way studies show that for children from the age of 5â7 years old in an active environment, evolution of the visualization is accessible for the students, although it does not seem to be used spontaneously (Coutat and Vendeira 2016). Situations that involve naming of particular shapes and the influence of names to deal with ï¬gures have appeared in many publications. There have been observations that show that the fact that the word triangle can refer to many objects of everyday life can be an obstacle to the construction of the concept of triangle (Vighi 2003a). Coutat and Vendeira (2016) have noted that children tend to give shapesâ both geometric and non-geometricânames that are associated with objects from the real world. Naming objects in this way makes it easier to deal with shapes as such. Another problem that has often been undertaken relating to the understanding of geometric ï¬gures at a slightly higher level has been the study of the understanding of the relationship between triangles and quadrangles (i.e., classiï¬cation of quadrangles). This problem can be placed at the transition between the descriptive and relational level. Research has focused on this problem due to the belief that students at this educational stage need not only know geometric properties but also need to understand relationships between properties and shapes. The aim of such studies has been to determine the ability to describe the ï¬gures and to observe attempts to create deï¬nitions. Studies have repeatedly been carried out that use models and ï¬gures that students have to group according to properties they choose themselves. Quadrilaterals and the relationships among them have often been a part of elementary school mathematics curricula. Research has suggested that students initially focus on visual characteristics of ï¬gures instead of their properties (Mack 2007). One of the reasons for having students operate with prototypical ï¬gures is their static understanding in the typical position: considering quadrilaterals to be static ï¬gures with certain properties (e.g., a trapezium is a ï¬gure with one pair of parallel sides, one of which is parallel to the bottom edge of the paper). This has been considered to be the main reason for students not being able to conceptualize the interrelationships among different quadrilaterals (Walcott et al. 2009). Some of this research has analysed these skills while examining the impact of teaching style. A constructivist approach to teaching has developed the concept of inquiry-learning through self-exploration. Researchers have been trying to determine to what extent questioning may influence an increase in competence in describing ï¬gures (Lee 2016). The conclusion that has come from these studies suggests that when students are faced with the need to answer teachersâ âwhyâ questions they are forced into deeper analysis of the properties of ï¬gures. However, this generalization may be wrong.

In a waterfall environment, there is an explicit stage called the design phase. This phase is led by the architect. He designs and documents the soluâ tions. The design is prescriptive. The assumption is that if the developers follow the design, then the software will be OK. This design phase is the most demanding and solemn of the entire software phase. If you get the design phase wrong, you will end up paying a high price for years to come. On the other hand, in an agile environment, there often is no design phase. In conseâ quence, the reasoning often goes: âIf in an agile environment, there is no design phase, so there is no designer hence no architect.â So we must clarify. No design phase does not mean âno designâ. No design phase means that there is not an explicit phase during which design happens exclusively. Rather, design happens all the time. Likewise, when we say that the architecture is emergent, that should not mean that we do not need architects because architecture just happens. That is not true. It means something much more subtle. When we say that the architecture is emergent, we are saying that as the system evolves, a certain structure emerges. Someone needs to keep an eye on that emerging structure. When it is emerging according to plan, the architect will strengthen it, and when it is starts diverging, the architect will act accordingly. Maybe adjusting"
118,301,0.99,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"organizational factors, as discussed above, played a critical role. Presented here are five simplified plausible reasons: â¢ Complacency and consequential poor training for emergency situations, especially evident when we see confusion in implementing EPR (level 5 defensein-depth), but, in general, there seems to have been the prevailing notion of âaccident will not happen here,â and ânothing much to learn from outside of Japanâ. â¢ Delayed decision-making to prepare for unexpected. â¢ Over-confidence in technology: focus on component reliability and technology is probably linked to the optimistic attitude of not assuming failure of components or technological measures, such as the case of SBO or SPEEDI. â¢ Lack of critical/reflective thinking, insufficient listening to alternative or even opposing views, and group thinking. â¢ Insufficient continuous improvements, partly due to âprisonerâs dilemmaâ situation with society. The root cause could be said to lie in history, since this cultural attitude was developed during the course of development and utilization of nuclear power for more than half a century. Investigation of organizational causes (not only TEPCO, but including Industry, Government, and local government as well) would need historical insight as was done in the CAIB report [71]. Also needing to be taken into account are national factors influencing the culture for safety."
134,56,0.99,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"ments have been developed as to why Latin should be a part of the curriculum. Students want to study it and thus limiting or eliminating it would restrict choice and diminish the possibilities for learning implied by offering choice to students, i.e. they are more likely to be motivated in their studies if they have some choice in what they study. Latin is the foundation for many European languages and thus studying Latin facilitates the learning of many of these languages. The language of Latin has cultural significance for European students. For those students who want to study ancient civilizations at European universities, studying Latin is particularly advantageous. Disagreement about the content areas of the curriculum occurs in all subjects and religious education is no exception. However, controversy about the purpose of the religious education curriculum can be particularly intense. A well-established aim of much religious education is to maintain the faith of students in one particular religion or denomination (i.e. confessional religious education). Such an approach is often popular with certain parents who want to see a school promoting the same religious way of understanding the world that they provide in their homes. This aim is often found in what are typically referred to as faith schools (whether publicly or privately funded), by which is meant that one particular understanding of religious faith predominates. Proponents of this approach may argue that parents have a right to ensure that their children are educated within a particular religious framework or ethos. As with philosophy, Latin and perhaps religious studies, we can see that a special case can be made for each of them as a core subject, or at least as an optional alternative, in the secondary curriculum. Yet the problem with maintaining student choice at the levels currently permitted, and (for example) maintaining instruction in particular subjects such as philosophy, religious studies or Latin, is that it has led to a very complex and diverse system with inconsistencies between schools. In some cases students are denied their first choices, or required to take subjects that they do not want to take. Currently, at S6 and S7 in the science specialisation, students are obliged to choose at least two options from biology, chemistry, ICT, physics and geography. Mathematics 5 is compulsory for students choosing physics. Human sciences are compulsory for those students not choosing geography."
78,410,0.99,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"epistemic communities the more useful debates often deal with the shades of gray. For example, it is not as if there are vast crowds of citizens wandering about under the whip hand of a circle of elite leaders (although Left publications might put forth this case). Rather, as members of a society, there are times when we contribute and times when we simply consume, not really fulfilling the Leninist idea of âfrom each according to his abilities, to each according to his needsâ but rather in the less economical and less elegant way of taking on shifting roles of responsibilities and benefits. Thus, change is better understood as evolution rather than revolution. However, there has been a lot of talk about internet ârevolutionsâ, whether it is the âTwitter Revolutionâ in Iran in 2009 or the âFacebook Revolutionâ in Egypt in 2011. While many of the manifestoes discussed above (especially Barlowâs) describe the internet in revolutionary terms vis-Ã -vis power redistribution from existing elites to the masses, the twin forces of national power and commercial online dominance make that unlikely. Yet, there are enough elements of the initial forces that shaped the internet to make it a social tool that is unlike anything that has come before. An overlooked element of the internet is speed. Its ability to communicate instantly among many without national or corporate frames is indeed revolutionary. In this particular way, the internet rebalances power between elites and masses. So far, this dynamic has been more about challenging political elites than replacing them, as the experience in Egypt suggests. While states are learning to harvest the online world to better understand and/or control their citizens, traditional political institutions are not well designed to take full advantage of the social capital offered by the online sphere. Rather, it may ultimately emerge that distributed power networks become more authoritativeâand hopefully more effectiveâat spreading democracy than established power institutions. The articulation of the rights (and responsibilities) of online citizens is a first step in preserving the potential of the online sphere to improve the condition of Man. There is an element to the Onlife Manifesto that is revolutionary and this is implicit in both the manifesto itself and the recent reflection from Charles Ess for the Onlife initiative: Governments cannot be passive in the face of evolving technology. Ess, in his chapter, usefully points to the historical evidence that businesses do not automatically safeguard consumers when they introduce new technology (his example of the exploding steam engines was particularly evocative). While this is regrettable, it is also understandable under the logic of the market. No single company could simultaneously bear the cost of innovation and public safety, particularly with the introduction of new technology. The problem is that the internet was supposed to be different; it was supposed to be a post-modern collaborative effort that was above the demands of both sovereignty and capitalism. That may have been true in the initial stages, but for the past decade there has been ample evidence that the internet is the prime locus for business (Google, Facebook, etc.) and national controls (as evidenced by Syria switching off the internet in late 2012 or the broader issue of how security services in nations around the globe mine the internet to monitor citizens). The notion that the internet does not have profound economic and politi-"
82,305,0.99,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"Note that the above reasoning is independent of whether we embrace an objective interpretation of probability (assuming, for example, that the firefighters have propensities for handing over the water only now and then) or a subjective interpretation (in which we specify our degree of belief in A0 ). Both the objective and the subjective interpretation are bound by the rule of total probability, and that is all that counts here. This suggests that our approach is not restricted to epistemological series, but might be applied more generally to the metaphysical structures that Carl Gillet has been talking about. In fact, it might even be used to query similar reasonings in ethics. Richard Fumerton argued that his conceptual regress argument for foundationalism has a counterpart in the ethical realm. Suppose we are interested in whether an action, X, is good, and suppose we are being offered a series of conditional claims: if Y is good then X is good, if Z is good then Y is good, and so on, ad infinitum. Have we answered the original question? Fumerton believes we have not. At best we possess an infinite number of conditional claims, but this does not tell us whether X is good. Just as inferential justification only makes sense if there exists noninferential justification, instrumental goodness only makes sense if we assume that some things are intrinsically good: . . . the view that there is only instrumental goodness is literally unintelligible. To think that something X is good if all goodness is instrumental is that X leads to a Y that is good by virtue of leading to a Z that is good, by virtue of . . . , and so on ad infinitum. But this is a vicious conceptual regress. The thought that X is good, on the view that all goodness is instrumental, is a thought that one could not in principle complete. The thought that a belief is justified, on the view that all justification is inferential, is similarly, the foundationalist might argue, a thought that one could never complete. Just as one terminates a conceptual regress involving goodness with the concept of something being intrinsically good, so one terminates a conceptual regress involving justification with the concept of a noninferentially justified belief.17 The concept of intrinsic goodness stands to the concept of instrumental goodness as the concept of noninferential justification stands to the concept of inferential justification. Just as there are no good things without there being something that is intrinsically good, so also there are no inferentialy justified beliefs unless there are noninferentially justified beliefs.18"

I had started working a four-day week. My best guess as to why I might have been denied the opportunity to work on the more interesting software, based on converâ sations with other colleagues, was that because I worked reduced hours, I wasnât taken seriously. People working on the really exciting stuï¬ were expected to work evenings and weekends, and of course ï¬ve days during the week. 3. I wasnât giving the job my full attention. It was a vicious circle: I wasnât given interesting work to do, so I focused more on hobbies and family, which meant that I was taken less seriously, which resulted in me paying less attention to my job. So, when I was oï¬ered voluntary redundancy, the decision to leave was not hard. In my exit interview, it was suggested I might try being a social worker! This did not appeal to me. 2.3 The Welcoming Environment of XP By the time I was made redundant, I was very bored of my job. My skills had stagnated so much, that as well as having very little enthusiasm for ï¬nding another software role, I doubted my ability to ï¬nd anything new. As a result of these factors, I left the career altogether. After four years out of the industry, I realised that I was more suited to software development than anything else. I decided to return. I was honest about my out-of-date skills, and got myself a job with a company that specialised in taking on graduates and training them up. It was a revelation. Because of the emphasis on training, employees were not only encouraged, they were exhorted to ask as many questions as possible. There was no problem with people being too busy to help. Everyone in the company was expected to both ask and answer as many questions as possible. The teams I worked with had daily stand-ups, where each team member would report on what they were doing and ï¬ag up any problems. The companyâs design methodology was largely waterfall, but the cultures of communication and collaboration were ï¬ltering through from XP working practices in other parts of the industry. This included regular and in-depth code reviews, and an introduction to the concept of clean code. All of this helped to counter the problems I had experienced before, in the following ways: 1. If I got stuck, I knew that someone would be eager to help me. 2. Daily stand-ups meant that there was nowhere for me to hide. If I had problems, I had to admit them. This was liberating. 3. My code was regularly reviewed in depth â so that I was always getting feedback. 4. The emphasis on clean code meant that I and my peers were focused on making our code accessible to each other. I was now back in the career and enjoying myself enormously. The idea that it was OK to ask questions was exhilarating. It also helped that I had those twelve years of experience behind me, so I no longer felt like everybody else was more experienced than me."

Approachable and knowledgeable booksellers are crucial. It is necessary to pass the âgood bookshop testâ â is being able to âfind books when you are not looking for anything in particularâ or books the browser âwouldnât have found on their ownâ. This âbrowsabilityâ was more recently termed by Mark Forsyth as âthe unknown unknownâ, in a specially commissioned Books Are My Bag promotional title.4 The online bookseller equivalent is their âalso boughtâ selections. The bookshop offers a valuable physical space when it comes to taking time out from the pressures and demands of everyday academic life; it is âa place for staff and students to wander among ideas and to generate chance sparks of inspirationâ. The university bookshop is an âessential part of the student experience at CCCUâ but also âsupports the teaching and research of staff magnificentlyâ as illustrated in the following anecdotes: Recently, I tried to buy an obscure, almost out of print book on Elizabeth I from a) Amazon and b) the Publisher to no avail (they only had three copies and couldnât find them). The CCCU bookshop was the only outlet that found me a copy, I rest my case. I know that I can ask for a book that the library do not stock and you can find it and have it âin Houseâ within days. This makes my work more research focused, more up to date and more effective. It is something I particularly value, even if I am not sure of the title and only know I need a book by Husserl!! Only this morning I was approached after class by an anxious international student who needed some reading guidance and wanted titles recommended to her. I was able to walk her into the bookshop and put the appropriate volumes straight into her hand. Problem solved."
223,394,0.99,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Orientation in Unencrusted Space The second feature that contributed to uncertainty is what we call unencrustedness of the space. By unencrustedness we mean that the room did not retain traces of the production of our previous sessions, that it was free of vestiges that might orient later groups in defining their task and shaping their expectations about the outcome. Unencrustedness was not a feature of the space itself but rather reflected an interaction between a decision of the convener-researchers, the physical space, and the participants. We had considered the option of leaving the products of previous groupsâ work in the room, of preserving changes they had made in the roomâs design, and/or of actually incorporating their suggestions for how the room should be used. Adopting any of those possibilities would have meant that each new group entering the studio would have been faced with evidence of the knowledge that had emerged from the previous groupâs engagement with the task. A group could have ignored this material or could have done something quite different, but it would still have been doing its work in the context of previous work and under its influence. Such an approach would have meant conceiving of the experiment as shaping the space through a cumulative, historical process in which each group, at least in part, interpreted and built on what earlier groups had done. We decided against this option because our guidelines called for leaving each group as much freedom as possible in determining how they would think and act in this space. Encrusting the space might have constrained the range of future possible ways of using the room. Of course, the space still had a history. Indeed, two of the participants remembered that the space had been an open stage, and its now closed structure saddened them."

Not having to make certain decisions and not being held responsible for oneâs actions to the full account also provide protection, and children would be overburdened if they were granted the full range of rights and duties as adults. Children lack the competencies and autonomy to make many decisions for themselves and to know what is best for them, their actual wellbeing and their future well-being. Such a justification of partial paternalism toward children, which decreases as they grow up and become more mature, is widely acknowledged, although there is significant disagreement about the justificatory bases of paternalism and how far it should go; for example, in regard to teenagers and adolescents who show (nearly) the same competences as most adults (Archard 2004; Franklin-Hall 2013; Anderson and Claassen 2012). What such a developmental view of children, together with an acknowledgment of their agency, means for capability approach theory has already been fleshed out in some detail (Ballet, Biggeri and Comim 2011). In particular, the concept of evolving capabilities was introduced as a crucial conceptual extension to the prevalent terminology. Evolving capabilities include the dynamic aspect of the development of capabilities and explicitly link the personâs abilities, achievements and circumstances at different points in time: The process of capability expansion or of evolving capabilities starts from an initial set of achieved functionings of the child at time tn. The process of resource conversion is very much affected by how different institutions, norms and cultures constrain or empower them, shaping the formation of a new set of functionings and capabilities that are inter-temporally distinct. The childâs capability set (opportunity freedom, i.e. the vector of potential valuable and achievable functionings) is thus given by the resources/constraints, by his or her limited opportunities and by his or her own abilities. From the multidimensional capability set the choice will determine the vector of new achieved functionings at time tn+1. The dynamic process is going to be influenced by feedback loops if seen as taking place in sequential periods of time. [ ... ] The emotional and cognitive development of children goes through different stages in which their decision making and agency is shaped by their life experiences and mimicking behaviour. (Ballet, Biggeri and Comim 2011, 34) The concept of evolving capabilities thus grasps the fact that capabilities change over time according to different factors. The already introduced"
56,38,0.99,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"âpuzzleâ would risk dehumanising and trivialising what can be a highly fraught situation. From time to time the human drama of the hostel residentsâ lives is the subject of public discourse and controversy in France. Headlines like âImmigration: the forgotten hostelsâ (Decugis 1998; authorâs translation);20 âThe refuge of the uprootedâ (Guyotat 2004; authorâs translation); and âForgotten, more and more immigrants are growing old alone in Franceâ (Bernard 1999; authorâs translation) give an indication of the tenor of this discourse. Other articles note with alarm that the Sonacotra hostels are âtransforming into retirement homesâ (Serafini 1999; authorâs translation), or worse, mouroirs â a pejorative term implying a refuge of last resort, where one goes to die (Guyotat 2004; Decugis 1998). Such headlines are the inspiration in part for the interrogation found in the title to this book, Retirement Home? This interrogation works on several levels. Firstly, it speaks to the question of whether the hostels constitute an appropriate living space for older people: can we really consider the hostel to be a retirement home like any other? Secondly, it speaks to the difficult question the men face at retirement: to return home definitively or not? Thirdly, in this book I question what retirement means for these ageing migrants and find that in several ways their passage to retirement does not correspond to normative expectations of later life, be it in France or in places of origin. Finally, I conclude by asking what âhomeâ can mean for the hostel residents: are they âhomelessâ everywhere, as the more pessimisticallyminded scholars conclude (e.g. Sayad 1999), or have they found home in new and unexpected places? Chapter 2 sets the scene, reviewing the history of the hostels and the relevant theoretical literature, before providing details of my multi-sited research design spanning France, Morocco and Senegal. At this stage I underline the importance of the concept of biography for this work. In Chap. 3 and thereafter, key elements of residentsâ biographies are characterised as deviating from the âstandardâ lifecourse expected by various welfare state institutions. Now that they are older and no longer working, the menâs biographies â recorded in documents such as passports, social security files and payslips â mediate their difficult relationship with the French state, notably in terms of social security benefits and healthcare. Accessing these two goods is a principal rationale for the retired hostel residentsâ preference for the va-et-vient over definitive return, as is elaborated in Chaps. 3 and 4 respectively. Many social security benefits are subject to minimum residence conditions. Administrators at various state agencies seek to territorially âfixâ and temporally âtimetableâ the hostel residents through strategies such as passport checks, tax declarations, and targeted fraud investigations. With healthcare, the betterquality, subsidised services available in France mean that it is the preferred location for most treatments. This implies that a large burden of care falls on the French welfare state, since the men have no family in France to look after them. Instead, hostel residentsâ families are transnational. In Chap. 5, it is shown how fundamental these family ties are for respondents, as manifested in their remittance"

247,41,0.99,Humanities World Report 2015,"Employment of graduates is an important issue in discussions about education in the humanities and liberal arts. The claim is that humanities disciplines prepare students for the world of work, whatever that may turn out to be. For instance, they teach students how to scan large bodies of text and information to detect patterns; how to use language to persuade; how to evaluate and construct arguments. There are, of course, difficulties in measuring the economic impact of the humanities and these are discussed in Chapter 5. A few of our interviewees took up the economic argument: E6: I would try to persuade the audience that people with degrees from the humanities have acquired (unique?) transferable skills that may be very useful in a much wider context than in professions where such degrees are directly relevant. In the humanities we study and interpret human behaviour as manifested by singular events â historical battles, works of art, all kinds of texts, etc. â and try to integrate them into larger patterns in order to understand them as well as possible. This is very different from what one does in the sciences, where the aim is to establish generalisations that, without exception, hold over a range of phenomena. Such singular events are what our lives are made up of, and the ability to interpret and understand them is therefore important at almost every workplace, of course in combination with more specialised knowledge. As5: If you fund humanities studies, you develop analytical skills and a definite philosophy in life which help you in any profession eventually.

A conspicuous appeal to the economic value of the humanities has been made by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council, which has embraced the argument wholeheartedly.15 Strong arguments in favour of the economic value of the humanities to the creative and cultural sectors have also been made by Scandinavian and EU reports.16 However, the economic argument has provoked a backlash among other humanities scholars. A number of prominent figures in the UK have founded the Council for the Defence of British Universities (CDBU) partly to promote an understanding of the broader value of universities (not just in the humanities).17 A recent national report on humanities and social"

In the first weeks and months after March 11, I could hardly bear to think about or look at trees, leaves, and dirt, wondering how much cesium had been absorbed into all the plants living and breathing between Tohoku and Tokyo and beyond. And although this acute sense of dread gradually faded, it was not because the cesium disappeared, but simply the lessening of a sense of crisis with the passing of time.

A broader framework, however, placing ï¬eld theory in a larger social science context, would be highly desirable. Only a few generations ago, about all that existed of âpolitical scienceâ was what we now call leadership theory, public policy and administration, and political philosophy. Psychology was dominated by the psychoanalysis schools inspired by Freud and behavior conditioning theories of Pavlov and Skinner. Crowd psychology, especially mob psychology (Le Bon) hinted at a crude form of ï¬eld theory. But so far as I can see presently, it was the insight of Adam Smith and the dynamic âinvisible handâ of the market place (the idea that the behavior of individuals and communities in interaction had a dynamic of their own that needed to be understood as distinct from individual psychology or crowd dynamics), that ushered in a third âlevel of analysis,â the system level. Today, of course, there is wide acceptance of the insights by Singer (1961) and othersâ that at least three analytic levels (individual, organizational or bureaucratic, and systemic) are needed in international relations theory, each with their own structures and functions. But even today, there is no systematic effort to integrate them into a multi-level theory, not to mention to follow the work of Richardson to examine longer term multi-nation dynamics.

How much the families use this opportunity varies. In one Danish municipality, only 56% of students attended their local schools; while in Norwegian municipalities, more than 90% of students attended their local schools. In Norway, the main motivation for selecting a nonproï¬t school are the special services they offer. For the religion-based nonproï¬t schools, the view of this parent is typical: âThe Christian influence and the values we have, they get them both at school and at home; the values we have, they get them at school alsoâ (Interview, parent, nonproï¬t school, Norway). The other schools, which have alternative approaches to teaching as their basis, point to their holistic approach to each student and relaxed approach to testing and competition as examples of their special qualities. At the same time, there was a large minority of families whose choices were not determined by the schoolsâ conceptual framework. Rather, they actively make a choice away from the public schools. These families shared a negative experience with the public schools, and approached nonproï¬t schools as a last resort. One mother gives a telling example about her daughter: She has had some difï¬culty concentrating throughout her schooling.

378,88,0.99,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"concepts in the second and third column of this table can best be understood by remembering that they were born in an era when â¢ the emphasis lay on the human intellect and its capacity to dissect complex processes and investigate them empirically; â¢ natural scientism and its law-like predictions of developments replaced religion as the prime source of explanations of the world; â¢ discourse around natural limits to population size met an energy revolution that fuelled the managerial-industrial drive to improve productivity; and â¢ the securing of private property and pursuit of self-interest became basic tenets of citizensâ freedom and were declared important drivers of progress. Modernity and neoclassical economic developments of the twentieth century have continued to employ the same mechanistic-additive view and basic concepts, pushing quantiï¬ed modeling and its extrapolating predictions into yet more dominance when computation made massive calculations possible. There is no emphasis on a deep or diversiï¬ed understanding of the ends that transactions should serve (human need satisfaction) or the scarce means that are required (natureâs resources). These are subsumed into the container terms âutilityâ and â(natural) capital.â This is in line with Robbinsâ deï¬nition and understandable when reflecting back on the context in which these concepts were born. Saturation with goods and services was reserved for a very small part of the population and poverty was widespread. It was rational to equate more with better. Meanwhile, in a world of one billion people with plenty of âundiscoveredâ territories, there was simply no expectation that more effective exploitation of nature would threaten its health and existence. From a transformation point of view it is thus easily understood why the Enlightenment movement claimed the term âliberalismâ: its ideas inspired collective action toward overcoming an old system that no longer delivered (as far as Enlightenment protagonists were concerned). The premise was to overcome the âdarkâ epoch of the Middle Ages. These ideas were key aspects of a paradigm shift that ï¬rst challenged the old order and its legitimizing narrative and later, as Polanyi showed, served as the gelling consensus between philosophers, scientists, businessmen, politicians and even church representatives working on alternative institution-building and rule-formulation. Polanyi also concluded that imagining all of society as one big market system and treating humans, nature, and money as ï¬ctitious commodities inevitably leads to sustainability problems. So here we come to an interesting question: if Robbins says that the application of economic concepts should be limited to situations of exchanges and choice making but Polanyi argues that all aspects of the planet have been subsumed under the imaginary and logic of a market system, where does the application of economics end? Having analyzed current discourse and observed the marketization and privatization trends of the last 30 years I would say that their application is almost ubiquitousâand that is precisely the problem. It means that neither ends nor means become the center of attention and investigation. Instead, it focuses only on the choice-making of selï¬shly calculating and insatiable individuals.

234,183,0.99,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"account for this qualitative difference between types of action goals, the authors deï¬ne âinnovative intentionalityâ as âthe will to conceive or imagine realities with the purpose of making them effectiveâ (CaÃ±ibano et al. 2006: 319). Economic agents, as individuals or organisations, can in turn be qualiï¬ed as operating with higher or lower levels of innovative intentionality. This approach and the weighting given to intentionality as the key driver can be contrasted both with the behavioural science model and, as MuÃ±oz et al. explain, with the economic literature which, âargues that knowledge is the only foundation of capabilitiesâ (2011: 194). For MuÃ±oz et al., economic evolution (systemic change) does not come about as a result of the growth of knowledge per se. Intention, not capability, is the starting point. The concepts that immediately captured our imagination and resonated most starkly with our experience in Uganda included the explicit engagement with agency and the emphasis the model places on existing knowledge. Learning is not something that happens to people as passive actors/ victims (or empty vessels) but something that is essentially relational, interactive and cumulative. The individuals concerned are not devoid of (or lacking in) knowledge per se; indeed, it is their experiential (tacit and highly contextualised) knowledge â âtheir perceived realitiesâ â that shapes their response to new learning and imported knowledge. Agency is explicitly recognised in this model, which assumes that âhumans have sufï¬cient intelligence and incentives to anticipate and avoid the selection effectsâ associated with evolutionary, Darwinian theories (MuÃ±oz et al. 2011: 194 citing; Witt 2004: 128). This approach to intentionality helps us to see motivation as contextualised and as much about extrinsic as it is about intrinsic factors. In the ï¬rst instance, health workers are heterogeneous and this heterogeneity is ânot only a matter of differences in knowledge [or innate ability], but also of differences in action goals and intentionsâ (CaÃ±ibano et al. 2006: 319) and their subjective responses to means (opportunities) or plans will shape their approach to new learning. Furthermore, a health workerâs motivation will vary over time and space and in relation to diverse plans. A person, according to this model, cannot be placed on a linear motivationâdemotivation or innate intelligence continuum: their degree of motivation will necessarily vary according to speciï¬c plans (places, conditions and relationships). Seeing motivation as fundamentally contextdriven helpfully removes some of the essentialising (and potentially racist) elements of the behavioural science model."
332,4,0.99,"Media Resistance : Protest, Dislike, Abstention","I would customarily refute claims that television was bad, being more interested in the actual operations of television institutions in society. Then two things happened that (re-)kindled my interest in media resistance. I became dean of a diverse humanities faculty in the 2000s and experienced ï¬rst-hand the deep ambivalence many in the humanities feel towards the media and media studies. There was still a sense that mass media objects were not worthy of academic attention, and that the discipline was slightly suspect, too celebratory and getting too much attention. The second thing that happened was social media. After an initial warm welcome, online and social media began to provoke diverse expressions of resistance. In the 2010s, complaints began to pop up in conversations that reminded me of the anti-television stance of my childhood. As statements and confessionals about invasive media proliferated, the labels customarily used by media scholars and liberals to describe media resistance, of âmedia panicâ and âtechnophobiaâ did not really seem to ï¬t. In an era of ubiquitous media, it seems like we all need a measure of resistance, or at least a strategy for self-regulation, to keep our engagement with media in check. And so the tables keep turning. I have written this book because I am curious about those who resist, and how media resistance is sustained as a powerful presence in our culture. I have also written it because I believe that media studies should devote more attention to expressions and acts of resistance, how they connect, persist and change."
37,28,0.99,The Making of Islamic Heritage : Muslim Pasts and Heritage Presents,"I believe this perspective to be truer to the nature of the development of ideas and practices pertaining to Islam. Read in this way, the mosque approximates to the trove of narrative materials pertaining to the past that has amassed over the course of more than a millennium. The density and variety of evidence available at the site of the Friday mosque in Isfahan makes it a case exceptional for its richness. However, I would like to suggest that principles regarding Islamic pasts that I have highlighted using it as an example are applicable more generally to materials and sites large and small. The ultimate point here is that heritage is an evaluative concept and is based on assessments of worth. Not all things from the past constitute heritage in all circumstances, and the ones that do differ between times and places. When assessing evidence pertaining to Islam, I suggest that we should begin with the presumption that Islamic understandings of the past are variable, both synchronically and diachronically. Traces at our disposal indicate a tremendous variety of ways of being and acting as Muslim. The diversity of meanings on display here has been inherent in Islamic discourses for all the contexts for which we have evidence. In tandem with these facts, Islamic valuations of heritage are also fundamentally diverse and changeable. As we can see in the case of the inï¬uence of the prestige of Italian restorers and modern organizations such as UNESCO, Islamic understandings need not be seen as exclusive or hermetic. Rather, the notion of heritage itself requires historicization in all contexts, which reveals investments held by us as well as people who created earlier material forms. I believe this perspective attunes us to pay the utmost attention to the particularities of the evidence we encounter while simultaneously avoiding reiï¬cation and being mindful of shadows cast by interpretive paradigms old and new. Appreciating and creating heritage are closely related, if not synonymous, matters, something that is as true today as it was for Muslims of the past whose effects we scrutinize to create our narratives."

A detailed understanding of the target audience can inform the development of a tailored mix of engagement approaches that are well matched and aligned.

And what are the consequences of this on a figurationâs relevance frames? Based on the research discussed so far, we can assume a number of possible consequences as a hypothetical set: the optionality, contingency and chances of participation in social domains might increase; social domainsâ communicative figurations might extend spatially; their borders might blur; there might be an acceleration and increasing immediacy within and across them; a disguise of agency might come about; media technology might stabilize sociality in social domains; social surveillance might take place; or all might result in segmentation, exclusion and division. While these assumed consequences are a starting point for future research, it remains an open question as to which of them is characteristic for which social domain, how these different consequences interfere with each other and even if there might be further consequences we are not aware of at present. In addition, we have to consider the different ways in which social domains relate to these trends in deep mediatizationâs changing media environment. They can be supportive of such changes, for example by always appropriating the latest media. Alternatively, by rejecting certain media, they can hinder these trends. For any empirical research, we need to have the dual character of possible consequences in mind. On the one hand, a changing media environment might have âinternalâ consequences for a social domainâ for example, optionality, disguise of agency or segmentation of figuration might take place.

13,323,0.99,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"There is much less desire involved in the descriptions of sexual encounters among the women, and their characterisations are actually not so different from the ones given by the women in the middle generation. Many of them depict their first time as a painful affair, involving blood and horror, while others laconically state that it was no great experience. In addition to Eva, who proclaimed that âsex is funâ, only Stine, who also had a painful first time, actually describes sexual excitement where âthe bodies live togetherâ. When feelings enter the picture, women still tend to talk about sexual experiences in relational terms, as the ultimate intimacy, sometimes as a testimony to their erotic power over the boyfriend, in addition to being a way to feel grown-up. The sexual experience itself is not highlighted, and we recognise some of the instrumentality from the women of the previous generation, although not as explicitly. The question is whether explicit sexual desire is still defined as a masculine affair even though both norms and practices are more degendered and individualised. Does this imply a gendered inertia when it comes to questions of the body and sexuality that seem to go slower or even resist other degendering processes?"

269,171,0.99,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"(not least the neurosciences), we throw our lot in with those disciplines â that we are, in other words, co-producers of the very epistemic power from which we claim to distance ourselves (Cooter 2011, 2014). Worse (we caricature here): the sciences with which we are entangled have been the source of deleterious discourses on, for example, race, class, and gender; that scholars in the social sciences and humanities had long built up a conceptual armature to counteract such discourses; and that by mingling those concepts with the methods and theories of the neurosciences, people like us actually evacuate the space for such critical work. To the extent that people become raced, gendered, and classed subjects through particular relations of power, and to the extent that scientific research has bolstered and solidified such relations (especially when it is increasingly licensed to talk about social life) â then our dirge for subjugation starts to look hollow indeed. This is a vexed and serious critique that we cannot do justice to here. It is undeniably true that neuroscientific research has been mobilized in deeply problematic ways (we say âmobilizedâ to gesture at the frequent distance between research in the laboratory and its diverse applications). There is now an extensive body of research on the effects of neuroscientific discourses on policy, especially as that policy has been brought to bear on predominantly working-class and ethnic minority families (e.g. Edwards, Gillies and Horsley 2015; Lee, Macvarish and Lowe 2014; Pykett 2015). There is an even more prominent discourse about neuroscience and gender, which is often self-consciously essentializing (e.g. BaronCohen 2003) â resulting in popular claims that are, as the psychologist Cordelia Fine has pointed out, sometimes âspuriousâ or âmisinterpretedâ (Fine 2010, 283). âThe imaginative readerâ, Fine goes on, will not have too much difficulty envisaging how, by reinforcing stereotypes, such claims may affect peopleâs social attitudes in ways that oppose progress toward greater gender equality, just as such claims did in the past.

116,93,0.99,Moral Reasoning At Work : Rethinking Ethics in organizations,"Moral dissonance occurs when there is an absence of what Rawls (1971) calls reflective equilibrium. His assumption is that when we make moral judgments about a particular issue, we compare them with what we more generally consider morally right and wrong in such situations. We seek coherence between the moral beliefs about the particular situation and the general moral beliefs we have about how one ought to behave in such situations. The principle of equality guides us in reflections of this kind, as we try to achieve internal balance and equilibrium. When there is a breakdown in this attempt to reconcile the particular and the general, we can feel and experience moral dissonance. Temptation is not necessarily involved in moral dissonance. Participants in Milgramâs experiment on obedience to authority experienced an intense moral discomfort in obeying orders to inflict pain on another human being (Milgram 1963, 1974). They, too, faced moral dissonance, a clash between their moral convictions and the moral aspect of what they were ordered to do. Who are the people who normally experience moral dissonance? In teaching sessions, Nigel Krishna Iyer and I have approached this question by placing them in the middle between two kinds of people who are not bothered by this particular kind of cognitive dissonance:  The moral saint: A person who hardly ever does anything morally"
117,257,0.99,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Depersonalization Versus Care As demonstrated, there are a number of depersonalizing aspects stemming from regulation that should worry a caregiver. With this, I do not want to assert that regulation is intentionally drafted to generate depersonalizing effects. I do not want to claim either that seclusion leads to depersonalization in the sense that caregivers necessarily act in an inhumane way. What I do maintain, however, is that (wrongfully dealing with) certain aspects of regulation might unintentionally obscure care and that this might at least give the patient a feeling of being depersonalized (see, e.g. Meehan et al. 2004). The possibly depersonalizing effect of regulation stands out against the background of Trontoâs phased practice of care (Tronto 1993, pp. 100â126). First, care requires noticing the need to care [Caring About]. Regulation might distract caregivers from this need. A focus on dangerâthe patient must be undressed, observed and guardedâimplies deviating from the reason for a patientâs presence in the hospital, restoring the self. Legally, the moral element of attentiveness (needs) is reduced to alertness (danger) (Bowden 1997, pp. 113â114; Jacob and Holmes 2011; Tronto 1993, pp. 134â135). Second, caregivers must assume responsibility for the needs they have noticed [Taking Care Of ]. If a caregiver believes there is nothing to do about it, the patient is not taken care of.

As he wrote: âIt is when [the two] converge and rush together that a spark of genuine illumination is certain.â21 Crichton-Browneâs advice has continuing relevance to the history of psychiatry: we need the patients and the doctors, the social and the scientiï¬c, in order to have a fuller insight into asylums and their work.

136,18,0.99,Principles and Practice of Case-Based Clinical Reasoning Education : a Method For Preclinical Students,"possess a mental library of illness scripts to facilitate System 1 thinking, those teachers teach something they usually do not do themselves when solving clinical problems This teaching resembles the âdo as I say, not as I doâ approach, in part because they simply cannot express âhow they doâ when they engaged in clinical reasoning. In a recent review of approaches to the teaching of clinical reasoning, Schmidt and Mamede identified two groups of approaches: a predominant serial-cue approach (teachers provide bits of patient information to students and ask them to reason step by step) and a rare whole-task (or whole-case) approach in which all information is presented at once. They conclude that there is little evidence for the serial-cue approach, favored by most teachers and recommend a switch to wholecase approaches (Schmidt and Mamede 2015). While cognitive theory does support whole-task instructional techniques (Vandewaetere et al. 2014), the description of a whole-case in clinical education is not well elaborated. Evidently a whole-case cannot include a diagnosis and must at least be partly serial. But even if all the information that clinicians in practice face is provided to students all at once, the clinical reasoning process that follows has a serial nature, even if it happens quickly. Schmidt and Mamedeâs proposal to first develop causal explanations, second to encapsulate pathophysiological knowledge, and third to develop illness scripts (Schmidt and Mamede 2015) runs the risk of separating biomedical knowledge acquisition from clinical training and regressing to a Flexnerian curriculum. Flexner advocated a strong biomedical background before students start dealing with patients (Flexner 1910). This separation is currently not considered the most useful approach to clinical reasoning education (Woods 2007; Chamberland et al. 2013). Training students in the skill of clinical reasoning is evidently a difficult task, and Schuwirth rightly once posed the question âCan clinical reasoning be taught or can it only be learned?â (Schuwirth 2002). Since the work of Elstein and colleagues, we know that clinical reasoning is not a skill that is trainable independent of a large knowledge base (Elstein et al. 1978). There simply is not an effective and teachable algorithm of clinical problem solving that can be trained and learned, if there is no medical knowledge base. The actual reasoning techniques used in clinical problem solving can be explained rather briefly and may not be very different from those of a car mechanic. Listen to the patient (or the car owner), examine the patient (or the car), draw conclusions, and identify what it takes to solve the problem. There is not much more to it. In difficult cases, medical decision-making can require knowledge of Bayesian probability calculations, understanding of sensitivity and specificity of tests (Kassirer et al. 2010), but clinicians seldom use these advanced techniques explicitly at the bedside. These recommendations are of no avail if students do not have background knowledge, both about anatomical structures and pathophysiological processes and about patterns of signs and symptoms related to illness scripts. When training medical students to think like doctors, we face the problem that we cannot just look how clinicians think and just ask students to mimic that technique. That is for two reasons: one is that clinicians often cannot express well how they think, and the second"

166,336,0.99,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"2.1 Reasons for Using an Online Social Network in a Study on Youth Transitions The assumption that a majority of young adults in Switzerland uses online social networks was one of the key reasons why we decided to use this method. In contrast to standardized questionnaires, an online network would give participants the opportunity to express themselves via a media they are supposedly comfortable with and used to. And as we are particularly interested in more vulnerable populations, this option seemed even more important: Instead of frightening off (or boring) participants with standardized questions, we wanted to give them the possibility to participate in the study with the method they often use to communicate with others. A second major reason to use an online social network was its flexibility as a method of data collection. Participants can use the network whenever they want for as long as they want. This permits a completely flexible time schedule both for participants and for researchers. Participants could âtalkâ about their experiences as soon as they happen instead of several weeks or months later (when researchers happen to collect data). This immediacy might minimize recall effects, which are often particularly strong for emotional experiences (Thomas and Diener 1990). The same way that participants can choose freely when to use the network, researchers can use the network flexibly to ask questions and stimulate discussions at different time points. The flexibility of networks is not limited to the temporal aspect, but also extends to the format of the data collection. Researchers can post closed and open-ended questions, invite participants for one-item-polls, invite discussions on specific topics and so on. The network thus offers a more flexible way to study different topics than questionnaires and interviews typically allow. A third advantage of the online social network is the ease of contacting the participants. Our participants are young adults who experience many life transitions, like starting a new school or job, moving out of the parental home or moving in"

In the meantime, we have seen overviews of more than 100 initiatives to develop natural capital methodologies, all outside the LCA community, all reinventing the wheel and forgetting that the very first serious impact assessment method based on monetization was developed by Bengt Steen in 1989. The big idea is to develop metrics that are understood by the CFO (chief financial officer) and CEO (chief executive officer). Developing metrics that assure results are compelling for the business is probably something the LCA community could learn from. Another development which is largely missed by the LCA community is the methodology developed by the sustainability consortium. They started out developing an LCA based method to assess products on a large scale, but failed to do so. Therefore, they switched to a procedure that focuses on hotspots and improvement opportunities in the lifecycle. This shift seems to be working very well and we should learn from this. Coming from another angle, but with the same core idea to make results more meaningful and also to give guidance to the management is the recent discussion to link metrics to planetary boundaries. One idea is to develop a âplanetary boundary enabled LCA methodâ. The Stockholm Resilience institute identified eight planetary boundaries, or levels of impacts we should not pass. Initiated by Unilever, a âplanetary boundary enabled LCA methodâ is being developed by a group of experts led by the University of Surrey, with the involvement of Unilever."
252,125,0.99,The Ethics of Vaccination,"are clean? Notice that I am not arguing here against Brennanâs claim that vaccination should be compulsory, nor am I interested in how a libertarian could justify compulsory vaccination while remaining libertarian. Actually, I might even agree with Brennanâs claim that âthe libertarian must endorse something like the clean hands principle, and, further, must accept in some cases it is permissible to use coercion against the individuals who constitute the collective performing the rights violation or causing the harmâ (Brennan 2018, p. 42). Whether I would be prepared to endorse this claim depends on how we interpret the phrase âsomething like the clean hands principleâ. This phrasing is quite vague. What does it mean? Something like, but not exactly, the clean hands principle? If so, I agree with this quite vague formulation, although it is not a very informative one; my point is simply that the âclean handâ principle itself (not âsomething likeâ it) does not do the work Brennan wants it to do. One way to support the clean hand principle is simply dogmatic: keeping oneâs hands clean and not being moral accomplices of bad outcomes is good in and of itself, full stop. This is, for example, the approach that grounds the Catholic doctrine of the moral wrongness of formal cooperation in wrongdoing. Another possible approach could be considered deontological: getting oneâs hands dirty would violate some established ethical code. And there might be other ethical theories that can justify a moral obligation not to be accomplices in collective harms even when the individual contribution is negligible. Examples include contractualism (see, e.g., Giubilini et al. 2018), that is, roughly, the theory according to which we should act on the basis of principles that other people could not reasonably reject, or rule consequentialism, that is, the theory according to which everybody should follow those simple rules that, if followed by everyone else, would produce the best consequences, such as âbe vaccinatedâ. However, even if we want to accept any of these justifications (dogmatic, deontological, consequentialist, or contractualist) for the clean hand principle, they can hardly be taken to warrant the legal enforceability of a moral principle: some of them only concern the sphere of individual morality, and those that aim at informing policymaking (such as contractualism and perhaps some versions of rule consequentialism) require to commit to comprehensive moral theories that many people would not accept. In order to enforce a moral principle, the principle should ideally be one of those uncontroversially taken to have some relevance for policymaking, no matter what comprehensive moral theory one embraces."

118,576,0.99,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"17.2.2 The Role of Engineers in Democratic Societies, by Christian Di Sanzo, University of California, Berkeley After the Fukushima accident, the governments of Germany and Switzerland have planned a phase-out of nuclear energy, while France and U.S. have decided to have little or no debate on the publicâs concerns about nuclear energy. Other countries, such as Italy, have chosen the way of a national referendum on energy policy which led to halt of the nuclear program. What should be the role of engineers and what are its limitations in the decision making process? In simple terms, we could say that engineers should honestly evaluate the technological performance, technological costs, and the risks associated with the use of energy technologies. This information should be conveyed to policy makers who should use their judgment to evaluate the social/economic benefits and then choose a solution for the benefit of the public. However, in this process it is of crucial importance to understand the information that is conveyed by the engineers. An energy analysis always has some uncertainties, e.g., in the numerical data available and in the expected cost of technologies. Consequently, all analysis should be conveyed to the policy makers with the related uncertainties. However, since policy makers often do not have a complete (all energy) background, it is hard for them to understand the real meaning of uncertainties, and they could often, even unconsciously, use them to fuel their own personal hopes for renewable energy or personal passions favoring oil companies. During this process the engineers could step in as advisors to policy makers as it is often done. However, the experts could often be tempted to hide some uncertainties in some results and overstate the importance of uncertainties in other results during the advising process. In fact, each engineer is often specialized in his/her own field and consequently he/she will be more passionate regarding his/her own specialization, such as nuclear engineering. The creation of expert figures with broad backgrounds could help in this regard. However, the final decision is in the hands of policy makers who are limited in their understanding of uncertainties. We could ask what would happen if the decision is in the hands of engineers as in a technocratic form of society. The risk of this approach would be that engineers would downplay the social consequences and have overconfidence in technologies, which is the opposite effect (and potentially even more dangerous) of decision makers who overstate the social consequences and put confidence in technologies with low performance (such as renewables)."

I suspect that most of us remain not quite as optimistic as Wells in believing that the simple presence of a body of knowledge can help guide the world to a better future. We are sometimes told that if we build it, they will come, and however much we might want to believe that, itâs not a guarantee. Human nature rarely conforms to expectations. Yet we must all do what we can."
128,210,0.99,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"Finally, our survey includes some specific questions regarding social capital framework. According to the framework adopted by the OECD (Scrivens and Smith 2013), there are several dimensions of social capital. We focus here just on two aspects: social trust and personal relationships. The first refers to the measure based on the standard question: âGenerally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?â Trust is measured on a scale of 0 (minimum trust) to 10 (maximum trust). In order to make crosstabulations more readable, we have recoded this variable by considering values between 0 and 4 as absence of trust in others, 5 as neutral position, and, finally, those between 6 and 10 as trust in others. The second aspect of social capital refers to the âstructure and nature of peopleâs personal networksâ (Scrivens and Smith 2013, p. 21) and is concerned with whom people know and what they do to establish and maintain"
379,2,0.99,"Tobacco Control Policy in The Netherlands : Between Economy, Public Health, and Ideology","If one is lucky, at some point in oneâs life, things fall into place. The process of writing this book and doing research for it was such an experience. For me, writing a book about Dutch tobacco control policy was the next logical step after more than a quarter of a century of research into tobacco control. I started my academic career developing and studying smoking cessation interventions. In the 1990s I became frustrated by the fact that regardless how much attention and counselling smokers who try to quit receive, the majority of quitters relapse within a yearâmost in the first month after treatment. Realising that even a combination of the best and most intensive treatment does not produce success rates much higher than 30%, I turned to more fundamental questions: what makes cigarettes so addictive, and what can be done to motivate whole populations to quit smoking? In 1998 I started to work for the Stichting Volksgezondheid en Roken (Dutch Smoking or Health Foundation) (STIVORO), the national expert centre on tobacco control. This gave me first-hand knowledge of tobacco control in practice, and I gradually learned about the political aspects of tobacco control. My appointment as Professor in Tobacco Control Research at the Department of Health Promotion at Maastricht University gave me the opportunity to cross the bridge from tobacco"

This understanding of kindoki, which we can take as the official Branhamist Christian explanation of kindoki through television, is somewhat different from Awakening Churchesâ explanations of how media is positioned in spiritual warfare. For the latter, viewing experiences (emotional unrest, social discord, etc.) are said to be indicative of either divine or demonic powers, which audiovisual footage transmits. Born-Again Christians refer to the Spirit of Hatred (molimo ya likunya), Jealousy (molimu ya zuwa), Sexual Deviation (molimo ya kindumba), etc. which are transmitted through images of Harry Potter, wrestling shows, science fiction, and music video clips of worldly and folkloric music. Shouting out Jesusâs name and changing the channel to a Christian TV station are strategies that Pentecostals of the Awakening Churches deem powerful enough to counter the footageâs negative influence (Pype 2012). Many Branhamist Christians, such as Fabrice, his parents, his pastor, and his friend, eschew television. While Fabrice does have a TV set at home, his family does not watch any television stations. Rather, they use the set together with a DVD player to watch DVDs and videotapes of sermons delivered by Brother Branham. Fabrice is more lenient towards the telephoneâan object about which Brother Branham did not preach. Still, usage is monitored closely, and, according to Fabrice, the same logic that shapes ideas about the devilâs hand in the television set are at play with the smartphone. âGood usageâ is perceived as crucial. Yet, not everybody knows what this âgood usageâ entails, nor are there ready-made instructions about this. Confusion regarding the possibilities of new technologies thus renders these objects suspicious in a religious scheme."
91,160,0.99,"The Crisis For Young People : Generational inequalities in Education, Work, Housing and Welfare","The majority of adults in the UK are pessimistic about the prospects for young people and expect that they will do worse over their lifetimes than their parentsâ generation. An international survey conducted by MOrI in 2013 asked respondents: âTo what extent, if at all, do you think that todayâs youth will have had a better or worse life than their parents generation or will it be the same.â1 Amongst adults in Great Britain 54 percent responded âworseâ and only 20 percent âbetterâ. The majority were pessimistic and more so than in most other countries surveyed. But not all young people and not all adults generally see things is this way. The same survey showed 61 percent in Great Britain âoptimisticâ about the prospects âfor themselves and their familyâ over the coming year, with only 13 percent pessimistic. People in Britain tend to be more optimistic about their own future than the prospects for their social group in general. Our CELS survey results suggested that this was particularly true for young people. Better off respondents, not surprisingly, tend to be more optimistic than those worse off. Many better-off parents who are able to support their children through unpaid internships and help them to buy homes, will deplore the difficulties faced by young people in general but are less likely to see these in terms of generational inequalities. After all, they are doing their best to mitigate the problems within their own families, even though this does nothing to reduce the problems of the less fortunate young people, whose parents are in no position to help. So for many people, wherever they lie on the political spectrum, the problems faced by young people today are the familiar ones of social class inequalities, with growing agerelated inequalities being an additional but only temporary difficulty for young people. Their transitions to adult life will have been prolonged, but the lucky ones and the most âresilientâ will catch up in time. The perspective is familiar and somehow reassuring, but does not fully capture the gravity of what is happening to the relationship between generations. Where a generation, on average, is likely to do worse than its parentsâ generation across many key domains and over the whole life course, a very major historical shift is occurring, and one that is unprecedented at least for the last century. We expect each generation to do better than the last. If that is no longer the case, it puts in question our whole notion of historical progress and indeed the viability of the current social and political order. It not only breaches the tacit social contract between generations. It also castes into doubt the socio-economic system which is designed, among other things, to maintain this generational contract."

The theme of the project is âResearch into the Possibilities of Establishing Multicultural Societies in the Asia-Pacific Region: Conflict, Negotiation, and Migration.â Some of the chapters in this volume were initially published by the Centre in the form of working papers and research articles. Needless to say, all the chapters were substantially revised before this publication. Completion of this volume would not have been possible without the devoted support of the Centreâs staff members. Thus the editorsâ first thanks goes to the excellent support team of the Afrasian Research Centre, including Masako Otaki, postdoctoral fellow, and research assistants, Shincha Park, Tomoko Matsui, Takumi Honda, and Tomomi Izawa. We also express our gratitude to Yasuhito Okumura, Kyoko Iguchi, and Chiaki Yokoe for their help in administrative issues. In addition, we would also like to thank all the scholars and researchers who supported our research activities in research meetings, workshops, and international symposia in these three years for their stimulating intellectual interventions. In this context, we should specifically mention that we appreciate the personal and intellectual friendship with Prof. Koichi Iwabuchi who kindly agreed to contribute the foreword to this volume. We would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their suggestive and valuable comments. We should also mention the very valuable help provided by the Palgrave Macmillan publishing team, particularly Christina Brian and Ambra Finotello. They provided us with a very comfortable environment for the publication, and it was our great pleasure to work with them. Finally, we would like to thank the founding director of the Centre, Nobuko Nagasaki, Professor Emeritus of Ryukoku University whose sincere approach to striving for the truth has been continuously stimulating our intellectual lives. Although we are in no way certain that this volume would satisfy her high standards and scholarly judgment, we would like to dedicate this volume to her without question for her support and inspiration.

271,142,0.99,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"political goals to a great extent relates to prevailing social arrangements. The more media technologies and infrastructures find their way into peopleâs everyday lives, the more attentive citizens, media representatives and decision-makers are to actors who demonstrate and articulate reasonable engagement in relation to technical transformations. Gaining and maintaining legitimacy is something that is framed and conditioned by social realities. While legitimation can be at least partially secured through institutions such as the media, legitimacy is never simply mediated. In the case of the CCC, institutional politics react, amongst other things, to public pressure that is built up through a multi-layered media ensemble; which confirms that actors who receive preferred standing and are able to stabilize their appearances across the media environment over time tend to be considered trustworthy. Interestingly enough, this relationship also operates the other way round. Media representatives consider CCC members as legitimate voices and provide them access to their outlets owing to their regular interaction with institutional politics. Politicians, legislators and judges learn about the organizationâs engagement in part through the hackersâ outward oriented communication. As a consequence, they invite Club members to articulate their stance in particular contexts, such as committees, consultations and hearings. Owing to the Clubâs involvement in institutional politics, different media outlets regard the CCC as worth covering as well as worth granting access to. Media environments and institutional politics, each in their own way, mutually signify the CCCâs engagement before a wide public. As a consequence its virtuous role as a civil society organization that has something valuable to say about the political relevance of technical developments continues to be acknowledged, inscribed and stabilized. Throughout this process, the Club gains opportunities to illustrate its activities, articulate its objectives and politicize particular themes. This process is accompanied by the Clubâs regular direct digital actions that constantly demonstrate the hackersâ high level of technology-related skills, experience and knowledge. Overall, instead of linearity one needs to stress rotation and reciprocity as the defining processual dynamics that create an attribution process, whereby the narration âCCC hackers are the good onesâ emerges and stabilizes. This is not to say that this spiral of legitimation cannot go into reverse. Legitimacy is never definitively acquired and remains open to challenge and dependent on social perceptions (Rosanvallon 2011: 7). Similarly, it is understood that no political actor is (il)legitimate for 100%"

Superluminal Communication Superluminal communication is communication faster than the speed of light. Two apparently contradictory inferences seem to be able to be deduced concerning this.

117,328,0.99,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Discussion7 Can Care Receivers Be Both âCustomersâ and âPatientsâ? The first theme of the research interprets the tension regarding the identification of care receivers as customers and patients. According to the research, home-care nurses consider their care receivers âpatientsâ because this helps nurses provide a continuum of care with different organizations. Nevertheless, consumer sovereignty8 is usually taken into consideration in healthcare. It is reflected in nursesâ care activities in that they avoid putting pressure on patients. For instance, when a patient rejects a nurseâs offer of a nutrition consultantâs services, this approach to care is discontinued in practice. In this case, the logic of choice is at work and the care receiver is treated more like a customer than a patient. Since consumer sovereignty has high priority in the healthcare market, patients are often practically treated as customers and as citizens and choices are made following the patientsâ wishes (Ryl and Horch 2013). Nurses then have difficulties carrying out interventions against patientsâ will. As a nurse explained, âI cannot force anybody to do anythingâ (I-NN-05). Nurses often have to compromise, which may run counter to their professional awareness. While the understanding of care receivers as patients and of the value of the personâs wholeness is rooted in the identity of the nursing professional, the way nurses have to act is often contrary to this identity in practice. This contradiction can produce a moral tension in nursing work. It might lead to frustration with the caring process or damage the trust-relationship between nurses and patients. We will discuss these two themes later in the second and third sections."
363,104,0.99,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"would transform itself, in my five- or six-year old mind, into an empty wildernessâ (3). By analogy, even the space that we imagine belongs to ârealityâ is always already mapped. It is unavoidable. The novelâs attempt to represent the unpresentable, an empty reality, devoid of overarching pattern and meaning is therefore undermined or countered by the category of natural history, which naturalises the human condition and makes a continued desire for history, in the face of the problematisation of historical knowledge, a universal and timeless quality. Tomâs installation of natural history as a category of the real suggests that his empty reality does posit Truth, that of nature, in much the same way as Elias cannot avoid her metaphysical idea of âHistoryâ as that which is beyond what we live (the present) and remember (the past). Yet, whereas for Elias, the Truth that constitutes the historical sublime is âopposed to or other to, the materiality of lived historyâ (Elias, 2001: 53) the novel attempts to avoid a metaphysical positing of truth by making it material. Desire is the fundamental truth of human nature, just as the desire to return is the fundamental truth of natural history. Both these truths are firmly housed not in a metaphysical concept, however, but in the materiality of bodies and of nature. Committed to representing the late-twentieth century crisis of historiography, the novel nonetheless posits the continuing value of seeking historical knowledge, even if that knowledge is provisional. For reclaimed land is highly fertile. The Fens yield âfifteen tons of potatoes or nineteen sacks of wheat an acreâ (16). Similarly, the emptiness of reality, the absence of over-arching pattern and meaning, invites inscription, proliferates stories, which produce a multiplicity of meanings. These meanings are not guaranteed by a perspective outside of the stories themselves and, as such, are always open to revision, to new meanings. Indeed history-making is abundantly fertile. As we have seen, stories and things made to happen beget more stories and things made to happen, so that while âhistory itselfâ might be empty, historymaking is a swarming, irresistible fecundity. Often the stories produced in and by history-making are, like civilisation itself, âprecious. An artifice â so easily knocked down â but preciousâ (240). As Decoste observes, this celebration of civilisation does not equate to an Atkinson-like faith in progress, but rather, a belief in process. Civilisation is equated with ceaseless inquiry: for this artifice that keeps the void at bay is, for Crick, itself a process and not a final destination. The civilization that must be husbanded and ceaselessly renewed is, indeed, the operation of inquiry itself,"
378,242,0.99,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"For me it is not so much that we have to ï¬nd an alternative to freedom and prosperity, or even growth. We have to reclaim their meaning for a world with 9 billion instead of 1 billion people who have too little spiritual guidance rather than too much, and a degree of commodiï¬cation and homogenization in productive activities and consumption that limits need-satisfying possibilities rather than expanding them. In the midst of this, functioning as a great positive feedback for these trends, the next technological revolution, digitalization, is unfolding. With it comes an overturning of former standards of communication, speed, size, and reproducibility of goods and services. At the same time, knowledge and evidence about the dimensions of human impact on the pattern of oceans, greenery, and soils that make up the fragile ball of Earth has led to the emergence of a new term: the Anthropocene. The political, cultural and economic circumstances from which the Enlightenment movement sought liberation simply no longer exist. A Second Enlightenment in the twenty-ï¬rst century would seek liberation from very different types of totalitarianism and limitation to human potential. So which imaginary could progress, freedom, prosperity, and growth, the principles mentioned by Welzer, carry for the era of the Anthropocene? In my view both theory and practice reviewed in this book offer the tenets of the guiding ideas a Second Enlightenment could foster: â¢ Instead of being an output measured only by money, progress can mean the equitable and balanced progress of the whole SETS as measured by differentiated social, environmental, and cultural indicators. â¢ Instead of freedom meaning the absence of obstacles to individual purchasing desires, it can embody human security and sufï¬ciency: freedom from the fear of falling behind in the race for resource accumulation, and freedom from the culturally created endless want that impedes well-being. â¢ Instead of prosperity embodying ever more consumption choices, it can stand for a holistic and adaptive understanding of human needs and resilient access to diversiï¬ed need-satisï¬er strategies. â¢ Instead of economic growth being an end in itself, different types of economic output and activity grow, stay steady, or also de-grow as means to the end of securing well-being within Planetary Boundaries. Many of the SDGs and their targets speak to these principles, albeit with the exception of the dogmatic clinging to GDP growth and greater income for even the rich. Many say they are not speciï¬c or binding enough. But in system innovation strategies, it is more important to map where not to go (anymore) and then outline"

198,87,0.99,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"overnight. This takes time; in fact the impact assessment done at the end of the project asked for âadequate timeâ to pass and for a stable situation to be achieved before impact is assessed (Ittyerah et al. 2005, p. xv). And if individual projects need adequate time to have an impact, it follows that market change can only be observed and measured over even longer stretches of time. Longer time lapses are well known in environmental circles and on environmental impact, as HildeÌn (2009) and Rowe (2014, 54â55) have pointed out, but they tend to be less associated with market change. The slow pace of market change is more often observed with impatience, raising the question why no change is happening, which led Wâ¬orlen (2014) in her study of climate mitigation evaluations to reformulate the âtheory of changeâ approach to a âtheory of no change approachâ that focuses on a better understanding of market barriers and how they can be overcome. In general environmental boundaries do not follow jurisdictional boundaries. One ecosystem may spread over several countries, and one country may have several ecosystems. Rowe (2012) asked attention for the fact that location may differ conceptually and practically between a social and economic system that is targeted for change and an ecosystem that is influenced through the same intervention or action. But this is not only an issue of different locations of systems, but also of scope of an intervention: it may be focused on a direct impact in the villages in which it is implemented, while other areas are still outside the scope of the project or have not yet been approached by suppliers, or invited to participate by State or Federal government. It is an issue of scale when impact needs to be observed at several levels: that of energy supply and demand, of greenhouse gas emissions related to energy, of greenhouse gas emissions including deforestation and alternative sources of energy, of livelihood and financial resources issues in the villages, of hilly rural areas in general, and perhaps somewhat more removed, whether greenhouse gas emissions in India are positively influenced by what happens in remote hilly areas. The last does not seem likely, and it may lead to a feeling of disenchantment â if it does not help India, it does not help the world, and it does not stop climate change.3 But that was the reason the project was co-funded by the Global Environment Facility in the first place! Scale is not easily defined. It seems clear that while interventions or actions move from one actor to multiple, from one location to many, from a âlocalâ to a ânationalâ or even âglobalâ level that moving up scales is involved, but scales can also be understood in terms of different dimensions or sectors. Kennedy et al. (2009) recognises jurisdictional and management dimensions as different scales, and Bruyninckx (2009) asks attention for overlap and discrepancies between social, economic, environmental and spatial scales. Yet even though there is no universal agreement on how scales should be defined or what their boundaries are,"
78,278,0.99,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"Hence, in order to really enable and support epistemic responsibility it would be essential to revise and amend current the RRI guidelines by adding new guiding thoughts such as the following: 1. Acknowledge the interrelation of epistemology, ethics and ontology: knowing, doing and being are interrelated, i.e. our processes of knowing have effects on what can be done and what we areâand vice versa. 2. Keep in mind the deep socio-technical entanglement of contemporary epistemic practices: Within our practices of knowing, we depend upon other human and non-human agents just as much as these other agents depend on us. 3. Bear in mind that epistemic relations are power relations: Within socio-technical epistemic systems, different epistemic agents, human as well as non-human agents, such as algorithms, are equipped with different amounts of power. 4. â¦ etc Thus, if revised appropriately, RRI could provide guidance on how to act responsibly in research and innovation as particularly knowledge-intense domains. Yet epistemic practices exist beyond research and governance supporting epistemic responsibility accordingly has to be expanded beyond advice or regulations regarding research and innovation. Each and every one of us has to assume epistemic responsibility for the things we claim to know in our everyday life as well. When and whom should we trust to know about climate change, about the war on terrorism or just about the latest unemployment numbers? How vigilant do we have to be when accepting information received from various on- and offline sources? While these are challenges that we all face on a daily basis, they also pose challenges for the governance of socio-technical epistemic systems. In a computational age characterized by ever more powerful personalization and profiling techniques assuming epistemic responsibility becomes much harder, because we may neither be able to decide which information we receive nor which information is received about us. After all, how can we be responsible knowers if we cannot assess how trustworthy our sources of knowledge are? Without denying the utility of personalized services, in order to act epistemically responsible in an age of extensive profiling and personalization, we need the possibility to access, understand and to even trick the systems which are accessing, understanding and potentially tricking us. As Mireille Hildebrandt stresses in her contribution, we need to develop âfirst (â¦) human machine interfaces that give us unobtrusive intuitive access to how we are being profiled, and, second, a new hermeneutics that allows us to trace at the technical level how the algorithms can be âreadâ and contestedâ (Hildebrandt 2013). We need policies addressing more broadly the challenges related to distributed epistemic responsibility in a hyperconnected reality, policies to set the parameters for an environment where individuals can act responsibly, i.e. where they can both assume and attribute responsibility even if they are deeply socio-technically entangled. To conclude: in the long run, it will be essential to develop a concept of epistemic responsibility that can account for the responsibilities of various differently empowered agents within entangled socio-technical epistemic systems. Moreover,"
13,400,0.99,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"(2009: 47) argues, masculinity is here constructed outside of shared recognition and bears the stain of the unmarked position. However, the men also want to defend their mothers as âotherâ and take care of her as strong men should. According to Benjamin (1995: 102), such attitudes of paternal protectiveness may also indicate latent maternal identifications. The weak mother in need of male protection is in particular seen in the accounts of the men who grew up in working-class and rural families. The mother is acknowledged more as a separate person in the interview with the one middle-class male informant we have in this generation. In the middle generation the mother is more visible. She is described as someone who had deserved to get more out of life, but she is seen as a kind, capable and caring person. She is not described with the joy and pride that is seen in the older and younger generation when sons talk about their fathers, but rather as âthe mother blanketâ (Holter and Aarseth 1993: 93). However, there is much less disidentification with feminine weakness in this generation of sons: the mother is not only a kind and warm person, she also does important things in the eyes of her sons in terms of her emotional competence and availability. The mother is primarily a love object, but in a limited sense is also a âlike subjectâ (Benjamin 1995). We may in this respect see traces of what Ken Corbett identifies as an internalised motherâson dialogue, which âoffers solace in the face of normative cruelty, and holds out the hope these boys need to imagine themselves otherwiseâ (2009: 114). Yet, the sonsâ sense of being different from her may have protected them from feeling overwhelmed by her services, as is more often the situation for the daughters. The sons of this generation identify as men, but since it is not clear what this implies or whether it is seen as something to strive for, this aspect of their gendered selves becomes less positive. The absent fathers also seem to give the masculine identities of their sons a defensive character: how do you defend yourself as a man if you do not know what it means to be one? For this reason it may be more vital for the men in the middle generation than for the men in the youngest generation to keep a watchful eye on the holding up of gender difference, something that complicates their efforts to incorporate and integrate the feminine qualities they value. The impression we get from some of the ânewâ men in this generation is that they use their"

Lacanâs downplaying of intellectual property may sound radical but, similar to Perlmannâs Silence, he does challenge us to explicitly consider a concept which is too easily taken for granted in mainstream integrity discourse (which increasingly revolves around a neoliberal framing of the scientist as a textual entrepreneur, scoring citations on the discursive stock market of citation indexes, known as academic publishing). Lacan challenges us to question the P of FFP. In dialectical terms, we initially start from an understanding of intellectual property and plagiarism which seems self-evident (M1). If I am the first person to publish about something (a concept, a formula, an equation, a discovery, a syndrome, a technical innovation, a personality test, etc.), I may rightfully claim it to be âmineâ, so that others should at least cite me as the owner. But further reflection will convince us that we always stand on the shoulders of others, and that every novelty presupposes terms, approaches, techniques, etc., developed by others, so that it seems artificial to consider my contribution as something which belongs exclusively to me, as my âpropertyâ even. In other words, the initial concept of intellectual property is challenged or even negated when the original concept is exposed to actual research practices, as fleshed out in science novels for instance (M2). This is an important experience, for it reveals that mainstream understandings of intellectual property actually build on questionable (neoliberal) framings of scientific productivity, staging scientists as a textual entrepreneurs, scoring citations on the discursive stock market of citation indexes, which allegedly has become the basic objective of academic publishing (which, according to this neoliberal logic, is neither about making discoveries not about working for the benefit of humankind, but about harvesting citations and boosting oneâs h-score). The various instances of plagiarism presented in novels (as literary case histories) expose this symptomatic misunderstanding and the subsequent subversion of neoliberal interpretations of intellectual property in misconduct novels forces us to critically reconsider the original concept and to actively work through the experiences which these novels describe. I will come back to this discussion in the final section, and also in Chap. 10."
245,973,0.99,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"As emphasized above, in Tuningâas in the Bologna Processâthe third cycle is not considered to be something quite different in nature from the preceding two cycles. The requirements for a doctoral degree in terms of competences, and the means for forming them to the necessary level, can be described using the same language and conceptual tools as for the other cycles. For Tuning, on the one hand, the need to form the key competences required to formulate and carry out meaningful research is not limited to the third cycle. Although at a different level, such a need is recognized and provided for in the ï¬rst and second cycles as well. On the other hand, the need for broad understanding and important interpersonal and creative skills is not limited to the ï¬rst two cycles, but is also taken into account for the third cycle, for the reasons indicated above.3 As a result, in the above mentioned âGuidelines and Reference Pointsâ,4 there is much useful material on doctoral programs, which can be most helpful for institutions wishing to improve the quality of their offer, in terms of its relevance for the young PhDs whose talents will be necessary for future society. The Guidelines and Reference Points for the various subject areas include formulations of speciï¬c level descriptors for the third cycle, as well as discussions of how to form the key competences at doctoral level. According to subject area and competence, various âlearning methodsâ and environments are proposed, including the production of the classical dissertation. The elaboration and defence of the doctoral dissertation is seen as a powerful tool for acquiring research skills and assessing themâas it has always beenâbut in the Tuning perspective it is only one of the activities to be carried out and assessed. As an example of the results, we may consider the work of the European Tuning History Subject Area Group, which resulted in a separate consultation with doctoral candidates in all or almost all European countries. That consultation gave a rich harvest of qualitative material as well as quantitative data, and amply conï¬rmed the hypotheses of the Subject Area Group: doctoral students were dissatisï¬ed with their current programs; they thought the programs were exclusively geared to preparation for an academic career which they would not in reality be able to access; they felt they needed to interact more strongly and in a more organized manner with researchers from other related and even non-related disciplines, and that they needed better language and interpersonal skills, project management skills and so forth. This consultation was carried out in 2006; and after eight years we asked those that participated in the original consultation about their present career status and whether they would answer the questionnaire in the same way as they did originally. Interestingly, their careers turned out to have developed better than they"

On the other hand, with other new trendsâincluding use of the Internet and social media, and the outpouring of support to address social challenges from the regionâs youthâwe could see an activation of civil engagement unparalleled in Asian history. Throughout Asia, the seesaw dynamism between old and new influences societal evolution in new and interesting ways. There is considerable variation across the region, but the presumption that every country would take on the attributes of the developed Western world has been debunked. Asia is evolving with unique characteristics that differentiate it from the West. In Chapter 1, we proposed to answer the following questions: â¢ Is there an âAsianâ way of doing good? If there is, why so, and what are the implications? â¢ What is the Asian philanthropy and social delivery ecosystem, and how has it evolved? â¢ What are the characteristics and strategies of successful Asian SDOs? â¢ Why is it important to distinguish between SDOs and other types of nonprofit organizations? â¢ What are trends of Asian philanthropists and why? â¢ What are shared challenges for the region? â¢ What can donors, SDO policymakers, and the public at large do to enable the social sector to thrive and contribute to improving the lives of people throughout the region? Only the last has not been sufficiently answered. In order to do so, we must ask ourselves fundamental questions about the world we want to live in and what values are important to us. Many say that we are living in the Asian century. Time will tell what the implications of that truly are. Asia has grown into the most dynamic economic region in the world today. Change is happening with great dispatch. Until recently, there has not been much infrastructure around the charitable sector, a condition improving rapidly along with the expanding reach of philanthropic efforts. These charitable aims grow through long-standing traditions, including the importance of relationships and an interest in family, as well as through newer developments, like the leveraging of technology and governmental partnerships. While the region retains its challenges, many will be met through the increased means and desire for doing good."
271,150,0.99,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"CafÃ©s can register and become visible through appearing on a map and in a calendar announcing events.2 While repairing is an old practice, what is new is that the act of repairing becomes public in Repair CafÃ©s, and the actual repairing as well as the repair events are staged as political actions which strive for cultural transformation aiming at sustainability. In this chapter, results of a qualitative study are presented in which Repair CafÃ©s in Germany have been analyzed from the perspective of media and communication studies. Choosing this approach, the focus of the study was on the people repairing media technologies as well as the organizers of the events. Why do people participate in Repair CafÃ©s and repair media technologies? What do Repair CafÃ©s and the practice of repairing mean to the participants? And what relevance do the participants see in the Repair CafÃ©s for a (mediatized) society? A figurational perspective (see Hepp and Hasebrink in this volume) is helpful to structure the findings, to further analyzed Repair CafÃ©s and to answer the research questions. When analyzing Repair CafÃ©s from a perspective of media and communication studies, the transformation of media and communicative practices becomes visible as do media practices aiming at cultural change. Therefore, on the basis of the study conducted, it can be discussed how media are and can be used for cultural transformation; here, with a view to sustainability. Defining the repairing of media technologies as media practice in this chapter, it is argued that the term media practice has to be understood in a broad sense in media and communication studies, not only taking into account what people do with media content but also what they do with media technologies."

Effective clinical interventions and other forms of interpersonal engagement aimed at self-harm cessation must acknowledge that women who self-harm do so for reasons, and have choice. For they need to exercise their control and choose to do things differently in order to stop â by deciding to resist the desire to self-harm, find alternative ways to fulfil the ends it serves, and, in addition, question and challenge some of the more self-denigrating ends self-harm may serve and express. When the desire to self-harm is present and the behaviour habitual, cessation almost invariably requires the exercise of rational agency: broadly speaking, women must choose selfcare over self-harm. But clinical interventions that acknowledge a personâs rational agency inevitably carry a risk. In this case, the risk is that in acknowledging and working with women as agents of self-harm, clinicians may end up judging and blaming the self-harmer for her actions, and experiencing or expressing a range of critical, negative attitudes and emotions. Despite the fact that self-harm is neither criminalized nor intuitively viewed as morally wrong, it is, after all, a form of violence, and it can have a profound impact on other people, especially when it is perceived as an expression of anger and rage, or a symbolic attack. Rational agency carries the (defeasible) assignment of responsibility, and it can be an easy slide from an acknowledgement of agency and (potentially) responsibility, to blaming attitudes and emotions, such as disapproval, dislike, rejection, contempt, disgust and anger â as if âthe problemâ lies fundamentally with the self-harmer herself. To be effective, clinical engagement must acknowledge agency and (potentially) responsibility, while at the same time avoiding blame and maintaining care, concern and respect for women who self-harm. A blaming atmosphere is likely to re-enact and reinforce past mistreatment and its impact on women, destroying the possibility of building trust and understanding. In contrast, a stable environment that maintains care, concern and respect potentially offers women a corrective experience, ideally helping them overcome the impact of past mistreatment on their self-esteem and self-worth, through therapeutic relationships that validate them and their experiences, and consistently and authentically show compassion and positive regard. In such environments, women may feel supported and empowered to stop self-harming, and embark on a process of freeing themselves from past mistreatment and learning new ways of managing feelings and caring for themselves.12 Given the extent of past mistreatment, this may be a long and painful"
326,146,0.99,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","matters what kind of vehicle we would crash into (e. g., is it a compact car or SUV?), how heavy incoming traffic is (e. g., would more than one vehicle be involved?), how many persons may be involved (e. g., are there children in the other car?). Of course, here we are assuming perfect sensing and V2X communications that can help answer these questions. If we cannot answer the questions, then we face a possibly large unknown risk, which makes driving into incoming traffic perhaps the worst option available. Other factors relevant to the decision-points above include: the road-shoulder type (paved, gravel, none, etc.), the condition of the carâs tires and brakes, whether the carâs occupants are seat-belted, whether the car is transporting dangerous cargo that could spill or explode, proximity to hospital or emergency rescue, damage to property such as houses and buildings, and more. These variables influence the probability of an accident as well as expected harm, both of which are needed in selecting the best course of action. From this short analysis of a typical crash (or possible crash) with an animal, we can already see a daunting number of factors to account for. Sensing technologies today cannot answer some or many of the questions above, but it is already unclear that braking should be the safest default option â as a proxy for the most ethical option â given these uncertain conditions, all things considered. Automated cars today can already detect whether there is oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. Therefore, it is at least possible that they can be programmed to maneuver slightly into the incoming lane under some conditions, e. g., when there are no incoming cars and when it may be dangerous to slam on the brakes. Whether or not sensing technologies will improve enough to deliver answers to our questions above, a programmer or OEM would still need to assign costs or weights to various actions and objects as best as they can. Yet these values are not intrinsic to or discoverable by science or engineering. Values are something that we humans must stipulate and ideally agree upon. In constructing algorithms to control an autonomous car, ethics is already implied in the design process. Any decision that involves a tradeoff such as to strike object x instead of object y requires a value-judgment about the wisdom of the tradeoff, that is, the relative weights of x and y. And the design process can be made better by recognizing the ethical implications and by engaging the broader community to ensure that those values are represented correctly or at least transparently. Working in a moral bubble is less likely to deliver results that are acceptable to society. Again, in a real-world accident today, a human driver usually has neither the time nor the information needed to make the most ethical or least harmful decisions. A person who is startled by a small animal on an otherwise uneventful drive may very well react poorly. He might drive into oncoming traffic and kill a family, or oversteer into a ditch and to his own death. Neither of these results, however, is likely to lead to criminal prosecution by themselves, since there was no forethought, malice, negligence, or bad intent in making a forced, split-second reaction. But the programmer and OEM do not operate under the sanctuary of reasonable instincts; they make potentially life-and-death decisions under no truly urgent time-constraint and therefore incur the responsibility of making better decisions than human drivers reacting reflexively in surprise situations."
186,180,0.989,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"violence and poverty can only be accomplished by recognising oneâs fetrah, or human nature, and believing that ânever will Allah change the condition of a people until they change it themselvesâ (Koran 13:11). If we achieve this, then we can revolutionise ourselves and realise the dignity which is unique to usâunique because humans have accepted Godâs âtrustâ (Koran 33:72). This trust to which the Koran refers is nothing but the responsibility of leadership towards development and freedom (Bani-Sadr 1992). By assuming this responsibility, we not only develop ourselves, but also undertake the development of our environment, both of which can only be realised in freedom. This stands in opposition to the growth of power, which only increases violence, destruction, poverty and inequality. The process of development should be seen as a single process; hence, there is no development if one section of the human community becomes rich while another becomes poor, or if some increase their wealth at the expense of the environment. This is rather a process of enslavement to the laws of power. Therefore what distinguishes living in freedom from living towards death and destruction is the absence of compulsion. If human beings neglect their responsibility as Godâs worldly vicegerents, they will not only lead the world to destruction; at this point, they become depleted of dignity. As mentioned above, people are born with fetrah, and as a result they are endowed with divine attributes. One such attribute is tawheed, or holistic unity. This central attribute, the core of human nature, also functions as a guiding principle for living.5 The loss or forgetting of this attribute leads to the emergence of belief systems which are based on dichotomies, ways of seeing the world which polarise rather than unite. This is the meaning of kofr, or blasphemyâit is the ultimate loss of dignity (Koran 35:39). Godâs warning is thus clear: blasphemy is nothing but forgetting that we are Godâs vicegerents on earth, the neglect of our own freedom and loss of our own nobility, becoming wretched, and causing harm to ourselves and others (Koran 10:26â27)."

How do we know this? How do we know that life will continue so that believers can fulï¬l this role? Initially, according to the Koran, humans were created from a mud which contained all the ingredients of life, into which God blew spirit (Koran 55:14; 32:7â 10). Human fetrah became godlike, and the fetrah was tawheed (Koran 30:30),7 in the best proportions and most beautiful (Koran 95:4; 82:7; 64:3), and God congratulated himself on this creation (Koran 23:12â14). Life could not emerge without tawheed; Imam Ali once said that human beings are microcosms of the entire universe. God created humans and other living beings with dignity and called upon humans to uphold this dignity. Humans volunteered to assume this responsibility, while other living beings did not. However, if in time Godâs earth is not to be depleted of vicegerents, there must be people to carry out the responsibility of acting in this capacity. We did indeed offer the Trust to the Heavens and the Earth and the Mountains; but they refused to undertake it, being afraid thereof; but Man undertook it â he was indeed unjust and foolish.

Here is important to notice that even a content presented to the user is personalized it is still suitable only for a human. One has to make sometimes not a small effort to make this information useful. This is significant especially when the user is looking for information. After constructing a query what can be sometimes time consuming and for not computer-literate people very complicated action, the user gets a list, which is assembled only after a text processing (a fulltext comparison between query and data stored in databases). For instance, if user's keywords are job and programmer because we want to find a job position for a programmer, the result is all documents containing these words. These documents do not even have to be job offers. It might be documents describing programmer's job in generally. Here is no guarantee that this list contains links to documents the user has been looking for and the user has to browse them to extract information. This result also does not take into account relations among information that are for a human obvious at a first sight. A solution to this problem is to represent the Web content not only in a form understandable for a human but also in a form that is easily machine-understandable. In (Antoniou & van Haremelen, 2004) is the term machine-understandable consider as not very appropriate even it is used quite often. This term makes people think that computers can really understand. Authors incline rather to use the term machineprocessable instead. Here comes Tim Berners-Lee's vision called Semantic Web initiative. This initiative tries to add semantics to knowledge to make it processable by automated tools as well as by people.

170,134,0.989,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"6.3 Knowledge for Policy The two previous subsections have been focused on setting some guidelines of how to approach the broad questions of politics and policy within the ICT4D and other development studies that face similar concerns. These questions can guide researchers on how to approach the policy process, but it is not research alone that will change policy. This is why this last section examines the types of research that could be carried out. As stated in the first section of this chapter, this document is based on the conception that not all research can or should influence policy. If such is the case, what are the types of research that become useful in the policy process and how? Vialle (1981) produces a typology of educational research based on its primary objective. As the author summarises, the problem with typologies is that they are not clear-cut categories, but they can help researchers determine their objective and approach their work with more clarity. Based on Vialleâs (1981) work, I present five types of research according to their objectives in the policy process: conceptual, planning, implementing, action research, and monitoring. Researches in ICT4D that aim at reaching policymakers could benefit from reflecting on how their work can be used in the policy process before it is launched. Conceptual research refers to the academic knowledge that explains phenomena, uncaps relationships between different variables, and creates categories and concepts to simplify complex trends. This type of research, often referred to as âblue skyâ or âpureâ research, is valued in the academic community, but it might be the most distant to policymakers that face day-to-day decisions. Despite this tendency, conceptual research can be extremely important for the development of"
271,494,0.989,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"To illustrate these points, let us take research on families as an example. At first sight one might consider the family a rather straightforward and easily definable field as well as an easily definable figuration. However, under closer scrutiny, defining what makes a family is not an easy task. As pointed out in The Blackwell companion to the sociology of families (Scott et al. 2004) we can observe a pluralization from family to families. The editors state: âOur title acknowledges the plurality of family forms and, by implication, the dynamic process of family formation and dissolution across timeâ (Scott et al. 2004: xvii). Recent research on families (see for example Jamieson et al. 2014) has acknowledged the complexities of families. Transnational family networks, as they have been researched by Madianou and Miller (2012) and Beck-Gernsheim (2014), are but one example of the growing diversity of families. In addition, these studies have shown that the complexities increase with the recent development in media change. In line with the broader definition of family in academia, research participants might similarly have shifting understandings of who belongs to their family, depending on circumstances. In a recent action research project with teenage refugees based in Bremen (Volmerg et al. 2016), participants were creating family-like relations with each other as well as with at least one of the researchers involved. Definitions of the family are certainly dependent on historical and cultural contexts. As Morgan (2014) points out, the changing definition of family is partly thanks to changing circumstances and the fluidity of social life, and partly to the changing perceptions of what can constitute a family. From a methodological point of view, the difficulty of defining families at the point of data gathering might seriously limit the data gathering process by imposing a set definition of families from the outside. By conceptualizing families as figurations, researchers can consider their actor constellations, relevance frames and practices and thereby construct families through a multi-perspective lens. The concept of communicative figurations can therefore be used to sharpen the understanding of what âthe fieldâ one wants to research is, by not neglecting fluidities within a figuration but by illuminating them. Another requirement when applying a figurational approach to a field of study is that it allows for scalability. As Couldry and Hepp (2017: 70) point out:"
245,89,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"Interestingly, the objective of balanced mobility was set in the EHEA context without any prior explanation of what is actually understood through balanced mobility. Or to express this differently, under which conditions mobility flows would be considered as balanced. Would only situations of perfect equilibrium between inflows and outflows be regarded as balanced or would small differences also be acceptable? These issues were not explored in the Bologna Process policy documents, balanced mobility lacking a proper deï¬nition therein. There are different potential explanations as to why this happened (or has not happened)âfor example the ministers might have thought that the concept of balance was self-explanatory, or they believed that clarifying the concept would not be a task for themselves, but of the operational arm of the processâthe BFUG. Nevertheless, irrespective of the motives behind this lack of clarity, there have been earlier attempts to deï¬ne what âbalanced mobilityâ could mean. Applying this concept of balance to total student inflows and outflows, Teichler et al. proposed in 2011 to deï¬ne as balanced a situation where the difference between inflows and outflows is smaller than 10 percentage points. Therefore, balanced would be not only cases where there is full equilibrium between the number of incoming and outgoing students (which is almost impossible to achieve in practice), but also cases where the differences are considered negligible or non-detrimental. This is the deï¬nition that we will be working with in the following sections in order to analyse how balanced or imbalanced EHEA mobility flows are. Apart from the lack of a proper deï¬nition, another peculiarity of this objective in the Bologna Process context is that, while the concept of balanced mobility is pursued here primarily in degree mobility, the idea of reciprocity, of balance, is actually the cornerstone of another type of mobility, i.e. credit mobility (student exchanges). Therefore, balance in degree mobility is a borrowed concept. Reciprocity as such was one of the original aims of the ERASMUS Programme, in the sense that the programme wanted to break away from up to then traditional mobility patterns (i.e. East to West and South to North) and to foster also reverse flows (West to East and North to South). Therefore, even in the context of credit mobility balance was not meant as full reciprocity, but rather as having flows in both directions. Knowing that the concept of balance is speciï¬c to credit mobility, we cannot help but wonder if it is at all applicable to or pursuable for degree mobility. Or to express this doubt differentlyâwould governments have the same tools at their disposal to influence balance in degree mobility as they have in credit mobility? The short answer to this question is no, they do not. Earlier studies (Kelo et al. 2006; Teichler et al. 2011) have highlighted the intrinsic differences between credit and degree mobility, labelling the ï¬rst as a horizontal and the second as a vertical type of mobility. Credit mobility is horizontal in the sense that students move for study purposes between higher education systems that are more or less on an equal par. The main aim of credit mobility is"

Overall our interviewees did not see a need for more specific public participation within the governance process.

If every system performance measure or objective could be expressed in the same units, and if there was only one decision-maker and one objective or goal, then decision-making would be relatively straight forward. Such is not the case when dealing with the publicâs water resources. A cost-beneï¬t framework, used for many decades in water resources planning and management, converted the different types of impacts into a single monetary metric. Once that was done, the task was to ï¬nd the plan or policy that maximized the net beneï¬ts, i.e., the beneï¬ts less the costs. If the maximum difference between beneï¬ts and costs was positive, that was the best plan or policy. But not all system performance criteria we consider today can be easily expressed in monetary units. Even if monetary units could be used for each objective, that in itself does not address the distributional issues involving who beneï¬ts and who pays and by how much. While all stakeholders may agree that maximizing total net beneï¬ts is a desirable objective, not everyone, if indeed anyone, will likely agree on to how best to allocate or share those net beneï¬ts among them.

In summary, the visual image of a patient relates the condition as embodied. Given that concepts of the aging process seemingly ï¬t those of the disease trajectory, a patientâs visual image may, therefore, quickly emerge as one of an elderly person. In addition, presentations of passivity and dependence in a female patient are perceived of as less ethically problematic because cultural concepts link being female by itself to such characteristics. On a second consideration, the core stigma attached to dementia, however, relates to it being perceived of as a condition of the mind. I suggest that this fact offers an explanation as to why, as G. Thomas Couser has observed in âMemoir and (lack of) memoryâ, the Alzheimerâs narratives that achieve larger sales and reviewer recognition centre on male patients: the loss of the male mind appears more profound. Regardless of the patientâs sex, though, the conceptualisation of patients losing their mind can easily turn them into passive beings without their own voice or continued personhood. It is such images, in particular, that will not enhance a positive attitude within society towards the ill â who are mostly, but not always, the elderly â and neither towards their condition and their need for empathetic and identity-afï¬rming accompaniment on their journey. Contrasting this viewpoint, I will now illustrate how two narrators rise above the disease-imposed temptation to objectify the patientâs body, or to see their mind destroyed. Both Phillip Toledano and Arno Geiger follow the conviction expressed by psychiatrists and philosophers that patients âshould be treated as wholesâ.38 They perceive of dementia as an integral part of their parentsâ personality and natural aging."
299,441,0.989,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Another major concern deals with the problem of accountability when autonomous weapons systems are deployed. Ethicist Robert Sparrow (2007) highlights this ethical issue by noting that a fundamental condition of international humanitarian law, or jus in bello, requires that someone must be able to be held responsible for civilian deaths. Any weapon or other means of war that makes it impossible to identify responsibility for the casualties it causes does not meet the requirements of jus in bello, and therefore should not be employed in war. This issue arises because AI-equipped machines make decisions on their own, which makes it difficult to determine whether a flawed decision is due to flaws in the program or in the autonomous deliberations of the AI-equipped (so-called âsmartâ) machines. This problem was highlighted when a driverless car violated the speed limits by moving too slowly on a highway, and it was unclear to whom the ticket should be issued (For more, see Etzioni and Eztioni 2016). In situations where a human being makes the decision to use force against a target, there is a clear chain of accountability, stretching from whoever actually âpulled the triggerâ to the commander who gave the orders. In the case of AWS, no such clarity exists. It is unclear who or what is to blame or bears liability. What Sharkey, Sparrow, and the signatories of the open letter propose could be labelled âupstream regulation;â that is, a proposal for setting limits on the development of autonomous weapons systems technology and drawing red lines that future technological developments should not be allowed to cross. This kind of upstream approach tries to foresee the direction of technological development and pre-empt the dangers such developments would pose. Others prefer âdownstream regulation,â which takes a wait-and-see approach by developing regulations as new advances occur. Legal scholars Kenneth Anderson and Matthew Waxman, who advocate this approach, argue that regulation will have to emerge along with the technology because they believe that morality will co-evolve with technological development. Thus, arguments about the irreplaceability of human conscience and moral judgment may have to be revisited (Anderson and Waxman 2013a). They suggest that, as humans become more accustomed to machines performing functions with lifeor-death implications/consequencesâsuch as driving cars or performing surgeriesâhumans will most likely become more comfortable with AI technologyâs incorporation into weaponry. Thus, Anderson and Waxman propose what might be considered a communitarian solution, by suggesting that the United States should work on developing norms and principles (rather than binding legal rules) guiding and constraining research and developmentâand eventual deploymentâof AWS. Those norms could help establish expectations about legally or ethically appropriate conduct. They write: To be successful, the United States government would have to resist two extreme instincts. It would have to resist its own instincts to hunker down behind secrecy and avoid discussing and defending even guiding principles. It would also have to refuse to cede the moral high ground to critics of autonomous lethal systems, opponents demanding some grand international treaty or multilateral regime to regulate or even prohibit them.

After all, the rules are also made by self-interested people such as politicians. Still, politicians, regulators, donors, and social investors do often act in the public interest, so it is on them that our best hopes rest for agency in the public interest. Thus, as a practical matter, the search for causes converges to a focus on what these legislators and regulators should do differently next time, taking human greed as given. The second factor muddling the search for a cause is that causes interact. The global financial crisis hit many countries, with diverse regulatory systems, so it is not credible to blame it purely on idiosyncratic national factors as Alan Greenspan and the Greek governmentâs affinity for side deals with Goldman Sachs. Seemingly, the universal cause was the huge swell of capital, much of it from certain developing countries. On the other hand, thanks to regulations that made Canadian banking relatively boring and safeâin particular, inhibiting loan securitizationsâ Canada escaped major damage, even though it was tied to the same global capital markets (Atlantic Council and Thomson Reuters 2012). So, arguably, poor policies in the United States and Greece were the root cause after all. How to square this circle? At the risk of oversimplifying, the crises can be seen as arising from the combination of easy money and bad policies. If either had been eliminated, the crises would have been prevented. Thus we could blameâand adopt policies to redressâeither factor alone and be partly right. But ideally, those seeking to act in the public interest would recognize both factors, survey possible policy changes that could affect either, then choose from among them in light of what is known about costs, effectiveness, and political and administrative constraints. The upshot is that it is important to distinguish the search for who or what to blame from the search for practical steps to prevent a repeat. In the sweep of history, countries that are wealthy today have had the most time to learn hard lessons (and sometimes forget them). In these nations, the lending system includes such actors as retail lenders; investors therein; credit information bureaus; and regulatory bodies that limit and monitor aspects of credit products such as term, term disclosure, even pricing. For institutions that take deposits, additional regulators come knockingâto insure those deposits or ensure that under ordinary circumstances capital is on hand to absorb losses and meet withdrawal demands. A truth often overlooked in excitement about microfinance as a retail service model is that it is no exception to this need for companion institutions. If anything, the need is greater when targeting the poor. The Economist Intelligence Unit annually surveys experts in order to assess the business environment for microfinance in dozens of countries. Implied in this work is a broad agenda for building microfinancial ecosystems. In contrast with the more famous Doing Business index, the Global Microscope survey puts roughly equal weight on the need for legal space to do operateâthe need to avoid prohibitively burdensome regulationâand the need for well-functioning institutions of restraint (EIU 2012). The compilers of the Microscope cull data from relevant legal texts, scholarly articles, interviews with country experts, and other sources. On this basis, they make qualitative"

If in contrast, the perceived challenge is located in the technological procedure of integrating new materials into known construction processes, construction engineers and material processing experts might be involved at first hand. Next question then could be how the market would react, so that marketing experts and potential consumers would be required. From these short considerations, it becomes evident that a range of actors has to be included in order to obtain a more complete understanding of a problem situation. And consequently, an interdependency is revealed between the actors describing the research problem and the way it is perceived and embedded into causeâeffect relations and the expected results and outcomes of the study. Summarising, the very first challenge of inter- and transdisciplinary research is to frame a problem appropriately and to unite a group of scientists (and other actors) whose composition is sufficiently broad and deep in its expertise to generate meaningful answers. In transdisciplinary studies, such a straight problem orientation has proven an effective instrument for successful identification and mobilisation of stakeholders (Knierim 2014). So, once the problem isâat least initiallyâ encircled and a number of concerned actors identified, the second and consecutive challenge of the first research phase is to set up the teamâs collaboration and to concretely implement the cooperation. In other words, how to practise a working procedure that allows both individual and group performances, so that the expertise of all actors involved can unfold? What exactly will be studied and how? What will be the responsibilities and tasks of the various actors? How will the results be determined? Clearly, these skills cannot be learned through books or taught in lectures but require a reflexive learning-bydoing approach. One basis for such skills can be a targeted team work training where steps of an action-oriented research process are practised"
13,136,0.989,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"69) had become a dominating cultural discourse when we interviewed the youngest generation as 18-year-olds. According to the North American historian Joan Brumberg (1997), this represents a historical trend in the last century, where society changed focus from inner qualities to outer looks, which in turn were ever-more commercialised and uniformly presented. The body appears to be a central battlefield between new subjectivities and old gender discourses both outside and inside young women today. This tension was exactly the point of frustration that exploded in the Scandinavian countries in around 2000 in a number of debate books by young feminists of the same age as our youngest generation (for instance, Skugge et al. 1999). The young middle-class women behind these books did not have any problems in making their voices heard, getting good marks and good jobs; the problem was that they were still caught in gender stereotypes, especially when it came to the body project. As body and style have become the central points of modern selfconstruction, the young women seem to be caught in a dilemma: it is deeply offending to girls who see themselves as subjects to be reduced to body and gender. The books by the young feminists circled this topic: their problem was not that they were not pretty enough, but that they still cared about being pretty enough. Shame is connected to having failed as a self-contained individual. This context of shifting youth cultures, and especially the cultural meanings surrounding the young female body, is an important context in which to understand the feelings of gender that these three generations have experienced in connection to their own and other bodies in their youth.

It is in this atmosphere, I so argue in my analysis of the accounts by Robert Davis, Diana Friel McGowin and Larry Rose, that patients follow traditional narrative concepts. In agreement with early criticism of these narratives, I identify them as deploying linear plots and established myths.6 But reading them from the vantage point of greater temporal distance, and in the context of Hawkinsâs illness narrative criticism as well as Couserâs ethical considerations, I believe these authorial choices to be purposeful for the patientsâ wider political cause. At the time of publication, these narratives appealed to a readership primed for the caregiverâs accomplished account. Complying with their readersâ expectations, patients could begin to gather an audience that learned to appreciate the patientâs continued personhood. It is against this changing background that slightly later published narratives could attempt a presentation that reï¬ects the patientâs narrative capabilities more credibly. My comparison of Cary Smith Hendersonâs narrative fragments to Thomas DeBaggioâs highly articulate and literary composition illustrates how patients struggled to ï¬nd narrative forms that would embrace the plot of their disease, while leaving space and scope for continued identity and personhood within this trajectory. I close this chapter with an analysis of the account of a Harvard cardiologist about his Parkinsonâs disease with rapidly progressing Lewy body dementia. Building on life-long experiences from the vantage point of a practicing clinician, Thomas Graboys now takes the viewpoint of the patient. His change in perspective enables him to bring the patientâs agenda to an audience that authoritatively includes the medical profession. Several years into patient life-writing, this agenda now can move on from the recovery of identity and personhood directly to address matters such as end-of-life treatment and choices."

381,587,0.989,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Implementing a Tiered Approach to Intervention Response to Intervention (RTI) is a three-tiered methodology that provides a structure for teachers to select and implement an appropriate intervention for a student or students who require special attention.42 Without some well-organized and defined strategy, students will slip through cracks. One major goal of RTI is to address problems very early to reduce the odds of students experiencing failure. The first tier of RTI is a well-organized and effectively implemented curriculum and inclusive instructional approach: All students are involved and expected to be mastering the content, and instruction is specifically designed to address the wide range of learner needs, strengths, and backgrounds.43 Regular monitoring of student learning is a critical aspect of first-tier instruction, with the goal of addressing problems or barriers to learning before they become serious. Interim assessments can play a role in this monitoring but are often not timely or fine grained enough to enable the teacher to respond effectively to individual student needs. More critical is the teacherâs capacity to observe how well students are learning the material on a minute-by-minute and day-by-day basis through the use of formative assessment and observation along the lines described by Black and Wiliam (2009). Black and Wiliam see this process as continuous, with the focus on preventing students from long-term confusion or withdrawing their attention from learning. With a strong core instructional program that is inclusive and incorporates formative assessment practices, 75â80 % of students can be sufficiently served. The second tier of RTI is for students for whom the core program is insufficient; that is, for those who regularly do not seem to be keeping up or who consistently lose attention. This could be due to not having the background to understand the material, to something going on in their lives outside of the classroom, or even to losing confidence in their capacity to learn the content. When a teacher observes a student struggling in class, his or her response will depend on that teacherâs own capacity and on the resources available in the school. If initial adjustments to the"

A more recent study on the political risks of field research in Central Asia found that â(s)everal respondents reported that they no longer work in Uzbekistanâ and a âfew respondents singled out Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan as sites where they have experienced significant censorship/restrictions, chosen not to go, or experienced difficulty goingâ(CESS 2016, 7). Goode (2010) initially discerned a relation between Russia becoming more autocratic and a decline in fieldwork, but qualified his conclusions in a later study of the broader region (Goode 2016). Nonetheless, we would logically expect the most repressive regimes within the authoritarian universe to be less likely settings for field research: either because it would be too dangerous, or simply because it is impossible to gain access. Similarly, assessments of feasibility and risk are likely to constrain the choice of research topics and research questions. We do not expand on this point, since it has been dealt with extensively by the contributions to Observing Autocracies from the Ground Floor (Goode and Ahram 2016). At the level of our own considerations and observations of colleagues, the notion of constrained country choices, and associated knowledge gaps, seems to have validity. Our Kazakhstan researcher for instance made a clear choice, within Central Asia, not to do research in Uzbekistan for safety reasons. We know no one who has done fieldwork in Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, or North Korea. We know colleagues who have started doing research in Myanmar only after it democratized from 2011. And more dramatically, we know many colleagues who have abruptly stopped doing research in Egypt when it became much more repressive in recent years."
117,227,0.989,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Such ideas are strengthened by the common yet precarious view of home and community as the ânaturalâ place of care and effortless relationships that are bound by emotions and connection, while medicine and cure carry the connotation of knowledge and comprehension of facts. The dementia village project evolved amongst many human and touching experiences, thankful relatives, husbands visiting their wives every day and a strong team spirit and cohesion amongst the carers.25 The home, designed to be a village in which everything resembles civic life, might not have met this vision, but it did not lack humanity. It did not lack care. Neither did I encounter insufficient or bad care. The carers did care, and most of them with sensitivity, rather than sentimentality. Nonetheless, the rising prevalence of chronic illnesses means that care is becoming an increasingly complex affair. It is with due regard for these actualities that we must construe the relationships between the village residents, the carers, dementia and social life. And I hope that by outlining some of these complexities, this paper will foster a deeper and more critical understanding of dementia, ageing and the care we all hope to receive in our twilight years."

The experimentâs object a is decidedly not the mouse, and it is no coincidence that the mice are furless, that their skin is nearly âtransparentâ, for they actually are a âliving libraryâ (p. 25) of proteins and genes. The object a is a spectral something inside these animals, something which may have invaded these mice, something toxic or at least exceptional which temporarily cures them (from cancer), but eventually kills them, because the mice are merely a kind of living stage, allowing the viral drama to unfold, and bound to be sacrificed in order to study the impact. The mice are merely vehicles or ecosystems: the object a is a particular type of virus (labelled R-7), the frustrating, enigmatic target which now suddenly seems to live up to its promises and expectations, for there is something missing in the mice, a disconcerting but at the same time promising abnormality or gap: the tumour has decreased. Marion and Feng discover that three mice have tumours significantly smaller than before. After repeated failure, one of Cliffâs viral variants actually seems to have some effect. Is it significant? Or is the atypical tumour decline âcontaminatedâ by some other (unknown) condition? The responses to this event differ. Whereas Marion (the scientific supervisor, the labâs epistemological super-ego) remains sceptical, Sandy is exuberant, because he immediately sees new possibilities for writing grant proposals for NIH.3 Sandy takes a U-turn by considering Cliff suddenly as the labâs trump card (Miedema 2012, p. 76). Cliff throws himself into work and experiences a second lease on life. He works even longer hours than before and his appetite for science revives. These are his experiments, his mice. This is his crucial moment. His moods swing âsickeningly between delight and despairâ (p. 48), fuelled by âthe propulsive energy of scientific questions, the relentless force of an investigation that might succeedâ, but also tormented by the possibility that âhis good fortune might evaporateâ, that the âremission of the mice is nothing more than a freak occurrenceâ (p. 48). In other words, he becomes trapped in the matheme of desire ($ â a). He forgets about the outside world, loses track of time, becoming âparanoidâ even ($ in the lower-right position; p. 48). All his previous work had given him nothing, but this was his chance. More carefully than ever before, he keeps and copies his records. Do not move, do not touch! These are his mice, his proprietary tumours, his results. Indeed, Cliff develops âa proprietary interest in his virus and his miceâ (p. 51). The âweâ of normal laboratory research has decidedly shifted to the first person singular. As the novel phrases it: All his thoughts and actions served R-7. Cliff saw now that you could not become possessive of this kind of research. Instead, he, the researcher, had become possesses by his creation (p. 178, my italics)."
386,32,0.989,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"2.1.1 Weberâs Iron Cage In any writing on the rationale of the public administration, Max Weber should play a prominent role, partly because the German sociologist (1864â1920) was among the first to give the public administration a central position in sociological theories. Weberâs general focus was on two concepts: one was rationalisation, which he considered as the most general element in our historic development; the other was domination, an apparently legitimate exercise of power. It is obvious that both concepts are easily traceable in the apparatus of public administration. His famous terming of the administration as an âiron cageâ to describe both principles can be found in his seminal work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: The Puritan wanted to work in a calling; we are forced to do so. For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order. This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force. Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxterâs view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the âsaint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any momentâ. But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Weber 1905: 28)"

This means that most people want to preserve their collective ways of life, symbols and practices in order to maintain a sense of collective continuity. In times of social change and transition, groups may get the feeling that they are losing their connection to âwho we wereâ in the past, and this is likely to result in attempts to restore a sense of collective continuity. Attempting to restore a national culture and identity that is perceived to be lost or undermined is another way in which the past validates the present. That is, people often refer back to the way things were done in the past, such as customs and traditions, in order to legitimize how things should be done in the present. Lowenthal (1985a, b) suggests that preservation and restoration often exist simultaneously. People are likely to preserve their group identity by affirming its continuity over time, and this is alternated with attempts to restore traditions and ways of life that are seen to be undermined by foreign flavours. One manifestation of this alternation between preservation and restoration is feelings of national nostalgia. National nostalgia is understood as a sentimental longing for the good old days of the country. It is a group-based emotion that can be experienced on the basis of oneâs social identity. Scholars have proposed that national nostalgia emerges in times of social change and transition, because it has a restorative function (Boym 2001; Lowenthal 1985a, b). The reason is that in longing for those good old days of the national past, group members become more aware of the importance of their original national culture and traditions as a basis for preserving their national identity. In other words, national nostalgia can help group members to restore a sense of collective continuity. At the same time, national nostalgia is often an expression of the mourning and regret over these changes that have taken place (Duyvendak 2011). A fond remembrance of the national past can serve as a painful reminder of the good things that are lost, and this is likely to result in attempts to restore âthe way we wereâ. Recent work has shown that national nostalgia is related to feelings of threat to the continuity of group identity (Smeekes and Verkuyten 2015) and results in negative attitudes towards immigrant outgroups (e.g. Smeekes et al. 2015). The focus on group history observed in public discourses over intergroup conflict in various European countries explicitly frames the collective past as the rooted basis for group identity. However, within these discourses there are different representations of what this collective past looks like. This means that people are both capable of understanding"
58,94,0.989,Enabling Things to Talk,"Figure 6.2 could give rise to the impression that we prescribe a sequential approach for generating architectures: (1) Define the scope, i.e. the business goals; (2) Create the Physical Entity View and the IoT Context View; (3) Define requirements; and (4) Generate the remaining views. This type of sequential approach to architecting lies, for instance, at the heart of the waterfall approach (Royce 1970). This interpretation of Fig. 6.2 is indeed true if all arrows in Fig. 6.2 are understood as arrows in time. However, they can also be understood as logical dependencies. For instance, in order to conduct the requirements process, we need a set of formulated business goals, an IoT Context View and a Physical Entity View. If we interpret the process described in this Section in the latter way, it can be mapped onto a plethora of popular architecting methodologies, such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) (Miller and Mukerji 2003), Pattern-Based Design (Gamma et al. 1994), and the Spiral Model (Boehm 1988). The only limitation we see is in the choice of views. Some architectural methodologies prescribe different sets of views. Some of them, for instance the 4 +1 approach, lack some of the views we prescribe (mainly the information and context views) (Kruchten 1995). In this case we could choose to embed the 4+1 framework into the process described in this Section. On the other hand, other methodologies comprise views that are not part of the IoT ARM set. In this case, the option is to integrate the IoT ARM views (and the manner in which they are derived) into this other methodology."

It is not a conclusion, but an input to a comprehensive assessment that can help make sense of current difficulties and plot a path forward. In light of this evidence, what strategies should those wanting to support financial services to the poor adopt? Just as one might engage a tutor for a student struggling to read, one logical response is to zero in on the weaknesses of microfinance, such as the inherent but dangerous tendency to press for near-perfect repayment rates. The Smart Campaign is one effort of this type. It has obtained hundreds of endorsements for a definition of responsible lending and is now piloting an audit system for compliance. Someday investors could condition their funding on such audits.

Many, though by no means all, of the ethical concerns raised by AI caregivers emanate from treating them as if they were to be substitute care rather than a partner in providing it. Hence, if one compares, say, an AI caregiver for the elderly to a human nurse, one indeed will find all kind of limitations. One must not seek to rely on an AI caregiver nanny in a crisisâa child breaks a leg, starts a fire, cannot stop the bathtub from overflowing and so on. These nannies ought to be programmed to alert a human for help rather than deal with such situations, and many others that may arise, on their own. At first, AI caregivers that provide psychotherapy may seem to be a major exception. These AI caregivers have been reported to be widely used and very successful. In the 1960s, MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum developed a computer program called ELIZA, designed to simulate conversation with a human. The user would type something on a typewriter connected to the computer, and the program would formulate a response and type it back. After the initial version of ELIZA, Weizenbaum made a new version known as DOCTOR after a meeting with Kenneth Colby, a psychiatrist who wanted to use computers in his study of psychotherapy. While Weizenbaum was troubled by the fact that people were quite willing to share their intimate thoughts with a machine, Colby held that people could begin using âcomputer therapistsâ (Rheingold 1985, pp. 163â65). Since then such programs have come a long way. Often cited is MoodGYM, which provides cognitive behavioral therapy online for people with anxiety, depression, and other conditions. According to Tina Rosenberg, âScores of studies have found that online C.B.T. works as well as conventional face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy â as long as there is occasional human support or coachingâ (Rosenberg 2015). Online programs help people for whom cost, stigma, or access (due to location or time constraints) is a barrier to getting help. Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands have online cognitive behavioral health programs, and MoodGYM is used by Australiaâs national health system. âAbout 100,000 Australians use it, as do people in 200 countriesâ (Rosenberg 2015). (Technically these programs may not qualify as AI caregivers but they have the same basic element: bonding with a computer and caregiving. Also, one must expect that in the near future such programs would incorporate AI, like the virtual therapist Ellie developed at the University of Southern California (Bohannon 2015, pp. 250â51).) On further examination, though, one notes that these programs should not work on their own for a few key reasons. (a) Often when a person is presenting with one symptom (e.g. depression) he or she may have others that these programs are not equipped to deal with. (b) All such treatment ought to be preceded by a physical examination to rule out a physical cause of the patientâs mental concerns (e.g. abnormal thyroid function). (c) Often these treatments work better if combined with medications, which these programs do not prescribe or administer. (d) All such programs should alert a human caregiver and/or authorities if the patients indicate that they may harm themselves or others. On all these important grounds, AI therapists are to be used as partners rather than as care substitutes."

Many of the respondents in this aspect of our research focused on the difficulty of directing conclusions or recommendations at most appropriate audiences.

Knowledge in this regard remains anecdotal, at best."
139,190,0.989,Programming for Computations - MATLAB/Octave (Volume 14.0),"If we call the above test_midpoint_double function and nothing happens, our implementations are correct. However, it is somewhat annoying to have a function that is completely silent when it works â are we sure all things are properly computed? During development it is therefore highly recommended to insert a print statement such that we can monitor the calculations and be convinced that the test function does what we want. Since a test function should not have any print statement, we simply comment it out as we have done in the function listed above. The trapezoidal method can be used as alternative for the midpoint method. The derivation of a formula for the double integral and the implementations follow exactly the same ideas as we explained with the midpoint method, but there are more terms to write in the formulas. Exercise 3.13 asks you to carry out the details. That exercise is a very good test on your understanding of the mathematical and programming ideas in the present section."
223,29,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"two problems to cope with. First, the knowledge and experience necessary for solving a problem or making the right decisions to achieve a certain goal may be available somewhere in an organization, but it may not reach the people authorized to act on it. Second, the nodal points or authorized decision-makers may not have the prior knowledge, experience, and intuition necessary to understand and evaluate the importance of information that has been forwarded to them. Those who decide often not understand those who know. And those who know are often experts in narrow domains only or are not close to those in power. Weberâs (1922/1980) ideal bureaucracy rested on the principles of meritocracy and the absence of nepotism and incompetence. In that system the hierarchy of decision-making corresponded to a hierarchy of competence. High-ranking decision-makers were expected to have broader expertise and more experience than their subordinates; the superiors would at least be able to understand, evaluate, and embrace the information forwarded to them. In large and complex organizations, it happens quite frequently that line managers (immediate superiors) have achieved their position because of merits other than broad knowledge and expertise in a certain domain. In some political systems, ideological reliability and loyalty to a political party, ethnic group, or powerful network counts for more than expertise does when it comes to promotion to a high post. Even if managers understand the relevance and urgency of information, they may fail to draw the necessary practical consequences because they are indebted to a political party or a powerful person or are under pressure from their social environment. Organization theory, especially the research field following the tradition of Mintzberg (1979), and the geography of knowledge have an abiding interest in the organization and coordination of social systems in space and in the spatial concentration of jobs involving high levels of educational achievement and decisionmaking. Originally, region meant a space that was organized, coordinated, controlled, and influenced by a power center or a social systemâs authority (for details see Berthoin Antal, Meusburger, & Suarsana, 2014; Gottmann, 1980; Meusburger et al., 2015). Organization theory and the geography of knowledge have documented how the structure of a social systemâthe centralization or decentralization of decision-making authority, skills, and competence within an organizationâvaries with the complexity of its tasks and the uncertainty of its environment. In summary, a number of research fields have underlined the importance of an environment or spatial context and its possible impact on individual and collective action, but their strands of argumentation have seldom coalesced."
315,421,0.989,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"transcultural belonging is rooted in the familial origin, eventual networks are constituted later and outside the family; (4) belonging beyond transnational tiesâthe type called in the earlier typology âbeing Spanish in Switzerlandâârepresents an interesting case of expressing a feeling of belonging to the Spanish community specifically in Switzerland but not to Spain or to family and friends in Spain; and (5) rupture of networks and detachment from belongingâthe last type, then, breaks with the networks as well as with the feelings of belonging. These interviewees clearly stated that they defined themselves as Swiss and not as belonging to both countries at once. The typology shows that with respect to transnationalism, the ways of being and of belonging are linked, but not in a simple way. For the second generation it is again the inheritance of their parentsâ networks and the way they are able to appropriate and later maintain the social ties that are crucial for their ways of belonging transculturally. The connection between both forms of transnationalism cannot be expressed in a direct correlation; there are cases where the transnational links are missing, but a transcultural belonging (based not on family links, but related, for instance, to culture in the sense of arts) is still expressed. Other cases connect both or are missing both. We could not find any case of existing transnational links without transcultural belonging. We think this is because of the case we examined: the second generation bases its networks and feelings of belonging, at least at the beginning, on the sense of origin inherited from their parents. Other transnational actors that build their social capital on a shared interest and not on a belief of descent and national/local belonging, such as business people or lifestyle groups, might maintain networks without a sense of belonging. Third, we relied on the accounts, but also, in particular, on the drawings done by the interviewees to apprehend their notion of the spatial and social formation that spans their places of living and working and their familyâ and friendsâ places in Spain. A first point to note is that the spatial accounts evoked very concrete places in Spain, such as the street where the grandparents live, or the little stream where they used to play with other kids from the village when they were younger. Although we started the interviews by asking them about their relationship with Spain, it became clear that the places they always talked about were connected to stories in their biography. This might in itself not be a surprise, but it is an important point to consider when planning the data collection and when designing the instruments. Talking about Spain usually evoked a very abstract account whereas the concrete places were tied to emotional moments and memories along their biographies. Finally, the research also underlines the importance of researching a social phenomenon that is based on movement by âmoving methodsâ (Tarrius 2001; Watts and Urry 2008). Even though the research question did not focus on movement, travelling between Switzerland and Spain plays an important part in maintaining the transnational ties. Therefore, movement lies in an implicit way at the very heart of the study, though it remains restricted to a few times per year and to roughly the same trajectories every time. The notion of the moving researcher seemed particu-"

363,89,0.989,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"such diverse experiences as the discovery of Freddie Parrâs body, which âpinioned [Tom] with fearâ so that âhe ceased to be a babeâ (61); sexual discovery, âwhich unlocked for [him] realms of candour and raptureâ (61); and the blow to the head which commits Sarah Atkinson to a waking coma: âhorror. Confusion. Plenty of Here and Nowâ (77). Those moments described as an encounter with the Here and Now are confrontations with the limitations of stories. They are proof that history is a âthin garment easily punctured by a knife blade called Nowâ (36). For, strangely enough, though they are the effects of history-making, these moments are âtense with the present tense ... fraught with the here and nowâ (207). While the Here and Now results from history it is also, conceptually, opposed to it, as in Priceâs rejection of history: âwhat matters is the here and nowâ (60). The vexed nature of this term, its grasping of a present that is continually slipping away, prompts Crick to wonder: âwhat is this much-adduced Here and Now? What is this indefinable zone between what is past and what is to come?â (60). The Here and Now can be understood as what Linda Hutcheon calls âbrute realityâ (Hutcheon, 1988: 155); it is present experience in that fleeting moment before it becomes the past, narrativised and emplotted. Or, as Janik puts it, the Here and Now is âdirect, unmediated, unintellectualized experienceâ ( Janik, 1995: 178. See also Janik, 1989: 84â6). It is an encounter with the limits of our powers to explain. That is, it is that moment when we confront an event which seems inexplicable, for which we have no contextualising, explanatory story. For this reason, the Here and Now is also an aperture where, very briefly, reality, in Tomâs sense of âemptinessâ, is glimpsed.8 This evanescent experience is the closest we come to non-narration, to being âoutsideâ story and meaning. It is the moment when history is made ânonsense by that sensation in the pit of your stomach â¦ the feeling that all is nothingâ (270). It is the reminder that there is no guiding purpose, or over-arching pattern and meaning to history; meaning is (provisionally) provided only by the stories we tell. Thus, an encounter with the Here and Now is always a more or less bloody apocalypse, an encounter with the end; the end of meaning, the end of a particular story which has framed and filled reality. Thus when Price proclaims the end of history just as Tom is confronting the limits of his power to explain Maryâs baby-snatching actions, it prompts Tom to launch himself into the past, to break away from teaching the French Revolution and try to come to terms, instead, with his own sense of the end and to elucidate the moments of crisis in his life which elude meaning and defy explanation. âThere are a thousand million waysâ, he reflects, âin which the world comes to an endâ (155)."
223,281,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"The Role of Knowledge Accessibility in Planning and in the Control of Action To assist the individualâs pursuit of a goal effectively, implementation intentions need to specify relevant critical situations in the if-component and instrumental responses in the then-component (see also Gollwitzer, Wieber, Myers, & McCrea, 2009). Prior studies have generally observed that people can indeed identify and self-select suitable situations and responses (e.g., Adriaanse, de Ridder, & de Wit, 2009; Gollwitzer & BrandstÃ¤tter, 1997). In fact, both experimenter-provided and self-generated implementation intentions have been shown to foster goal attainment effectively (Armitage, 2009). But how do people generate effective plans? Individuals have to access goal-relevant knowledge before they can further process this information. Generally, psychological research shows wide agreement that knowledge accessibility is important for individualsâ cognition and behavior (overview by Wyer, 2008). As for the accessibility of goal-related knowledge, goal systems theory (Kruglanski et al., 2002) affords a helpful conceptual framework for understanding how pursuing a goal affects the accessibility and application of knowledge that is relevant to planning. This theory rests on a cognitive approach to motivation. Its proponents apply a network conceptualization that allows for dynamic and malleable modeling of the activation and permits application of cognitive content to motivation content. Within this âmotivation-as-cognitionâ approach, goal systems are defined as âthe mental representations of motivational networks composed of interconnected goals and meansâ (Kruglanski et al., 2002, p. 333). Given this connectedness of goals and means, the activation of a mental representation of a goal should also activate the mental representation of suitable means to pursue this goal. When this idea is applied to planning, it follows that when one is pursuing a goal (e.g., to prepare a healthy dinner), knowledge of possible means that is relevant to planning the when, where, and how of goal-striving becomes easily accessible (e.g., thinking of the salad in oneâs fridge and of the tomatoes that one has to purchase on the way home). Two properties of the interconnections are thus especially interesting for the activation of goal-relevant knowledge: structure and strength. As far as the structure of the interconnections are concerned, the number of means that are attached to a goal can vary. For one person, activating the physical fitness goal might activate only the means of going to the gym, but for another person it might activate a multitude of means (e.g., going to the gym, riding a bike to work, and taking the stairs). In addition to such interindividual differences, the number of means connected to a goal might also vary from one goal to the next. For instance, there might be numerous ways to pursue the goal of eating healthily (e.g., eating at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, drinking water rather than soft drinks) but only a few ways to pursue the goal of acquiring a driverâs license (i.e., taking the official test). Concerning the strength of the interconnections, one may expect the strength of the cognitive association between the goal and the means for achieving it to be stronger when the number of those means is relatively low than when it is relatively high."
251,368,0.989,inter-Group Relations and Migrant integration in European Cities : Changing Neighbourhoods,"superiority of âweâ who care and keep the environment clean and âtheyâ who do not. Similarly, Wimmer (2004) highlights that the use of places often reflects or is employed for exemplifying a sort of moral order. According to him, the discourse of order does not represent a hidden way of excluding groups on an ethnic basis, but rather, a pure logic of boundary-making. As a matter of fact, in the Swiss neighbourhoods that Wimmer investigated, exclusionary sentiments and discourses were not directed towards immigrants per se but towards outsiders seen as undermining the established social and cultural order. In that case, immigrant residents were regarded as belonging to the âusâ or not depending on whether they were seen as complying with the rule of order and keeping common and public places tidy. Therefore, antimigrant attitudes may be nourished by the feeling of loss of social order often reflected in migrantsâ use of places according to different and unfamiliar rules. In this regard, an episode that happened in San Paolo is particularly enlightening. Here, groups of Peruvians used the volleyball field of the SPA gardens until late at night listening to music and speaking loudly, raising complaints from people living nearby. Then meetings aimed at defusing the tensions were organized with the support of the District administration. Surprisingly, the more inflexible positions were held by long-established Peruvians residents who â as they themselves admitted â were in favour of the implementation of strict rules whereas native residents were more open to negotiation and compromise. The conflict was finally solved thanks not just to rules being agreed for the use of this place, but also to a light re-planning which made it possible to move the fields farther from the apartment buildings. This episode confirms Wimmerâs view that conflict does not necessarily express latent racist attitudes but may actually just be about accepting the established local order. A specific lesson from our case studies in the city chapters is that the connecting potential of public places also depends on rules of use, the absence or ineffectiveness of which can generate conflicts quickly turning into âmoral clashesâ along ethnic lines. From our fieldwork, we can derive some hypotheses on how to improve the effectiveness of site-specific sets of rules. In the first place, these rules can be partially embedded in spaces. Indeed, sometimes the very setting of the place suggests the ways in which it should be used thereby limiting negotiation and preventing conflicts; in other cases, places are very open to different uses and the agreement on them is completely delegated to users who could be unable to find a satisfying arrangement. If the first option tends to limit conflicts, overly neat distinctions between areas designed for specific purposes can also limit contacts. For instance, in the SPA gardens in San Paolo or the Tres Xemenies Park in Poble Sec specialized areas (a skateboarding area and basket or football fields for adolescents, playgrounds for children, benches for elderly people, etc.) certainly prevent conflicts but also seem to prevent meaningful interactions since each group uses a specific area without contacts with others. This sort of space planning conducive to inter-group encounters should not, however, be seen as something mechanical or deterministic and it can also be the object of negotiation, as in the case of SPA gardens in San Paolo mentioned above. The second element which can help to identify common rules of use for places is formal or informal mediation facilitated by organized actors such as associations,"

This includes prayer groups, openair preaching, and a focus on productive responsibilities to the nuclear family, and the church community. For witches, it is taboo to touch a broom or coconut husks (used for cleaning saucepans or making fires for cooking), thus indicating that they are immune to the normal work that women do. Tidiness, productivity, order, and female beauty are central qualities in the Pentecostal church and qualities that are resisted by witches. Witches in the Trobriands used to be anonymous and had hidden relational capacities. Now, women may suddenly start confessing inside Pentecostal churchesâadmitting that they are hiding witchcraft capacities inside their body. By confessing and clearing the place taken up by the witch creature, they leave this space to Jesus. In addition to confession, the means for doing this is also to convert to a life of righteous, âclean,â production. This also involves commerce, as work with the banana leaf bundles that used to constitute the most important womenâs wealth (a classic ethnographic case of gendered exchange) shifts into making new products for the tourist market (MacCarthy, n.d.). This in many ways converges with Newellâs (2007) point about Cote dâIvoire: that the focus of Pentecostals with regard to witchcraft is on material success and money, which thus intertwines with moral issues raised around capitalism. The attention, then, is on the convergence of faith and financial success (Newell 2007, p. 479). The relationship between sorcery and the economy is also the concern of Knut Myhre in Chap. 7. He describes how Chagga-speaking people in Tanzania understand the phenomenon of the albino murders that have become a national concern in recent years. According to news reports albinos are targeted for their body parts, which are used in witchcraft to bring people good luck. Body parts, and especially albino body parts, have become part of an informal economy, portrayed in the media as a perverted trade. Myhreâs argument goes in a different direction to the occult economy argument proposed by Comaroff and Comaroff (1999). The latter proposed that discourses about witchcraft, cannibalism, bloodsucking, and organ-snatching in Africa are metaphoric ways of addressing and critiquing the ârealâ economy of capitalism. Myhreâs important point here is that the circulation of body parts is not necessarily about the economy, but may instead be something equally as ârealâ as the economy: that is, it is about life itself and modes of being, since, for the Chagga, âwitchcraft and life fold out of and into each other.â (Myhre,"

In a photographic reversal, that is, Lucy is able to see us. For Jacob, it is as though âunbidden, he had glimpsed Lucy in another realmâ (218). The distance between past and present is elided. Indeed, both novels have been criticised in reviews for psychological anachronism. For Susan Elderkin, Lucy is too modern, âeerily ahead of her timeâ and the portrait of the period is unconvincing: âreferences to Dickens and pink bonnets come as a surpriseâ (Elderkin, 2004). For Ion Martea, the novel âfails to bring the insight into the period the author had intended to deliverâ (Martea, undated review). Humphreys, too, has been criticised for creating an anachronistic heroine. Andrea Barrett observes that Annie âreshapes Isabelleâs thinking about proper representations of womenâ and, therefore, Annie âcan seem both too good to be true and anachronistic, her character shaped by class and gender issues that belong to our time and not hersâ (Barrett, 2001). For Elderkin, Martea and Barrett these anachronisms represent chronological and historiographical confusion and a serious failing in an historical novel. However, I would argue that the use of anachronism contributes to the sense that the Victorian past continues to exist in uncanny forms today; it suggests its absent presence. The sense of linear disruption is consolidated in Afterimage through the immediacy of its present tense. It suggests a kind of afterlife, or, more properly as Humphreysâ title suggests, an âafterimageâ, a picture that continues to be visible, in altered form, after its original has vanished. It is memory, seeking to hold onto the transient and, in the process, transfiguring it. These novels proceed as memory does for Benjamin, in fragments, connecting events according to âresemblancesâ or âcorrespondencesâ (Benjamin, 1968a: 211). They offer themselves as aberrant repetitions of the Victorian period, suggesting that what is important is not that the past is accurately known, or fully understood or made sense of, but that it is remembered in fractured form, as shards of memory. Jones suggests that âwords and images do not have achieved reparation within them, what they have are the gestures towards reparationâ ( Jones, 2006). Like Lucyâs notebook of âSpecial Things Seenâ, the historical novel becomes, here, a kind of shrine, a âkind of honouring attentionâ (200). Thus, a scene in Sixty Lights in which Lucy sees a gaslit street in London âremade in a quivery film of lightâ provides a model for thinking about memory and historical recollection in the novel. Moreover, it provides a model for thinking about Jonesâ project as an historical novelist or,"

This compassion with fragile masculinity was also seen in the oldest generation, whereas the middle generation of women were in need of constructing their fathers as strong. Could it be that the identificatory love for the father gives a different dynamic in womenâs and menâs craving for gender difference? Whereas men want to preserve gender difference because it is important to their own sense of masculinity, women want to protect the menâs feeling of masculinity because they sense their fragility. However, the longitudinal data with the youngest generation also indicates that the protection of the father has more realistic proportions as the daughters become adult women and see him more clearly as the person he is, not as a fantasised object, whether idealised or sentimentalised."

The visual level is the main step in spatial knowledge. On the visual level, students recognize a ï¬gure as a whole and are able to represent it as a mind vision. Note that Van Hiele (1986) states that âthe levels are situated not in the subject matter, but in the thinking of manâ and Arcavi (2003) suggests that visualization can be considered as a method of âseeing the unseen.â Moreover, Viholainen (2006) states that âvisual thinking is probably the most usual type of informal thinking in mathematics.â At the visual level, therefore, the student: â¢ identiï¬es, compares, and sorts shapes on the basis of their appearance as a whole; â¢ solves problems using general properties and techniques (e.g., overlaying, measuring); â¢ uses informal language; â¢ does not analyse in terms of attributes.

Confronted with the need to be resourceful, the neighborhood becomes their point of reference, the gang their base: their pals in the neighborhood are an invaluable support, but they are also very aware how fragile this link is, as their friends are as impoverished as they themselves are and may up and leave at any moment. Meanwhile, they have some good times together, trying for a moment to forget the hopelessness of their situation (Dubet 1987) and trying to keep their problems to a minimum. Their pathways reveal how they combine their different experiences of symbolic (and sometimes physical) violence, social and personal problems, all of which are intensified by the obviously unstable economy, and creating a vicious circle from which it is, at the time, impossible for them to escape. For these young adults, the absence of any career and personal perspective (no stable job, when will they ever be able to move away from home?) leaves them feeling that they have been abandoned by society, as a result of which they withdraw a little further still into themselves and their neighborhood.

Through such decomposition, we can create constructive information for other regions. Using such information, one might be able to conclude, for example, that Komiyama-san uses this heat-insulation system, and that such a type would be better in Okinawa. Another might say that Komiyama-sanâs solar cell could be used also in that region. Komiyama House is only one of many cases. There may be few cases where Komiyama House can apply directly. It is then important to âfactorizeâ each case into individual elements and abstract common elements to create a universal solution. The paper-medium Platinum Handbook has a similar structure. It is not a collection of examples of experiments themselves, but it is structured, with the table of contents giving shape to the structure. The Platinum Handbook, based on IT, permits users to make a table of contents freely from their own perspective.

261,217,0.989,The Poetics and Politics of Alzheimerâs Disease Life-Writing,"Surely, Graboysâs closing with âa search for hope and courageâ (178) could, next to being read as the note of a âsurvivorâ, be interpreted as ï¬tting into mainstream conceptualisations of masculinity. The formal layout of this book suggests that I perceive of the caregiver discourse as much more evidently gendered than the patient discourse. Still, we are compelled to ask, whether male as compared to female patients generally portray their condition differently; whether such a difference goes beyond the telling of a purportedly seamless narrative, the artistic exploitation of their condition, or the formal underplaying of their concerns. In Chap. 5, I look at narratives offered by patients who published their stories once the Alzheimerâs patient movement had fully taken off. This gives me the opportunity to investigate more deeply whether the patient discourse is as strictly gendered as the caregiver discourse seems to be, and whether there are forms of dementia life-writing that enable patients to remain true to their narrative abilities, bringing poetics and politics in unison."

93,389,0.989,Nordic Mediation Research,"Three of the questions in the child questionnaire concern childrenâs experience of the child conversation: âWere you able to say what you wanted to the mediator? Did the mediator understand what you meant? Did you enjoy talking to the mediator?â In the vast majority of cases the children expressed very positive experiences from the child conversation. Most of them found that they to a great extent were able to say what they wanted to say. On the visual, analogue scale from sad face (0%) to smiley face (100%), half the children put a mark against 100%. Seventy per cent of the children put the mark between 90 and 100%. Median score is 93% of the maximum when it comes to how children experience being able to say what they want to the mediator. For the question about whether the mediator understood what the child meant, the average of the marks given by the children was 92%. The average of the childrenâs marks for whether they liked talking to the mediator was 86% of the maximum. The childrenâs opinion was also sought on the inclusion of children in mediation in general: âDo you think that children and young people should be able to take part in mediation?â The children were very positive towards this. The average level of the childrenâs marks was 88% of the maximum positive. The ï¬fth and last question where the children were asked to mark a long, visual, analogue scale was: âDid you want to take part in the mediation when your parents suggested it?â The average of the childrenâs markings in this case was 64%. In the study we were interested in possible variations when childrenâs experiences were compared with different features of the situation the child and the family were in. Figure 2 illustrates the correlation between the childrenâs experience of being able to say what they wanted to the mediator, and the degree of conï¬ict between the parents. The X-axis in the ï¬gure shows the mediatorâs assessment of the conï¬ict level, with âno conï¬ictâ on the far left and âvery high conï¬ictâ on the far right. The Y-axis shows childrenâs experience of being able to say what they wanted to the mediator, where 0% is a sad face and 100% is a smiley face. As the ï¬gure shows, the children experienced to a very great extent that they were able to say what they wanted to the mediator, also in cases where the mediator had assessed a high degree of conï¬ict between the parents. For each percentage point of conï¬ict level increase,"

187,388,0.989,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"CI [3]. (2) An emergency or disaster may emerge from a CI. A technical failure in the electricity infrastructure may lead to a blackout and further cascading effects [4]. (3) An infrastructure may be a resource for response and mitigation actions. This might not be immediately obvious, but may come as a late insight when this infrastructure fails or even gets destroyed [5]. An example is a bridge in eastern Germany that was washed away by a fluvial flood. The local responders were no longer able to send forces to the other riverside, and did not have an alternative plan for that situation. In most cases, it is not possible for crisis managers to revert a decision or an action already takenâin reality. However, in simulation it is possible to do exactly this: âgo back in timeâ and explore a different course of action. This allows answering hypothetical questions like âWhat would happen if I take a different decision or follow a different course of action?â. Therefore, this is also sometimes called âwhat-if analysisâ. Since this type of what-if analysis requires simulation, it is rather suited for training purposes. Providing such what-if analysis as a capability to end-users is the essential idea behind the training system CIPRTrainer, which we will present in detail in the main part of this chapter. CIPRTrainer is the software system that enables crisis managers to train decision-making in crises and emergencies involving cascading effects of CIs. CIPRTrainer constitutes an unprecedented training opportunity that complements standard command post, table-top, or physical exercises. The expected beneï¬ts would be increased awareness of crisis managers of the role and behaviour of interconnected CIs in disasters, emergencies, and crisis situations, and a better understanding of possible consequences of scenario evolution and the influence of own actions. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. We continue with briefly embedding the CIPRTrainer approach to what-if analysis into the state of the art and then proceed with characterising the types of complex crisis scenarios that we designed for the CIPRTrainer prototype. Then we will give an overview of the building blocks of CIPRTrainer, explaining how we technically realised it. The following section will then provide an overview of how we realised impact and consequence analysis (CA) for the global assessment of damages and how it is employed for what-if analysis. We continue with explaining how CIPRTrainer is actually used and with an example of a training session. An outlook on the next version of CIPRTrainer and a conclusion end this chapter. For reference, we included a list of acronyms and a bibliography."
271,599,0.989,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"The research interest of Klein et al. lies in establishing how media play a part in five life spheres: work, intimate relations, parenthood, asset building, and civil society engagement: âwhich role does the intervieweesâ media repertoires play in their conduct of life with respect to disturbances and copingâ (364). In pursuing this aim they are concerned with exploring how the participantsâ own horizon of relevance can be given priority: what method can ensure a large measure of openness while retaining the researcherâs thematic focus on media? The obvious problem faced by many qualitative researchers is that if researchers state their media-focused research interest in their initial framing of the interview and frequently during the course of the interview, âthey might steer the intervieweesâ response behaviourâ (366) and impose a media-centric focus which may not accurately reflect how the interviewees perceive media in the different life spheres. In order to find a solution to this problem, Klein et al. devise an impressively systematic research design, which takes into account that media-centrism is a continuum. They set up a taxonomic methodological system of media-centrism, which enables researchers to choose the degree of media-centrism that best serves the knowledge interest of their project (Table 15.1: 372). Out of the taxonomyâs nine possible interview strategies they select four for experimental testing, with an increasing order of media-centrism: â¢ Strategy 1: The least mediacentric interview strategy, in which the researcher does not mention media at all, waiting for interviewees to spontaneously bring media into the talk. â¢ Strategy 3: Media are mentioned in a non-conspicuous way at the beginning of the interview, and are only brought in at the very end after having dealt with the life spheres. â¢ Strategy 4: Media are mentioned in a non-conspicuous way at the beginning of the interview, and are brought in explicitly after each of the life spheres has been dealt with. â¢ Strategy 2: Media are emphatically mentioned at the beginning of the interview, and are also brought in explicitly after each of the life spheres has been dealt with. The analysis of these four interviewing strategies then looked for the prominence that media repertoires displayed in the participantsâ accounts"
137,324,0.989,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"When asked about negative experience there was some diversity in the answers. Some had experienced social isolation and went on about how much easier it seemed to be for mothers to break out of the isolation. To begin with, the mothers had sometimes bonded with other expecting women in pre-natal courses and sometimes had formed a group on Facebook that they used to discuss their experience as well as planning outings and social gatherings. Then there are organized âmother-morningsâ in some of the churches in ReykjavÃ­k (Icelandâs capital) and even though fathers are officially welcome only one had given it a try and he did not enjoy the experience. And finally there are simply more women than men at home during daytime. But the isolation was on the whole not a major issue and in some cases brought about enjoyable new experience: Well obviously you experience isolation when you are at home and all others are workingâ¦ I met with a lot of people that I usually would not meet. I very often took him to see all his grandparents and aunts and cousins and so on, people that I usually would not visit without a specific reason. You just went when you knew that someone was at home. So this of course is one indication of isolation that you start looking for new companyâ¦ even though that company was also very enjoyable. [7]"
192,346,0.989,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"although Beard is presented as a perpetrator, this does not mean that he is completely unsusceptible to the ethical side of things. He manages to produce a story that makes life morally liveable for him. During internal, first-person deliberations (long before the accusation of plagiarism is actually put before him), Beard argues that, although Tom Aldous indeed produced all the valuable ideas, it was Beard himself who recognised the true value of Tomâs work. In fact, while Tom was basically an intellectual, Beard had been the person who had done the âhard workâ: securing patents, assembling a consortium, managing the lab work, involving venture capital (p. 258). Via Beardâs activities, Tomâs work would endure. In other words, Beard defines his collaboration with Aldous in terms of a Master-Servant relationship. Beard appropriates Tomâs ideas because he is able to valorise them, by transforming knowledge into money. Ironically, the term âvalorisationâ, so often used in this context, is actually of Marxist origin (âVerwertungâ). Instead of simply abolishing Tomâs intellectual property rights, Beard claims to be able to sublate them, by making Tomâs esoteric insights generally applicable. If he had left Tomâs ideas unused, it would surely have destroyed them, but now Tomâs body of knowledge is resurrected as it were, making his perishable file imperishable. A mere pile of notes becomes a planetary knowledge network (absorbed into what Pierre Teilhard de Chardin referred to as the noosphere). Beard continues to work on Tomâs file while involved in the New Mexico solar project. At the certain point, for instance, he finds himself âthinking with strange lucidity about his old friend the photon and a detail in Tom Aldousâs notes about the displacement of an electron. There might be an inexpensive way of improving a second generation of panels, when he was back in London he would blow the dust off that fileâ (p. 363). In other words, the âcollaborationâ between the two continues long after Tomâs death. Both Tomâs original work and Beardâs valorisations are necessary to turn the formerâs brilliant ideas into a functioning prototype, one could argue. And towards the end of the novel, when he is actually accused of plagiarism, Beard defends himself by claiming that Tom and he had indeed worked together âintensivelyâ (p. 370) on artificial photosynthesis. But then again, Beard relapses into his fatal strategy of down-playing and obfuscating the value of Tomâs contribution completely, claiming that he, Beard (whose work had been in light, in energy, in photons and electrons, ever since the age of twenty), had done most of the âthinking and talkingâ, while Tom had only made the notes. Although these claims are clearly invalid (Tom had written his notes without any intellectual support from Beard), there is some validity in the argument that Beard (as a manager, not as a researcher) had significantly contributed to their joint achievement (the translation of theoretical ideas into useful applications). He could have âsolvedâ his problem, in accordance with formal standards concerning intellectual property, by explicitly sharing the honour with Tom, by formally acknowledging the latterâs decisive contribution. Technically, a solution could have been fleshed out, and it would even have been genuine co-authorship, rather than mere honorary authorship. The problem is that Beard opted for âsole attributionâ (p. 259), partly for financial reasons: because of the patents involved, but first and foremost because he desperately needed Tomâs legacy so as to compensate for the loss of his"
185,139,0.989,The Essence of Software Engineering,"2 Other Kinds of Software It is worth noting that the word âsoftwareâ is applied to artifacts from domains other than computing. In entertainment, for example, software is sometimes used to describe programmatics, such as videos and television productions. The term seems to be used to contrast this sort of product with âhardwareâ, which refers to physical devices such as VCRs, CD players, and television sets. There are other domains that seem to be very much about âsoftwareâ but some of these domains may not ever use the word, nor be very conscious of the relevance of what is known about computer software to what they do. Thus, we guide our search for an understanding of what âsoftwareâ is by searching for other disciplines that seem to deal with âsoftwareâ, even if they may not use that term in describing their work. Thus, for example, it might suffice to simply identify points of similarity between what computer software engineers do and what is done by practitioners of these other disciplines."
299,453,0.989,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"gestures, do not âreach out and touch someone,â but instead use mainly their voices to convey affect. We choose our words carefully: We refer to the presentation of emotions that leads humans who interact with AI caregivers to believe that these machines have emotions. Without this feature, AI caregivers are unable to perform much of their care. Following this definition has another major benefit: it excludes from the domain under study all programs that provide exclusively or mainly cognitive services. A prime example of these is Google Assistant. It provides answers to questions, gives customized suggestions to fit the userâs preferences, and helps with tasks such as booking flights or making dinner reservations, among other things. Google Assistant presents no emotions; although people can find expression of emotions in anything, there is nothing in Google Assistant that fosters such projections. Other, mainly cognitive services by AI-driven software include Appleâs Siri and Microsoftâs Cortana, which have been designed to reveal a human touch, a rather limited sense of humor, but still do not qualify as AI caregivers because they are used mostly as a source of information. (In short, these programs are not caregivers and hence are not examined further here; online tutors are also mainly cognitive agents and are also not discussed.) Chat bots constitute a somewhat more complicated case. There is no formal definition of what constitutes a chat bot. However, to the extent that these are mainly interactive, informative agents, they fall into the cognitive category and are not AI caregivers. This is true even if they are given some mannerisms to make them seem friendlier, such as greeting one by oneâs first name when one queries them, say, about the best place to have dinner. Other chat bots are designed to display emotions in order to manipulate those they interact with, acting like humans who work in sales. An extreme position holds that all such interactive relationships between humans and AI caregivers are unethical because, by definition, AI caregivers display emotions that they do not have, and hence the relationships are âfalseâ and âinauthentic.â Robert Sparrow makes an applicable point about robot pets: âIf robot pets are designed and manufactured with the intention that they should serve as companions for people, and so that those who interact with them are likely to develop an emotional attachment to them, on the basis of false beliefs about them, this is unethicalâ (2002). Sharkey and Sharkey offer a more nuanced view; they grant that illusion is a part of Artificial Intelligence, but draw a line between imagination, or a willing suspension of disbelief, and actual belief. Thus, they maintain that AI researchers must be honest and transparent about their designs in order to avoid deceit (2006, pp. 9â19). However, people are exposed to mild forms of ingratiation and false expressions of solicitude by many sales personnel, financial advisers, politicians, and others. The same is true about many people who read and apply the lessons of Dale Carnegieâs How to Win Friends and Influence People. There seems no obvious reason to treat AI caregivers more strictly than humans.4 To the extent these kinds of manipulative AI caregivers (and humans) need to be restrained depends on whether or not they cause harm and the level of that harm, granted manipulation is never ethical. If the harm is minimal, it seems reasonable to"
4,202,0.989,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"assumption: that whatever may be the differences in the children assigned to one or the other teacher, they are captured by the âbaselineâ measure of learning or development (which, generally, is learning outcomes at the end of the previous grade). Put differently, estimates of value added assume that any difference in learning gains, as opposed to learning levels, can be attributed to teachersâespecially when the comparison is limited to children taught by different teachers within the same school. A great deal of research has gone into testing this hypothesis. An influential paper by Rothstein (2010) used rich data from North Carolina to show that future teachers predict earlier learning gains. This is an indication that teachers and children were not matched with each other at random, and that the characteristics of teachers and children that determined the match may bias estimates of value added. More recent work by Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014), however, argues that estimates of teacher value added are a good indication of that teacherâs effect on learning, uncontaminated by possible differences across students. For example, in one set of estimates, the authors focus on teachers who change schools. Headmasters in one school may have different objectives than those in another school, and the student population may vary a great deal between schools. Even so, when a teacher with a positive value added changes schools, the value added in the school she leaves goes down, and the value added in the school she joins goes up, by proportionately the same amount, on average. This suggests that a teacher carries her âvalue addedâ with her, and this is largely independent of the school, headmaster, or student body. Another concern with estimates of value added is that, even if they are causal, these estimates appear to vary a great deal for the same teacher from one year to the next. Part of that variation may be because some teachers are more effective at teaching a particular group of students, and the composition of their classroom varies from one year to the nextâeven if this is by chance alone. It may also be that teachers have a particularly good or bad year. Finally, measurement error of various sorts will tend to dampen the correlation of estimated value added for a given teacher in different years. Put differently, the same teacher may be equally effective in one year and the next, but measurement error will make it appear as if her effectiveness has changed across years."
137,563,0.989,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"of full-time leave, beyond the usual period of paternity leave immediately after the birth of the child, as a personal âoptionâ rather than a taken-for-granted individual entitlement to work-family balance. Acceptance tends to be faster and more neutral in public and female-dominated workplaces and legal protection provides an important framework for negotiation in more adverse work environments. Finally, in a third set of countries, where statutory, well-paid, non-transferable rights to full-time parental leave do not exist (e.g. Switzerland, UK, France) and where cultural and labour market contexts tend to favour the long-hour male breadwinner model (e.g. Japan), the very rare fathers trying to share part of the leave find it even harder. It is not only the initial barriers to leave that have to be overcome but also the censorial attitudes and the social isolation associated with a practice that is not endorsed explicitly or, in some instances, legally by society. Rather than mere forerunners, these fathers are described in this book as âpioneerâ figures with a âfrontier spiritâ. Leave can come at a heavy price, both personally (isolation) and socially (social stigma, severe work penalties, having to âplay downâ parental involvement) and is therefore easier to take up for fathers who are highly qualified, can rely on significant educational and financial resources, whose wives invest in their jobs/career, or that have work environments that for some reason (e.g. generous company-based entitlements) provide more openings for fathersâ work-family balance. The variations in fathersâ parental leave entitlements and arrangements add to the complexity of policy impact on fathersâ experiences of leave alone. In the studies reported in this book (with the exception of France) fathers took at least thirty days of full-time leave in a âhome aloneâ manner when the mother returns to work. Even with this criterion, however, there is some diversity in respect of the nature and use of leave across and within the different national contexts. For example, the duration and the type of leave entitlement seem to impact on the experiences and nature of fatherâs involvement. Being on leave for 1 month full-time when the mother returns to work may be a different experience from taking leave for 2 or more months or the same number of months as the mother; and having an individual non-transferable right to parental leave is different from being on leave through a maternal transfer of leave. Although a systematic comparison between fathers who took less and those who took many months of leave is not carried out in this book, several contributions suggest that taking a longer period of leave, beyond 1 or 2 months, impacts strongly both on the experience of leave (e.g. identifying, rather than just sympathizing, with mothers who take long stay-at-home periods of leave) and the negotiation of parental roles (e.g. more confidence and assertiveness with regard to equal and individualized parenting routines, cf. chapters on Norway, Quebec, Portugal). On the other hand, when leave design is based on maternal transfer of leave and there is weak formal institutional support, leave can be experienced as a âgiftâ offered by the mother (cf. Chapter on UK), thereby underlining an implicit understanding of parental leave as a maternal entitlement and the naturalness of women taking paramount responsibility for the care of young children. The normative context, especially in respect of gender roles in work and family, thus interacts with the policy environment in shaping the perceptions and experi-"

When students commence their university education, they experience ontological shifts and identity transformations that may be akin to âpassing through a portalâ and an âopening up of a new and inaccessible way of thinking about somethingâ (Meyer and Land 2005). Threshold Concepts, as deï¬ned by Meyer and Land (2003) are âthresholdâ because they have features that are transformative, irreversible, integrative, bounded, potentially troublesome, discursive and reconstitutive. We acknowledge that there are many threshold concepts that come into play when becoming a student, including those relating to language, knowledge creation, theories, frameworks, writing, creativity and many more. We focus speciï¬cally here on aspects of the liminal space experienced by those who are learning to be a student, rather than identifying the speciï¬c threshold concepts themselves. Once a student registers at a university and begins a speciï¬c programme of study, there are multiple thresholds and transitions that students must negotiate in order to successfully complete their university journey within the particular programme. We consider what happens when students at all levels, across all programmes, are positioned in a higher education transitional space that requires the crossing of interwoven and multilayered thresholds. For us, the theory of Threshold Concepts and Liminality (Meyer and Land 2003) captures the processes of a university journey, the pivotal stage-like trajectories4 of a university experience. Liminality reflects the transitions (positive and negative, smooth and choppy) that transform old to new being and learning along the student journey. Liminality helps us better comprehend the complex and multi layered nature of a university experience; it helps to understand and support transitions or âtransformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape â¦ [and] world viewâ (Meyer and Land 2003, p. 1). In this paper, we aim to capture and qualify the transitional process characterised by liminality and explore its potential to influence practice for all stakeholders within higher education. This area of study has previously received little attention in a European student experience context. We draw on empirical data collected through an institution-wide student experience survey (SES) conducted at University College, Cork (UCC). The UCC SES aims to capture âclose-upâ expectations, perceptions, hopes and aspirations of students at all stages and at all levels of the student journey."
117,64,0.989,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Concern, Volition and Practice in the Nursing Context If nursing is to be understood as care, it is thus to be presumed that the quaternary phenomenology of careâthat is not only the appeal, as I have attempted to show, but also concern, volition and practiceâis similarly reflected in nursing.15 I now wish to conclude my investigation with a brief look at where the reflections of concern, volition and practice in the context of nursing can be found. Just as the nursing care-giver wishes to be appealed to, he or she subsequently wishes every appeal to become his or her concern. The care accommodated to become nursing is concerned with that which has appealed to it. The Principle of Concern states: the nursing caregiver wishes to be concerned with that which was allowed to make the appeal. An appeal is not only noted, but also made a cause for concern. This cause for concern manifests itself in the direct volition to do something for the sake of the source of the appeal. The Principle of Volition and Practice in Nursing thus states: the nursing care-giver wishes to take practical action for the sake of the concern."
57,71,0.989,"Research, Ethics and Risk in the Authoritarian Field","depoLiticizing tHe researcH One of the clearest, most commonly agreed recommendations in the emerging literature on fieldwork in authoritarian circumstances is to âframe the research topic in a way that has the best chance of reducing any sensitivity around itâ (Art 2016, 980). This appears to be a common practice among scholars of the post-Soviet region, as reported in the Central Eurasian Studies Societyâs recent task force report on fieldwork safety. According to their survey, â(m)any respondents admitted to adjusting the presentation of their research topic to decrease risk. Some respondents indicated that they either do not disclose their real research topics to anyone or change how they describe their work depending on the context, whether a government institution, university, etc.â (CESS 2016, 6). The report also mentions that a âsmall minority reports outright misrepresenting their purpose for being in-country, a practice that we [the taskforce] find ill-advisedâ (CESS 2016, 7) because of the risk it poses to local helpers after publication of the real research. Making research sound âbland and grayâ, avoiding âphrases that hint at political curiosity or other sensitive topicsâ (Turner 2013, 398) is apparently also a usual approach to field research in socialist East Asian states including China, Laos, and Vietnam (Cornet 2013; Petit 2013; Sowerwine 2013, all cited in Turner 2013; Reny 2016). Country specialists on Iran (Malekzadeh 2016), Kazakhstan (Gentile 2013), and Rwanda (Loyle 2016) all refer to similar strategies.

How does one cope with different, diverging or even opposing wants and needs? How can different views on urban nature and green developments be integrated? Who defines what benefits, qualities, good and healthy urban life are at all? How does one cope with the uneven integration of people into participative and opinion-building processes? In the literature on UES, e.g., there are some studies that point to different perceptions, wants and needs of urban dwellers (e.g. Botzat et al. 2016; Gentin 2011) as well as their different opportunities to make use of or benefit from urban nature (Jones et al. 2009). There is a need to link the NBS or âgreenâ debate with (social science based) debates on urban diversity, inequalities, capabilities, and (in)justice. Existing studies on UGI, UES and NBS have so far a bias with regard to the views and perceptions of middle-class inhabitants and the needs and wants of specific (environment-minded) lifestyle groups; this largely by-passes the views of various precarious population groups including the unemployed, poor families, alternative subcultures, migrants, other minorities (see Berbes-Blazques et al. 2016). The ecogentrification debate, again, considers this fact, stating that ecological projects or solutions often designated for a bourgeois aesthetic (Dooling 2009) and that urban gardening and farms picture a niche or âglossy representations of sustainabilityâ (Steinberg 2015). By and large, the views of low-income groups or people not taking part in participatory events tend to be less considered when discussing on green developments, the potentials of UES or NBS as solutions for a sustainable neighbourhood development. If we really want to understand the potential of NBS for contributing to social cohesion, communication, empowerment, reduction of inequities etc., we must acknowledge the wide range of potentially opposing perceptions, wants and needs. The development of a more differentiated view and, as explored by Low (2013), the consideration of matters of distributional (Is there green space for all and a fair allocation?), procedural (Is there a fair access to green space?) and interactional justice (Does the green space allow for all to interact safely?) when creating and implementing NBS such as parks, playgrounds or other types of open space would be a large progress for the whole debate on NBS and would it make more than just a middle-class discussion. Solutions that directly address the needs of disadvantaged groups would offer an incentive for those people to get involved and would directly contribute to social inclusiveness. Particularly now, in a situation where most larger European cities are seeing new waves of in-migration and immigration including international migrants and (non-European) refugees, the question of how different parts of urban society look at urban nature and how this nature can be employed for different needs and wants, long-term or even temporary, seems to be crucial. It remains to be seen whether the NBS concept has the capacity to develop such a differentiated view. Thesis 5 NBS as they are discussed run the risk to get overloaded regarding their capacities to respond to societal questions and to be easily transferable."
118,625,0.989,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"18.5 Conclusion Histories of engineering education have examined how the training of engineers positioned them with respect to larger societal roles [22, p. 739]. In the postFukushima world, nuclear engineers are positioned to assume a new social role. In fact, this is what they are being instructed to do. Students are learning from their professors about the widespread severity of the Fukushima events on the future of the nuclear industry. Students were told that they were at the Summer School to learn how to communicate in a global society. They have been charged with rebuilding the trust of the nuclear engineering community; a task that they have inherited, like it, or not. They are being asked to think and act differentlyâto challenge their professors, to challenge all of their assumptions, to find their own answers. Students are hearing that it is time to expand the scope of nuclear engineering. Programs are being restructured. The Summer School provides those that are doing the restructuring with good evidence about: the value of discussion as a tool to facilitate critical reflection; the importance of collaboration for enabling engineers to inhabit new societal roles; and the necessity of incorporating student perspectives during curriculum reforms in a way that allows students to become active participants in shaping the future of nuclear engineering."

The migration away from 1024-bit keys provided an opportunity to follow the progression of the connectivity in our WoT after several of its hubs were removed. The preliminary results for this work have been shared with a group of Debian developers. Historically, the usual practice for key signing has been to generate non-expiring signatures; people that have already cross-signed their keys donât have an incentive to refresh their trust. There is an ongoing discussion as to whether this practice should change towards time-limited signatures, better modeling ongoing social relationships, or to stick to current practice. As mentioned in Sect. 4, the survival study has so far been done around individual keys; work is underway so that a personâs activity can be properly represented instead of following keys as separate individuals. The resulting survival analysis can be used to generate cohort tables that further explain the keyring population for demographics, [4]. The outlined methodology can also be extended by introducing covariates such as the number of signatures received or network measures; this study was done only on the Debian Developers keyring, it would be interesting to compare with the more loosely connected Debian Maintainers keyring. We also want to further explain the keyrings by stratification. The survival analysis showcases good health of the Debian Developers keyring (which makes up the mass of Debianâs WoT). Finally, the methodology followed for this study could be applied to other free software projects, aiming to correlate with events and trends spanning a wider population than Debianâs; the applicability of our work to other projects, however, depends on having a proper data set to base the work off. We are not aware of other projects having curated keyrings in a fashion that allows for analysis of their evolution over time. Acknowledgments.

Thus, the relevance of media set by the respondents can be controlled for, while at the same time there is no risk of fully omitting it in cases where the couples do not bring up the subject themselves. However, to the detriment of this approach, questions focusing on the respondentsâ media repertoires after the first set of questions could influence the relevance interviewees attach to media in the subsequently discussed life spheres, resulting in biased response behaviour. Consequently, the relevance the interviewee attaches to the role of media repertoire is distorted. The second option is to ask for media repertoires only at the end of the interview and after all the different life spheres have been addressed. These questions would encompass all domains and would make the respondent reflect upon the media impact in a comparative way without disturbing the flow of the interview for those who do not mention by themselves media as relevant to their conduct of life. Nonetheless, a disadvantage of this strategy could be the detachment of these media-related questions from the respective life spheres, requiring each interviewee to recollect them themselves. A third option is, again, not to ask for the middle-class couplesâ media repertoires at all. On the one hand, this strategy bears the advantage of leaving it solely to the interviewees to determine the mediaâs relevance to their conduct of life. On the other hand, this approach runs the risk that media repertoires are not mentioned by the respondents at all. Based on these two variables with three different options each, nine different strategies arise to investigate the role of media repertoires and media change as both sources of disturbances and as strategies of how to cope with them (see Table 15.1). These are neither to state the research interest, nor to ask questions targeting media, or not to state the mediarelated research interest, but to ask such questions either at the end of the entire interview or after each set of questions. Other strategies are to explicitly state the media-related research interest, not to further enquire unless the respondents address the topic themselves, or to again ask corresponding questions at the end of the interview or after each set of questions dealing with one of the identified life spheres. Finally, media change can be stated implicitly as one research interest among others, and then again, questions dealing with this area can be asked not at all, at the end of the interview or after each set of questions. From these options we decided against the strategies of not stating our interest in media use and media change.

271,97,0.989,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Our presentation of the friendship group as the central communicative figuration for the urban community construction of young people shows how important individual locations in the city are for this: places to which one goes on a night out, where one meets up, does things together, or experiences things together. Seen from this perspective, a location is a place with a special meaningânot something physically given, but places whose meaning is created by people through repeated and varied interaction (Massey 1994: 39; see also Berg and Roitsch 2015 and the contributions in Christmann 2016). Put another way, localities are, materially and physically, socio-culturally defined places with shared space for human interaction (Hepp 2015: 187). By referring here to mediatized places of community construction we seek to emphasize two things. First of all, the places are not simply something that is counterposed to the use of media. Instead, todayâs localities are largely created through media-related practices, and are in this sense themselves mediatized. Secondly, our interest is directed to those places that for young people have a great potential for creating a sense of community. We are thinking here of semi-public places, places to which young people have general access, depending upon their financial resources.

The adoption of such an approach in taking political or other decisions would undoubtedly cause chaos. It should therefore be rigorously distinguished and differentiated from massive but authentic democratic participation. The latter demands that all relevant stakeholders be given the opportunity to participate and a voice to argue over the issues that influence their lives. Votes should be weighted in some way in order to ensure that decisions take advantage of what we call âcollective wisdom.â This is not a trivial problem to solve. Identifying who the ârelevantâ stakeholders are and deciding who should have a (weighted) vote on which matters is extremely complex. Even when the theoretical challenges are resolved, we will need to develop systems that implement the theory. Athenians of the Golden Age were engaged collectively in searching and carefully examining meanings and alternatives together through a process they called âdeliberation.â They aimed to fully understand the underlying problems, clarify the debatable situation, and achieve consensus. More than two millennia later, we need to reinvent democracy in such a way that millions can participate effectively. We must guarantee that the individual will have access to all relevant information, alternatives, arguments, and predicted futures that might emerge according to the choices s/he makes. We will probably need to invent new liquid forms of democracy in which ideas can flow from crowds and are shaped through a process of open deliberation. Future citizens should somehow become capable of choosing alternatives by harvesting their collective intelligence and wisdom rather than allowing the personal interests and pathetic behaviors of individuals to prevail in the decisionmaking process. Since technology will be absolutely essential, the democratization of the processes of design and development of such new technologies also becomes a fundamental requirement. In addition, we must guarantee access and simplicity of interfaces. In sum, we should design spaces and technologies and implement policies that respect our cognitive constraints, safeguard our attention capabilities, and secure our individual human rights and freedoms. We ought to develop systems that guarantee the authentic participation of those whose lives might be influenced by any decisions taken. Courses of action should be chosen based on their capacity to facilitate change toward a collectively defined, desired, and agreed-upon ideal future state.

And if the world does not go to church, then the Church has to go to the world.â2 This priest is a youth priest with an active Facebook profile. He preaches and gives film reviews on local radio, publishes his own songs and preaches sermons on his YouTube channel. There are other examples which suggest that social media are an integral part of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany; for example, the organization for clerical professions and ecclesiastical services of the German bishop conference [Zentrum fÃ¼r Berufungspastoral der Deutschen Bischofskonferenz] started the project âValerieundderPriesterâ in 2016,3 in which a young non-religious female journalist accompanies a priest and publishes her observations on different media formats such as blogs, Facebook, and YouTube. And even some of the German bishops themselves have begun to tweet. At first glance, social media seem to have arrived in the world of religious organizations: namely the Church. Nevertheless, religious organizationsâand the Catholic Church in particularâare said to be more reluctant to accept change than many other organizations. And furthermore, people seem to have different expectations of how the Catholic Church has to deal and interact with media: one example is the response to the aforementioned wedding, where reactionsâin magazines, television, newspapers as well as in social mediaâranged widely, from statements such as âFinally a Catholic priest who speaks casually and touches my heart!â to responses such as âNot a Church for pagans but a Church of pagans!â And within the religious organization itself, we can observe quite critical remarks regarding digital media: for example, the leader of the German bishop conference, Cardinal Marx, who stressed during a press conference in 2015 that âblogging sometimes leads to dementia, doesnât it?â.4 So, the crucial question remains: how exactly does the Roman Catholic Church act and react towards media? Depending on their perspective, academic studies emphasize either a high mediatization or a low mediatization of religious organizations with resistance to media change. What is the reason for such contradicting evaluations concerning religious organizations and how can they be explained? In this article, we analyze an exemplary religious organization, namely the Roman Catholic Church, and ask for specific resistance to media change.

In other cases where self-interest is involved, the distinctions are not so clear-cut, since pursuing self-interest on a personal as well as on an organizational level can have some moral value. Protection of oneâs own economic security has a moral dimension to it (Maitland, 2002, p. 5), and not standing up to defend oneâs own interests can be seen as a form of servility (Hill, 1985). Concrete cases, then, belong somewhere on the spectrum between purely real and purely false dilemmas. Anne has to decide whether to get the electricity back by giving in to blackmail from local bureaucrats, or stand firm and see the cement congeal. Where exactly does the situation belong on the scale between real and false dilemmas? That depends on the further details of the case. The analysis Anne has to make in preparation for a decision does not require a precise placing of the dilemma on the scale, but rather an acknowledgement of the general dilemma nature of the situation. Anneâs particular dilemma builds on a true story, where the outcome was that the project manager decided on a two-step response. First, she handed over the PCs and got the electricity back on to get the project on track again. The next day she invited senior bureaucrats from the town hall to a meeting, where she explained that the company wanted to contribute to the local community, but not in the haphazard way of the previous day. Instead, she proposed a systematic plan for how the company could help the town hall to modernize its PCs and other electronic equipment. With this initiative, she came on better and closer speaking terms with the local administration, and avoided further blackmail situations. The following case can serve to highlight how challenging it can be to face a situation close to the false dilemma end of the spectrum: Ben is the manager of a small private banking unit within a large financial services group. Results have slumped recently, mainly due to a bitter conflict between one employee and some of his colleagues. They complain that he is rude and difficult to cooperate with. Ben has attempted to mitigate, to no avail. National legislation prohibits the option of firing the quarrelsome employee, at least in the short run. Key members of Benâs unit have become very upset by the situation and have started to look for work elsewhere. A recent turn of events is that the employee himself has applied for a job in a different part of the financial services group. Ben has agreed to serve as a reference person.

This still applies. As one of the Agencyâs analysts said: [T]the logical conclusion is that citizens are willing to pay more tax if s/he can trust that all others (taxpayers) provide more and that s/he can trust that the political institutions provide us with better services in return.

119,375,0.989,Contemporary Issues in Human Rights Law : Europe and Asia,"Firstly, as a matter to be attended to when we introduce a German issue to Japan to review its constitutionality, Professor Tetsuharu Matsumoto37 notes that in Germany the idea of applying a strict test to the regulations on freely expressing opinions has not been adopted. According to him, there are differences between the thinking in Germany and the United States, since the US Supreme Court has applied a test mainly based on the First Amendment, and judicial reviews are incidental and concrete. In contrast, in Germany, he mentions how, when a review is conducted, it involves human dignity at its core, and, furthermore, the Constitutional Court can also conduct an abstract review. After adding that he does not have details of Germanyâs in-depth discussions, Professor Matsumoto speculates that it is difï¬cult under the German approach to describe freedom of speech as a dominant material value, because the concept of human dignity is at its core. In his view, whereas dealing with the conflicts between judicial reviews and democracy has been an issue in the United States, it might not arise in Germany, based on the Constitutional Courtâs competence in dealing with abstract reviews. The result of that conclusion for him is that, âit might be difï¬cult for the thought to arise that the courts should strictly review freedom of speech, when democracy is accepted as legitimate.â However, his observation is likely to require two considerations. The ï¬rst question is whether, in Germany, a conflict did not arise between judicial reviews and democracy.38 The other question, dealt with in this article, is whether there exists a German view on applying a strict test to regulations on the right to freely express opinions. With regard to this question, Professor Matsumoto refers to the views of Professor Shigenori Matsui, which are presented next. Professor Matsui says that there is no one approach to applying different tests to each aspect of fundamental human rights in Germany, and he asserts that the"

Thus, at a discursive level, the government was frequently trying to foment a new notion of rent distribution, coupling social welfare with collective organization and a broader ideological horizon of social transformation. At the same time, the stateâs lavish spending, which gave the impression of endless wealth, as well as its personalistic style of government, also contributed to reinforcing these notions, striking deep chords of the collective psyche. The habituated practice of soliciting help for solving individual problems was reproduced on a number of arenas. Ever since ChÃ¡vez was elected, people had the custom of trying to hand him personal notes with requests for help during public meetings. Indeed, when he traveled across the country, he was followed by personnel whose responsibility it was to collect these notes and catalogue them in a special office. Moreover, the vice-presidencyâvis-Ã -vis the presidential palaceâhad an office dedicated to processing citizensâ emergencies and difficulties with other institutions. The task of this office however, rather than providing assistance directly, was to turn to other state entities (i.e., a hospital, a municipal government, a social security entity) and try to find solutions. As a last resort, people came to this office from all over the country. Individual attempts for problem-solving was also on display every day in the top national newspaper, Ultimas Noticias. It has a section whereby people can call or send short messages by SMS. It contained as string of requests directed to the government or President ChÃ¡vez, or sometimes to a particular institution or just anybody, to, for instance, supply credit for a car so that someone can make a living as a taxi driver, or to provide material for constructing a house, or a lap-top for the childrenâs education. I want to reiterate that it is not my intention to be patronizing or condescending toward peopleâs efforts to solve their problems as best they can. Rather, the persistence of these practicesâreflecting a political imagery as much as historically habituated mechanism of problem-solvingâ must intrinsically be understood through a structural perspective. As long as needs are still widespread, and universal access to welfare is hampered by continuous poverty and patchy state policies, these practices necessarily reflect peopleâs attempts to find âa way inâ and a last resort when other options are exhausted. Fundamentally, these practices are intimately interwoven into political culture across Latin America, reflecting particular patterns of post-colonial state formation in societies characterized by hierarchical social formations and the monopolization of access to power and economic resources."

However, not everything goes so smoothly â Cardiff RHB even interprets the guidance in such a way as to decrease the visibility of communicative attempted suicide.70 Stengel has other problems with it and implies that the return is less than useless. His letter to the Ministry of Health is unfortunately no longer in the file, but there remains a copy of one he sends to the Superintendent of the Royal Infirmary, Sheffield. In it he argues that âI have not been able to comply with your request ... patients who have made suicidal attempts are not usually diagnosed as âattempted suicideâ but under some other heading ... The only way to provide the required information would be for the Ministry to request hospitals to put âattempted suicideâ into the diagnostic indexâ.71 He says that âit would be a pity if the Ministry should accept information which cannot possibly be valid [and] dangerously misleadingâ.72 This is a significant problem for the emergence of a consistent, epidemiological object of attempted suicide. As Stengelâs criticism highlights, without either a customised structure for its record, or the labour-intensive scrutiny of research psychiatry, attempted suicide is exceptionally difficult to pin down. Specialised research projects begin to record it during the early 1960s. W. Malcolm Millar, George Innes and Geoffrey Sharp design a research questionnaire in the early 1960s that includes the question: âHas a suicidal attempt formed any part of the present illness? Yes/Noâ.73 Peter Sainsbury and Jacqueline Grad prepare a clinical record sheet for psychiatrists to record reasons for deciding upon a certain disposal option. Next to âprevious mental illnessâ there appears the phrase â(N.B., Suicide Attempt)â.74 This"

Europe must not and cannot tolerate such invasions. This comment stirred up different reactions among our interviewees. On the one hand, they condemned what they called a âstereotypical positionâ which is âradically underinformedâ and, thus, âformed quite superï¬ciallyâ (P2, FG1). On the other, they acknowledged that such cultural prejudice is very hard to overcome, unless our educational models change in order to provide us with the right instruments to do so. Of course the media role was also emphasised as a primary bearer of such a change, given the way in which it continuously affects the opinion of people of all ages. More speciï¬cally, they suggested that our society needs a ânew common senseâ (P6, FG1), according to which, everybody should have the opportunity to live without borders. So, rather than giving this particular opinion any weight, our interviewees swiftly dismissed it as ignorant and an example of an unacceptable marked stereotype. What they counter-argued was that anyone who expresses an opinion like this should be reminded that these âpoor peopleâ are âjust trying to have a better lifeâ (P3, FG1). The second comment, which is another example of a xenophobic remark, this time against the particular ethnic group of Roma people, was a response to an article reporting the attempted robbery of a jewellery store by a Sinti woman. (122) Seppellitela in galera e buttate la chiave. Data lâetÃ  non dovrebbe avere ï¬gli piccolissimi che possano farle da scudo. Dimenticavo. Era una rom di etnia sinti? Ebbene, i sinti sono i peggiori e piÃ¹ pericolosi fra gli zingari perchÃ© sono quelli che piÃ¹ degli altri si sanno mimetizzare fra la gente comune. In ogni caso sempre ladri e delinquenti rimangono.17 Lock her up in prison and throw the keys away. Given her age, she probably hasnât got children who can act as a shield for her. Ah I almost forgot, was she a Sinti? Well, Sinti are the worst and most dangerous among Roma, as they can blend in among common people better than others. Anyway, theyâre all thieves and outlaws. This comment spurred the intervieweesâ feeling of disappointment even more. While acknowledging that the stereotyping of Roma people as thieves is quite widespread, both in Italy and beyond, they underlined the necessity of focusing on the act of stealing rather than on the speciï¬c ethnicity of the thief. They then highlighted the âcarelessness and inaccurate attitude of news reportsâ (P4, FG1); they underlined the responsibility that journalists and media reporters carry, as far as the conditioning of the general publicâs perception of current events goes,"

Dieksâ suggestion is intriguing, but it causes difficulties. First, why did not Lewis make this explicit? In his debate with Reichenbach there appear to have been opportunities enough. Second, even if An+1 has been called a reason for An , we should not overlook the fact that other propositions, contained in the negation of An+1 , can well contribute to the justification of An . As Johan van Benthem phrases it: â[P(An |Â¬An+1 )] measures intuitively the âbonusâ that An receives even if An+1 were untrue. This inclusion might perhaps sound odd if we have just introduced An+1 as reason for An â but we may, neither here nor in argumentation generally, ignore the fact that a postulated claim can already enjoy support without An+1 â (Van Benthem 2015, 148, our translation from the Dutch; cf. Peijnenburg 2015, 205-206). In any case, if Dieks were correct this would considerably restrict the domain in which the Lewisian approach could apply, and it would appear to be inconsistent with the probability calculus."

(see also the box on page 9 â The hierarchy of networks) It is also highly likely that monitoring mechanisms will be built into devices themselves: for example, âif a guest is charging their electric car at a friendâs house, we should consider applications that will understand that the charge should appear on the guestâs electric bill and not that of the friend.â16 But there is a clear deadlock: clients do not know what they can expect, nor do they know what they could ask. M2M vendors cannot interface their sensor capabilities beyond an optimizing function. No one is asking for an Internet of Things. People have no idea about what they can expect and why they should hand over their washing machines to a local grid to ensure energy efficiency, for example. Is a positive outcome feasible? A successful IoT means the best possible feedback on our physical and mental health, the best possible deals based on real-time monitoring for resource allocation, the best possible decision-making based on real-time data and information from open sources, and the best possible alignments of our local providers with the global potential of wider communities. Now that we have introduced the basic ideas of the Internet of Things concept and pointed out some aspects of the current discussion taking place in the Internet of Things community, you can see that the whole field is very much âin motionâ. New ideas, concepts and new technologies are appearing constantly, whereas others are disappearing, being ruled out as incompatible or not feasible. In the IoT concept, which is itself disruptive, other potential âdisruptiveâ technologies (e.g. Google Glass etc.) strongly influence the direction of technological development as well as the related societal and political discussion. Despite the high-level discourse that is necessary to assess the socio-economic impact of IoT in general, in this book we will focus on the underlying technological concepts, network architecture approaches and connectivity and interoperability requirements that are required to provide and realise the fundamental connectivity that will ultimately allow for the emergence of the Internet of Things to the benefit of mankind in general."
166,136,0.989,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"Fisherâs exact test in the case of small n in the cross-tables) to test the null hypothesis of no significant association between the age group, sex, level of education, and last occupational status of respondents and the method of sampling (random/snowball). The p-values of each test are above 0.05, so we accept the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant bias as far as the above-mentioned variables are concerned. To conclude, the adjustments of contact approaches do not appear to have distorted the quality of the final samples and allow a sample large enough to run some descriptive and multivariate analyses. The initial objective was reached since elderly migrants are largely overrepresented in the VLV database. For example, Spanish migrants are three times more numerous in our database (for the 65â79 year-olds) than they are in the residential population. Consequently, weighting issues do arise, and attention should be paid as to how weights are assigned. Furthermore, manipulating the database with care remains crucial considering the impossibility to reach many of them. When analyzing and interpreting the data, one has to be conscious of what the database contains and what it does not. The file does not include individuals who left Switzerland to spend their retirement in their country of origin (though it was not the goal of VLV to gain access to such groups), individuals who did not identify themselves to the goals and uses of VLV, and individuals who were not in Switzerland at the time of the survey. Moreover, with such complicated questionnaires, the biggest risk for VLV was to reach only highly skilled persons who are the exceptions among elderly migrants from Italy, Spain, and Portugal living in Switzerland. Nevertheless, the focus group with the interviewers in charge of the oversamples demonstrates that the risk did not materialize for VLV: I had many respondents who only did primary school, or almost nothing. Because at that time it was normal, education was not mandatory in Spain, in Francoâs time : : : A lot dropped out of school to help their family or to help in the fields : : : For illiterate respondents, it was not a big deal for us because we were with them all the time throughout the questionnaire, we were there for that purpose, and then it was easy.

137,568,0.989,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"ing, shopping and cooking the familyâs evening meal. This full assumption of what we might call the stay-at-home âmothering mandateâ (Arendell 2000) is associated in fathersâ discourses to the context of full-time leave alone and solo caring: in fact, the studies in this book show that fathers differentiate between âpaternity leaveâ, taken straight after the birth of the child in order to âhelpâ the mother and âsupport lifeâ, and parental leave allowing for full responsibility in childcare. Those who take part-time leave or 1 day a week off work to care for the child (e.g. see French fathers in this book) do not report experiencing the same kind of impact, implying a shift towards the demands and the mandate of primary caregiving. A second common trend is related to the many varied consequences of leave. This experience of intensive and involved caregiving is felt to be a positive experience: learning to take responsibility alone; being preoccupied and absorbed with their child; shaping daily life around the childâs routines; enjoying increased physical contact with the child; sympathizing with mothersâ stress; learning to balance care and housework; experiencing the time as fulfilling, joyful, âa luxuryâ, âan oasisâ. As such these fathers have taken on emotional responsibility as well as direct engagement and accessibility as discussed by Doucet (2016), Chap. 2, in this book. But ambivalence with reports of anxiety, saturation, fatigue and boredom are mixed with these affirming experiences. Such fathers realize that they may not be totally cut out for full-time caregiving and might not like to repeat the experience. Overall, then, these findings are a vivid reminder of the challenges, difficulties and diversity in mothersâ experiences of childcare for a new born child at home (Arendell 2000). Moreover, in contrast to fathers in the 1990s, the studies in this book reveal men, albeit not all, who take on household tasks and home planning, in line with the idea that the sharing of leave also implies taking on responsibility for both care and work, on a par with what mothers do when at home. Some diversity, however, also emerges, under the influence of policy context, conjugal gender roles and fatherâs agency. Some fathers, in particular those who perceive themselves as âhelperâ rather than âindependentâ fully-autonomous fathers, still rely on their partner or another person for some of the housework and perceive their task as focused essentially on childminding. Nevertheless, some of these initially âdependentâ fathers, moved by a fundamental rupture in gender roles due to full-time solo caring, also experience a break away from this âdependentâ profile and report that they have acquired more autonomy and skills. In sum, context, conjugal relations and agency are all important shaping factors of what fathers âdoâ and experience while taking full-time parental leave. A third common trend is related to the impact of fathersâ full-time parental leave alone on gender equality in families, an issue taken up in all the studies in this book. Rather than clear-cut, linear trends, the contributions in this book stress the exploratory and complex nature of the qualitative findings. This diverse pattern is to be expected given the range of contextual factors and agency as well as the difficulty in disentangling short-term and long-term impacts. Five main conclusions may be highlighted across national contexts. First, fathersâ experiences during paternity leave taken with the mother immediately after the birth of the child are consistently reported as different from those of solo caring during full-time parental leave; the"
97,472,0.989,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Nature-based solutions (NBS) are promoted by the European Union as an innovation meant to solve many societal problems. As a supposedly new idea, an innovative solution to outstanding problems, they are being promoted by the European Commissionâs Directorate-General for Research and Innovation which is responsible for defining and implementing European Research and Innovation policy. The European Commission and its experts (2015) argue that NBS fit well into the dominant discourse on âsustainable and green growthâ that NBS are cost-effective and that they offer a business opportunity for European companies to take the lead in this area in international markets. If EU authorities see NBS as a window of opportunity not only to protect the environment but also â or perhaps principally â to improve business prospects and the position of the EU in international markets, then we can assume that this approach will be further reflected in national policies and on-the-ground management in EU countries. However so far, the EU discourse on NBS seems to have attracted relatively little attention in Poland (Kronenberg 2016). Indeed, Poland, which is one of the new post-socialist EU members, with an economy which has undergone a radical transformation, often reveals many differences in how new concepts and political ideas spread, compared to the relatively better known Western democratic countries (Kronenberg and Bergier 2012). In this chapter we aim to address the following research questions: why the concept of NBS is so slowly accepted in Poland, what factors and drivers control the process of its diffusion, and what are the challenges and opportunities to promote it further? To realise these goals, we use Amoeba â a tool developed by Alan AtKisson to analyse the dynamics of cultural changes leading to the widespread acceptance of the innovation, especially those connected with sustainable development (AtKisson 2009). We explain the broader context of NBS in Poland and apply Amoeba to two examples â green roofs and ecological corridors. Finally, based on our analysis, we draw broader conclusions regarding further opportunities to promote NBS in Poland."
75,96,0.989,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","article: ââI publish an article with five co-authors and we have six times as many friends who quote usââ (FrÃ¶hlich 2006). â¢ Ever-increasing specialization To meet this enormous need for publication, new journals for ever more finely divided sub-areas of a research discipline are launched constantly. Thus, the total number of worldwide existing scientific journals is estimated between 100,000 to 130,000 (Mocikat 2009), and each year there are more. By getting increasingly specialized and narrow-minded, chances for publication are improved (Frey et al. 2009). It is advisable to be specialized in a very exotic but important-sounding topic which is understood only by very few insiders, and establish a scientific journal for this topic. Consequently, the few specialists within this field can promote their chances of publication by writing positive reviews in the peer-review process, so that they will all get published. Let us just take the topic of ââwineââ as an example: There is the ââJournal of Wine Economicsââ, the ââInternational Journal of Wine Business Researchââ, ââJournal of Wine Researchââ, the ââInternational Journal of Wine Marketing,ââ and so on. All of these are scientific journals that deal with wine on a ââhighly scientificââ level, covering topics such as wine economics, wine marketing, or sales. Probably we will soon also have specialized journals for red-wine and white-wine economics and we also await the ââJournal of Wine Psychologyââ. â¢ Forgery and fraud Last but not least, the whole competition for as many publications and citations as possible leads to fraud and forgery. The higher the pressure to increase productivity, the more likely it is to resort to doubtful means. (FrÃ¶hlich 2006). The assumption that universities are committed to the search for truth (Wehrli 2009) becomes more and more a fiction. Modern universities are exclusively committed to excellence and the search for truth does not help very much in this respect. No wonder that quite a few cases of fraud have become publicly known more recently. A good example is the former German physicist Jan-Hendrik Schoen, born 1970, who was celebrated as the German Excellence prodigy until his case of fraud was discovered. For some time it was believed that he had discovered the first organic laser and the first light-emitting transistor, and accordingly he was highly praised and received a number of scientific awards. At the peak of his career, as a 31-year-old rising star at Bell Laboratories in the United States, he published an article in a scientific journal on average every eight days, of which 17 were published in highly respected journals such as ââNatureââ or ââScienceââ. No one seemed to notice that this is simply impossible if you do proper research. Instead the German scientific community was proud that they were able to come up with such a top performer. It took some time until co-researchers doubted his results and soon the data turned out to be forged in large parts. A lot of the results were simply simulated on the computer. The interesting thing is, as Reich (2009) writes in her book ââPlastic Fantasticââ, that these forgeries would probably never have even been discovered if Schoen had not exaggerated so"
234,67,0.989,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"The following section considers the role of professional volunteers from a more informed human resource perspective, arguing strongly that volunteer deployment must be framed and negotiated within an evidence-based understanding of local human resource dynamics. In so doing, it also emphasises the importance of multi-disciplinary expertise and not leaving these kinds of decisions to individual clinicians who may arrive in an LMIC with little understanding of human resource management in low-resource settings or even of international development. The title of this chapter âFirst do no Harmâ10 is taken from the Hippocratic Oath â an ethical statement governing the conduct of the medical profession. At face value, the Oath and its interpretation through the General Medical Councilâs âGood Medical Practiceâ Guide (2015) do not suggest any major contradictions or tensions for doctors. Put simply, it requires doctors to pledge to put the needs of patients ï¬rst and âdo no harmâ to them. An earlier version of the GMC guide included a paragraph stating, âOur ï¬rst duty is to our patients, not to the Trust, the NHS or to Societyâ (2012). This implies a prioritisation of the one-to-one doctorâpatient relationship â a highly individualistic approach to patient well-being which guards against political and pecuniary interference. However, it fails to grasp the potential unintended consequences of this approach when doctors are working as âoutsidersâ in a foreign health system.11 Hurwitz suggests that this simple message masks greater moral complexity in the face of âbizarre moral predicamentsâ as ânew obligations thrust on doctors may conï¬ict with their ï¬rst responsibility to care for patientsâ (1997: 2). Although Hurwitz refers to the challenges of working in âextreme circumstancesâ, there is no explicit reference here to diverse international contexts. The updated (2015) version simply states: âMake the care of your patients your ï¬rst concernâ (p. 0) potentially opening up opportunities for a more holistic interpretation. The prioritisation of the doctorâpatient relationship is often evident in the motivations expressed by professional volunteers applying for international placements through comments such as âwanting to help peopleâ or âmake a differenceâ. Many of the professional volunteers motivated to work in LMICs are motivated not only by clinical concerns but also by religious convictions. And these âGood Samaritanâ motivations often accentuate the desire to focus on individual patients rather than understanding and responding to systems.12 Furthermore, whilst many professional volunteers â and especially those with prior experience in low-resource settings â articulate an interest in sustainability and longer-term change, they rarely interpret this as challenging their immediate commitment to"

Our researcher immediately launched into a detailed question about events twenty years ago, which eventually led to an in-depth one-to-one conversation and a followup at the respondentâs home. In line with her professional persona, our Morocco researcher, who interviews mainly officials, similarly prefers to set out her âcase knowledgeâ of a topic early on so as to be taken seriously. She also builds trust by showing that she knows what she is doing in procedural terms, for instance, discussing the status of the conversation as off-the-record, anonymous, and so on. But she has also experienced how, working as a pair with a researcher less steeped in local knowledge, they managed to have it both ways, using expertise and naivety in tandem. Her colleague, who had a more basic command of French, could at some point break into the interview, posing quasi-ingenuous questions that she herself did not feel able to ask, but the boldness of which could be attributed to her inability to express herself more subtly in French. A final consideration is whether to present ourselves as an âimportantâ or a very junior person. Again, our choices are very much constrained by age, gender, and position, but each of us can work with what they have. A male middle-aged full professor may well find it easier to get an appointment with an official than a young female PhD student. But by being considered more consequential, he may also be more threatening and may have less fruitful interviews. While our Morocco researcher regularly uses her doctoral title to get in the door, our Iran researcher by contrast still sometimes introduces himself as âa studentâ to diminish his importance, years after finishing his PhD."
113,39,0.989,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"goods and modern technologies such as mobile telephones, the internet, and television play a key role in debates about kindoki witchcraft; these technologies are now targeted as objects of an electronic modernity that helps mediate the power of the devil. Pentecostal reflections on communication technologies force us to perceive the ways in which contact with social and spiritual Others can be initiated, mediated, or broken off, in a worldview in which a person is under attack from foreign influences and in need of protection. Here, it would seem that the Pentecostals articulate a global template that is about fear of abusive connectivity and fear that invisible evil forces are inclined to follow lines of communication opened up by new technologies. In Kinshasaâs Pentecostal discourse, the SIM card, for instance, has become a reference to the soul, and âto unlock a SIM cardâ means to deliver someone from witchcraft. The technologies are merely shells for hidden occult forces, and the Christian mobilization against this form of connectivity is now just as global as the multinational companies that develop the technologies. In Melanesia, there are many references to the inherent moral perils in new technologies, but it is perhaps not the technologies themselves or the companies behind them that are demonized to the same degree. This may be because there is a less developed culture of consumerism. Brands are very limitedâmany are Chinese or Australian productsâand their importance in consumer desire is mostly limited to fulfilling kinship network obligations rather than individual consumption. Even in urban places like Port Vila, Honiara, or Port Moresby, the standard tins of beer, cartons of cigarettes, bags of rice, or shorts and t-shirts figure as currencies that certainly have an exchange value, but they do not come with the phantasmagorical promise of individual pleasure, future happiness, or self-fulfillment that has become normal in consumerist worlds. In Michelle MacCarthyâs Chap. 6, we realize that the angle toward consumerism is quite different from Blanesâ and Pypeâs urban African examples. In the Trobriand Islands, technology and material possessions may be a source of envy, with Trobriand witches perhaps representing the moral perils of individual consumption, but the main issue with witches is that they hinder productivity. Indeed, the notion that the witches are so âhungryâ that they feed on corpses indicates the danger of becoming âgreedyâ and refusing to share freely and meet all reciprocal exchange obligations. When women are born again as Pentecostals and renounce their evil powers of witchcraft, they shun the antisocial capacities they have carried within them since early childhood, transforming"

For epistemic responsibility this means that as responsible epistemic agents, we intentionally assume responsibility for what we claim to know. In full awareness of our socio-technical epistemic entanglement, we accept to be challenged for what we claim to know, we commit ourselves to provide evidence for our claims and to revise our beliefs in the light of new evidence. Hence, to understand and improve our processes of knowing, to be responsible knowers as individuals, we first need to acknowledge both the deep entanglements between the social, the technical and the epistemic as well as between epistemology, ethics and ontology. However, the only adequate reaction to this awareness must be to assume responsibility as an intentional act. It is only we humans (so far?) that can take this stance, hence it is our duty to assume responsibility for our interrelated ways of knowing, being and doing. However, what is also clear is that the ease with which epistemic responsibility can be assumed differs between different socio-technical environments: in some environments assuming responsibility for what one knows is rather easy, in others it is much more difficult. Access to various types of evidence, to supporting or contradicting information is essential to become epistemically responsible in knowing. It is in this sense that supporting open access is a very important and valid aspect of Responsible Research and Innovation. More generally it means that our individual efforts must be complemented with appropriate policies that support environments in which epistemic responsibility assumption is enabled, fostered and incentivized."

The incorporation of mobile methods in my research design (see Sect. 2.4) also helped me appreciate the sometimes precarious nature of the va-et-vient. In the course of a gruelling three-day journey by bus and ferry from Paris to Tiznit in Southern Morocco, I gained an insight into the fragile state in which some older hostel residents are prepared to travel. Between the cramped coach seating which made sleep difficult, the infrequent stops for meals and comfort breaks, and the steep gangways and stairs on board the ferry, I could only empathise with my travelling companions. A health advisor at Sonacotra-Adoma recounted similar experiences: If you go to the airports, itâs quite funny to see â they do the va-et-vient as long as possible. They leave in conditions sometimes which neither you nor I would accept our parents travelling in: one would think they wouldnât survive the journey (...)

363,126,0.989,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"Yet this narrative both fits and does not fit. It captures some truth of their story, but not the whole of it. What is denied in this rendering of the story is their mutual pleasure in reciprocal possession; their joint delight in âtrusting minds which recognised each otherâ (501). Ash challenges her revision of their story, saying: âthink over what we did together and ask, where was the cruelty, where the coercion, where Christabel, the lack of love and respect for you, alike as a woman and as intellectual being?â (456). In her final letter to him, LaMotte acknowledges that although Ash threatened and ultimately destroyed her self-possession and solitude he did so âmeaning me nothing but goodâ (502). Her refusal to either contact Ash or tell him about their child, and her retreat into her pain and pride, is figured in the novel as a rejection of mutual possession, in favour of self-possession. It is symbolically rectified in the novel not only by LaMotte voluntarily seeking forgiveness and revealing the information that she withheld, but also by her relinquishing self-possession once more. And not only to Ash, but also to his wife: âI write under cover to your wife â who may read this, or do as she pleases with it â I am in her hands â but it is so dangerously sweet to speak out, after all these years â I trust myself to her and your goodwillâ (500).

Their child, born of those moments in which each found the centre of life in possession, each by the other, becomes a literal embodiment of the life that inheres in mutual possession. So, too, does their grandchild, who âis a strong boy, and will liveâ (503). Witnessing the life that has come of their relationship, LaMotte once again asserts the mutuality of their love, and can see Ash not in his role of usurper and despoiler, but as the man she has known, loved and been loved by. Byattâs Victorians, who believe in love and write and speak their own copiously, provide a contrast with her contemporary characters Roland and Maud. The sterility of the texts produced by the contemporary scholars is matched by the nullity of their sex lives. For Roland and Maud, love is something they theorise about, a âsuspect ideological constructâ in which they cannot believe in any personal way. They are âtheoretically knowingâ about desire and sexuality, and possess a sophisticated, scientific vocabulary to describe âphallocracy [â¦] punctuation, puncturing and penetration, polymorphous and polysemous perversityâ (423), and so on. However, it is their very cerebral, theoretical knowingness that"
198,72,0.989,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"As argued in van den Berg (2013, p. 47), evaluations of climate change interventions, especially if they aim for a higher more comprehensive level of understanding what the interventions mean and what they achieve in the longer run, need to evaluate in the context of the continuing societal and economic winds that are causing climate change. Evaluators need to point out to policy makers and decision makers that what they promote with one hand, is more than sufficiently undone with a very active and much bigger other hand. If the forces of destruction can be reduced or even halted, climate change action will become successful. How successful can currently not be established fully for all actions â there is some international agreement on measurement of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, but this agreement needs to be further developed. Many countries, multilateral and bilateral organizations are currently using various measurement systems at the same time in different projects â this needs to be improved. Evaluations, not just the seven comprehensive ones, but the many evaluations at the intervention level as well (many of which are highlighted in this book), provide an increasing body of knowledge that has been insufficiently explored for policy makers and decision makers on what works, where and when and for whom under what circumstances. This should focus on: â¢ How systems change can be effected through activities on key issues that will âtipâ or âtiltâ the system in the right direction; â¢ Identify the top-down actions that can and should be taken as they have proven to be effective; similarly look at bottom-up actions that can and should be supported; â¢ Present evidence on the difference in effectiveness between inclusive, gender sensitive, equity based approaches versus approaches that lack these perspectives; â¢ Contribute to a repository of evidence on which technologies under which circumstances, for whom, have proven to be effective in supporting more sustainable and low-carbon growth; â¢ Contribute to a repository of evidence on what works for whom, when, where, and under which circumstances on adaptation to climate change."

So it becomes a useful metric (measure) of where the system might be heading. We cover feedbacks in more detail when discussing the speciï¬c components of the climate system and how we model them in Sect. 3.2. As described in the box, there are both positive feedbacks (like the ice-albedo feedback) and negative feedbacks (like the temperature feedback) in the climate system. Put a lot of complex feedbacks together, and the climate system starts to sound less like the single screech of an electronic microphone and more like the complex tones of a symphony, perhaps one without a conductor. Many of these tones or combinations of tones have feedback loops, like the example of the sea iceâalbedo feedback described here. We discuss this feedback more in Chap. 5, after we introduce additional concepts about how the atmosphere works. To understand the climate system and how it will evolve over time, it is critical to understand these complex interactions. Most climate science is dedicated to understanding the components of the system, their coupling, and how they work now and have worked in the past, so that we can understand how they might work in the future. The imperative to understand the climate system stems solely from how society is affected by variations in high-frequency extreme weather events and lower frequency climate extremes and how they may change over time in response to different forcings within the system. Or even with no forcing of the system. The importance of understanding weather and climate is independent of any human influence. Even if we did not have reason to think the climate was changing due to human activities, it would still be important and critical to understand and simulate the climate system to predict the natural variability and potential changes in the system so that we can adjust. This is also called adaptation to climate changes, as in adapting our society to a new climate."
363,43,0.989,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"the apparition itself as reapparition of the departedâ (Derrida, 1994: 6). These texts exploit the ghostliness of textuality to foreground the non-presence of history, its disappearance, and to suggest that its meaning is fleeting, or flickering; in fact, more than this, its meaning only exists as it is created, and recreated afresh. In this sense it is like the text itself, the meaning of which is configured and reconfigured with each reading, and by each reader. Similarly, the past is configured and reconfigured, and attributed different and multifarious meanings in each act of historical recall. Julian Wolfreys writes: ârecognizing the signs of haunting it must be concluded that whether one speaks of the experience of reading or the experience of the materiality of history, one witnesses and responds to ghostsâ (Wolfreys, 2002: 11). Indeed, he explores the ways in which texts, because of our tendency to anthropomorphise them, can themselves be considered ghostly, âare neither dead nor alive, yet they hover at the very limits between living and dyingâ (ibid.: xxii). This ghostliness is part of what separates the historical novel from the objectives, and assumed objectivity of history, and aligns it with the functions of memory: âTo the extent that memory âreincarnatesâ, âresurrectsâ, âre-cyclesâ, and makes the past âreappearâ and live again in the present, it cannot perform historically since it refuses to keep the past in the past, to draw the line, as it were, that is constitutive of the modern enterprise of historiographyâ (Spiegal, 162). The contemporary proliferation of historical fictions, and their commercial success, registers a persistent desire for cultural memory. Stemming from this continuing desire for stories about the past, historical fiction might extend and elaborate our versions of the past, offering different ways of seeing it, without asserting finality or Truth. In the earliest identification of the neo-Victorian subgenre, Dana Shiller observes, the âneo-Victorian novel â¦ attest[s] to the unflagging desire for knowledge of the past, a desire not extinguished by doubts as to how accessible it really isâ (Shiller, 1997: 557). This could be reformulated as an unflagging desire for historical recollection, the act of remembrance, which is privileged over historical knowledge itself. In her discussion of collecting in Susan Sontagâs historical novel The Volcano Lover, Julie C. Hayes suggests that it is desire that ensures the past will continue to be interpreted, that its stories will continue to be told. Indeed, far from erasing historical difference and distance, she argues that the collectorâs desire for the object, his or her passion and the resulting fear of its loss, âassures [the objectâs] status as unique, as having belonged to a specific, punctual place and time. The pastiche-collection is thus not so much critical or ironic, as paradoxical and complex, less bent on unmasking"

These phenomena are seen as central in Objectivist accounts, but which seem not to figure in most Subjectivist accounts. This holds, I think, not only for the psychological theories that postulate concepts to be tested against certain behavioural responses by language users (where these theories donât pretend to test a full range of linguistic phenomena), but also for the cognitive linguists who are very aware of many of the deep and peculiar intricacies of natural language but who nevertheless use the overly-simple results from the psychological theories to account for them. (Sometimes just assuming that âmore of the sameâ will accommodate the intricacies.) I write this from the point of view of an Objectivist, formal semanticist. All the topics discussed below are thought to be adequately dealt with on the Objectivist side of a two-tier theory (at least by Objectivists44 ). Presumably, Subjectivists would have their own lists of topics that Objectivists need to deal with before any two-tier account could be made to work. But someone else will have to provide that list."

We can interpret this as another example of inattentional blindness, discussed in chapter two, illustrated with the gorilla experiment (Simons & Chabris, 1999). Even here, the individuals involved seem to be blind to important aspects of what they are doing, and blind to that blindness. Moral fallibility is the name we can use for the phenomenon of acting contrary to oneâs moral convictions and beliefs. An individual may believe that adultery, tax avoidance, and nepotism somehow is morally wrong, but still engage in those activities, due to the weakness of will or some other explanation. Moral fallibility in organizations occurs when leaders or other employees make decisions and act in manners that appear to contradict what they generally take to be morally acceptable and right. A financial advisor may believe that he or she should put the clientsâ interest first, but still try to sell dubious products to them, to bolster personal bonuses. An athlete may consider doping to be morally wrong, but nevertheless take up an offer to use illegal substances to enhance performance. A waste management employee may be concerned about sustainability, and be a proponent of safe treatment of waste, but still let industry clients dump hazardous waste among the safe and recyclable waste. If there are real cases that fit these descriptions, they illustrate that people can actually go against their moral convictions, and be morally fallible. However, one widespread assumption in the field of moral psychology is that when we come up against alternatives that conflict with our moral beliefs, we will dismiss them unless we manage to convince ourselves that those alternatives are morally acceptable, after all (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, & Pastorelli, 1996). The main idea is that âpeople do not ordinarily engage in reprehensible conduct until they have justified to themselves the rightness of their actionsâ (Bandura et al., 1996, p. 365). When facing an option to act against our moral convictions, then, we will either dismiss the option or revise those convictions to be able to proceed with the option, without conflict. Rawls has described how individuals and groups seek âreflective equilibriumâ, a situation where there is coherence among our beliefs (Rawls, 1971). In that state of affairs, the beliefs we have about particular cases"

Habit and custom are potentially a lever to implement change in the food system, utilising âthe value of forms of experimental inquiry or intelligence, essential for the learning through experience that, ideally, opens up future possibilities for learningâ (Blomley 2014). In summary, then, the methodological tools of legal geography, performativity and pragmatism, are useful in explaining how Cubaâs food system underwent a swift and radical change in the mid-1990s; and further this might point to a ânew place to beginâ (Blomley 2014) in experimenting with alternatives to Australiaâs urban food system. Such an approach does not fall into the comparative law trap of cut-and-pasting foreign legal structures into a new context, but rather points to that which is true in a particular context (Cuba) and invites experimentation with placespeciï¬c alternatives: âthere are no predetermined outcomes that can be derived from lawâs geographies â¦ such geographies should be thought of as experimental and contingent â¦ [citing Allen] âWhat works best in any given situation cannot be known in advance, only in practiceââ (Blomley 2014)."
82,207,0.989,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"astic regress seems a contradiction in terms. Where could we ever find a doxastic series of infinite length? In the next chapters we will come back to this objection, and then we will also discuss the distinction between a propositional and a doxastic regress. At this juncture we will restrict ourselves to showing that a probabilistic regress of propositions also is relevant to a real-life situation. Imagine that we are trying to develop a new medicine to cure a disease. In this connection, we want to know whether a particular bacterium has a certain trait, T . Bacteria reproduce asexually, so one parent, the âmotherâ bacterium, alone produces offspring. After having carried out many experiments, one day we take from a batch a particular bacterium, which we call Barbara. From our experiments we know that the probability that Barbara has T is considerably greater if her mother has T than if her mother lacks it. So if q is âBarbara has T â and A1 is âBarbaraâs mother has T â, then we can say that A1 probabilistically supports q. It is not certain that Barbara has T if her mother has the trait, but on the other hand Barbara could have T even if her mother does not have it. Thus 1 > P(q|A1 ) > P(q|Â¬A1 ) > 0. The unconditional probability of Barbara having T is given by P(q) = P(q|A1 )P(A1 ) + P(q|Â¬A1 )P(Â¬A1 ). Whereas the conditional probabilities in this equation, P(q|A1 ) and P(q|Â¬A1 ), may be assumed to have been determined from our experiments, obtaining P(A1 ) is a problem. What is the probability that Barbaraâs mother has T ? We know that it is given by P(A1 ) = P(A1 |A2 )P(A2 ) + P(A1 |Â¬A2 )P(Â¬A2 ), where P(A2 ) is the probability that Barbaraâs grandmother has T , which in turn is conditioned by P(A3 ), the probability that Barbaraâs great-grandmother has T .31 It will be clear that we can only compute P(q) if we know P(A3 ). And the situation remains the same, even if we add more and more instances of the rule of total probability, going further and further back in Barbaraâs ancestry. It seems we are only able to compute the probability that Barbara has T if we know what is the unconditional probability that her primordial mother had T . So at first sight it looks as though foundationalists are right: if q is probabilistically justified by A1 , which is probabilistically justified by A2 , 31 In the reading of Pastin the probability intended by Lewis would be P(q â§ A ),"
99,274,0.989,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"process can set a new practice into motion and address broader networks of civil society, political and administrative actors, possibly market actors as well. Are they willing to pay attention to such messages? What determines the different degrees of readiness among these actors to take up messages? And moreover, what influences the capabilities to âreadâ and the ways of interpreting them? All this may concern innovations and innovators themselves, the degree to which they actively care for broadening their action and winning support, but it mainly concerns contexts and the ability of systemsâhere welfare systemsâto adopt innovations. The second part of this chapter will reflect on these questions, focusing on the difference it makes once an innovation is non-market based and in its essence non-technical, such as social innovations, taking shape in local milieus and welfare systems. Obviously the metaphor of âmessagesâ may in many ways be insufficient and questionable. Studies of innovation usually prefer the âdiffusionâ metaphor, and we also use it in this contribution. It takes account of the fact that innovations are a kind of âmessage into the openâ, without any specific or exclusive addressee. Many effects and messages of innovations are beyond the control of the innovators. However, speaking about âmessagesâ has the advantage of including not only processes (of diffusion) but also issues related to content (new values, practices, policies). Furthermore, looking for âsendersâ and âreceiversâ allows us to study not merely systems and structures but also the actors who are responsible for dealing with a message, its contents and readings. What are the main messages we found in the approaches and instruments used in local social innovations studied as part of the WILCO project? The first part of the chapter will deal with this question. What can be said about the processes of transmitting, accepting, rejecting or reading such messages (what is mostly called the process of diffusion)?What are the challenges when it comes to linking social innovations and social policies? This will be taken up in the second part of the chapter."
227,30,0.989,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"through reasoning. Unreasonable problems require a breakthrough in order to solve them. The problem, however, is itself inert. It is neither reasonable nor unreasonable. That quality is brought to the problem by the solver. That is, if a student cannot solve a problem by direct effort then that problem is deemed to be unreasonable for that student. Perkins (2000) also acknowledges that what is an unreasonable problem for one person is a perfectly reasonable problem for another person; reasonableness is dependent on the person. This is not to say that, once found, the solution cannot be seen as accessible through reason. During the actual process of solving, however, direct and deductive reasoning does not work. Perkins (2000) uses several classic examples to demonstrate this, the most famous being the problem of connecting nine dots in a 3  3 array with four straight lines without removing pencil from paper, the solution to which is presented in Fig. 1. To solve this problem, Perkins (2000) claims that the solver must recognize that the constraint of staying within the square created by the 3  3 array is a self-imposed constraint. He further claims that until this is recognized no amount of reasoning is going to solve the problem. That is, at this point in the problem solving process the problem is unreasonable. However, once this self-imposed constraint is recognized the problem, and the solution, are perfectly reasonable. Thus, the solution of an, initially, unreasonable problem is reasonable. The problem solving heuristic that Perkins (2000) has constructed to deal with solvable, but unreasonable, problems revolves around the idea of breakthrough thinking and what he calls breakthrough problems. A breakthrough problem is a solvable problem in which the solver has gotten stuck and will require an AHA! to get unstuck and solve the problem. Perkins (2000) poses that there are only four types of solvable unreasonable problems, which he has named wilderness of possibilities, the clueless plateau, narrow canyon of exploration, and oasis of false promise. The names for the ï¬rst three of these types of problems are related to the Klondike gold rush in Alaska, a time and place in which gold was found more by luck than by direct and systematic searching. The wilderness of possibilities is a term given to a problem that has many tempting directions but few actual solutions. This is akin to a prospector searching"
303,215,0.989,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"nurses is singlehandedly decided by stakeholders in these destinations. Respondents pointed out that staying in one destination is an efficient and effective way to spend time while waiting for the opportunity to work in the most preferred destination, which depends largely on immigration policy reforms that may take years to be approved. For example, the current visa retrogression policy (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2013) of the US prevents entry of Filipino nurses, despite them meeting requirements such as passing the Visa Screen Program administered by the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) International and National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). Instead of staying in the Philippines, many of them grab the opportunity to work first in a less preferred destination with migration that is more restrictive and labor conditions that and worse and have lower pay, but which has a shorter processing time and requirements that are easier to meet. Indeed, when the respondents were asked about their top three reasons for working in the current destination, 71.7% of those in Singapore and 59.6% of those in the UAE chose âhaving the opportunity because this country actively recruits nurses from the Philippines.â In contrast, only 11.3% of the respondents from Australia chose this response. This finding confirms that countries that actively recruit nurses from the Philippines easily become immediate or initial transit destinations for its nurses, but not necessarily their final destination. Finally, the fact that nursing is a relatively global profession also contributes to the feasibility of stepwise migration. Nursing skills and knowledge have basic commonalities in many countries, allowing their accumulation and transferability among destinations. There are countries where the license is honored under a mutual recognition scheme so that nurses can begin working with minimal orientation from the new employers. Such is the case in Australia for licenses obtained in the UK (as explained above), Ireland, and New Zealand. The licensure or board examinations act as an objective way of assessing the nursing skills and knowledge accumulated elsewhere and evaluating their transferability across countries. From these findings, it can be inferred that there is indeed some sort of hierarchy in the preferred destinations of stepwise migrants. However, such rankings do not seem to be determined prior to their first departure from the Philippines, and they will go wherever there is an opportunity to work. As they move along their stepwise pathway and accumulate resources overseas, the succeeding decision-making process to determine whether to stay or move and when to move to the next destination becomes more systematic and predictable."
13,195,0.989,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Compared to the idealisation of female care and the gratitude expressed by the men towards their wives, the silence on these matters from the women we have interviewed is more than striking. They seem to share the view that they, as women, had the main responsibility for home and family, and with no public childcare available, they did not have much choice in the matter. They tried to be more caring mothers to their children than their own hardworking mothers had been, for instance, by having fewer children, more time for them and being less strict. In this way they are clearly complicit in creating the new family model, but they definitely do not describe it as âa golden ageâ Lorentzen (2012: 79) like the men do. They idealise neither their own nor their husbandsâ contributions. Hardly any of the women express the kind of admiration for menâs efforts as providers or their own husbandsâ personal qualifications as the men do towards their wives. If the refined gender complementarity was given as a gift of love from the men in this generation, it does not appear to have been received as that. The idealisation of gender complementarity belongs to the men; the women made the best they could out of it. Maybe the womenâs small critical remarks of the asymmetries in the gender complementarity model gradually fizzled out? The times were definitely on the menâs side in a period where it was both ideologically and economically arranged for married women to stay at home. The women adjusted to realities and also complied through their sensible choice of marriage partners and because of the benefits they gained. For many women of this generation, marriage and establishing your own home was the main route to freedom and independence from their parents. Ingrid, who spent her youth working in her motherâs shop, felt that she finally was set free when she married: âNo chance, back then you got married, and then you had a man to take care of you.â Helga, the farmer girl who married a hardworking and successful contractor and who helped out with the companyâs accounting at the kitchen table, says as she looks back: âAt least I have tried to be loyal and kind â¦ I feel like I have stood by him all these years.â The lack of enthusiasm is understandable in the light of their double and more ambivalent gender identifications, including the split between boring husbands and fun fathers. It may also be seen in light of womenâs double burden of work that gradually found its way into the gen-"

275,312,0.989,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"the trustee discretionary power. This trade must be viewed by the trustor as worth enough to bear the risks entailed in a trust relationship. Distrust as a psychological state amounts to a disposition to avoid being vulnerable to the distrusted party, often arising as a result of uncertainty about this partyâs intentions or future actions. Distrust therefore may involve unknowns in the form of suspicions as a given, or even as a justification for distrust in the first instance. Distrust also brings with it two additional forms of uncertainty. First, one may believe or suspect that the distrusted party lacks integrity and therefore doubt the veracity of information provided by that party. Second, distrust can morally license the manufacture of unknowns by the distrustor, either by withholding information from or outright deceiving the distrusted party. It seems plausible that people would find it easier to justify either of these acts if the distrusted party is an automaton than if it is a human, and therefore would be more likely to try to keep secrets from or deceive an automaton. The consequences of distrust in HRI appear to be relatively neglected in the research literature. Relevant uncertainties can enter into any of Hardinâs tripartite components: the (dis)trustor, the (dis)trustee, and the context. People can be unsure about their own psychological states; they may not be familiar with the automatonâs reliability or design specifications; and they may have to engage in HRI in situations fraught with unknowns. Disentangling all of these uncertainties in a way that is relevant to trust considerations requires, first, ascertaining what is at stake in a HRI trust relationship. Thereafter, we can bring in knowledge about how and when people are likely to be able to tolerate and work with unknowns."
395,82,0.989,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"The reason for choosing this topic is that much of my research has been founded, perhaps implicitly at times, on the assumption that enhancing job performance so that it is of better quality and efï¬ciency will concomitantly enhance safety due to improved risk perception and risk management behaviours. In this chapter, I ï¬rst briefly discuss what I understand the term âprofessionalismâ to mean. It is not a topic I have ever studied and so I have attempted to set out my interpretation of how professionalism relates to workplace safety. I then discuss two areas where my own safety research has been located. These indicate two ways in which safety training and safety thinking can be integrated into routine work, at both operator and managerial levels. The ï¬rst is behavioural, namely to focus on the non-technical skills for a given job, as evidenced by the airlinesâ Crew Resource Management training and assessment programmes. This approach is now being adopted in other safety-critical sectors, such as acute medicine and offshore oil and gas operations, typical for operational staff but in some cases also for managers. The second direction is more attitudinal in nature: it examines the relatively novel concept of chronic unease, derived from the High Reliability Organisation literature. This has been used at both operational and managerial levels. What is proposed is that addressing both non-technical skills, as well as underlying attitudes to operational risks (chronic unease), can help to build protective skills for safety into the professional job repertoire."

The â20 % by 2020â mobility benchmarkâas this is often called in European higher education jargonâis currently paralleled by another recently-set objective in the area of student mobility, namely the aim of âbalanced mobilityâ. This is what the present article focuses on, i.e. the concept of âbalanced mobilityâ in the EHEA, and more speciï¬cally on its coming into existence as a policy goal, its potential understandings, its status quo and on necessary actions to reach it. Consequently, we ï¬rst try to trace and understand the goal of having more balanced mobility between the Bologna Process countries, and to sketch different ways in which the concept of âbalanceâ could be interpreted, given that policy references to balanced mobility leave room for interpretation. Next, we try to provide an answer to the question Why has balanced mobility become an objective at this particular point in time? Third, we present recent statistics on student mobility in the EHEA context in order to show how balanced or imbalanced mobility flows are. Fourth, we try to outline some possible solutions for correcting different types of imbalances encountered in the EHEA context.

As engaged readers or followers of online self-representations, we always crave the next post, the next image, the next bit of the story. The very act of starting a blog or an Instagram or Facebook account carries with it an intention to write or share more, again, another day. As Phillippe Lejeune writes of diaries, âAll journal writing assumes the intention to write at least one more time, an entry that will call for yet another one, and so on without end. ... To âfinishâ a diary means to cut it off from the futureâ (2001, 100â1). Social media embed this âcall for yet another oneâ into the software. Facebook asks âWhatâs on your mind?â, Twitter offers me retweet buttons and a box to write my tweets in, and HeyDay and OptimizeMe push notifications to the home screen of my phone, suggesting I might want to look at my photos or update the log of my activities today. The ultimate real-time diary is a diary that writes itself automatically, without needing your input. Smartphones are ideal devices for logging our day-to-day experiences. For a start, they automatically store information about what we are doing: a phone can log our geographic location and thus where we go and how fast we are moving from place to place, and many models can also track motions, meaning it can estimate whether we are running, climbing or dancing. Some phones sense far more than this.

The phone not only knows whether we make phone calls or send texts or emails, but also knows which apps we use and what we search for online. It knows what version of the operating system we are using, what music we play, what videos we watch and what we read. It can measure how fast we read and the style of our writing. In the final chapter of this book, I discuss the implications of our devicesâ automatic tracking for privacy and surveillance, but in this chapter I explore how we are beginning to use this automatic tracking to document and explore our own lives. We are currently seeing more and more examples of continuous, automated, real-time diaries, where our everyday use of technology is converted into a journal-like format. Location sharing was one of the first aspects of personal data to be automatically logged at the userâs request, first with services such as Plazes.com, which logged you as being at a new location every time it saw that your laptop was connected from a different IP number (J.W. Rettberg 2014, 86), and later with smartphone apps such as Foursquare and Swarm that use the phoneâs built in GPS and DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0006"

Among the most valuable and scarce resources were competent employees, whose assessment through networks will be at the center of this section. The particular significance of personal evaluations and recommendations in Russia may be understood against the lack or distrust of formal means and institutions of evaluation. Overcoming this distrust with the help of personal network ties was underlined by a 40-year-old company director who had conducted a survey about how customers had found their company. He illustrates the significance of trusted third persons with the following example: If a person tells his friend that Iâve bought a TV set at this specific firm, his friend will go there automatically, without thinking, just trusting his friend. Even though this person may have bought his TV set there by chance, his friend will anyhow automatically also buy his TV set there. Provided, of course, that everything was OK with this firm. His friend will go there and the friend of his friend, and this chain will work on and on. [According to our customer survey] a significant percentage of our clients come here because of recommendation from somebody. Moreover, when there is a personnel change in a [customer] company, the new employee will first see with whom the company has worked before. And if theyâve been happy, they will continue to work with us. (director, p22) The need for recommendations from a third person was even more acute in the field of IT services, where defining the quality of the services, products, or labor was a much more complex process than evaluating the quality of TV sets. Though international certification standards such as ISO9000 and CMM were referred to by some of our respondents,17 only a minority of small- or medium-sized firms have been granted these certifications. The remaining text of this section focuses on the use of brokers in recruiting personnel which, at the time when our interviews were conducted, was the main problem for St. Petersburg IT firms.

During my field interviews, I often asked middle-aged or elderly people what they thought about oil during the Puntofijo era. To my surprise at first, almost everyone responded that they didnât think about it, or that they didnât know much about it. However, it soon dawned on me that this professed lack of consciousness about oil to a large extent was a reflection of the schism between âthe two Venezuelasâ: that of the middle and upper classes imagining themselves in the core of and benefiting from the oil state, and that of the popular sectors who had no means to partake in the symbolic and material manifestations of its riches. As one elderly woman said: âoil didnât concern us, oil was for the oil people.â If we remember Coronilâs words about the little that we know about how subaltern lives were lived in the shadows of the Magical State, it is my belief, through numerous conversations, that people were above all concerned with mitigating lifeâs innumerable challenges in their immediate life worlds. However, that does not mean that the grandiose imagery of the Magical State that he describes was not present though the everpresent promises and political spectacles that the poor were also exposed to. Indeed, as Ewell indicates (Ewell 1984:193) and as we will address more in depth later on, Carlos AndrÃ©s PÃ©rezâs golden period in the 1970s in particular conjured an imagery of prosperity being just around the corner, also for the poor. However, in spite of these expectations and the Venezuelan stateâs dazzling spectacles, peopleâs tangible experiences with the state were above all characterized by marginalization and oppression. While some experienced a growing frustration leading to an enormous anger with the whole system (as evidenced by the frequent protests during the 1980s and 1990s), others again described themselves as apathic during these years. They had no interest in or concern for politics. It belonged to the realm of âthe others.â However, historical memory is a malleable imaginative horizon. As Schwartz notes, âthe way ordinary people conceive the past, reflects the concerns of the presentâ (Schwartz 1997:470, cited in Auyero 2001:183). And I believe that we can safely assume that knowledge about oil was present at some level for most people, even if they felt that it didnât concern them. However, if we do contend that our focus in the present shapes our memories of the past, it follows that ChÃ¡vezâs promise to redistribute oil gave new meaning to their memories of the Fourth Republic. It was through ChÃ¡vezâs political message that many people internalized that"

Dire economic times and a lack of economic opportunities contribute to political populism of all colors. Friedmanâs (2005) message is a starting point of this volume, and makes what has been labeled âEuropeâs Growth Challengeâ (Ãslund and Djankov 2017) seem even more acute.

They can be tools for communicating about family mediation, for example, leaï¬ets, brochures, referral instructions or process descriptions. An agreement to mediate form was used in the project to communicate to the parents the ground rules of mediation and increase their commitment. They can also be tools for managing the interaction and problem solving in mediation (e.g. different types of questions, techniques for focusing on the child, impasse strategies, re-framing techniques, managing power imbalances, methods for creating options and reality testing). The most important perceiving tool used in the project was an ecogram, a model introduced by Lisa Parkinson in her training (Parkinson 2014). I will describe it more closely, as it incorporates the main theoretical ideas behind the mediation model created in the project. During the project, the original ï¬gure was adjusted as the participants elaborated the model in the network sessions after Parkinsonâs training and when testing it in mediation sessions. In project Fasper, the ecogram was drawn as presented in Fig. 3. The ecogram describes the children and their parents, and the two relationships between the parents: their relationship as a couple now terminated and their relationship as parents that usually needs to continue. The underlying assumption in the project was that it is useful to analytically distinguish these two and to focus family mediation on the parenting relationship and the children. Making this distinction is, however, emotionally difï¬cult for the parents. It is difï¬cult to end the marital or partner relationship yet continue to work together as co-parents (Parkinson 2014). It happens easily and is only human that the disappointments and rows ï¬ow into parental issues. That is why the parents beneï¬t from mediators to facilitate their communication and help to overcome the emotional, social and cognitive barriers that are on their way in resolving their conï¬ict (Nylund 2018). According to the understanding adopted in project Fasper, family mediation is not about who did wrong in the couple relationship. Instead, family mediation is about childrenâs matters and the organisation of their everyday life so that they could Fig. 3 The ecogram (adapted from Lisa Parkinson 2014)"

Naming models is very much a matter of personal taste: some people like the name of the model to describe its structure, other people like the name of the model to be simple and to rely on the formula (which is part of the structure of the model) to describe what the model does. I like the second approach, so I might write model <- lm(growth~tannin) The object called model can now be used for all sorts of things. For instance, we can use the predict function to work out values for the response at values of the explanatory variable that we did not measure. Thus, we can ask for the predicted growth if tannin concentration was 5.5%.

And, undoubtedly, things have considerably changed due, in part, to the use of modern information and communication technologies, which greatly facilitates the retroaction of patientâs associations in public debates and the mobilization through the network of disseminated patients, who can now exert a strong pressure in case of need. However, recently, many people (Colombo et al. 2012; Mosconi and Colombo 2010; Rothman et al. 2011), have denounced the opacity of patient association funding, which comes partly from industries. To clarify this point, let us recall that, when a patientsâ organization grows up and augments its influence, it needs to employ full time administrators, who quickly establish a kind of bureaucracy, whose aims are a long way away from patientsâ interests: quite naturally, these administrators become mainly occupied with the influence of their organization, which justifies their employment and satisfies their personal ambitions. As a consequence, their prior concern is that their organization be considered as an essential stakeholder, and then that it be involved in the main decisions, even if this activity has no direct relationship with patientsâ interests and care. For instance, they want to be involved in new clinical trials and in the discussion with health care organizations about reimbursement of treatments. It may then happen that industries would secretly negotiate with patientâs organizations to constitute coalitions of interests against state organizations or against physician organizations. In such cases, the patientsâ organizations no longer represent the interests of patients, but their own interests, which may coincide to the interests of pharmaceutical industries, because they give them funds. It follows that the current situation looks to be far away from the spirit of May 1968, even if the patientsâ associations oppose to the body of physicians and its domination."

We want growth and more prosperity, but we also want fluidity and more fairness. A common way to present this intergenerational relative mobility is to examine the relationship between the income quintile (one-fifth of the income distribution) that people end up in as adults compared to the quintile they were born or raised in. Alternative approaches include a measure of the correlation between the income rank of parents and their child, used in particular by Raj Chetty, and rank direction mobility (RDM), which tracks an individualâs position on the whole income rank compared to their parentsâ rankâdeveloped in particular by Bhashkar Mazumder (Mazumder 2011, 2014). Three more questions of definition should be briefly addressed. First, there is an important distinction to be made between intergenerational and intragenerational mobility, which is a measure of how far individuals will move up and down the income ladder during their own lifetime, especially during the prime working age years. While these kinds of mobility are related, my primary focus is on the former. Second, the choice of outcome is important. Most studies of mobility focus on income. But there are, of course, many other possibilities, including wages, education, well-being, and occupational status. Many of these will provide important information about the capabilities and opportunities enjoyed by individuals, but I focus here on income. Income is important in itself and is strongly correlated with other goods. It is also a yardstick that is reasonably easy to measure and compare over time Third, the presumption underlying this approach to measuring equal opportunity presumes that an outcomeâin this case of incomeâis a good enough proxy for opportunity. They are not the same thing, of course, because there is a difference"

In other words, researchers fall victim to the matheme of desire ($ â a). Classified information becomes the object a precisely because it is classified as top secret, withdrawn from the knowledge commons. This has grave repercussions for the individuals involved. As soon as it becomes clear that atomic knowledge may give rise to an atomic bomb, the biographies of the scientists involved (previously uninteresting more or less) become ârecordsâ or âfilesâ, while problematic entries (such as: involvement in certain political activities) become items of concern. Thus, from now on, scientists involved in classified research are scrutinised and monitored. A researcher with communist leanings is from now on a scientist with a divided loyalty (p. 312), who âprofesses loyalty first and foremost to the Soviet Unionâ (p. 229). The communist is the Mister Hyde ($) concealed beneath the allegedly impassive expert persona (S2), who is therefore likely to fall victim to the matheme of desire and to give in to the inclination to perpetrate. When Sebastian is about to be appointed as scientific director of the Valhalla project, it is made clear to him that âfrom here on â¦ you will have to resign yourself to the fact that youâll probably be under more or less constant observation. I would simply assume that everything you say, and everything said to you, whether directly or over the telephone, is being monitored, that your mail is being opened and your movements followedâ¦ Youâll be watched closelyâ (p. 217), all this because of his involvement with the Thing. Due to the Thing, Sebastian becomes a file, scrutinised by secret service experts, trawling it for symptoms of divided loyalty. Thus, Sebastian becomes the target of investigations by the secret service, but the object of these investigations is not Bloch as a living human persona, but something inside Bloch, something enigmatic: the âMr. Hyde in this Dr. Jekyllâ (p. 40) as Gregg phrases it, his communist leanings, in combination with his uncanny gift for influencing people, his almost âtelepathicâ talents of persuasion, bordering on the occult. Bloch is an enigma (p. 68) who does not limit himself to one particular speciality, like normal scientists, but seems completely at home in the whole realm of science; and in the arts as well (p. 40).10 There is something strange about his eyes and voice, moreover, and his face seems suffering and haunted: a âstrange, arrestingâ face with a âbrooding, uncanny lookâ (p. 67), a âdemoniac lookâ (p. 258), with a compassionate yet cruel set of eyes (p. 67). Due to his involvement with the Thing, his face becomes even more unsettling: an âabstract maskâ (p. 261), while his âblack eyes become enormousâ (p. 343). For Gospodin Gregg, the archetypal secret agent, this enigmatic âsomethingâ, the Mr. Hyde in Dr. Bloch, the $ inside S2, becomes the object a, to which he devotes many years of research and around which he designs a completely new type of âexperimentâ. Gregg is a psychologist studying a physicist, driven by his antiIn art a similar dynamics is discernible as in science, Sebastian argues. Beginning with CÃ©zanne, modern painters had âdestroyed painting â¦ had begun the process leading to disintegration that made the exhibits of modern painters look like the cemeteries and ossuaries of artâ (p. 147/148).

Historical research explores the social and the cultural, as well as the medical and the psychological. We seek to view ideas about male behaviour and psychological illness within the context of their time and to illustrate how it might appear that symptoms emerge in ânewâ forms and be understood differently in response to prevailing cultural and medical forces. This book has explored a range of medical, cultural, situational and organisational factors that have influenced men and their experiences of distress since the mid-twentieth century. In that sense, it makes no apology for emphasising the important role of wider sociocultural factors in disease and for endorsing a holistic, interactionist model of mental health. There is much more yet to be done. The experiences of individual men must now be the logical next stage of enquiry if we are to expand our knowledge of male psychological illness. One challenge might be whether we confront or exploit familiar notions of stoic masculinity in order to persuade men to think about their mental health. A number of recent initiatives to promote mental wellbeing have drawn on the traditional model of masculinity by raising awareness of mental illness at sports venues, for example. Another enterprise that attracted widespread attention was the âMenâs Shedsâ movement that originated in Australia and aimed to engage isolated men in communal activity through furniture restoration.38 In so-doing, they are perhaps reinforcing and promoting the very âmasculineâ ideals from which we aim to move away. However, as recent researchers have noted, behaviours and attitudes take a long time to change, and while early intervention might allow young boys to foster healthier ways of expressing emotion, the mind-set of the generations of men who are already adults might be less easy to transform.39 History does, however, offer the opportunity to expose the ways in which men have coped with distress in the past and to explore many of the social and cultural factors that influence experience. In 1976, Bruce and Barbara Dohrenwend proposed that the debate surrounding which sex was under greater stress, and hence more prone to psychiatric disorder, might be unproductive. Accepting the broad notion that men and women might react differently under psychological stress, they suggested that we would do well to discard unidimensional concepts of psychiatric disorder and âfalse questionsâ about whether women or men were more prone to mental illness. Instead, they recommended we ask instead: âWhat is there in the endowments and experiences of men and women that pushes them in these different deviant directions?â40 Some forty years later, current research still"

For Nelson it has been a long journey, at times a very difficult one, but it has been necessary. Necessary for him personallyâas he puts it in Possiplex, âI have no alternative but to go on. Like Shackleton of Antarctica I find myself enmeshed in a harsh duty that was not the original planâ¦ I will fight for it to my last breathâ [10, p. 339]. He has survived the journey so far, his ideals held high above the mud. But as the Intertwingled conference has demonstrated, as the people who have spoken here have demonstrated, the journey has also been necessary for the computing world. Nelsonâs vision is, I think, the most important vision in the history of computing. Thatâs a tall call, so Iâll need to explain my reasoning. In my book Memory Machines [1], I argue that the idea of a universal digital publishing system, an âopen hypermediaâ system, originated with Nelson. Bushâs vision, though it was about connected items, was analogue. Engelbartâs vision was also profoundly important. He was first to build many of the things we take for granted in modern computing (and I donât mean the mouse; I mean the whole concept of real-time, networked, interactive computing). His contributions would take hours to elaborate. But he was not thinking about hypertext as a domestic thingâsomething your mom and pop would consume over latte and a cheeseburger. Nelson saw that hypertext on a computer screen would spread around the globe like electronic kudzu vine. He wrote singing commercials for it; he even sketched a quirky interior for a Xanadu cafÃ©. What Nelson saw was an anarchic, global hypertext publishing system: a âdigital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishingâ [9, p. 3/2]. While working at"

The practicalities underpinning educational delivery in such a complex, plurilingual context contribute to this. Over the years there have been various attempts to produce teaching materials in different languages. These were usually widely distributed but not always properly evaluated (Theiler, op. cit.). The outcome was that special European schoolsâ textbooks were not always considered appropriate by teachers (Savvides 2006b), who instead developed their own teaching materials. This led in some circumstances to a lack of collaboration amongst some European schoolsâ teachers from different nationalities, and in turn a somewhat atomised form of professional identity for some teachers (ibid.) Similarly, student identity can be somewhat atomised as well. It is clear that there is usually unqualified approval of students trying to speak other languages, but this does not automatically lead to high levels of competence in non-native tongues, or deep integration. This is because the pedagogy of language instruction within the European schools is not always sufficiently well-structured (Baetens Beardsmore and Kohls 1988). This can lead to limitations to the linguistic ability of some students, where they can speak enough of an additional language to âget byâ, but not necessarily a great deal more (Shore and Baratieri 2005). A further issue peculiar to the European schools is that while multiple languages are welcomed, relatively few sociocultural demands are put on students in terms of integration due to the existence of language sections as âmini schoolsâ (Bulwer 1995). That having been said, it would be very wrong to dismiss the existing structure as having no merit at all in terms of promoting international cohesion. Baetens Beardsmore and Kohls (op. cit.) found that by the end of the secondary school phase, friendships are cross-national and racism rare, if students stay in the system for a sufficient amount of time. Savvides (2006b, op. cit.) similarly found that although it might seem like several schools running within one large school, European Hours provision helps with integration, although in a later work she also describes some evidence of atomisation, such as the national groupings on school trips (Savvides 2008). In summary, therefore, we see multiple forms of social sorting taking place within the European schools, and multiple identities co-existing under the same institutional banner.

Apparently, he wants to lay his cards on the table. Jerry tells Cantor that âheâ cannot accept the Nobel Prize (card game terms: that he has decided to pass), but Cantor retorts that he is not authorised to make such a decision by himself. The prize was awarded for what âweâ published in Nature, not for experimental work conducted by a post-doc and proving somewhat difficult to replicate. Once the card of the Nobel Prize is played, it cannot be repealed or refused. Even Sartre (who refused the Nobel Prize for literature for ideological reasons) is still on the list of Nobel laureates. In response to Staffordâs reluctance, Cantor decides to deal the cards (to divide the roles) as follows: while Stafford will be allowed to speak first, to cover the theory, Cantor will subsequently describe his âsecondâ experiment, so that all scepticism concerning Staffordâs âfirstâ experiment will be trumped. But Stafford is less frank or naÃ¯ve than Cantor suspects, and is actually holding his cards close to his chest. There is a secret hidden in the sealed envelope of his Nobel Prize speech. Initially, everything seems in order. In the main aula of the Karolinska institute, Stafford announces that they will present their work in chronological order, starting with the âtheoretical constructâ (p. 197). The slides of the presentation are like playing cards, and initially, Stafford puts his cards on the table as expected. But then, suddenly, his tone of voice seems to change: âLet us now turn to the relation of theory to factsâ¦ A theory cannot be proven but only disproved. In other words, it must be tested experimentallyâ¦Therefore, I would now like to addressâ¦â (p. 198). Until now, Cantor had been quite relaxed, but now his âmental radar started to detect the first blips of irregularity. Was it the use of the first person singular?â (p. 198; my italics) The âIâ form (the use of the first person singular here) is symptomatic and indicates that Jerry suddenly plays his trump card. Actually, he has two surprises in store for Cantor. The first one is that he presents a detailed account of his first experiment. And the second is that, apparently, but unbeknownst to Cantor, this experiment has now finally been replicated by Dr. Ohashi (the post-doc at Kraussâs lab at Harvard), so that Cantorâs second experiment, as well as his Nobel speech, become quite irrelevant. Initially, there were problems repeating the work, Stafford admits, but when each step was scrutinised carefully, the discrepancy was finally discovered. In addition to the experiment as reported, there are always hidden instructions, apparently trivial details, which may become significant after all, so that âeven the smallest detail should be put into oneâs notebookâ (p. 198). Meanwhile, Stafford continues, â¦we had conceived a second testâ¦ which is now under scrutiny in Professorâs Kraussâs laboratory. I have no reason to doubt that it will also be replicatedâ¦ So we actually have two independent tests in support of our theory. I trust that none of you will consider this just a superfluous crossing of a t, the unnecessary dotting of an i. After all, âtumorigenesis theoryâ has two tâs. And the work itself was performed by two Iâs: myself, and then Professor Isidore Cantor. He will now tell you about that second experiment (p. 199)."
227,9,0.989,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"Transferring: Successful problem solvers will be able more easily than others to transfer a well-known procedure to another, sometimes even very different context. They recognise more easily the âframeworkâ or pattern of a given task. Here, this is about own constructions of analogies and continual tracing back from the unknown to the known. Intuitive, that is, untrained good problem solvers, are, however, often unable to access these flexibility qualities consciously. This is why they are also often unable to explain how they actually solved a given problem. To be able to solve problems successfully, a certain mental agility is thus required. If this is less well pronounced in a certain area, learning how to solve problems means compensating by acquiring heurisms. In this case, insufï¬cient mental agility is partly âoffsetâ through the application of knowledge acquired by means of heurisms. Mathematical problem-solving competences are thus acquired through the promotion of manifestations of mental agility (reduction, reversibility, minding of aspects and change of aspects). This can be achieved by designing sub-actions of problem solving in connection with a (temporarily) conscious application of suitable heurisms. Empirical evidence for the success of the active principle of heurisms has been provided by Collet (2009). Against such background, learning how to solve problems can be established as a long-term teaching and learning process which basically encompasses four phases (Bruder and Collet 2011): 1. Intuitive familiarisation with heuristic methods and techniques. 2. Making aware of special heurisms by means of prominent examples (explicit strategy acquisition). 3. Short conscious practice phase to use the newly acquired heurisms with differentiated task difï¬culties. 4. Expanding the context of the strategies applied. In the ï¬rst phase, students are familiarised with heurisms intuitively by means of targeted aid impulses and questions (what helped us solve this problem?) which in the following phase are substantiated on the basis of model tasks, are given names and are thus made aware of their existence. The third phase serves the purpose of a certain familiarisation with the new heurisms and the experience of competence through individualised practising at different requirement levels, including in the form of homework over longer periods. A fourth and delayed fourth phase aims at more flexibility through the transfer to other contents and contexts and the increasingly intuitive use of the newly acquired heurisms, so that students can enrich their own problem-solving models in a gradual manner. The second and third phases build upon each other in close chronological order, whilst the ï¬rst phase should be used in class at all times. All heurisms can basically be described in an action-oriented manner by means of asking the right questions. The way of asking questions can thus also establish a certain kind of personal relation. Even if the teacher presents and suggests the line of basic questions with a prototypical wording each time, students should always be"
382,178,0.989,"A History of Male Psychological Disorders in Britain, 1945â1980","Shortly after the release of Blackâs report, researchers from the menâs health charity, Menâs Health Forum, warned that these findings had potentially serious consequences for men who spend more of their lives in the workplace and are much less likely than women to make use of almost all other forms of primary health provision. In their policy briefing paper, the authors noted that the NHS should âbegin to find ways of delivering services to men more effectively than has been the case in the past. Acting in partnership with employers to deliver health improvement services in the workplace offers a real opportunity to do thisâ.19 On an individual level, âengaging with the emotional lives of menâ in the twenty-first century appears to be no less problematic than it was fifty years ago.20 As recent research has shown, âgender, for males as for females, helps to shape life experience and behaviour, impacting most strikingly upon help-seeking and engagement with health servicesâ.21 When men do seek help, much distress is routinely unrecognised because many men âeffectively abandon psychological reflectionâ.22 Research suggests that socialisation for the male role leads some men to develop fewer emotional skills, leaving them less able to identify and articulate their feelings. Alexithymia (the inability to express emotions) is increasingly considered to be an aspect of normative masculinity and âas such poses a major barrier to men seeking therapyâ.23 There is also some evidence to suggest that alexithymia is associated with somatisaion.24 Frustratingly, many of these observations are not new. Insights presented over thirty years ago by the menâs movement in America suggested that âmen have not been socialised to be comfortable either with affective experience or with the processing of their inner experienceâ.25 Consequently, âdepression for many men may be a private experience, unshared with others, that men attempt to alleviate or remove by their own efforts without external helpâ.26"

For each concern on a row, a person or a group would be asked âHow do you address this?â drawing responses like âIt is not in the scope of our assignmentâ or âIt is handled in the X module?â Since there was no management overview of the document, teams would have a different understanding of a concept or term depending on what function they were working on. What was meant by âtrack changesâ, âdata reliabilityâ, and âtransparencyâ? The way the concerns spreadsheet was used contributed to contradictory responses for issues about provenance. There was also a basic translation problem requiring technical people to interpret abstract issues raised by the IEB. What does âdata transparencyâ actually mean to the different parties? These examples illustrate the significant limitations of document-based approaches to bridge the translation gap compared to face to face discussions. The benefits of the spreadsheet are recording and management of issues in one document (dates, notes added, a column for actions etc.) with the document providing a dynamic and ongoing record. The disadvantages are (i) sharing revisions with the IEB (ii) The nature of the document and the process (to contact relevant people in the consortium to ask if the issue is addressed) forces a âsiloâ approach â that is a response to a specific issue and no other issues (iii) the issue can be phrased ambiguously (e.g. the âtransparencyâ example above) and responding to the concern as expressed in the document results in a query. Without face-to-face, or vocal communication in some way (that allows for queries, elaboration, explanations) the concerns expressed have to be interpreted by the responder who is mostly operating in unfamiliar territory â ethical/privacy/ legal issues. If misinterpreted the responses are not likely to answer the concern. Both of these methods have benefits and both have been used, they are excellent methods for exploring the issues and sharing with developers the reasons why a particular item is an ethical concern. However, in the context of the âface-to-faceâ option, unless someone has been allocated to record the detail, or some pre-prepared âcheck sheetâ is completed, records of the meeting rely on notes and remembering conversations."

While the discussion on the policy cycle and locus might be more clearly stated, the discussion of the context for policies tends to seem elusive. As Avgerou (2010) has mentioned in the case of ICTs, oversimplifying context as a different âlocal cultureâ adds little value on understanding the interactions of people and technology in the developing world. With regard to policy context, it may involve understanding the interaction between policy and research, political systems, electoral processes, structure of governments, and so on. For the purpose of simplifying our understanding regarding the politics of implementing ICT4D initiatives and the role research can play in the process, I would argue for focusing on understanding the rational and value-driven aspect of policy problems. Hoppe (2010), for instance, looks into two dimensions of a policy problem: on the one hand, the level of certainty regarding relevant knowledge for the policy process and, on the other hand, the level of consensus on relevant norms and values. The first dimension is rational and relates to what is known about the problem at hand and how stakeholders react to such knowledge. Is knowledge valid, trustworthy, and relevant? The second dimension refers to values surrounding the problem and whether stakeholders agree or disagree on how the problem is defined and the values that should guide its solution. This way of thinking about the political context focuses on the relationship among the stakeholders involved in relation to their rational and value-based interpretation of the problem at hand. Some of the questions that could be seen from this perspective involve both the evidence and the value surrounding decisions on the role of the state and the provision and support of ICTs. Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore the perceptions of stakeholders. For instance, it could be interesting to examine how policy actors see technology, either as something that should be imported from the developed world or constructed locally or the result of the articulation of imported and local knowledge. It could also be interesting to explore if ICTs are seen as a disruptive or progressive force of development (Avgerou 2010), the expected uses of ICTs (Harindranath and Sein 2007), and how they would gauge the success of an ICT policy. Research in the realm of ICT4D-related policies and its politics is the basis to be able to plan research programmes that can respond to the challenges of public policy. This research allows understanding of the setting where ICT4D research would interact with policy and politics and sheds light on the complexities of policymaking and the adoption of ICTs in public programmes, projects, and regulations."

Seixas and Peck (2004) distinguish six main elements composing this ability of historical thinking: significance, epistemology and evidence, continuity and change, progress and decline, empathy and moral judgment, and historical agency (Seixas and Peck 2004). Although obviously relying on all these elements in order to be effective, the use of parrhesia when teaching historical wrongdoings of the in-group covered up by a literal social denial (Cohen 2001) addresses in a specific way the dimensions linked to empathy and moral judgment. It has to be stressed that, in this description of Seixas and Peck (2004), empathy is evoked not as a psychological construct, yet as an ability to perspective taking that is historically based. It means that, although trying to âimagineâ ourselves in the position of older generations when facing difficult choices, this kind of empathy is not based on âpresentism,â i.e., a cognitive short cut assuming that all people react in a similar way under different historical and cultural situations. On the contrary, this perspective taking is based âon a rich base of information about the fundamental structures and processes of everyday life during those (past) timesâ (Seixas and Peck 2004, p. 115), making it clear for students feeling empathy with past generations of the in-group that there are basic differences and changes between their life and life of their ancestors. Being empathic and aware of anachronistic abuses of imposing present-day moral standards to past situation, however, does not imply the impossibility to morally judge on past crimes. In fact, âexactly as with the problem of historical empathy, our ability to make moral judgment in history requires that we entertain the notion of an historically transcendent human commonalityâ (Seixas and Peck 2004, p. 115). Speaking fearlessly about moral transgressions committed by the in-group and then denied in the following social discourse, parrhesia specifically address this capability to recognize this urge to morally judge the past inherited by previous generations, without nourishing a relativism that disallows any condemnation, also when it is largely deserved. In the second part of the chapter, results of a case study on contemporary history teaching about colonial crimes committed by the Italian Army during the Ethiopia invasion (1935â1936) will be presented, in order to observe how conveying this knowledge, although referring to remote facts, may produce considerable effects on present-day young Italians. This study explores how such a kind of historical teaching, narrating in-group misdeeds formerly denied in the social discourse, may help young descendants of perpetrators to better understand their"

It is not merely the likeness which is precious in such cases â but the association and the sense of nearness involved in the thing â¦ the fact of the very shadow of the person lying there fixed forever! It is the very sanctification of portraits I think â and it is not at all monstrous in me to say, what my brothers cry out against so vehemently, that I would rather have such a memorial of one I dearly loved, than the noblest artistâs work ever produced. (Elizabeth Barrett Browning in a letter to Mary Russell Mitford, 1843) Photography is an elegiac art, a twilight zone â¦ All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another personâs (or thingâs) mortality. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographâs testify to timeâs relentless melt.

249,103,0.989,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"Although Dummett provides no further explanation for this change of heart, his reaction echoes that of other theorists who, in the intervening years, had come to conclude that the Theory of Constructions not only did not live up to Kreiselâs promise of providing a âsemantical foundationâ for intuitionistic logic, but was also ill-motivated because of its association with the second clause. As we are now in a good position to appreciate, however, the formulation of a theory such as T is independent of how (or even if) we elect to attempt to use its object language to formalize the BHK clauses. And as such, it seems that criticisms of the Theory of Constructions which are grounded in objections to the propriety of adopting the second clause are likely to be off base. Putting this observation to the side for the moment, it is also possible to identify two broad classes of criticisms which have been targeted at the second clause itself. The first of these is that the transition from (e.g.) (Pâ ) to (P2â ) either adds nothing to the original BHK interpretation or does not serve to resolve the problems which appear to have motivated Kreisel to introduce it. For instance, Girard [12] says the following: Since the â and â cases were problematic (from [the . . .] foundational point of view), it has been proposed to add to (Pâ ) [. . . ] the codicil âtogether with a proof that f has this propertyâ. Of course that settles nothing, and the Byzantine discussions about the meaning which would have to be given to this codicilâdiscussions without the least mathematical contentâonly serve to discredit an idea which, we repeat, is one of the cornerstones in Logic [12, p. 7]."

And, interdisciplinarity is inherently a team effort, requiring us to consider team work in a fundamentally different way. This puts emphasis on education as well as team building. The chapter uses robotics as an example of an interdisciplinary research area, heavily relying on ICT expertise but additionally on other disciplines such as biology, social sciences, and law. In such an interdisciplinary setting, the issue becomes how to organize research, and one way is without doubt to show strong leadership. This is describedâin the special case of a nonuniversity research settingâby Dunja MladenicÌ and Marko Grobelnik and their contribution âLeadership and Balance in Research.â They provide several observations, based on their experience of many years. One is that leadership requires clear philosophical alignment and fundamentals shared between all the members. An important issue is the organization of the team, which should be preferably flat (but not too flat) with well-defined roles, but as fluid as possible. And not surprisingly, one of the major fundamentals is to develop trust between people and maintain good human relationships."

(Laplaceâs rule gives a slightly different estimate.) Humans often make predictions this way. For example, when predicting whether I will like the food at a Vietnamese restaurant, I use my experience from previous visits to Vietnamese restaurants. One question that arises when doing induction with contexts is how long or specific the context should be. Should I use the experience from all Vietnamese restaurants I have ever been to, or only this particular Vietnamese restaurant? Using the latter, I may have very limited data (especially if I have never been to the restaurant before!) On the other hand, using too unspecific contexts is not useful either: Basing my prediction on all restaurants I have ever been to (and not only the Vietnamese), will probably be too unspecific. Table 2.2 summarises the tradeoff between short and long contexts, which is nicely solved by the CTW algorithm. The right choice of context length depends on a few different parameters. First, it depends on how much data is available. In the beginning of an agentâs lifetime, the history will be short, and mainly shorter contexts will have a chance to produce an adequate amount of data for prediction. Later in the agentâs life, the context can often be more specific, due to the greater amount of accumulated experience."

(Interviewee 4) All in all, the qualitative results of the British C.O.N.T.A.C.T. interviews reflect a microcosm of a wider geo-political youth movement which may in turn shift deï¬nitions of hate speech whilst the millennial generation increasingly adopt positions of socio-political power. Contemporarily, the evolved deï¬nitions of hate speech discussed are likely to be too radical for the general population to be regulated into law. Yet, the millennial generation show no explicit interest in legislation on three counts; 1. scepticism as to whether laws would be fairly enforced 2. a preference for community resistance 3. self-induced moral obligations to âstay wokeâ and reject hate speech are stronger than legal obligations. This raises wider questions surrounding tackling hate speech. A tendency to heavily rely on the law ignores the fact that juridical punishment often fails victims of hate speech, and provides no moral lesson for perpetrators. What the âwokeâ generation demonstrates is that tackling hate speech requires the work of communities to promote a moral obligation to treat one another with dignity, with a retrospective awareness of the historical origins of hate speech and âstructural violenceâ (Galtung 1969). With this grassroots or bottom up approach, law can be more trusted, and respected."

This discrepancy originates from a twofold aspect: on the one hand, rankings use a necessarily limited set of indicators to evaluate multi-output organizations, as universities are not enterprises; on the other hand, particularly in Europe, university is a right, not just an opportunity. HEIs are therefore complex organizations, and rankings measure only what is measurable, and not only what matters. In this perspective, we should not underestimate the fact that higher education systems should be increasingly more accountable to their stakeholders, who have a growing importance, both in the EU, as well as in the rest of the World. The second question suggests analyzing measures and indicators used in ranking systems. Given that âwhat you measure is what you getâ, the measurements cannot be limited only to what is easier to measure. Activities and countable phenomena are by sure easy to manage, but HEI should focus on education, which is deï¬nitely more difï¬cult to capture (Mio 2013). It is most important to understand how to measure the higher education and which are the more suitable indicators to this purpose, even if one should proceed by proxy. The ï¬rst point to assess is that it does not exist an absolute measure applicable to all organizations, but it is necessary to consider the context in which the university operates. For instance, the economic situation and the development rate of a country or region must be considered in the planning of a measurement system, particularly when measuring social impacts. Ranking universities have a challenging task because each institution has its own particular mission, focus and can offer different academic programs. Institutions can also differ in size and have varying amounts of resources at their disposal. Another important issue for university rankings is how to take into account the disciplinary differences across institutions. Some are more oriented toward the hard science, whereas others are more focused on liberal arts. Disciplines can differ in paradigms, preferred publication types, preferred research types (pure vs. applied), research methodology, time allocation between different types of academic activities. In addition, each country has its own history and higher education system which can impact the structure of their colleges and universities and how they compare to others. It is very difï¬cult to rank properly entire universities, especially across national borders, according to the single criterion of ranking indicators. The next step is to develop a set of indicators appropriate to measure the higher education. To do this, it could be useful to see which are those already used in the on-going evaluation process of education system (elementary school, middle school and high school). An important methodological issue for rating agencies concerns the proper weightings of indicators in overall rankings of institutions. Some indicators are"

(Volume 4.0),"shortcoming: there is no malware-free baseline with which heuristic methods can train their classifier. Even after having painted this bleak picture, there is still hope in the further development of static approaches. We have argued that full deobfuscation is very hard and often an impossible task. Still, it is possible to detect the existence of obfuscated code to some extent. One approach is therefore to agree with the vendor that the code used in your equipment will never be obfuscated. The problem with this is that obfuscation is used for many benign purposes as well. In particular, it is used for the protection of intellectual property. The balance between the benefits and drawbacks of obfuscation in the formation of trust between customers and vendors of ICT equipment needs further investigation before one can conclude whether banning obfuscation is a feasible way forward. What appears to be the most promising way forward for static approaches is a combination of specification-based techniques and proof-carrying code, which we will elaborate upon further in Sect. 9.8. Specification-based techniques have not been subject to the same amount of attention as the other techniques. Still, for our problem, it has one big advantage over the other methods: it does not require the existence of a clean system and it does not require the malware to have been identified and analysed beforehand. Proof-carrying code has the drawback of being costly to produce. Still, efforts in this area so far have been to provide proof that the code is correct. Our purpose will be somewhat different, in that we want to make sure that the code does not contain unwanted security-related functionality. Although this is not likely to make all problems go away, the combination of controlling the use of obfuscation, applying specification-based techniques, and requiring proof-carrying code on critical components has the potential to reduce the degrees of freedom for a supposedly dishonest equipment vendor. In recent years, malware detection has been based on a combination of static methods such as those discussed in this chapter and dynamic methods based on observing the actions of executing code. Such dynamic methods are discussed in the next chapter."

Such teacher-student role division promotes a familiar classroom teaching style, whereby the teacher talks and demonstrates and the student listens. My experience has shown that pair-programming is most effective when both developers are equally involved and proactive throughout the session. Therefore, I propose to view pairing across skill in the light of the leader/adopter pattern. The latter suggests equal participation of both developers in the session, with the experienced developer acting as the leader and the junior, as the adopter. The skill set of the leader should include both technical excellence and emotional intelligence - one or the other alone is insufï¬cient. The skill set of the adopter is incomplete, hence the role. During my time at YNAP I have had to heavily rely on my social skills to facilitate my own learning. This led me to a conclusion that technical expertise of an individual does not imply emotional maturity; consequently not all senior developers are good leaders. A simple metaphor of a parent teaching their child to ride a bike might help. The parent tasked with teaching is expected to not only be a conï¬dent cyclist themselves, but to be also adequately patient and articulated to lead their child through learning experience. From the adopterâs perspective, quality of pairing experience is heavily influenced by the emotional expertise of the leader. Continuing the cycling metaphor, the most effective teaching method involves a parent and a child working together as equals. In contrast, a parent demonstrating the technique by cycling around their child in silence, is obviously ineffective. Yet, when it comes to pair-programing, senior developers often choose the leading strategy of cycling around their junior pair."

Nevertheless, effective functionings are the only things researchers would probably be able to assess in the majority of studies: well-paid jobs, formal education achievement, income, etc. This would be the area or dependent variable in which ICT may have an impact. However, Fig. 1 shows that CAâs framework is even more complex, in the way that not all individuals are able to convert or generate capabilities in equal rates from the same features. This is due to differences in their conversion factors, which may be personal (i.e. literacy, cognitive ability, gender), social (i.e. culture, norms, values) and environmental (Zheng 2007: p. 2). Conversion factors may also be considered capabilities themselves, which mediate the conversion of ICTâs characteristics (Alampay 2006: p. 9; Garnham 1997: p. 32): literacies, knowledge on the use of ICT and the understanding of the implications of using information as a resource, to name just a few of them. Moreover, ICT commodities may also act as conversion factors or conversion factor enablers (Heeks and Molla 2009: p. 34). At this point, it is probably clear to the reader that the problem with CA is that as strong and comprehensive its theoretical and philosophical framework is, it is a very difficult framework to understand and apply, especially to a non-ICT researcher. As Heeks and Molla (2008: p. 33) argue, CA is âquite a dense set of ideas that can be hard to understand and translate into practical evaluation termsâ. For the sake of lowering barriers to entry to the ICT field, while CA provides a strong theoretical model on ICTâs impact on wellbeing, it is not the best candidate to use as a firstentry analytical framework."

Practice has shown that the following focus questions are helpful in exploring the five factors (Gunderson, 2009).

(b) What is the main religious orientation? (What might this mean for teachingâlearning relationships?

Few other terms have been used in so many settings with so many contradictory meanings. Political events in the Middle East have given dignity new meanings. Some analysts have gone as far as calling the revolutions and civil wars that have dominated this region in the early 21st century the âdignity revolutionsâ. With this book we want to show that the concept of dignity can be meaningfully employed in politics, philosophy and everyday life, if one is clear about its different meanings, and about which of those meanings to use in what context.

And in 2011, an armed intervention in Libya that started as a humanitarian intervention quickly morphed into a forced regime change drive. And before too long, several leading voices called for massive nation-building by introducing a Marshall Plan for the Middle East. Former U.S. National Security Advisor and NATO Supreme Allied Commander General James Jones has explained, âWe learned that lesson after World War IIâyou know, we rebuilt Europe, we rebuilt Japan. That was an example of an enlightened view of things. The Marshall Plan, I am told, wasnât very popular in this country, but we went ahead and did itâ (Jones 2011). Secretary of State Hillary Clinton believes âas the Arab Spring unfolds across the Middle East and North Africa, some principles of the [Marshall] Plan apply again, especially in Egypt and Tunisia. As Marshall did in 1947, we must understand that the roots of the revolution and the problems that it sought to address are not just political but profoundly economic as wellâ (Clinton 2011a). Two professors at Columbia Business School, Glenn Hubbard (who was also Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under George W. Bush) and Bill Duggan, argued that a Middle East Marshall Plan would âlimit the spread of Islamic extremismâ in the region (Hubbard and Duggan 2011). Senator John Kerry argued that âwe are again in desperate need of a Marshall Plan for the Middle Eastâ (Kerry 2011). Senator John McCain also expressed support for such a plan. And in Prospect, MP and former foreign office minister David Davis calls for a British Marshall Plan in the Middle East, arguing that such a plan âis one of the best ways to consolidate and support the Arab Spring as it stands, [and] could spark reform in other Arab Gulf countries tooâ (Davis 2011). Some realists and conspiracy theorists may well deconstruct these normative appeals and the reactions to them and point to other motives instead (access to oil being one often cited). However, I suggest that analysis of these rationales (not carried out in the confines of this chapter) would show that normative considerations, which had ârealâ effects because of their resonance with opinion makers and voters in the United States and in other nations, did play a significant role in the repeated transformation of foreign policy from a position that was antagonistic to forced regime change and nation-buildingâto one that sought to carry them out. (Some may argue that averting humanitarian crises requires expanding the mission to unseating tyrants and building civil society and stable governments. For my response, see below.) One serious difficulty the expansive approach to armed intervention encounters, as a normative principle, is that it has not been (and we shall see cannot be) consistently applied. In earlier ages, nations could act with limited concern for public opinion. However, as the masses became more educated and paid closer attention to public affairs (facilitated by greater access to information via the media), governments recognized the necessity of justifying their actions; they were now forced to provide a normative rationale for them. They would be held accountable. Fulfilling such a responsibility requires a measure of consistency. This is, of course, what is meant when one states that the Goddess of Justice is blind: she treats all comers in the same way, and it is in large part that consistency that legitimates her role as ultimate arbiter. Inconsistency is associated with arbitrariness, a failing of which the"

117,331,0.989,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Can âFinding an Endâ Be Acceptable in an Ongoing Care Process? The second theme summarized from the research findings is around care actions. Within the logic of care, care is an interactive, open-ended process that may be shaped and reshaped depending on its results (Mol 2008, p. 23). Nevertheless, nursing care has its boundaries in practice. In the research, a tension emerged between continually trying for care improvements and finding an end by accepting an undesired care outcome. This kind of distress is usually connected with the differences in care goals between patients and nurses, as well as their different perspectives on what âgoodâ is. A care intervention such as asking patients to follow strict nutrition rules may be considered as good for diabetes management, but may limit patientsâ day-to-day life and happiness a lot. Patients may therefore reject an approach to care during a care process. The logic of care implies the need to pay attention to the information obtained from care practice without passing judgment as to what is good or bad, so that healthcare professionals and patients respect each othersâ experience and are attuned to each othersâ strengths and limitations (Mol 2008, p. 65). While healthcare professionals are carrying out their duty of ensuring patientsâ safety and devoting themselves to keeping risk and harm away from patientsâ bodies, patientsâ wishes and/or desires may often be ignored. For instance, if a nurse tries to prohibit her patient from eating chocolate, which is his favourite food, that patient may suffer from the feeling of being controlled. On the contrary, if the nurse knows more"
305,176,0.989,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"The inability to clone a qubit has many important consequences. We want to be able to back up files and send copies of files to other people. Copying is ubiquitous. Our everyday computers are based on von Neumann architecture, which is heavily based on the ability to copy. When we run a program we are always copying bits from one place to another. In quantum computing this is not possible for general qubits. So, if programmable quantum computers are designed they will not be based on our current architecture. At first, the fact that we cannot clone qubits seems like a serious drawback, but there are a couple of important comments that need to be made. Often we want to prevent copying. We want to secure our dataâwe donât want our communications to be tapped. Here, as we saw with Eve, the fact that we cannot clone qubits can be used to our advantage, preventing unwanted copies from being made. The second comment is so important it deserves its own section. Quantum Computation versus Classical Computation The qubits 0 and 1 correspond to the bits 0 and 1. If we run our quantum CNOT gate just using the qubits 0 and 1 , and not any superpositions, then the computation is exactly the same as running a classical CNOT gate with 0 and 1. The same is true of the quantum version of the Fredkin gate. Since the classical Fredkin gate is universal and the quantum Fredkin gate using just 0 and 1 is equivalent to the classical gate, we can see that a quantum circuit can calculate anything that can be calculated by a classical circuit. The no-cloning property may seem worrisome, but it doesnât restrict us from doing classical computations in any way. This is a deep result. It shows that if we compare classical and quantum computation, we shouldnât think of them as different types of computation. Quantum computation includes all of classical computation. It is the more general form of computation. The qubit is the basic unit of computation, not the bit. Now that we have seen some basic gates, we will start to connect them together to form circuits."

379,141,0.989,"Tobacco Control Policy in The Netherlands : Between Economy, Public Health, and Ideology","PubliC suPPort for tobaCCo CoNtrol The flywheel model assumes that, at least in modern democracies, the adoption of policies reflects what the broader society wants. Tobacco policy generally reflects shifts in public opinion (Kagan & Nelson, 2001). Empirical evidence from US states has shown that when public opinion becomes more supportive of smoking bans, states are more likely to adopt them (Pacheco, 2012). Politicians know this and push for more stringent measures when they feel that society is ready. The battle is thus fought first in society, after which it moves to the political arena. When public opinion changes, politicians follow. As one former civil servant put it, âIt is a very slow process to get societal support. Politics usually follow trends in society, because this assures that you remain in office and can come back again â¦ it rarely happens that policy makers actively want to change public opinion.â5 The need to have support from the general public is well known among Dutch politicians and policymakers. They routinely refer to public support when they defend or reject tobacco control policy proposals. For example, State Secretary for Health Joop van der Reijden (VVD) explicitly made decisions to intensify tobacco control contingent on the political discussion in parliament, which âshall made clear whether the climate is ripe for a really powerful policyâ (WVC, 1986). In those days, the civil servants at the Ministry of Health who developed the first tobacco control policy measures complained that they did not feel supported by society or the medical sector.6 Twenty years later, when Health Minister Borst defended her tobacco control bill in the senate, she said, âI believe that exceptions [to the ban] can only disappear when we have a totally different culture in the Netherlands, a culture in which nobody, exceptions granted, smokes. â¦ We must not make things look"

He or she is less careful, since the cost of any mishaps for the most part will be taken care of by other parties. Most insurance companies are keenly aware of the dangers of moral hazard, and are therefore wary of offering conditions where the customers only have to take an insignificant part of the burden in case of an accident. Moral hazard also occurs when banks and other financial institutions engage in reckless transactions and investments, on the assumption that the authorities will save them if the market collapses. In work settings, the highest ranked professionals in an organization can engage in harassment and other anti-social behavior, expecting that their expertise and status as being irreplaceable experts will protect them against sanctions. Under such conditions, the agents do not fear moral luck, because they perceive themselves as invulnerable. For this reason, they may not hesitate to engage in an activity that may turn out to go horribly wrong. More specifically, moral hazard occurs in health care settings where the moral risks in relation to different treatments are measured (Antommaria & King, 2016; Brunnquell & Michaelson, 2016). The distinction between active and passive mistakes is useful in identifying the behavioral consequences of moral hazard. Human beings make mistakes of both kinds, but under a moral hazard regime, it is more likely that active mistakes dominate. The decision-maker worries less about the personal consequences, and takes more risk than if he or she would have had to take the burden of failure. From the decisionmakerâs perspective, moral hazard neutralizes the threat of bad moral luck: It may exist, but that is not a worry for a person who experiences protection against punishment or other forms of negative consequences for having caused bad outcomes. Another important and somehow neglected phenomenon in decision-making and moral risk is on the other side of the perceived protection spectrum from moral hazard. A decision-maker who feels fully exposed to repercussion in the event of a bad outcome, even when the risk he or she have taken appears to have been reasonable, will tend to act in an overtly cautious manner, and avoid doing anything that might conceivably end up badly. Fear of bad moral luck can lead to what we may call moral paralysis, a passive and cautious"
308,25,0.989,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"2. Reason (intellect, mind, al-âaql): God endowed humanity with the ability to use reason to differentiate between right and wrong, and to discern the proper course of action. Those who refuse to use their minds and follow their egotistic desires, and blind themselves with self-importance follow their instincts and hedonistic desires and deviate from the true path, becoming unable to minimally distinguish right from wrong. To be sure, even if they know the truth of the matter, they are inclined to follow their carnal desires and lust for material ends and tramp over whatever remains of their conscience. The Qurâan extols humanity to strive to control egotistic and hedonistic desires, and it deplores those who are arrogant, mischievous and having insatiated desire for wealth and power, which they use to crush the poor and weak. Muslim theologian, Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, has admonished people correctly when he says: âIf you cannot reach the level of Angels, then do not fall into the level of beasts, scorpions and snakes [3].â We will have more opportunity to cite the Qurâan and the Sunna, in addition to theological and philosophical heritage of Islam, when we undertake to elaborate this point further. 3. Revelation (wahy, Tanzil): Muslims believe that all communities had received Allahâs (Godâs) guidance through revelation given to the Prophets and Messengers of God. In Islam, Adam is not only ï¬rst human being; he is also the ï¬rst Prophet who delivered Godâs message of monotheism to his descendants. It is important to state from the outset that Muslims do not believe in original sin. Adam committed an act of disobedience by eating from the fruit of the tree which God had ordered him not to eat. According to the Qurâan, he and his wife, Eve, repented and God accepted their repentance and they became pure. God bestowed on Adam and Eve and their children His Grace and Blessing âWe honored the progeny of Adam, provided them with transport on land and sea; given them for sustenance things good and pure; and conferred on them special favors above a great part of Our creationâ (Qurâan/17:70). Furthermore, Muslims believe that God sent to every nation and people, prophets and messengers to guide them to worship one God and follow the path of righteousness. In other words, Muslims believe in all these prophets and that they brought the same religion in its essence, and worshipped only one God. This belief is the source of unity among human beings under the unity of Godâs religion, which is essentially the same. However the followers of these religions distort Godâs religion and bring back polytheism in different forms and shapes, by changing the pristine clear messages of the prophets altering the good teachings with adulterated misconceptions both in theology and morality. It is signiï¬cant to note that, as the youngest of the monotheistic traditions, Islam addresses the whole humanity and respects all the prophets from Adam to the last Prophet Muhammad and considers all nations to have witnessed Godâs uncompromising unity conï¬rmed in all the messages and teaching of Godâs true envoys on earth. Belief in Godâs unity (Tawhid) is the basis not only for Muslim theology; but it is also the basis of morality and ethics in Islam. We will return to this subject in greater detail in the ï¬rst two chapters: âThe Sources of Common Principles of Morality and Ethicsâ and âThe Origins of Islamic Morality and"

In his spare time, he engages in high culture, as an erotic art connoisseur for instance, being the owner of seven original erotic drawings by Egon Schiele. We learn that Cantor inherited a fortune from his father-in-law â a wealthy Jewish industrialist from Vienna, whose only daughter Cantor had married when she was thirty-six â and this heritage included a complete art nouveau interior, a fin-de-siÃ¨cle Viennese decor, transplanted to Chicago, whose most remarkable item is a seating machine (Sitzmaschine). But this sample from Viennese existence is now embedded in the American way of life and combined with a splendid view over Lake Michigan. In the course of the novel it becomes clear that Cantorâs actions are much more calculated, strategic and self-centred than is initially apparent. The race for priority (and indirectly for the Nobel Prize) is much more important to him than something like scientific âtruthâ. And Cantor is quite good at playing the publication game. At a certain point he deplores the abolishment of the pli cachetÃ©, the âsealed envelopeâ system (p. 62), a reference which requires some explanatory remarks concerning the history of the scientific journal which, originally, was not invented as a communication device, but as a device for solving priority conflicts (Zwart 2001). By establishing formal outlets in the form of journals, discoveries could now be attributed to the scholar who first published about it, or whose paper first reached the editor of an acknowledged journal. And the âsealed envelopeâ procedure meant that an article could be submitted so that a journal editor, who would date it upon receipt, but would refrain from opening it until the author was sufficiently certain that its content could be validated and replicated, or when a competitor was about to publish something similar. In that case, the original submission data of the pli cachetÃ© would demonstrate priority. If still in place, it would significantly reduce the risk of retraction, and it would certainly have solved Cantorâs dilemma. But it would also turn publishing into a kind of card game, with the sealed envelope functioning as a kind of trump card. âI wonder what made me think of the pli cachetÃ© systemâ, Cantor asks himself, âI hope itâs not some unconscious wish of mineâ (p. 63). From a Lacanian perspective, one could argue that the sealed envelope system demonstrates the extent to which the fate of the scientific subject may come to"

125,45,0.989,"Charismatic Christianity in Finland, Norway, and Sweden : Case Studies in Historical and Contemporary Developments","As already mentioned, the first Pentecostal preacher in Norway was originally a Methodist minister. This is significant. The fact that he traveled to the United States in 1906 in order to ask for financial support from American Methodist congregations is also important, because it points to the strong relationships of economic dependence between congregations in the two countries. It also shows the results of earlier NorwegianâAmerican contact, whereby American-influenced migrants had introduced Methodism five decades earlier. The financial aim of Barrattâs mission was unsuccessful, as he returned without a penny; what he brought with him from America was inspirationâliterally speakingâfrom the Pentecostal revival he had encountered âover there.â In this sense, the story is emblematic because it shows how new and larger processes can be set in motion almost by chance, but it also demonstrates that the introduction of new revivals greatly depends on the history of previous movements and on social structures. Here was a Methodist pastor who unwittingly encountered Pentecostalismâs different but also familiar message. We may say that Methodism provided the background that prepared Barratt for his encounter with Pentecostalism. In a similar manner, his own ministry provided a bridge to Pentecostalism for many others. When he went back to Norway to spread the âgood news,â he preached to Methodist congregations in which he was already known. In other words, Methodism offered an organizational network of congregations which allowed him to preach and secured him an audience across the country. More importantly, Methodism provided the theological concepts (e.g., sanctification through the Holy Spirit), looser liturgical structures, and enthusiastic preachers needed in order to make sense of the new message. Religious change and innovation are complex processes, partly because religions often rely on exclusive notions. In a study of medieval Catholicism, Jean-Pierre Albert analyzes the process of making new saints. In order for a would-be saint to be recognized as holy, he argues, the new saint needs to tap into existing traditions and provide answers to present-day relevant questions, needs, and expectations. If a would-be saint fails to do so, he or she is regarded as either crazy or possessed (Albert 1997, 47â48). Inspired by Max Weberâs ideal type of âthe prophet,â Albert points out that wouldbe saints pop up all the time, but only a few of them are taken seriously and become foci of devotion. For this to happen, the saintâs new message must be better adapted to the existing social and emotional conditions of believers. The aspect of Albertâs study that pertains to religious change is useful to the analysis in this chapter, because it helps clarify the significance of Pentecostalism in the Norwegian context, and it will thus be applied in the present analysis."

143,91,0.989,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Erik, there is a lot of controversy about government intervention into private-sector activities. What is your take? What should be the ideal role of government? So the role of the government is very simple: To reduce friction in the system for the technology industry to grow. What does that break down into? It breaks down into regulation that is actually good for businessâ speed of setting up business, tax breaks for new companies, things like that. Another example of friction in the system that does not need to exist is legacy laws that are 30 to 40 years old and put a 20 to 30 % duty on components imported into the country. I can import a fully assembled, packaged BRCK duty free. Yet the components to make it have a heavy import dutyâwhich means it does not make sense to import. In other words, I cannot create a new manufacturing industry in Kenya if we do not have the ability to bring in raw materials that are not produced in Kenya. Like this, we never will create industries unless we change these legacy laws. So again, governmentâs job is to reduce friction. And by reducing friction, they increase wealth and they increase jobs. Then there are other things, such as providing foundational access, of which the subsidization of the undersea cable by the government was a massive example. That is exactly what the government should be doing, massive projects that bring in both the public and private sectors and help things move further. Another one is regulation around spectrum allocation or licencing. How about foreign aid and NGOs? What should their role be? In a well-functioning state, most NGOs would not exist. There is only a limited role for them, because the market answers many of the problems, and the government should answer the rest. However, here in Kenya, we have one of the highest count of NGOs per capita in the world. It is an interesting dynamic though, because international NGOs bring in money for some things, which bastardizes the market for other things. It creates a whole realm of craziness that you would not find in other places. Let me give you an example. NGOs build bridges that after two years become dysfunctional.

Neither evidentialists nor reliabilists have been very explicit about this formal side. Conee and Feldman, when referring to the relation, speak about âfittingnessâ: a belief in a proposition is justified for a particular person if and only if that belief fits the personâs evidence.24 They explicitly refrain from describing the fitting relation in formal detail, presumably because they want to keep their analysis as general a possible. Reliabilists, of course, are not particularly interested in the formal side of the justification relation either, since they consider it inessential to the actual process of acquiring a justified belief. In contrast to both groups, we deem it fruitful to investigate the formal structure of the justification relation. As we will see, this will enable us to reconstruct the evidentialist and the reliabilist view as two interpretations of one and the same formal framework."

Filters of how we perceive and thus feel in situations and habitualized circuits of interpretation are modeled in our brains in parallel to our experiences in the environments we happen (or choose) to live in (Hanson 2009).

Their English was very poor and they had no advocacy interpreters. She noted that âyou wouldnât really know at all what was going on with themâ.111 Mental and physical diseases were often exacerbated by addiction to alcohol and drugs. Heroin addiction became a âdevastatingâ problem in the East End of London during the 1980s.112 Compliance with medication regimes also differed between groups. Bangladeshis were in general very compliant with prescriptions and medication, whereas Afro-Caribbean patients were less keen on taking medicines or relying on traditional western medicine.113 Psychosomatic presentations were common in both men and women from different ethnic backgrounds; however, Sarah Hall maintained that for women there would âbe a much more rapid shift into a psychiatric domainâ.114 Both GPs with experience treating immigrant communities were of the opinion that patients who somatised were not able to express distress beyond bodily pain. Robertson maintained that if one were to ask any east London GP, they would tell you how difficult it was to manage psychological symptoms in immigrant groups because of what he described as the âI hurt all overâ syndrome.115 As Hashmi had noted in his paper in 1970, presentations were often culturally specific. Hall suggested, for example, that a psychological diagnosis would be seen as threatening in Bengali culture because it would suggest weakness: If the psychological domain meant you were weak, that you might have a family weakness . . . that might be very troublesome when your daughters or sons came to get married, an alliance, you know. So any hint of weakness was really quite difficult.116 Hall explained that, while wishing to avoid generalisations about all Bengalis, most often, as patients, their favoured discourse was in the physical domain, articulated through some kind of pain â usually gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal. Often a patient would present with a long list of different pains and would be reluctant to accept a psychological diagnosis due to the stigma attached to it. According to Hall, for example, the Bengalis did not have a word for âdepressionâ in their culture.117 Often, patients would be uncomfortable with the language and the concepts of western medicine. Eventually, Hall realised that it was mostly counter-productive to apply western concepts and illustrated"
137,140,0.989,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"sexuality (Pacaut et al. 2011, p. 6). Fatherhood as an âidentity projectâ is also an issue; indeed, according to Pacaut et al. (2011, p. 6), âBeing a father is more than a social role, it is an identity project.â In this line of thought, according to LacharitÃ© (2009, cited in Pacaut et al. (2011 p. 6), âIt is not so much the realization of tasks, duties or obligations that defines the contours of fatherhood, but rather the fact that men accept (or more precisely, negotiate!) to engage themselves in the paternal role which constitutes its substance.â Dulac and LacharitÃ© (mentioned above) were amongst the first authors on fatherhood, but they mainly looked at the issue from an identity and psychological perspective. Research on work-family articulation long centered on women and mothers, until researchers started to look at fathers in the 2000s (Tremblay 2003). In Quebec, the work on Canadian fathers by Doucet (2006) is known by researchers in the field. However, there is a strong language barrier between Canada and Quebec, so that social debates are different and it is mainly Quebec authors, feminist groups and womenâs committees in trade unions that animate debates on these issues of fatherhood and parenthood. While we cannot say that in Quebec, paternity leave has come to be âtaken for grantedâ as much as is the case in Sweden, it is surely more the case than in the rest of North America, where there is no such leave reserved for fathers. Also, the whole debate on work-family reconciliation has been extremely important in the last decades, with the Ministry of the Family being very active in supporting workfamily programs. The Ministry which offers financial support to firms in order to develop such programs, has developed some web pages and published a âworkfamily best practiceâ guide, as well as a âwork-family normâ. This ânormâ is in fact more of a âlabelâ or recognition that firms have followed a formal process to develop work-family measures and it is supported by the Normalisation Board, which also deals with ISO workplace norms. The debate on parental/paternity leave was thus very active in Quebec and any attempt by a government to change the regulation or benefits in the context of austerity measures, brings the âparental leave coalitionâ back to life. Indeed, Quebec unions and womenâs groups formed a coalition which pushed this issue forward for some 10 years, until the new parental leave regime was adopted in 2006 (Tremblay 2012a; Doucet et al. 2009). In 2014, when the Liberal government just âhintedâ at reducing QPIP benefits, there was immediately a very vocal opposition to any questioning of what is seen as an important social program and part of working parentsâ rights. The objective of this new parental and paternity leave was to favor a stronger participation of fathers in leave, as well as equality between men and women more generally. The traditional obstacles to men taking leave are still present, that is some workplace opposition, the fact that men still usually earn more than women, and that there may be resistance on the part of some mothers at the idea of losing part of âtheirâ leave. This is precisely why there was a lobby for a non-transferable paternity leave. Interestingly, workplace opposition was apparently not important in the case of the fathers who participated in our research. There was little to ânegotiateâ as the leave has come to be seen as a ârightâ for most fathers, and relatively well accepted in the work environment, although there are surely workplaces that oppose"

For example, when the risk of Covid-19 was communicated to the public in February 2020 (i.e. at the very start of the pandemic), it was important to find the balance between transparency and public panic. It was important to communicate so that it protects vulnerable populations (e.g. people with immunodeficiency problems). It is also important to avoid conflicts of interest. When communicating risks, we also need to consider legal frameworks and regulations. For example, we need to be compliant with privacy and data protection laws, with advertising and marketing restrictions, and with health and safety regulations."

The reasons are illustrated by the United Nations Environment Program GEO-5 report for the UN Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012 (Fig. 2.4). Here we see that the outer layer (or low-ranking adjustments in Meadowsâ list), will change little in the overall dynamic of development: Putting different people in charge of making political or managerial adjustments is not going to bring about a system innovation as long as the levers they pull are the same as before. They can only use them with the same information and the same rules as before and thus keep on pursuing the same old goal. Thus, while the exchange of CEOs or political leaders is often sold as a radical measure, it may not turn out to be radical in effect unless the new leaders start repurposing the system by tackling the high leverage points. Unfortunately, most of the attention in sustainable development thinking has focused on adjusting to system feedbacks or tackling the symptoms of environmental degradation and of extreme poverty. Most of the resource efï¬ciency agenda remained within this remit, as did a poverty alleviation agenda that declares yet more growth for the richest to be a precondition for redistribution measures. This is understandable given that these changes are easily visible and can be measured in quantitative numbers, both of which are important standards in project planning and evaluation under the current short-term, costâbeneï¬t paradigm. This is also not very surprising in political and economic systems in which having more than others is seen as an indicator of merit and superiority and where the avoidance of short-term costs for voters and stakeholders is what counts most for election purposes or investment decisions. It is also very understandable in situations in which the bare necessities for life must be met and path-dependent solutions are the easiest, fastest or economically cheapest remedy for disaster prevention."
252,50,0.989,The Ethics of Vaccination,"tured, loose collections of individuals, rather than the responsibilities of organized, structured groups that can be assimilated to individual agents (List and Pettit 2011). Also, in principle and in an ideal world, the collective in question would have to include the entire global population, because local failures to realize herd immunity could endanger the life or health of the vulnerable people living in a certain area. Therefore, ideally, the type of collective obligation we are looking for would have to be what Bill Wringe called a âglobal obligationâ (Wringe 2014). However, in many areas of the world, and in developing countries especially, access to vaccines can be both very difficult and very expensive. It seems unreasonable to expect that people in poor countries who do not have access to vaccines have a collective moral obligation to contribute to the realization of herd immunity. I will proceed under the assumption that the collective obligation to realize herd immunity, although in principle a âglobal obligationâ, given the situation of our world, currently only applies to the group of people with easy access to vaccines. Now, if it is true that the obligation to realize herd immunity cannot be individual, it also seems problematic to argue that there exists a collective to which such responsibilities can be attributed. Some authors, for example Peter French (1984), have argued that only collectives with a formal decision structure can be the subjects of collective obligations. These types of groups constitute collective entities that, because of their internal structure and decision procedures, count as particular types of agents and therefore might bear a form of responsibility (as some have argued, including Pettit 2007, and List and Pettit 2011). However, people who together have the causal power to realize herd immunity constitute simply a random collection of individuals. There is no structured and formal connection or coordination among individuals that render them a collective agent. And to the extent that we think that only agents, that is, individuals that can intentionally act, can have the responsibility to act in certain ways, the collective that could realize herd immunity cannot have the moral responsibility to realize herd immunity, at least not in the same sense as agents like a state or a corporation have the responsibility to bring about or prevent certain outcomes. Attribution of collective responsibility to unstructured groups might reflect some form of metaphorical talking, but it is difficult to see how collective responsibility can literally be attributed to such groups. However, according to some, it is not necessary that a group has a structure and an internal organization in order to be considered an agent and therefore a subject of collective obligations.

28,178,0.989,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"Kesselâs âself-poisoningâ: similarities and modifications Kesselâs self-poisoning is different in three main ways from Stengel and Cook and Batchelor and Napier. The self-conscious nature of the appeal is the strongest and simplest notion of intent yet seen, and the archetypal behaviours and gender stereotypes are explicitly discussed. Further, Kesselâs self-poisoning is rooted in an amorphous category of distress. This emotional state is thought common to all self-poisoning episodes, through which point of view it becomes a distinct, coherent clinical object. Thus in all three ways, Kesselâs self-poisoning is more definitely, more precisely and more securely established: the intent is self-consciously to appeal; the stereotypes of young women and overdose are explicit; and interpersonal, present-centred stress and distress hold the object together at a deep conceptual level. However, much remains the same under this new term. Much of the intense scrutiny focuses upon the familiar issues of lethality and intent. These function as part of a debate between therapeutic regimes. Kessel and two social-work colleagues make it very clear in 1963 that physical danger to life and psychiatric pathology are to be assessed separately: [N]o simple relationship exists between the degree of danger to life and the seriousness of any psychological disorder present. Many people who have been deeply unconscious we allow to go home after physical recovery because they require only a minimum of psychiatric supervision afterwards; on the other hand, a sixth of the patients who had not risked their life at all needed admission to a psychiatric hospital, and many more needed extensive out-patient care.16 There is a complex relationship between danger to life and a psychological disorder.

78,340,0.989,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"In scientific terms, humans are treated as mere scientific objects, i.e., they are elucidated with a view to predict and/or to manipulate them7. As pointed out by Arendt, the scientific discourse is indexed on necessity: âwhat science and the quest of knowledge are after is irrefutable truth, that is, propositions human beings are not free to rejectâthey are compellingâ (Arendt 1978, p. 59). In scientific terms, contingency is just another name for âepistemic failureâ, a not-yet-known. By denoting contingency with the term uncertainty, i.e., as a negative, certainty is made the norm or the ideal. And scientific knowledge is paired with certainty of facts, even after several decades of quantum mechanics, which rather teaches us that uncertainty and indeterminacy are intrinsic to scientific knowledge as well. This scientific register positions humans as an object of enquiry, a âmaterialâ, inherently heteronomous i.e., as fully determined by external materials, forces and processes. When considered in ethical terms, as Arendt put it ironically, âattemps to define human nature almost invariably end with some construction of a deityâ¦â (Arendt 1959, p. 12). Furthermore, she reckons that freedom has wrongly been identified with sovereignty in political and philosophical thought: âIf it were true that sovereignty and freedom are the same, then indeed no man could be free, because sovereignty, the ideal of uncompromising self-sufficiency and mastership, is contradictory to the very condition of plurality. No man can be sovereign because not one man, but men, inhabit the earthâand not, as the tradition since Plato holds, because of manâs limited strength, which makes him depend upon the help of othersâ (Arendt 1959, p. 210). Understanding freedom as sovereignty has a huge price, the price of reality: âsovereignty is possible only in imagination, paid for by the price of realityâ (Arendt 1959, p. 211). Ethical/philosophical narratives of what it is to be human contend with the need to escape from, or at least to balance with,"

306,8,0.989,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Accumulated experience enables children to create a data set that is used by them to build up their mathematical knowledge. The use of materials for manipulation (e.g., stacking ready-made elements) has been considered to be the most effective learning environment. In addition, childrenâs drawings also have a high research value (Swoboda 2007). Patternsâ arranged with blocks, folded with puzzles, made from plasticine, lined from small pictures and ï¬gures, or drawnâare a friendly environment for children as they are close to their natural, spontaneous activity. They give the pleasure of creation without worrying about the outcome, create a chance to speak out without the fear of criticism, enable the realization of oneâs own ideas, and give motivation for manual and intellectual work. Research conducted in the United States has shown that more than 94 % of children beginning their education are able to count to 10 and identify basic shapes (Ginsburg 2004). Additionally, children between 5 and 10 can act in the âworld of regularitiesâ by discovering them. During the creation of geometrical compositions, constructing buildings with blocks, or decorating carpets, children not only better learn geometrical shapes (by comparing the lengths of the sides or recognizing the size of the angles). They may also feel the need for such arrangements that an adult can describe using the language of geometrical relationships. Symmetry, illustrated either in a broader or narrower sense, is an idea that has been used by people to describe beauty, order, and perfection. These arrangements may appear accidentally, by trying and checking, until the child considers them to be sufï¬ciently pretty. A sense of order tends to be veriï¬ed visually by children. Hence, propaedeutic of geometrical ï¬gure-to-ï¬gure relationships may reside in the sense of a certain order or harmonyâa speciï¬c arrangement of a surface or available fragment of space. The idea of engaging children in the world of rhythms and regularities is a welcome phenomenon. The preschool period is already a good time for children to become interested in building shapes and ï¬nding patterns (Clements 2001). Generally, it has been stated that creating their own patterns is a good starting point for childrenâs understanding of geometrical transformations. It is a long way to go from building a mosaic to creating geometrical concepts, but the connection between both is clear. In some handbooks for teachers, there are suggestions to do exercises with changing a ï¬gureâs position, such as drawing patterns and mosaics where translation, rotation, and mirror symmetry are used (Jones and Mooney 2003). The creative process included in childrenâs activities is regulated by perception. Theories concerning the development of geometrical reasoning stress that, at ï¬rst, understanding is passiveâconsisting of attracting attention to a particular phenomenon: the shape of a ï¬gure or line or the mutual arrangement of objects in"

However, as briefly illustrated in this chapter, what society requests to engineers is being changed fundamentally now. This change had been unfolded even before the Fukushima Accident happened, but both of magnitude and velocity of it has been even increased so much in this Post-Fukushima society. If nuclear engineers donât listen to peopleâs voice, donât change their thinking, donât suggest alternative picture of nuclear utilization for society, the future of nuclear technology could never be positive one. What people would like to have is never intentionally unified, stereotypical answer that suggests the existence of bureaucratic control on the nuclear engineering community. But, citizens and all other stakeholders desire to have more diversified and organized options that have been elaborated through unfettered discussion and sincere efforts by independent engineers. They are waiting for the nuclear engineers to break their fetters of ânuclear villageâ. As Borrelli argues, we need âthird generationâ nuclear engineers âthat will lead and shape perspectives on nuclear technology and develop new relationships with societyâ [11]. It is the era of unprecedented challenges in nuclear field. Innovation in nuclear power system, treatment of contaminated environment by the Fukushima Accident, decommission of damaged Fukushima plants, management of various kinds of radioactive wastes, almost all contemporary challenges in the nuclear field have no established paradigm or concrete model-cases. Itâs not the era of âlong-term planâ set by the Government as the rock-ribbed law. Most of them are not just technically solvable in the sense of conventional engineering practices. They ârely on more than numbersâ [9]. Social-scientific literacy is not a tool to manipulate public sentiment, rejecting their voices. It is a method to listen to it carefully, to find and grasp needs in society, to suggest engineersâ proposal to society in humble and sincere manner and to collaborate with other stakeholders than nuclear engineersâ âold friends.â Engineers can take its advantages to make their thoughts and practices more open-minded ones as discussed in this chapter. It can become a strong tool to break their fetters, of course. Return of diversified and independent nuclear engineers is now being waited by society."
282,48,0.989,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"Why do organisations generally, including partnerships, need appropriate accountability mechanisms? For many this may seem like asking âwhy should individuals behave morally?â so obvious seems the normative content of accountability. As argued in the Introduction, the moral appeal of the concept of accountability is so strong that it has become a rallying cry for partnership critics. If the charge that partnerships are unaccountable can be substantiated, this would seriously undermine the partnership approach to public policy. It may be because accountability is a âhurrahwordâ (Bovens, 2005, p. 182) that it is rarely discussed why we actually see it as a âgoodâ. Without a clea r normative basis, however, there is bound to be confusion over what accountability means in practice. Note, for example, that our accountability expectations differ significantly depending on the kind of institution concerned. Thus an accountable government needs democratic elections, an informed public, effective parliamentary control systems and transparency on decision making and the budget. An advocacy NGO, by contrast, may be expected to be transparent about the sources of its funds and their allocation, but not necessarily to be democratic in its operations. Mulgan and Uhr confirm these differences in expectations when they write: Although the term âaccountabilityâ is fundamental to governance discourse, expectations of accountability vary quite markedly with different institutional and community perspectives. (Mulgan and Uhr, 2000, p. 1) Faced with these variations, some analysts propose to abandon accountability as a normative principle. Brown and Moore, for example, propose to treat accountability not as an abstract, fixed moral ideal, but instead as a strategic idea. [â¦ In this conception,] instead of there being one right answer of how best to structure accountability, one gives a contingent answer. (Brown and Moore, 2001, p. 2)"

However such an approach will not identify all safety issues and it is not well adapted to either understanding or improving safety in community settings.

117,82,0.989,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Giving Preference to Emotional Knowledge The above criteria show that care ethics differs from other forms of ethics above all in the way in which problems are perceived. It perceives the ethical problem in different terms, which are not just related to the above basic elements, but rest more fundamentally on a wider concept of knowledge. For care ethics, knowing the objectifiable and formalisable facts does not suffice; care ethics also draws on what could be called âimplicit knowledgeâ. The critical role of relationships, the demand for an adequate perception of the situation, and the prioritising of creative solutions over deductive inference necessitate implicit forms of knowledge such as experiential knowledge, situational knowledge, and relationship knowledge. Valuing these forms of knowledge, which go beyond the confines of a formal-logical approach, is the essence of care ethics. They are forms of knowledge that cannot be learnt by heart but must be practised. According to care ethics, competence could be described as skill in dealing with ambiguity. The ability to cope with complexity plays a significantly more constitutive role here than in other forms of ethics. This perhaps also explains why the medical community continues to give little importance or support to care ethics. Care ethics represents a counterpoint to operational rationality because it practices a rationality of its own, in which feelings, intuition, and sensations are just as important as calculations, and in which experience is ascribed an epistemological value which is overlooked in the structural logic of modern medicine. In this regard, care ethics is more progressive than many forms of principlism, because it does away with the prejudice of the irrationality of feeling, because it takes the knowledge content of feelings seriously and in this respect constitutes an implicit plea to place more value on emotional knowledge. The specific challenge of care ethics, on the other hand,"

These meanings are even more important when considering psychological categories that ascribe meaning to the actions of human beings who, themselves, are aware that they are being described and labelled in various ways. Through interaction with these powerful diagnostic labels, people can come to understand themselves through the motivations and emotions provided by the diagnoses. Telling someone that they are âunconsciously crying for helpâ when they profess to be trying to kill themselves can change how individuals understand their own actions. Diagnoses can become much more than labels â they can form part of peopleâs identities. If such descriptions are unavailable in a certain context, and the labels are different, the meanings produced are different. After engaging briefly with some current accounts of self-harm, we can open up these conceptual and philosophical issues about descriptions of behaviour in the past, asking precisely what we mean by an epidemic of communicative overdosing before asking how it becomes available to historians in credible ways. The various sources of information (coronersâ statistics, police reports, hospital records, etc.) that allow historians to access âsuicidal behaviourâ are assessed, and the consequences that flow from using different kinds of information are outlined. These differences are a crucial part of the context. Since the nineteenth century, studies of suicide have been largely based upon well-established judicial registration procedures (coronersâ statistics) from which a picture of âsuicideâ is formed. No such registration practices exist for âattempted suicideâ in this period. From the late 1930s this phenomenon of overdosing emerges from hospitals, which are very different indeed from coronersâ offices. The easy combination of material from very different sources (highlighted in Andersonâs combination of hospital and police records to produce parasuicide) also occurs in the literature between coroners and hospitals, between suicide and attempted suicide. The distinction between two sources of information is erased. We then turn to the specifics of our story. The context right at the core of this work is one which enables patients who arrive at hospitals after having suffered a physical injury to be assessed by psychological and psychiatric clinicians. It is this psychological expertise, and the assumptions contained within it, that enable the presenting physical injury (in"

With the fragmentation and proliferation of resistance, it is difï¬cult to identify speciï¬c professions that are more active than others in online and social media resistance, and it is also difï¬cult to identify differences in concerns and methods across national borders.

Usually, prayer over an object breaks its occult ties (see Meyer 1998). Fabrice did not suggest prayer as a strategy to make the smartphone safer. Rather, the user was supposed to possess sufficient Christian knowledge to handle the technology in a moral way. Therefore, along with âmediationâ, a currently hot topic in the anthropology of technology, âconnectivityâ deserves greater theoretical investigation. Both âmediationâ and âconnectivityâ emphasize interaction (social or spiritual) and allow room for agency; yet, while âmediationâ emphasizes the in-between, the transfer of communication, power, and value, and at times even suggests the resolution of conflict, âconnectivityâ attends to the relationships generated, to âaccessibilityâ or âavailabilityâ, and to the possibility of entering into a relationship with an Other (socially and/or spiritually), whether technologically mediated or not. In Kinois terms, it is âyou who open the doorâ (ofungoli porte)âa familiar idiom to describe oneâs receptiveness to the Holy Spirit or to bad spirits. Witches are not just mediators of evil powers; they also connect the souls of their victims to demonic powers. Through kindoki, bewitched people have access to new, invisible, realms of identity, success, and power. Witches open the doors between the visible and invisible worlds. Very much like ICT, therefore, witches connect people with other worlds, even as people are not always aware of the consequences of entering therein. Telling in this regard is the name attributed to the ingredients of the medicine bugota used in magic by Sukuma farmers in Tanzania (Stroeken, this volume): shingila, entrances. As Stroeken describes, the power of this medicine depends on its relatedness to others parts of culture. âWherever âmagicâ works in the world, the reason is a sense of differential relatednessâ. Via the medicine, the patient is connected to multiple worlds. This complex state of belonging defies homogenization and total control and is characterized by ambiguity and negotiations. According to Stroeken, who draws on Gluckmanâs distinction between simplex and complex societies, Pentecostal Christianity cannot accept the multiplexity of peopleâs relationships and tries to reduce the ties between people. Pentecostal discourses emphasizes oneâs responsibility in âopening the doorâ via technology. The ways in which âconnectivityâ or"

With both FODWs and their families in sight, this chapter suggests in its final analysis that we cannot conclude that the emerging activities of FODWs represent a great sign of âinsecurity reductionâ if one thereby ignores the inherently double-sided dimension of the problem. It also emphasizes that the nexus of global householding and global de-householding affects our lives in todayâs globalized world, and no one, whether in Europe, Africa, or Asia, can be free from the changesâand even crisesâcaused by the reconfiguration of the household beyond national borders.

Am I interpreting her rendering in much more positive terms, because I have her open acknowledgement âthat Mother is very fortunate to be able to afford such care, and that I am very fortunate to have her near â but not in â my homeâ (14)? Given that the issue of gender is part of how we read a narrative, I wonder whether we absorb Foxâs photo book, Lindberghâs memoir or even Spohrâs account â which is, after all, written in the emotional turmoil of losing the beloved husband â with deeper involvement as they are told by a woman, with whom I, as a gendered reader, might in addition identify more ï¬uidly.

This raises the question, âWhy is it appropriate to score y in a way that dramatically amplifies group differences in contact with Whites as observed in this example?â Relatedly, âIn what way is the exaggerated difference of 59.1 points on y scored for G and 100.0 points for y scored for D more sociological meaningful than the smaller difference of 23.8 points for y scored for S?â Perhaps compelling answers to these questions can be given. For now, however, the measurement literature does not provide a ready answer and I am skeptical that a compelling answer can be advanced. Regardless, it will remain the case that in these segregation comparisons examining S and its component terms reveals important information that would be missed if one looked only at G and D. Specifically, S documents that White-Asian segregation does not involve group residential separation and neighborhood polarization whereas White-Latino segregation and especially White-Black segregation do. The practical implication is straightforward; one cannot safely assume that high values of G and D indicate a prototypical pattern of segregation. One must also examine S to draw a safe conclusion on this issue."

From an Arendtian perspective, being a citizen means having the right to be publicly visible, The centrality of emotions for (collective) political (in)action, such as hope and fear in our case, has also been highlighted by various social movement scholars (see Goodwin et al. 2001; Goodwin and Jasper 2004)."

According to Landberg and Svedin (2013), some Barnahus have a clear structure for collaboration after the interview. This included a follow-up case conference. Duties with regard to who is responsible for informing parents and children were allocated among the professionals. In other Barnahus, the routines for determining who informs the child after the interview were non-existent. Eight Barnahus (35%) had clear and consistent procedures for the return of the child and how the collaboration between the authorities worked after the police interview. Twelve (52%) had clear procedures that were not always followed. Three Barnahus could not describe any clear procedure. This means several professionals could inform the child or its parent, or none at all, with the consequence that a child could come home to the suspected parents without any support for either of them. The lack of routines described above compromises the right of the child to be informed. This can have severe consequences since the child can be sent home to a potentially dangerous environment, and shows the need for a national standard of routines, including the need to ensure that the routines are followed."
28,180,0.989,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"intervention ... it certainly is not right that mildness of method indicates lack of severity of psychological illnessâ.17 A year later Kessel and various collaborators talk of the dangerous fallacy of âusing this yardstick of physical damage to judge whether the patient needs psychological treatmentâ.18 The clinical object exists between therapeutic regimes, but (somatic) lethality is downplayed. The communicative overdose remains a tactical intervention between therapeutic regimes where the significance of the act is determined not by its physical consequences but its psychosocial context. The first major difference is the explicit archetypal method. In 1965 Kessel entitles his Milroy (public health) Lectures at the Royal College of Physicians âSelf-poisoningâ. These two articles are key in further publicising the terminological debate around attempted suicide. Rather than accept Stengelâs and Cookâs increasingly established modification of the term, Kessel finds attempted suicide, âboth clinically inappropriate and misleadingâ,19 advancing self-poisoning because it allegedlyâ describes the phenomenon without interpreting it along a single pathwayâ.20 However, Kessel is opening up and closing down various possibilities. His terminological offering is intended to sidestep issues of intention (âinterpretingâ here indicates assessments of intent), but collapses all possible behaviours into one archetype. These lectures describe a rather unorthodox practice in the promotion of self-poisoning stereotypes. Kessel sends an actor into six chemist shops in Edinburgh, instructed to simulate being in floods of tears, and to request two hundred aspirin. Kessel reports that she was served in every shop and only once was concern expressed: âTwo hundred? Are you all right? You ought to go and have a cup of teaâ. This state of affairs is described in strong terms as irresponsible.21 This expresses the twin facts that a âsobbing girlâ is typical of self-poisoners and that purchasing a large quantity of aspirin in this state is obviously a suicide risk â which also narrows the method of attempted suicide. Kessel concedes that definitions of self-poisoning are difficult and fraught with complexity, but he uses phrases like âmimicking suicideâ, âsimulation of deathâ, and âdrama was enacted for their own circleâ.22 Such phrases expose a simplification of intent: this is not Batchelorâs and Napierâs childhood emotional trauma surfacing, nor Stengelâs and Cookâs unconscious, ambiguous ordeal. This is performance, deception and drama. The object is still unarguably social, but now very much self-consciously so. This is clearest in one of his last publications on the subject: âThe respectability of self-poisoning and the fashion for survivalâ (1966). He claims that âit is common knowledge that you can take a lot"
235,24,0.989,"Physical (A)Causality : Determinism, Randomness and Uncaused Events (Volume 192.0)","A typical example for a successful application of Descartesâ fifth and thirteenth rule is the method of separation of variables for solving differential equations [204]. For instance, SchrÃ¶dinger, by his own account [450] with the help of Weyl, obtained the complete solutions of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the hydrogen atom by separating the angular from the radial parts, solving them individually, and finally multiplying the separate solutions. So it seems that more fundamental microphysical theories should always be preferred over phenomenological ones. Yet, good arguments exist that this is not always a viable strategy. Anderson, for instance, points out [13] that âthe ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe. . . . The constructionist hypothesis breaks down when confronted with the twin difficulties of scale and complexity. The behaviour of large and complex aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in terms of a simple extrapolation of the properties of a few particles. Instead, at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of the new behaviours requires research which I think is as fundamental in its nature as any other.â One pointy statement of Maxwell was related to his treatment of gas dynamics, in particular by taking only the mean values of quantities involved, as well as his implicit assumption that the distribution of velocities of gas molecules is continuous [234, p. 422]: âBut I carefully abstain from asking the molecules which enter where they last started from. I only count them and register their mean velocities, avoiding all personal enquiries which would only get me into trouble.â Pattee argues that a hierarchy theory with at least two levels of description might be necessary to represent these conundra [384, p. 117]: âThis is the same conceptual problem that has troubled physicists for so long with respect to irreversibility. How can a dynamical system governed deterministically by time-symmetric equations of motion exhibit irreversible behaviour? And of course there is the same conceptual difficulty in the old problem of free will: How can we be governed by inexorable natural laws and still choose to do whatever we wish? These questions appear paradoxical only in the context of single-level descriptions. If we assume one dynamical law of motion that is time reversible, then there is no way that elaborating more and more complex systems will produce irreversibility under this single dynamical description. I strongly suspect that this simple fact is at the root of the measurement problem in quantum theory, in which the reversible dynamical laws cannot be used to describe the measurement process. This argument is also very closely related to the logicianâs argument that any description of the truth of a symbolic statement must be in a richer metalanguage (i.e., more alternatives) than the language in which the proposition itself is stated.â StÃ¶ltzner and Thirring [489, 493, 529], in discussing Heisenbergâs Urgleichung, which today is often referred to as Theory of Everything [34], at the top level of a âpyramid of laws,â suggest three theses related to a âbreakdownâ to lower, phenomenologic, levels: â(i) The laws of any lower level . . . are not completely determined by the laws of the upper level though they do not contradict them. However, what looks like a fundamental fact at some level may seem purely accidental when looked at"

382,25,0.989,"A History of Male Psychological Disorders in Britain, 1945â1980","As Robertson and Williams recently pointed out, âmasculinitiesâ should not be seen as character types and attributes held by individuals; they can alternatively be recognised as âprocesses of arranging and âdoingâ social practice that operate in individual and social settingsâ.91 Using this approach, I have been able to understand better the possible links between male behaviour and practice, and menâs mental health in a range of settings both within and outside medicine from the 1950s. I thus avoid the notion that there are a range of essential male traits that engender stoic, unemotional and independent behaviour, instead arguing that male customs were (and still are) often constrained by social structures and institutional gendered practices. As a historian, I would also contend that there are still advantages in employing the concept of hegemonic masculinity. The version of masculinity that was most âhonouredâ during the post-war period required the projection of strength and control â qualities that did not fit well with a notion of male nervous instability. As Mark Micale has shown in his work on male nervous illness in earlier times, these values were a hangover from the Victorian era when âthe spectrum of emotions deemed appropriate for adult men in Britain greatly diminishedâ â a point that will be developed more fully throughout this book. 92 This is of course not to say that all men âachievedâ or complied with this version of masculinity. Indeed, as the testimonies from clinicians in this book will illustrate, much of the male psychological and psychosomatic illness that presented in primary care could be correlated with unsuccessful attempts to live up to this ideal. Of recent years, historians have highlighted a tension that has developed between earlier social histories, which focused primarily upon experience and agency, and more recent cultural histories, which focus upon discourse and representation.93 As Michael Roper has rightly noted what is often missing from linguistic analyses is an adequate sense of the material: the practices of everyday life and the human experience of emotional relationships.94 Historians of masculinity have therefore suggested that future studies would benefit from a focus, not only on broad cultural codes, but also upon how men related to these codes.95 In the words of Roper and Tosh, new histories need to âexplore how cultural representations become part of subjective identityâ.96 This is a challenging task, for we cannot know with any real certainty the subjective processes that operate to mediate between individual men and cultural formations of masculinity. We can only ever hope to âcorrelateâ certain aspects of male behaviour with the set of cultural codes that predominate at any one time. Roper cautions that earlier social histories"

Stoic cosmopolitanism in its various guises was enormously persuasive throughout the Greco-Roman world. Although the term cosmopolitan (ÎºÎ¿ÏÎ¼Î¿ÏÎ¿Î»Î¯ÏÎ·Ï, literally, world-citizen), originated earlier than the Stoic philosophers, it was these philosophers who gave meaning to the term, even if that meaning is somewhat different from the way it is used now. As early as 340 BC Diogenes the Cynic (1925a) described himself as âa citizen of the worldâ (in Greek, kosmopolites), and Antiphon (1965), a little later, wrote that âby nature we are all constituted alike in all things, both barbarians and greeks. â¦ This can be seen by consideration of those things which are essential by nature to all men. In these things no barbarian is set apart from us, nor any Greek. For we all breathe into the air through mouth and nostrils â¦â. Zeno (1925b), in his Republic, was reported by Plutarch as saying: â(m)oreover, the much-admired Republic of Zeno, the founder of the Stoic sect, may be summed up in this one main principle: that all the inhabitants of this world of ours should not live differentiated by their respective rules of justice into separate cities and communities, but that we should consider all men to be of one community and one polity, and that we should have a common life and an order common to us all, even as a herd that feeds together and shares the pasturage of a common fieldâ. Stoic philosophers later offered a dual notion of citizenship, that of the local polis, city-state or nation complemented by that of the kosmos (universe or world). This is redolent of the modern notion of layered citizenship, embracing local and global elements, including a notion of Europeanism. This sense of common humanity, reflected in our ability to reason, was later seen as a principle of natural law, and the philosopher, John Locke (2007 [1689]), at a much later point in time, used it to develop a notion of a universal code of justice and an idea that human beings have inalienable rights regardless of what governments said and did. Stoic cosmopolitanism made many people more receptive to the cosmopolitan ideal and thus contributed greatly to its widespread influence. Cosmopolitanism slowly emerged as a key theme of the European Enlightenment, exemplified in the writings of the renowned international"
46,57,0.989,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"Finally, we will discuss a list that so far presents one of the best available approaches to childrenâs well-being from a capability perspective. Mario Biggeri and his colleagues (Biggeri 2003; Biggeri and Mehrotra 2011; Biggeri and Libanora 2011; Biggeri and Santi 2012) proposed a pragmatic and empirically informed approach to selecting functionings and capabilities for children that are important to their well-being and well-becoming. They worked with two types of procedures, which we explain in what follows. Biggeri and his colleagues took up Robeynâs suggestion and carried out a procedure to conceptualize a child-sensitive list of capabilities in the following way: In a first phase, a group of child experts (including UNICEF officers, psychologists, sociologists and NGO practitioners) selected, on the basis of their knowledge and experience, relevant capabilities for the evaluation of child well-being. Since the well-being of children is a concern for many stakeholders and different scientific disciplines, such an interdisciplinary and interprofessional approach seems to be required. There is a need to include theoretical and empirical as well as ethical reasoning to comprehensively grasp the different dimensions at stake, something that can be achieved only through a dialogue involving a broad range of experts. In the second phase, the reasons for the choices were explained and the inclusion of each capability was justified, relating them to other works on the capability approach, particularly those of Nussbaum and Robeyns, and to literature on childrenâs issues as published by the UN Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations (UN). Again, methodological concerns suggest this proceeding, taking into account the most important documents already developed in the field of the well-being of children, relating them conceptually to the capability approach and seeking valuable links and mutual improvements. In the third phase, an appropriate level of abstraction of the different items was chosen in order to make them generally applicable to children as a group while still including the uniqueness of each child. Finally, the list was rechecked both to include all relevant dimensions for analyzing the well-being of children and for nonreduction, meaning that none of the domains should be reducible to another. As a result, the following list emerged (Biggeri and Mehrotra 2011, 51):1 (1) Life and physical health: being able to be born, be physically healthy and enjoy a life of normal length"

When a person makes a decision as an individual, however, a heuristic approach is usually used due to humanâs limited cognitive ability. One often relies on simple, fast, and easy-to-access heuristics [7]. This situation also happens when a group makes a decision. Even though there are more resources to process information, group members still need to rely on heuristics such as other peopleâs opinion instead of information from actual sources. To illustrate the group decision making process and observe the social influence, input-process-output model is used. The model is explained in the following subsection."

Anne-Marie: They donât understand the meaning of the care, and furthermore the linguistic barrier means that already â well, when you see your GP, he has known you for a long time, he can take the time to chat with you (â¦) except that theyâre not going to get a GP, theyâre not going to get someone they know.

Persuasion is a type of communication that aims at influencing individualsâ behaviour (Rossi and Yudell 2012, p. 192). In the context of public health, persuasion has been defined as a âform of interpersonal influence, in which one person tries to change the attitudes or behaviour of another by means of argument, reasoning, or, in certain cases, structured listeningâ. (Warwick and Kelman 1973, quoted in Faden and Faden 1978, p. 183), or in which âa person comes to believe in something through the merit of reasons another person advancesâ (Beauchamp and Childress 2001, p. 94). Despite its being aimed at influencing individual behaviour, a distinguishing feature of persuasion so understood is the fact that it is both non-coercive and non-manipulative. By contrast, manipulation infringes, to a certain extent, upon individualsâ autonomy by bypassing their capacity for autonomous decisions (Rossi and Yudell 2012, pp. 193â194). For example, manipulation might use subliminal messages or enlist community opinion leaders as allies in pro-vaccination campaigns (Colgrove 2016, p. 1316) or, as we shall see in the next section, deploy some form of nudging. Mere persuasion, on the other hand, preserves individualsâ autonomy by relying merely on provision of factual information and of reasons for engaging in a certain behaviour. This means that individuals generally maintain the capacity to overcome the influence to which they are subjected.

387,9,0.989,CHAPTER 5 âRapt Up with Joyâ:,"Once illness struck, the preparation for death intensified considerably: the sick were entreated to perform various acts of piety, such as prayer, Bible-reading, and repentance.32 Through carrying out these devotions, the dying demonstrated their inward faith, which in turn was evidence of Godâs grace and salvation after death. Although the preparation was, in theory, the responsibility of the sick themselves, in the case of children, great dependence was placed upon relatives to initiate and guide this behaviour. They did this chiefly by asking their children if they thought they were dying or whether they were willing to die. In 1680, Lady Elizabeth Andrews from Buckinghamshire enquired of her thirteen-yearold daughter Margaret, âMy Dear, Are you so ill that you think you should die?â33 Three hours later the girl died. While it might seem cruel to question a child on such a foreboding subject, in the early modern period the practice was considered quite the opposite: ultimately, parents wished to help their children to reach a state of happiness about dying. By asking simple and direct questions about death, the child was given the opportunity to voice any anxieties and receive reassurance.34 The young would have been accustomed to this question-and-answer format, since catechism was the standard method of religious education in this period; this familiarity may have been comforting for children.35 It must be noted that in Calvinist theology, the idea that deathbed behaviour could influence the destiny of the soul was flawed: the doctrine of predestination taught that God had already decided who would be damned or saved, and nothing could be done to change His mind.36 However, in practice, families hoped that they held some sway over their salvation, perhaps considering that God had foreseen their godly conduct and built it into His plan.37 This was even the case for puritans, individuals traditionally regarded as the strictest proponents of predestination.38"

They also fit well with some of the findings from Chapter 2, where we analysed respondentsâ views about the value of the humanities, often as expressed in public and even defensive contexts. Here we have been looking at what researchers say about their fields from the inside, out of the public gaze, but their views seem to be in tune with the more rhetorical statements about the justification of the humanities. Prevalent themes within academia resonate strongly with what is going on outside it.

Therefore leave uptake was often combined with part-time work as a long-term solution for being involved fathersâa decision which however entailed non-negligible career consequences. Finally, the study uncovers implications of fathersâ leave uptake on the societal level. Fathers on leave alone can be viewed as agents of social change. On playgrounds and in supermarkets, they play a part in âundoing genderâ and transgressing gendered norms of parenthood (Deutsch 2007). Within companies, with their leave uptake and their part-time work, respondents make fatherhood more visible in organizational life and challenge the meaning of masculinity (Burnett et al. 2012; Hojgaard 1997). The leave experience can even take an activist dimension; with the aim to advance gender equality and the social recognition of fatherhood. This dimension is probably linked to the Swiss context, as men are currently not recognized as caregivers by the state. However, similar cases were found in Quebec, where menâs leave entitlements are more developed (Tremblay 2014). Altogether, fathersâ small-scale transgressive actions can be seen as challenging the institutional level of the gender structure, as conceptualized by Risman (1998, 2004, 2011). To conclude, this explorative qualitative study on men taking leave alone sheds light on the different types of leave situations that exist in the Swiss context. It shows that in the absence of statutory leave policies for fathers, leave uptake has a high price, which only few are willing and able to pay. The study gives insights in the leave experiences of these pioneer fathers, highlighting the positive experience it represents as well as its challenges. It also analyzes the implications of leave uptake for fatherhood and gender equality, revealing a mixed picture among respondents. While it is clear that leave uptake was not equally transformative for all interviewees, findings suggest it also has a societal impact. Men on leave alone in Switzerland can be viewed as agents of social change contributing to the redefinition of the cultural meaning of fatherhood.

What would future generations like us to do for them? We do not know, but we can guess. As uncertain as these guesses will be, we should take them into account as we act to satisfy our own immediate needs, demands, and desires. There may be trade-offs between what we wish to do for ourselves in our current generation versus what we think future generations might wish us to do for them. These trade-offs, if any, between what present and future generations would like should be considered. Once identiï¬ed, or at least estimated, just what decisions to make should be debated and decided in the political arena. There is no scientiï¬c theory to help us identify which trade-offs, if any, are optimal. The inclusion of sustainability criteria along with the more common economic, environmental, ecological, and social criteria used to evaluate alternative water resources development and management strategies may identify a need to change how we commonly develop and use our water resources. We need to consider the impacts of change itself. Change over time is certain; just what it will be is uncertain. These changes will impact the physical, biological, and social dimensions of water resource systems. An essential aspect in the planning, design and management of sustainable systems is the anticipation of change. This includes change due to geomorphologic processes, to aging of infrastructure, to shifts in demands or desires of a changing society, and even due to increased variability of water supplies, possibly because of a changing climate. Change is an essential feature of sustainable water resources development and management. Sustainable water resource systems are those designed and operated in ways that make them more adaptive, robust, and resilient to an uncertain and changing future. Sustainable water resource systems must be capable of effectively functioning under conditions of changing supplies, management objectives, and demands.

56,197,0.989,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"These three testimonies support the NELM assertion that an inter-generational transfer of responsibility in providing for the needs of the family occurs when the migrant breadwinner retires. Yet this transfer of responsibility does not necessarily lead to definitive return. In these three cases, the men have remained in France, but their non-return is not presented as an economic issue. Instead, it is justified on health grounds, as was elaborated in Chap. 4. For other respondents, however, the NELM logic becomes distorted and the assumption of transferring household responsibility to adult children is called into question. In these cases, the duty to provide for a significant number of dependents after retirement weighs heavily. Respondents often enumerated the many family members remaining in their financial charge past retirement. 70-year-old Issa (Tambacounda, Senegal) for example still has seven children living at home, some of whom are still at school. Hadyatou (DembancanÃ©, Senegal), although in his 70s, has several children still at school, some at primary level. Further financial difficulties arise when respondentsâ children start their own families, but without the income from regular employment to satisfy the new needs which result, due to the difficult job market for young adults in many parts of North and West Africa. As a consequence, new additions to the family were not always perceived as an unqualified source of joy for grandfathers in France. This was captured very well by Saleem (60, Tiznit, Morocco): 90% of us are trapped in this situation (â¦) So we â excuse my language â but we become slaves, of ourselves.

Itâs a specific policy of ours and itâs something that we have decided we want to do. And itâs also been influenced by the fact that these grants that Iâve been getting through the government system of these linkage grants, which are with industry partners, have proved to be so much more gettable and so much better value for money and so much more fluid in terms of open to open-minded research that we use that as a model in my particular institution as a desirable thing.

When Mrs. Elastic took 15 steps, how many would Dazz take? The numbers were chosen so that scalar reasoning was easily used; 12 is twice 6, and 15 is 12 plus half of 6. The children found the ratio diagram easy to use and were quick in applying it to other problems. A problem presented later on was: Paul replaced 5 energy saving bulbs in the bathroom and saved Â£20 that year. He then decided to replace all the bulbs in the kitchen as well. There are 8 bulbs in the kitchen. How much money will he save? This problem is not easily solved by doubling; it requires extending the scalar reasoning to the search for the unitary value. Figure 4b presents one studentâs solution. A major advantage of the ratio table was that students did learn to organize their thinking, separating out the numbers that referred to each of the quantities. Whereas at the start they might have carried out computations without thinking about the quantities that the numbers represented, by using the diagram this was not a problem later on. In two studies in which we used Streeflandâs ratio table, one in which the researchers taught small groups of children and another in which teachers used the program with their classes, we obtained positive results. Statistical analyses showed that the group that worked on quantitative reasoning made more progress in problem solving than the group that did not (Nunes et al. 2015a); however, this outcome cannot be attributed only to the use of the ratio table because the program involved other components. In a recent study, Nunes et al. (2016) demonstrated the impact of teaching quantitative reasoning on childrenâs mathematical achievement. In a large-scale randomized controlled trial, second graders who participated in a mathematical reasoning program that included no teaching of arithmetic performed signiï¬cantly better than the children in the control group, both in problem solving and arithmetic. As the children did not have any extra time on mathematics teaching during this period, it seems safe to conclude that the improvements were an outcome of the teaching of quantitative reasoning. Thus there is some evidence that children can beneï¬t from teaching that focuses on quantitative reasoning and uses representational tools that help them mathematize situations."
223,409,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Small Places, Big Issues Looking at the relationship between rationality and action in the domain of space, anthropologists first think of actions such as walking and the related decision to move or to stay. Walking may be considered the prototypical human action in a spatial setting. Correspondingly, the decision to move is the prototypical challenge to human practical reasoning in the context of moving through space. I wish to contribute to the topic of rationality and action by reviewing cases of human mobility and human orientation in space in some detail. This chapter is based on ethnographic work I have carried out with various groups of mobile hunters and gatherers over the years, particularly in southern Africa and Australia. Do these remote foragers have anything to offer to understanding decisions that matter most in the current world (regarding the current refugee and migration crisis, for instance)? I propose the following considerations with regard to this question. First, bringing in examples from far away is a key element in combating the common bias that âthere is no alternativeâ (see Widlok, 2009a). A case study exemplifying a very different mode of engaging rationality with action underlines that alternatives always exist and that it is worthwhile to spell them out clearly and develop them creatively. Second, the forager decision to move occupies the opposite end of the spectrum of human possibilities in that it focuses on rationality and action in a basic face-to-face setting without being confounded by effects of larger institutional frameworks. Third, the major global crises always come down to numerous smaller dilemmas and questions that social agents need to solve and that preoccupy them. For most agents the"

One such example is over-identifying with the âfair sexâ and its tendency to set high standards for oneself (Chatot 2014). This is the case when Mr F. talks about his decision to take sole responsibility for cleaning the kitchen. Far from seeing this as an unequal division of labour, he seems to have claimed his territory and does not wish to share it. This man has been affected by âirresistible household integrationâ (Kaufmann 1992), which usually leads women to raise their standards, more than men tend to, in order to reach the traditional ideal of the home: he has acquired a âfemaleâcompulsion. âWell in terms of the division of labourâ¦ I do the kitchen, the cleaning in general is 50/50, but I do all the kitchen cleaning.

247,31,0.989,Humanities World Report 2015,"Social value The social value of the humanities could be broken down into various kinds, perhaps the two most frequent being cohesion and decisionmaking. Social cohesion The humanities have been thought to promote social cohesion. One way is through undergraduate education, a point widely discussed in the commentary on US liberal arts, where the role of the humanities in enhancing our ability to communicate is central: by making people better able to articulate their viewpoints, they ease communication within society. Also, by equipping them to understand different viewpoints, they make citizens more tolerant of each other (a point that applies across national boundaries, of course, and so the humanities can be seen to be useful in an increasingly globalised world). The link between the humanities and social cohesion can be clearly made for specific disciplines.

More generally, this research was motivated by the desire to take a different perspective on the issue of âsuburban youthsâ and, in order to achieve this, to employ a methodology which would allow me, on the one hand, to cover the diversity of their life courses and, on the other, to understand socialization processes and their impact on the formation of these French North-African-origin youngstersâ trajectories. Constituting a cohort1 of French youngsters of North African background who shared the same environment at a given period in time seemed to be the most appropriate way of breaking with the presupposed relative homogeneity of this group of young people â it enabled me to consider as a whole all those young people who grew up in the same neighborhood.2 It was thus not a question of carrying out a survey amongst âneighborhood youthsâ who happened to be there, outside the blocks of flats, but to find all those youngsters who grew up in The word cohort is a demographic term defining those individuals who have experienced a similar event in the same time period; here, the âeventâ consists in their common upbringing in the same neighborhood, a process which they all shared.

Overall, this creates strong pressure on the Barnahus, forcing them to prioritise the child investigative interviews and reduce treatment as a consequence of limited resources. It may seem as if the Barnahus ends up in a âcrossfireâ of competing expectations. Since the Barnahus staff are employed by the police, they feel that the Barnahus has to serve the police in order to fulfil the demands of new time limits. On the other hand, the Barnahus are very conscious of the fact that treatment and support of the child and family are just as important. In an interview from 2016, a Barnahus employee describes the pressure of crossing expectations: â¦yes, we have been very accommodating [towards the police].

259,108,0.989,The Little Book of Semaphores,"In the previous section, we addressed what Iâll call categorical starvation, in which one category of threads (readers) allows another category (writers) to starve. At a more basic level, we have to address the issue of thread starvation, which is the possibility that one thread might wait indefinitely while others proceed. For most concurrent applications, starvation is unacceptable, so we enforce the requirement of bounded waiting, which means that the time a thread waits on a semaphore (or anywhere else, for that matter) has to be provably finite. In part, starvation is the responsibility of the scheduler. Whenever multiple threads are ready to run, the scheduler decides which one or, on a parallel processor, which set of threads gets to run. If a thread is never scheduled, then it will starve, no matter what we do with semaphores. So in order to say anything about starvation, we have to start with some assumptions about the scheduler. If we are willing to make a strong assumption, we can assume that the scheduler uses one of the many algorithms that can be proven to enforce bounded waiting. If we donât know what algorithm the scheduler uses, then we can get by with a weaker assumption: Property 1: if there is only one thread that is ready to run, the scheduler has to let it run. If we can assume Property 1, then we can build a system that is provably free of starvation. For example, if there are a finite number of threads, then any program that contains a barrier cannot starve, since eventually all threads but one will be waiting at the barrier, at which point the last thread has to run. In general, though, it is non-trivial to write programs that are free from starvation unless we make the stronger assumption: Property 2: if a thread is ready to run, then the time it waits until it runs is bounded. In our discussion so far, we have been assuming Property 2 implicitly, and we will continue to. On the other hand, you should know that many existing systems use schedulers that do not guarantee this property strictly. Even with Property 2, starvation rears its ugly head again when we introduce semaphores. In the definition of a semaphore, we said that when one thread executes signal, one of the waiting threads gets woken up. But we never said which one. In order to say anything about starvation, we have to make assumptions about the behavior of semaphores. The weakest assumption that makes it possible to avoid starvation is: Property 3: if there are threads waiting on a semaphore when a thread executes signal, then one of the waiting threads has to be woken."

When we see our respondents in pain or afraid, especially when we come upon hard stories unexpectedly, the impact on us is much greater. This was the experience, for instance, of our Morocco researcher, who spent an afternoon meeting the members of an association for the rights of Salafist prisoners. She sat in a room full of women, the daughters, wives, and mothers of these prisoners. Each woman in turn told her story, and it was just one atrocity after the other. One ended her story about her son with âand they condemned him to the death penaltyâ. Another appeared to have become mentally deranged as the result of the killing of her younger child and husband, and possible psychological torture. Had she been working for an organization like Amnesty International, our researcher might have been prepared to hear these stories, and would have known what to do with them: write a report. But she was unprepared, and felt alone against the ugliest part of humankind. During the meeting, our researcher remained clinical, asking questions, taking notes. She could not open the door to empathy because it would have overwhelmed her. The traumatic impact of these stories was compounded by the intrusive surveillance, described above, that followed immediately afterward, and by the pressure to get results, which we discuss further on in this chapter. For a time, she could not stop thinking about the stories, the derangement of one woman, the lifeless voice of another. Hiking, eating well, and spending time on her own eventually helped her recover. Stories that unsettle us do not always come from those directly affected by them. Our Mexico researcher was shaken by the account of a forensic journalist who investigates crime scenes, including political murders. She told a story of careful planning and tremendous professionalism in the implementation of deliberately gruesome murders, intended to send a message to others. He was told similar stories by other respondents as well. Just like our Morocco researcher, his initial response was to get on with his work, ask more questions, analyze the situation, without considering the horror of what he had been told, and how it affected him personally. In fact, it is difficult to start processing the mental impact while in the field, when there are too many other things going on. We oftentimes need the safety of home, and the distance in time and space, to evaluate and deal with the impact the field has on us. If coping in the field becomes too hard, then going home early should be the obvious solution. However,"

However, if we look at data from 2015, we now see that there is practically no difference when it comes to standard gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles. Uchiyamada I talked about it earlier, but one of the biggest drivers for hybrid vehicles was that the worldâs manufacturers got wrapped up in a competition over fuel economy. Due to this, governments also decided there were still more regulations they could set and those regulations got tighter. Itâs tough for us, too, but given that these regulations apply to all manufacturers your only choice is to do what you can to come out on top under those conditions. Komiyama Right. If everyone really joins in, and in particular if China and the United States join in, then the tighter the regulations the more Japan has an edge. Uchiyamada There certainly are some who say itâs better to make them as strict as possible, but when you do so the burdens on the customer rise dramatically. You need time in order to not push the cost up. The best time for developing and introducing the new engines and platforms that make the biggest improvements to fuel economy is when you do a model change. Accordingly, even people say letâs improve it by 20% starting next year you canât do it out of the blue. Mid-to-long-term targets like those of the Paris Agreement talked about at COP 21 are important. Komiyama Are various efforts already underway with 2050 in mind? Uchiyamada Things have already started. I canât offer you any specifics as of yet, but letâs take furnaces as an example. Currently, we fuel them with natural gas, but weâre wondering about whether or not we can use hydrogen, which doesnât produce CO2 when burned. Nobody thought about this at Toyota before we came up with the challenges. Itâs that sort of a new idea. We havenât built a plant in the past 3 years, but in the future, we will begin construction for the next stage of development. Because we must test technologies that have possibilities, we are studying a variety of things like whether it will now be possible to try taking those ideas on board. The hurdles we have to traverse are high when it comes to something like making a zero CO2 car by 2050 since that will be done not just at one plant but at plants around the world."

These are behavioural complexity, symbolic complexity, affective complexity and perceptual complexity. There is also a type of progression, abstracting, which involves moving from a concrete understanding of a concept to a more abstract one. A further type of progression is an increased capacity to articulate, explain or amplify an idea or construct, i.e. the learner retains the ability to deploy the skill, and in addition, they can now articulate, explain or amplify what they are able to do and what they have done. And finally progression can be understood as part of a process, and this refers to the way that the learner interacts with the learning object. An example could be moving from an assisted performance to an independent one. This suggests that curricula as they are presently conceived round the world are deficient if they employ extensional forms of progression exclusively at the expense of a range of other types. These forms of progression are not of the same order; however, they refer to different aspects of the process of learning. There is no category error here. They are linked by their capacity to affect different parts of the learning process, and in particular, where an individual moves from one state of being to another. For example, extensional forms of progression focus on the objects of learning, whereas process forms of progression focus on the learner and the way they can and do respond to these objects. Over the last fifty years, there has been a move away from traditional/ fragmented approaches towards networked approaches in some school curricula. There are implications of adopting either fragmented or networked approaches or taking up positions in between. A fragmented or traditional approach fits better with how universities, teachers, parents and students understand curricular divisions at school level; allows choice between subject options whilst retaining core subjects; better reflects current arrangements; and can be better accommodated within traditional pedagogic structures. A networked approach reduces choice because it implies that all aspects of the curriculum have to be covered in the teaching and learning arrangements that are put in place; and may better reflect the nature of subject knowledge. The key question is how to balance these imperatives when undertaking a reform of secondary education in a system such as the one we are focusing on in this book. Thus,"
379,372,0.989,"Tobacco Control Policy in The Netherlands : Between Economy, Public Health, and Ideology","Tobacco is a highly contested topic. Lobbyists present their policy solutions to politicians and government officials who weigh the evidence against what they believe is feasible or desirable, much like solving a complex puzzle (Kingdon, 2003). Such puzzles take considerable time. In the meantime, the many other concerns that a government is confronted with compete with tobacco control for a place on the policy agenda. The public policy literature distinguishes different stages of agenda setting: issues move from the public agenda to the political agenda, move again to the formal (sometimes called institutional or governmental) agenda, and finally reach the decision agenda. The public agenda consists of issues that have achieved a high level of public interest and visibility, while the formal agenda lists the topics that decision makers are actually working on (Cobb, Ross, & Ross, 1976). For an issue to reach the formal agenda, decision makers must be aware of the underlying problem, and consensus must be reached that acting upon the problem is possible and necessary and that the solution falls within the governmentâs responsibility. This chapter starts with an examination of the process of problem identification, which is the first step in agenda setting. Problem definition is central to understanding agenda setting, and refers to what Rochefort and Cobb (cited in Cairney (2012)) describe as âwhat we choose to identify as public issues and how we think and talk about these concerns.â Attention from the government is often drawn to an issue when new statistics surface"
253,1115,0.989,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Furthermore, the context of acceptance and autonomous driving described above is of central signiï¬cance for future studies. This conclusion can also be taken from the results, among others, of US comments, with their marked socio-politically connoted statements. These show that, to the commenters, autonomous driving looks like it may collide with the prevailing system of norms and values of car usage. Future studies should therefore investigate the individual and societal signiï¬cance of how cars are used today, and then enquire precisely into how this is embedded in the context of daily praxis and cultural- and milieu-speciï¬c frameworks (on this, see also Chap. 31). This will help to deï¬ne which speciï¬c issues can be expected to have an effect on the acceptance of autonomous driving. In terms of deï¬ning uses and assigning values more precisely, in future it will also be a question of allowing potential users and other persons affected to experience the technology. This will give them an idea about what to expect from it, but also let them know what it cannot do. To this effect, policy and public bodies especially could help in promoting acceptance, or at least access ([4]: 3), by shaping public debate more vigorously or initiating speciï¬c autonomous driving test and pilot projects: For the current efforts and endeavours being made on the policy side, see Chap. 8. In other areas of the project, it is already clear that speciï¬c use cases, as outlined in Chap. 2, each bring with them speciï¬c judgments, expectations, and assessments (see Chap. 31 on car usage and ownership in the context of autonomous driving and Chapters by 6, 12 and 32).

If you look at funding profiles of humanities scholars as opposed to social sciences scholars, thereâs just much less out there. And if you compare it to the natural sciences, itâs even more dramatic. Often the library is identified as the core support structure: (E14) In the humanities, the highest cost comes from subscriptions to magazines, journals and reviews (online or not), which tend to be really expensive because of some editorsâ monopoly. Some disciplines also require special materials, e.g. linguistics, but generally speaking infrastructure costs in the humanities are low, for we do not need laboratories, machines and so on, like in the sciences. We do not have enough rooms for offices because places were built and attributed according to the approximate number of intern ordinary professors (and collaborators); this did not include visiting professors or research fellows, PhD students, etc. It is difficult to deal with this issue and find sustainable solutions. Besides, funds allocated to indirect expenses for infrastructure, maintenance and administration of research projects, which are called overheads, cannot help us to solve this problem. It is clear, however, that support needs are developing: (NA7) I needed research assistants to gather data, I needed statisticians, so then you need a team. Thatâs why my RO1 needed $2 million over five years. I would need equipment and I would need to rent space. And thatâs typical for scientific research and why it needs so much funding.

However important this approach is, it also has a tendency to conceptualise the dominant norm as monolithic and undynamic (McNay 2004; StormhÃ¸j 2013). The dominant norm emerges as a static background to non-normative gender performances and the question of what motivates some people to adhere to this norm moves out of focus (Hollway 1984; Layton 1998). But gender norms are neither deterministic nor monolithic or static. They vary between men and women and between classes and generations, and this creates internal incoherencies and contradictions within prevailing gender norms. The norms also change historically, and often also within the life course of individual people, without necessarily being dependent on destabilising discursive interventions from non-normative groups. Thus, the âdominant normâ is a moving target, and some of the movement may be explored by looking into the feelings of gender in those groups that adhere to these norms or through their behaviour modify them or create new ones. Feminist approaches departing from Bourdieuâs practice theory have a structurally and historically based understanding of change, combined with an emphasis on the ways in which such change also takes place as âlived relationsâ. Practice is motivated by peopleâs perceptions, feelings and representations, not just abstract social structures and economic forces (McNay 2004: 184). It is necessary to enter the âphenomenology of social spaceâ, a space that is relational in its structure and tied to experience in specific contexts, in order to understand how reflexivity and agency work as elements in both societal reproduction and change. Such reflexivity could be understood as an ongoing transformative practice âsimultaneous with the normal course of daily life, but also constitutive of how life is lived in history, across generations and in personal interactionsâ (Silva 2005: 96). By producing gender in ever-new ways, new ânormalitiesâ also come into being. Thus, change does not necessarily imply normative constraints, individual resistance or collective mobilisation, but can be located âin regard to a shift in the conditions of social reproduction itself â (Adkins 2004a: 9). Gender does not dissolve through this reflexivity, but is constantly in a process of reconfiguration. It is reflexivity itself that becomes âa habit of gender in late modernityâ (Adkins 2004b:"

These two illness categories perform a negotiation between psychic and somatic medicine that is very different to attempted suicide, thereby showing that there is nothing fixed or inevitable about such crossover. As noted, the rise of treatment in observation wards heralds a more intense type of psychological scrutiny. However, the treatment role is highly ambiguous at Smithdown Road: âIn hospital, under conditions sheltered from ordinary life, they [patients] can take a more objective view. They are enabled to discuss and disentangle their mental complexities, and there is an opportunity for readjustment with relatives and associatesâ.67 Hopkins is open about the therapeutic effects that occur in observation wards â social adjustment with friends and family â without actively carrying out treatment. Similarly, the intensity of the scrutiny Hopkins brings to bear on the attempted suicide patients is unclear. His study is undertaken to find out which factors are most important in provoking an attempted suicide. He initially states that â[t]he material and social conditions are known or easily investigated, and relatives, friends, relieving officers, police and probation officers are usually available to provide informationâ. However, he then changes tack, conceding that â[s]uch an enquiry obviously entails a great deal of work in the detailed investigation of each patient, the interviewing of relatives, friends and other informantsâ. He reveals that in a 1930s observation ward, with limited opportunities for psychiatric scrutiny, it âwas decided to limit the number to 100 cases, taking 50 consecutive admissions of each sexâ and that â[n]o effort is made to consider ... its psychological mechanismsâ. For Hopkins, âa real and complete understanding of the causes for such action would necessitate so prolonged and detailed a study of the individual as is impossible in practiceâ. In remarkably explicit terms, Hopkins argues that a study of the âpsychological mechanismsâ behind attempted suicide requires âa great deal of workâ and âdetailed investigationâ â something that is just not possible in these wards at the time.68 This does not stop Hopkins from speculating about these psychological mechanisms and their significance, speculation that yields something rather similar to communicative self-harm in these observation wards. However, it is notable how cautious he is when describing it: It might be contended, and with reason, that in investigating a consecutive series of cases admitted to hospital on account of attempted suicide, one may be dealing not solely with cases who"
211,71,0.989,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"entrepreneurial passion Researchers established long ago that passion is a strong motivator of action (see David Hume 1711â1778; Jean Jacques Rosseau 1712â1778) as well as of entrepreneurial decisions (Smilor 1997). We turn to selfdetermination theory (Deci and Ryan 2001; Gagne and Deci 2005; Ryan and Deci 2000) and its extension to passion (Vallerand et al. 2003) to gain a deeper understanding of entrepreneurial motivation. Self-determination theory proposes that individuals attempt to satisfy three basic psychological needsâneed for competence, need for relatedness, and need for autonomyâand thus carefully bear these needs in mind when making decisions. When individuals are put in a decision-making situation, the intentionality of their efforts to meet these needs is either controlled or autonomous (Gagne and Deci 2005). Controlled motivation concerns a pressure to act, whereas autonomous motivation refers to individualsâ voluntary participation in an activity because they find it enjoyable and interesting. This difference between autonomous and controlled intentionality is reflected in the different types of passion. As a whole, passion is a âstrong inclination toward an activity that one loves and finds important, that is, self-defining and in which significant time and energy are investedâ (Houlfort et al. 2015: 85). Then, depending on whether passion stems from a controlled or autonomous source, it is labeled as obsessive passion or harmonious passion (Vallerand and Houlfort 2003; Vallerand et al. 2003), respectively."
186,208,0.989,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"The two main philosophical streams of Western dignity are dignity as virtue and dignity realised through the formula of humanity. We have extracted from them a common core, namely a sense of self-worth. Could this extension be applied to the Middle Eastern concept? Yes. Dignity as respect for and the protection of the self-worth of human beings is the core that could harmonise the main Western approaches to dignity with the Koranic interpretation. The Koran, as interpreted in this book, encourages its readers to replace humiliation with dignity, leading to a deviolentisation of life. Dignity leads to peace, according to the Koran. In humiliating others, the Koran argues, one loses oneâs own dignity. It also asks followers to develop their own dignity ï¬rst, as a basis for recognising the dignity of others and acting upon this recognition. No one can revoke oneâs own dignity, the Koran argues, but oneself. Recognising and developing oneâs abilities, talents and senses belongs to the search for dignity. At the same time, one can help others develop and assist in their self-improvement and quest for dignity. Finally, striving towards dignity, according to the Koran, means that people need to be aware of their spiritual dimension and develop their related abilities in a constant effort to improve themselves. For instance, the inferiority of the social standing of women is an indication of social decadence and a sign that menâs dignity is not developed. From the above, one can see a strong similarity between dignity in the Koran and dignity as virtue, and in particular a strong emphasis on developing self-worth and assisting others in doing so. Human dignity is contingent upon the recognition of oneâs own nobility (self-worth) and othersâ nobility. Neglect of other peopleâs dignity is a result of the neglect of oneâs own, according to the Koran. For instance, corruption is an example of neglect for oneâs own dignity. At the outset of the book we quoted Fukuyamaâs (2012) editorial commenting on the Arab Spring. He wrote: âThe basic issue was one of dignity, or the lack thereof, the feeling of worth or self-esteem that all of us seek.â It thus seems that one can ï¬nd an inner kernel in dignity discussions that unites major Western and Middle Eastern streams: dignity as a sense of self-worth, which we have a duty to develop and respect in ourselves and a duty to protect in others. At the same time, this book identiï¬ed a range of diverse interpretations of dignity. For meaningful dialogue on the subject, it is therefore necessary to listen carefully and ascertain whether conversation partners are using the same or at least a similar concept of dignity. If not, fundamental disagreements can remain hidden to the detriment of constructive consensus. We would like to end with a ï¬ctional dialogue."

However, it was generally accepted that GPsâ training did not equip them with the ability to measure an employeeâs capacity for work.87 As this chapter and the oral history testimonies throughout this book suggest, âdiagnoses suggestive of neurosis [were] often vague, and because in the eyes of some physicians and patients, a stigma attaches to mental disorder a more acceptable symptomatic diagnosis may be given on the certificateâ.88 One GP interviewed as part of this research recalled that it âwas a real . . . real problem, having a psychiatric illness on your note. So . . . we would call a psychiatric illness a physical one, because that was acceptable, and it was acceptable to their friends and their boss and everything elseâ.89 Likewise, a senior professor of general practice concurred: âBecause the man didnât want to be labelled as psychological, the doctor would go along with it.â90 The same GP remembered that one of his patients, a senior executive, drove over thirty miles outside the local vicinity to collect his prescription, for fear that someone might discover he was being prescribed psychotropic drugs.91 The situation not only caused problems for patients, but also for GPs who were often placed in a difficult situation when deciding whether or not to issue a sickness certificate. One GP, contributing to a symposium on absence from work in 1969, noted that âworkmen do not usually want to bother a doctorâ and that it was ânot part of the general practitionerâs function to maintain industrial discipline or moraleâ. Indicating how unsatisfactory the whole process appeared to be, he added: âThere was a time in my career when I occasionally tried to refuse people certificates â but in the interest of my coronary arteries, I have given up arguing.â92 Certainly, evidence suggests that workers were often reluctant to discuss the causes of short-term absence with their employers and that some men refused to take part in workplace health investigations.93 Those who did give consent to participate were often impervious to advice about health. An investigation during the 1960s, which explored the attitudes of senior staff in industry towards health investigations, noted that advice on smoking, drinking and eating habits was seldom received positively, possibly due to the employeeâs âreluctance to remember advice which he found unpalatableâ.94 Moreover, studies that featured groups of men who, in statistical terms, appeared to be rarely ill often exposed interesting ambiguities.

299,484,0.989,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Communitarianism is often viewed as the polar opposite of liberalism, as seeking to preempt individual choices by relying on communal normative criteria and authorities. Common good considerations are said to replace respect for autonomy. Accordingly, for example, people with infectious diseases are to be incarcerated, the way Cuba deals with those who contract HIV (Hansen and Groce 2003, p. 2875). Indeed, such authoritarian communitarianism has been championed by the leaders and some public intellectuals of East Asian nations, especially Singapore and Malaysia (Jiang 1998; Bell 1995). One major reason many, especially in the West, reject this kind of communitarianism is that they hold autonomy in high regard. The same challenge does not apply to responsive (or liberal) communitarianism.1 This communitarianism seeks to balance autonomy with concern for the common good, without a priori privileging either of these two core values. And it seeks to rely on society (informal social controls, persuasion, and education) to the greatest extent possible and to minimize the role of the state (law enforcement) in promoting compliance with the norms that flow from these values. Responsive communitarianism is often confused with, or treated as part and parcel of, authoritarian communitarianism, though the two differ as much as social democratic socialism differs from Soviet socialism. Although responsive communitarianismâs starting point is the recognition that the tense relationship between autonomy and the common good must be worked out rather than starting with the assumption that one of these core values trumps the other, it expects treatment to differ from one society to another and among different"
48,86,0.989,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"trained for such work. How do we train people in time prediction and how effective is the time prediction training? Training in the sense of learning about biases and the use of proper judgement and decision methods seems to haveâbut beware of the limited evidenceâa positive effect on judgement and decision quality [57]. However, the standard training method of learning through feedback and reflection does not seem to work well for time prediction. As an illustration, a learning process called the Personal Software Process [58] includes a time prediction training program with feedback of actual time usage and analysis of reasons for deviation between predicted and actual time usage. Independent empirical studies analysing this training found no improvement in time prediction accuracy from following this program [59, 60]. Similar results were found in another study on the effect of a feedback and lessons learned training program.6 Those who followed this training program were instructed to spend time reflecting on what went wrong, what went well, and what could be learned from previous accurate or inaccurate time predictions. The training program did not lead to improvements in time prediction accuracy compared to individuals who underwent no such training program. Amount of task experience: Generally, more experience in completing a task tends to lead to more accurate time predictions. Research participants without experience in completing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle [62] had, for example, more overoptimistic time predictions than those with some experience [63]. It is, however, not always the case that more experience in completing tasks leads to higher time prediction accuracy. Experience may change the way people think about a task. As people gain experience, their mental representation of the task tends to become more abstract, with information stored in a few larger chunks rather than as many smaller entities that represent details of the task. This has the paradoxical effect that more experience can lead to more overoptimistic time predictions. In a study on predictions of the duration of piano tunes, participants brought their own sheet music and were asked to predict the time it would take to play tunes that were recently learned, well learned, and extremely well learned [64]. The piano players gave 48% too high time predictions for recently learned pieces, 11% too high time predictions for well-learned pieces, and 19% too low time predictions for extremely well learned pieces. This pattern was apparent for both novices with an average of six months of experience and advanced players with an average of 11 years of experience. The results suggest that the piano players âchunkedâ together larger parts of the welllearned pieces, whereas they were more conscious about the different parts of the more recently learned tunes. More overoptimistic time predictions among those with more experience were also found in a study where participants were instructed to fold a paper rabbit (an origami task) [65]. The participants were first asked to produce one (low-experience group), three (medium-experience group), or nine (high-experience group) rabbits. 6 See [61]. Note that the time predictions were found to be more accurate due to increasingly greater knowledge about the tasks to be completed, but this improvement was at the same level as for those not following the time prediction training program."

Blerimâs case was compared to other cases with a similar biographical structure to further investigate the corresponding biographical constellations (orientation pattern, family and peer situation) in which such a crisis develops. Furthermore, we compared cases where the crisis could be âreversed,â as with Blerim, and cases where this was no longer possible. In so doing, we identified the specific personal strategies and resources that could be used to achieve the turnaround or which were unavailable. On this basis it was also possible to carry out topic-focused case comparisons. For example, we used the specific role of the community as the point of departure for Blerim. In comparing his with other cases, it was possible to investigate whetherâ and in which constellationsâ the community plays a supplementary role with regard to the occupational sphere (opportunities to experience self-efficacy and recognition in the occupational sphere as well as in the community), or a compensatory role (community as the only space to find at least some resources and opportunities to develop and realize own ideas and projects). The case comparisons also allowed identifying gender-specific features. For example, in contrast to Blerim, the search for recognition and self-efficacy within the community for a young woman of Kosovar background did not lead to commitment to and success as a musician but rather to plans for starting her own family at an early age. This approach was supported by the fact that our study sample was comparatively large for a biographical (reconstructive) research project and it included variation along important dimensions, such as gender, level of education, and patterns of social relationships. This enabled us to develop systematic and fruitful case comparisons in order to answer the research questions that cropped up repeatedly (e.g., the role of the community)."
299,137,0.989,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Since the advent of modern media, especially following the rise of social media, moral dialogues occur even on a transnational level. The suggestion that the âpeople of the worldâ can have moral dialogues may seem at first like one of those dewyeyed notions held by naive idealists. Indeed, even in national dialogues, not all citizens participate, and the resulting understandings are not shared by everyone. Millions are preoccupied with basic needs, set back by a lack of education, or under the influence of mind-numbing substances, and in parts of the world run by authoritarian regimes. However, the attentive public (Miller 2010), deemed as those who are publicly aware and engaged, is growing, as education and access to the media are spreading through many parts of the world. Thus, the citizens of countries as different as Russia, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia have more access to transnational communications than they had in 1980. Hence, the reach of transnational moral dialogues is rising. The effect of transnational moral dialogues is reflected in new shared understandings regarding land mines, trading in ivory and antiques, whale hunting, norms against proliferation of nuclear weapons, armed intervention in the internal affairs of other nations, the responsibility to protect (against genocides), human trafficking, andâto a lesser extentâin support of human rights and climate protection. Before I can proceed, I must note a meta point that underlies much of the following: escaping the curse of dichotomies. A good part of public discourse and quite a few philosophical and social science deliberations draw on dichotomies. For instance, for the last two centuries the people of many nations have been engaged in debates between those who champion the private sector and those who champion the public sector; between the merits of the market compared to those of the government; between liberals and conservatives. These debates typically ignore a very large amount of social âbusinessâ conducted in the third sector, that of communities, voluntary associations, ethnic and religious groups, hundreds of thousands of not-forprofit corporations, and millions of families. This observation is particularly relevant for much that follows because moral dialogues occur largely in the third sector. The curse of dichotomies is equally evident in the analysis of behavior as either rational or irrational, and of dialogues as either evidence-based, drawing on facts and logic (âcoldâ), or as passionate (âhotâ), and hence irrational. Such dichotomies are particularly seductive because they do not tax the memory, are strongly favored by the mass media (which only rarely give voices to third positions), and allow one to split ambiguities and project positive traits and attributes on one element of the dichotomy and negative ones on the other. Last but not least, dichotomies greatly simplify analysis. This is the case because if one shows that one option of the only two which dichotomy-based analysis recognizes is valid or good, then there is no need to study the other. Its evaluation logically follows. Thus, if one sees time as divided only into days and nights, if something did not occur during the day, then one need not study anything to determine that it occurred at night. It logically follows. Thus, once critics of the rational model, homo economicus, showed that people do not command the intellectual qualities the model presumesâspecifically that people cannot process information the way the model requiresâit followed logically that people are irrational, poor"

Not all of the academic bookâs future users will be human. As machinereading, text-mining, online âsocial annotationâ and related approaches come of age, the academic book will need to be optimised for new reading techniques. This creates particular challenges where the book includes non-textual content. As humanities researchers increasingly want to zoom in and out between âdistantâ and âcloseâ reading protocols, the academic book will need to facilitate scaleable reading.7 We must ensure that academic books are designed today in such a way that they will be findable, citeable and readable in the long term, using as yet undeveloped tools. Scholars in the future will want not only to write different kinds of books, but also to discover, study and interrogate books in new ways. The academic book of the future will need to be future-proof. We can read printed books that are 600 years old. The academic book of the future may not remain useable for so long. The printed codex marries hardware (the paper and ink) and software (the words and ideas). This makes it one of the most durable data-storage technologies ever devised. This is not the case for electronic formats, where the âcontentâ needs to be readable on new devices powered by upgraded software. Most printed books exist relatively well in regimes of benign neglect. With reasonably constant temperature and humidity levels, and without overexposure to light or moisture, they remain readable for centuries.8 The same is not true of electronic formats, which often become irrecoverable after only a few years due to obsolescent hardware and software. We therefore need to consider who will bear the ongoing responsibility and cost of maintaining long-term access and usability of academic books created in digital formats, and the datasets associated with them. This means remixing the division of labour that currently exists among faculty, publishers, and librarians. As the academic book of the future takes shape, we will also need to engage seriously with the concerns raised in many quarters that digital media make sustained intellectual work more difficult, even while they facilitate research in some respects.

245,784,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"To really achieve a successful implementation of the social dimension and generate equality as an outcome, monitoring, advising and peer learning among member states should be improved. So far the actual monitoring is primarily done by the member countries of the EHEA itself on themselves. Of course publications like Eurostudent and Eurydice reports play a useful role in summarising data; however these reports do not have the task of political monitoring, and it would not be suitable for them to acquire such a responsibility. Before the PL4SD initiative was ï¬nally agreed by the ministers in 2012, the idea of a European Observatory for the Social Dimension was discussed. This ideaâto have a centralised organ, which collects and interprets data on the development of the social dimension, while at the same time providing countries with recommendations on what and how to improve, should not be left buried without consideration. The beneï¬t of such a European organâwhatsoever its formâwould be that the responsibility for data collection, recommendations and promotion of actions would no longer depend on the subjective interest of the EHEA members. This could signiï¬cantly improve the objectivity and transparency of the social dimension within the EHEA. Such a coordinated tracking of the development of the social dimension might stimulate member countries to become more pro-active and to consider their current approaches. It also has the potential to simplify the work of improving the social dimension, as member states could be pointed to success stories of peers. Beyond the shared targets and aspirations, the EHEA is also facing shared challenges, so to have a more structured and uniï¬ed approach might be a sensible way to go forward. Of course, external monitoring might face a certain resistance of states, but the opportunity to use the externally gathered information might be used to create EU funding and support lines and this might balance the resistance to a certain degree. However, the monitoring ideas show also that the EHEA is not independent from the general ideas how the EU and its associates will develop in the future. The"

However, the wrong answers to the questions concerning the history of Polish Jews did not stand out from the answers assessing the level of general historical knowledge, as 31% of the participants gave wrong answers to other questions about historical facts unrelated to the history of the Holocaust. when asked about the amount of Polish help offered to Jews, participants most often chose the answer âsufficientâ (39%), whereas 22% considered the amount of Polish help as âslightly too extensiveâ or âdefinitely too extensive.â within the section measuring attitudes, the students demonstrated considerable prejudice towards Jewsâmore than half of the participants (54%) declared cold, negative feelings. A similar pattern was obtained for the measure of contact willingnessâthe majority of the young Poles indicated that they would prefer not to have contact with people of Jewish origin. Almost half of the students said that they would react negatively to Jewish classmates (40%) or to Jewish neighbours (44%). In order to determine how school education is related to knowledge and attitudes of students, we conducted a series of correlation analyses (see Table 1).

137,267,0.989,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Significant differences were found between the ex-ante reasons for taking leave and the advantages reported by fathers after the fact. The justification for taking a leave, essentially based on an economic rationale, contrasted with the advantages fathers expressed a posteriori in terms of bonding with their children and becoming âsocialisedâ into caregiving. Consequently, while Beckerâs (1991) economic rationality would support menâs rationale for applying for leave, the theory would not suffice to explain the results. While several fathers failed to mention bonding with their children as one of the reasons for leave-taking, they all found that it was one of the advantages of having done so. âSocialisationâ into caregiving and the associated extension of equality in the distribution of these activities proved to be effective. The socialising effect was, then, observed to be more effective among fathers who used the leave for instrumental than among those who did so for affective reasons."
321,32,0.989,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"But many Japanese believe that foreign feelings toward Japan are poor. This is because anti-Japanese sentiments of Korea and China are exaggerated and widely reported. And indeed, anti-Japanese sentiment in general in both Korea and China cannot be denied. However, even in the case of Korea, since around the time of the joint sponsorship of the soccer World Cup in 2002, the situation has been considerably changing. I think that going forward this will largely change in China too. From manga and anime to video games and the novels of Haruki Murakami, and even to safe and delicious food, longings for Japanese culture in a broad sense are growing stronger among the Chinese people. In a 2010 survey conducted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on which countries have a beneficial effect on the world, Germany came out on top, followed by the European Union and Japan in second place, and Canada in third. As far as which countries were disliked, Japan did rank higher than Germany, the European Union, and Canada, but this is because many Chinese and Korean name Japan as a country they do not like. All the same, generally speaking the world estimates highly Japanâs having accomplished its modernization after the Meiji Restoration and leaping even into the global top class as a non-Western nation. The Japanese need to recognize this fact.

This broad representation of key actors gave legitimacy to the portal at an early stage: âThe purpose was to establish a common public healthcare portal [â¦] that vision was crucial, and then of course it was important that they managed to engage the most influential partners, such as Danish Regions, that primarily runs sundhed.dk, together with the municipalities and the Ministry of Health as partnersâ (representative, The Ministry of Health). In addition, informants describe it as a clear advantage that the organization of the governing bodies resembles the way in which the remaining healthcare system is organized. For example, the relationship between the regions, the government, and GPs has been maintained through general agreements: âThe collaboration model we find in the Danish healthcare system is reflected in the organization of sundhed.dk. I believe that if we wouldnât have had this organization in place, it would have been very difficult to establish sundhed.dkâ (representative, the regions). The initial phase of sundhed.dk can be characterized as a political showcase for regional collaboration with solid political unity and common ambition. The involved parties have largely gathered around the common ambition of having one access point to the healthcare services: âAt the outset, there was a clear vision, which was politically anchored in the Association of County Councils â one entrance point to healthcare services and cross-sectorial collaboration â it was a vision we all could agree uponâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). In addition: âWe were told that if we could find a project that could strategically mark the 14 counties across, and not as silos, we would receive fundingâ (representative, the regions). In the initial phase, there was little disagreement concerning what should be offered to citizens and healthcare providers. The political unity and broad collaboration of stakeholders was described as key reasons for the success of the portal. While there was a clear political mandate and a broadly agreed-upon vision, the partners had different starting points in terms of already existing digital services. One of the initial challenges was to get everyone at the same level: âIt was a great opportunity to establish cross-sectorial collaboration, but this was also one of the biggest challenges [â¦] For example, not all regions had very advanced webpagesâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). In addition, it was a challenge to get everyone onboard: âIn the beginning, a lot of partners were happy about sundhed.dk and many believed in the overall vision. But if a region was working on a local project, it was difficult to get its buy-in. We spent much time in the beginning to go out locally and defend our existence. There was no choice for opting out. We basically told them that they themselves had decided that we should existâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). The engagement of multiple stakeholders did not come automatically but had to be enabled actively by the staff at sundhed.dk. It was important to engage actors, since sundhed.dk did not have any authoritative responsibility or obligations. The overall purpose was to make services available and to establish"
346,221,0.989,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","CONCLUSION Concluding these brief notes on situations when historical education turns into parrhesia, I think that it is important to pay attention to the differences between emotional reactions of participants described in the study that we used as an example of this field of research (Leone and Sarrica 2014). I propose that, all results taken together, clearer information provided in the parrhesia condition allowed participants to better regulate their emotional reactions (frijda 1986), especially their selfconscious or moral emotions (Lewis 2008). The exemplum given in the research described in this chapter shows how these emotions may be seen not only as a barrier (Bar-Tal and Halperin 2013) yet, if well regulated, as a motivational resource (frijda 1986) to get to know a formerly hidden aspect of oneâs own historical past. Of course, not all historical sensitive issues require a parrhesiastic narrative, but those breaking a long-lasting social denial of past in-group faults. Only in this last case, in fact, psychological processes linked to first emotional reactions become crucial, since there is not a consolidated and widespread historical culture framing this knowledge, silenced since teacherâs intervention. In such a situation, literal social denial (Cohen 2001) on past moral indignities of the group produces a lack of historical knowledge that makes parrhesiastic teaching a risky yet unavoidable communication move, since there is a need to break a social silence"
245,753,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"Complicating this somewhat is the fact that not all students may perceive ï¬nancial barriers in the same way. For some, a rise in costs (either in terms of fees or a change in the cost of living) might create a rate of return issue, while for others it might only cause a liquidity issue. In which case, does it make more sense for governments to offset rising costs with loans or grants? Clearly, there are some efï¬ciency arguments which come into play here, and the proportion of students who view it each way is not irrelevant to determining the correct policy; unfortunately, few if any countries bother to investigate this kind of question before formulating policy. Before examining what the evidence tells us about policy and equity, it is worthwhile reviewing some of the difï¬culties that exist in terms of being able to make deï¬nitive statements about âwhat worksâ. There are four major problems when it comes to discovering âwhat worksâ in terms of equity in higher education. The ï¬rst is the ability to collect adequate data, the second is the ability to properly attribute cause and effect, the third is the generalizability of particular results and the fourth is a tendency to re-deï¬ne the term âequityâ when results become inconvenient. To begin with the problem of data: despite the rhetorical signiï¬cance governments lay on equity in higher education, very few countries systematically collect data annually on any key equity criteria apart from gender. Not all countries in the European Union systematically collect data on the socio-economic backgrounds of students and when they do it is often simply to record parental occupation, which without corresponding information on occupational structure in the economy as a whole is not very useful in calculating participation rates. Data on ethnicityâat least in countries which have substantial minority ethnic populationsâis also absent more often than not. Data on completion rates is available only in a minority of EU countries, and of these fewer than a half-dozen provide completion-rates data on sub-populations such as socio-economic backgrounds (European Commission/ EACEA/Eurydice 2014). As a result, when policy changes are made which might affect equity, there is little evidentiary basis on which to evaluate reforms. Where high-quality policy evaluation has been done (e.g. the work of Nielsen or Baumgartner and Steiner), it has tended to come through datasets entirely unrelated to education. This problem of good national data is, it should be noted, of signiï¬cantly more importance in Europe than it is in other parts of the world. In North America, where there is considerably more policy variation within states (because of the federal nature of both Canada and the United States) and across institutions (because of wider limits on institutional autonomy), deï¬ciencies of national datasets can be made up through local surveys. In Europe, where national policies tend to be more uniform and policy entrepreneurialism at the institutional level is rarer, the policy âexperimentsâ which one might want to evaluate can often only be looked at through national-level data. The issue of cause and effect is somewhat more difï¬cult. Equity-affecting policy decisions are rarely taken in a vacuum, and isolating the effects of one particular policy can be difï¬cult. A similar example would be where a government in dire"
21,79,0.989,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"to be used for at the time, had chutzpah. He called the design the âEvolutionary List Fileâ or ELF. In this system, items in one sequence could become part of another like the teeth in a zipperâexcept the two sides of the zipper didnât have to be in the same order. Versions of a document could be visually intercompared, and all items could be written or retrieved in a nonsequential fashion. Links could be made between large sections, small sections or single paragraphs. Most importantly, however, chronological stages and sections in a document could be retrieved and compared. You could trace the evolution of an idea. In his autobiography, Nelson reflects that the ELF design was âstrange and hard to understand. In fact, it was quite badâ [10, p. 151]. It did, however, include facilities to compare versions of a document and reuse elements from these versions. Both of these ideas would make their way into Xanadu in some form, but the zippered list in particular would eventuate in a âdeliverableâ 30 years later: ZigZag. In that same 1965 paper, Nelson claimed that computers would eventually âdo the dirty work of personal file and text handlingâ [5, p. 85]. Needless to say, personal computing has happened. The dirty work is now done by clunky programs like Microsoft Wordâprograms Nelson has a go at every now and then. Not because heâs a cranky ââone-note-sambaâ fellow who canât find another idea to pushâ and âshould have moved on by nowâ as one programmer put in on a Lambda the Ultimate blog post (this programmer may not be happy that Iâm including him hereâ[14]), but because the computing world could be completely different. Thatâs always been his message, even in the 1960s. In 1967, having seen Engelbartâs NLS, Nelson went on to predict a networked structure of information that would âbe read from an illuminated screen; the cathode-ray display; it will respond or branch upon actions by the user. It will be a succession of displays that come and go according to his actionsâ [6, p. 195]. That succession of displays that respond and branch has also happened. Itâs hard to imagine a world without it, actually. The idea that the Xanadu system should be an open or shared access publishing system, what this talk is really about, also started in the 1960s. Although in 1967 he envisioned a sort of âsuper Executiveâs Console,â which was self-contained. He writes in Literary Machines that in 1967 âthe idea of communicating between such consoles was beginning to get through to me, and the nagging issue of shared access began to grow on meâ [9, p. 1/31]. It may have been growing on Nelson in 1967, but as Iâve said, the computing world really wasnât about to swallow the idea of a global hypertext publishing system. Work had not even started on the ARPANET (though Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor had been thinking about it for some time). The computing establishment was still trying to grapple with the concept of a person sitting in front of a screen and exploring information in real-time after Dougâs mother of all demos in 1968. That demo took yearsâover 20 yearsâto filter through properly. There was, however, an attempt to build part of Nelsonâs vision at Brown University in 1967, and that resulted in a unique and historically important standalone system called the Hypertext Editing System. Iâm not going to go into that"

If it is considered by the researcher as an influence, then it would be decided whether it is a rational or non-rational influence. One example of rational influence is as follows: for the item oxygen, someone says, âThe amount 2.5 kg is not sufï¬cientâ. The logical reason may be strong or weak but at least the participant shows a fact-based argument. On the other hand, an example of non-rational influence is as follows: for the item pistol, someone says, âPistol is really unimportantâ, without providing any argument. The statement that says whether an item is important or not is the expected decision, therefore when someone mention their preference about a decision without any argument, it is considered as a non-rational influence. The result of the analysis towards group 5_6 is shown in Fig. 3. In the ï¬gure, one dot represents one utterance. This group mostly discuss about compass and oxygen, 30 and 32 utterances respectively. For compass, 17 utterances were rational while for oxygen it was 24. The group was focusing on those two items for most of its rational influence. When looking at the distribution of IIR for each item in that group, oxygen on the other hand is the item with the least diverse IIR. Meanwhile, the item with the most diverse IIR, the heating unit, was discussed only in 5 utterances and 2 of them are rational influence. As can be seen from Fig. 3, in the ï¬rst half of the discussion they intensively used rational influence, while in the latter half non-rational influence was more dominant. One might think that the second half is probably the decision stage after they discussed the matters in the beginning. However, most of the other items appeared in the second half. It means that for these items they conformed to each other with few rational influences or even not at all. This happened regardless of the difference of IIR of these items. One possible factor is the time pressure. Reaching the latter half they realized that they do not have much time to make a decision. At that moment, they started to use the heuristic approach by conforming or influencing other member even without a logical reason. Most of the time in the latter half, some of the members mentioned their rank for some items and then other people conformed to it, or provided alternative rank without any argument. However, a different pattern was found in group 3_3. In the beginning, rational influence was not so intensive. When the content of the discussion was checked, it is found out that they began intensively using rational influence only after they found a difference of opinion against a certain rank or item. Another fact that was observed from the discussion is the domination of the discussion. In group 5_6, the discussion was dominated by two of the members. One other member almost never spoke or gave any opinion. When their IIRs were"

And however much we discuss with the local partner, the problems with this is it remains a high expectation whether the visitors are consultants or students. We were aware of these tensions before the start of the SVP and issued clear guidance to all parties that professional volunteers should not be placed on staff rotas except in exceptional circumstances.14 Quite understandably, local health workers are often upset about this and resent it, expecting volunteers to relieve them of very burdensome tasks. This reï¬ects misunderstandings about the role of volunteers (and of Health Partnerships and AID more generally) accentuated by years of experience of missionary-style labour substitution voluntarism. Some local health workers will challenge the decision not to permit volunteers to go on rotas, suggesting that volunteers are work-shy voluntourists and more interested in going on safaris than supporting them. And this may well reï¬ect their experience of volunteers. Challenging this culture of volunteering has proved a challenge within the SVP but we are conï¬dent that consistency in response is essential. The following Ugandan clinician who was part of a focus group argues forcefully against allowing volunteers to go on staff rotas on the basis that this will undermine co-working and encourage absenteeism: I donât support the idea that they go on the rota.

118,618,0.989,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"18.3 Post-Fukushima Questions and Answers Engineers are celebrated for their role as superior problem-solvers who depend on math and science to make rational, accurate decisions, and ultimately to create new things [20]. Increasingly, scholars are raising questions that challenge the engineersâ role, including: For whom do engineers work? How do engineers select the problems to solve? Which problems are not worth engineersâ investment, and which are beyond the expertise of the engineer? Who benefits? [20, p. 26]. Since their role is traditionally in the problem-solving domain, engineers tend to stick to solvable problems, wherein a problemâs solvability is directly related to the amount of quantitative information that can be gathered about it. Trained to approach problems with the tools of optimization studies, cost-benefit analysis, and risk analysisâengineers depend on manipulating numbers to obtain objective results. One of the core issues with the problems surrounding Fukushima is that the answers rely on more than numbers. This was a concern that was raised repeatedly throughout the Summer School. Much time was devoted to searching for ways that nuclear power could be justified without weighing its costs and benefits in numerical terms. In this sense, the problems are distinctly non-engineering. And yet, they involve a technologyânuclear power plantsâthat are beyond comprehension to the majority of those outside of the nuclear engineering community. What then, is a reasonable and desirable approach to take when weighing the analyses and recommendations of nuclear engineering experts alongside the views of the rest of the population? This question, in particular, seized the Summer School participantsâ attention. Discussions about the challenges of communicating the safety of nuclear power persisted throughout the week. These discussions largely focused on public communication, safety, and trust, which were the most salient issues to the participants, perhaps because communication seems within the nuclear engineersâ realm of responsibility. In contrast, it was more difficult to have âproductiveâ discussions about issues that were more squarely located in the social sciences, including conflicts of interest, troubling institutional arrangements, and different ideas about the concepts of rationality, expertise, and risk. One of the professional norms that became evident during the Summer School was that engineers learn that it is irresponsible, and perhaps even impossible to make the ârightâ decision without adequate knowledge of the scientific facts. This prioritization of factual knowledge was evident in the organization of the summer school. For example, the first day of the program involved a series of content-heavy lectures that offered rigorous"
245,792,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"2 Discussion Despite its large number of problems, the evolution of the social dimension has provided positive developments. The progress made with regards to the affordability and portability of loans and grants, identiï¬cation of some underrepresented groups and the commitment to improve access to higher education and completion rates, as well as the collection of data can be seen as a success. It is not so much the CommuniquÃ©s or the ministerial meetings which are problematic for the social dimension, but rather that political promises have often not been followed by political action back home in the ministersâ own countries, in order to really achieve what was agreed during the meetings. The social dimension is a rather complex area of work within the European Higher Education Area as it allows several interpretations of even the basic deï¬nition provided in the London CommuniquÃ© (2007). The real challenge for the future of the social dimension is the gap between the political promises made in the CommuniquÃ©s and the actions actually taken to fulï¬l these promises. There are not many opportunities for stakeholdersâexcluding voting against or demonstrating againstâto encourage legislators to be more active with regards to the social dimension. Investment in and commitment towards a social dimension will not provide short-term beneï¬ts and the retention of beneï¬ts might go well beyond legislative periods of government. In the long term, the commitment to a social dimension is a pre-condition to achieving the original intentions of the Bologna Processâcompetitiveness and attractiveness. The so-called European dimension (EHEA 1999) itself is innately linked with the social dimension; OECD data shows us a tight correlation between democratic participation, perceived (in-)equality, and educational status (OECD 2012a). One step which we hope will be taken after the next ministerial conference is the development of lower-level targets towards overarching goal of mirroring the composition of society within higher education (EHEA 2007). Breaking down the end-goal to smaller increments would not only make it easier to begin to work on the implementation of the social dimension, but also make partial achievements more visible. Furthermore, it would provide ministries, higher education institutions, and all other relevant stakeholders the time to adjust to a more diverse student population and to learn to be able to serve this population. The time for adaptation is not inï¬nite, as more and more areas of Europe will be diversiï¬ed, or in some cases minorities will be the new majoritiesâas Crul et al. (2013) reports it is already the case for some cities like Amsterdam. The EHEA should urgently ï¬nd strategies to adapt to this change."

Analysis of statewide data can help states set priorities for moving forward to ensure that all students have access to the standards. But standards and priorities are only one step toward setting direction for the state. Equally important is ensuring consistency in the signals to local districts and schools through consistent leadership and sustained commitment to improvement. This has been and continues to be a major challenge in the majority of states. All too often, state leaders do not have a deep understanding of the nature of the problems; state bureaucracies are locked into patterns that are directive and punitive rather than supportive; and lobby groups work to maintain current practices, often by guiding the votes of legislators and the behavior of the administrators. These practices will not change quickly, but they can be ameliorated over time. Though not yet fully successful, leaders in states such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Texas, and now California have made substantial progress. The key is sustaining the work over time. One- or two-term leadership is not enough; change of the sort we describe here takes a decade or more to embed itself into the fabric of the system. The task is not easyâthe commitment to sustain a policy direction that is based on continuous improvement and equal opportunity is difficult to keep up without succumbing to the siren call of âmagic bullets.â But it is necessary. And we suspect that strategic mobilization within the profession and among community stakeholders will be necessary to reach a common vision and ensure that state governments actually stay the course (see below)."

It should be noted in this connection that there were a number of background factors that made MiloÅ¡eviÄâs nationalist agenda viable, but it was his political strategy that was the initiating and driving force. A similar question is whether a German war of revenge would have taken place had it not been for Hitler. The answer is probably given, the harsh Versailles treaty. Would the Holocaust have taken place without Hitler? The answer is no, at least no if the Nazis did not come to power but some other right-wing movement with no specific anti-semitic agenda.9 The comparison is made not to put MiloÅ¡eviÄ on a level with Hitler, which would be outrageous, but to show that structural change often is difficult, regardless of which actors are involved. Both the Second World War and the partitioning of Yugoslavia were examples of this phenomenon. On the other hand, the ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia and the Holocaust during World War II would be hard to imagine without actors that at least had the same type of agenda as the two leaders named above. Both the Serbian and Bosnian nationalist movements repeatedly referred to the Second World War, in order to create a sense of continuity for and lend legitimacy to their own movements. This approach is relatively common, regardless of whether it concerns politics, science, business or other areas. Institutions or people who had high reputations in the past in the eyes of a particular group will still be of current value and also used because of that very value. It is a question of identifying oneself with the symbolic capital of the actor or institution concerned and thereby strengthening oneâs own position at the same time.10 Tudjman was an accomplished politician of the Realpolitik genre and may have seen that these Nazi references were favourably regarded by the Croatian diaspora.11 Many of these had fled Yugoslavia after the Second World War, and even if new generations had come, the nationalistic master narrative sprung from the Ustasha Croatia was strong in the diaspora. The same can be said about the Serbs to some extent. Serbia started to run a satellite TV channel of its own, mostly because"

Societal development is not unambiguous. In order to navigate in a forever changing and messy reality and understand the tendencies and phenomena at play in our time, there is a need for maps with guideposts and beacons to navigate properly. With such beacons it will be possible to gain understanding of a complex and changing world that may form the foundation for further study of the political landscape. The concepts of factual and post-factual democracies are such beacons; they are ideal types. Sociologist Max Weber (1864â1920) introduced the ideal type as a conceptual instrument to compare different singular phenomena (Coser 1977). According to Weber, ideal types are methodological tools to analyze the world, not describe it in detail:"

As we have seen, treatment in psychiatry is not solely concerned with the patient. It is concerned with the patient in his total environment which includes his family, his home, his work and all other areas of his existence that affect his mental wellbeing ... it is necessary to learn a great deal about the patientâs social constellation.59 This social constellation is not static. Changes are apparent during the 1960s as social workers are advised: âUnless financial hardship is patently a factor in the patientâs mental disturbance it is not usually necessary for the psychiatrist or the social workers to obtain minute details of family income and expenditureâ. In addition, it is ânot enough to record the district or municipal ward in which the patient lives as an indicator of his social statusâ due to housing shortages, housing policy and increased social mobility. Instead, âit is better to discover whether the patient is suited or unsuited to his home area and whether he and his family are happy to conform to the prevailing standards of the neighbourhoodâ. From implied previous concerns around poverty and fixed urban spaces (which are also traditional sociological concerns), the issue becomes one of adequate psychological adjustment within any given social environment: âThis account of the patient in his social milieu is a valuable background to the more detailed information on the patientâs emotional environment which the psychiatrist will gather from the patient himselfâ. Given McCullochâs interest in the subject, it is unsurprising that this co-authored textbook, Psychiatry for Social Workers, should accord a special place for social worker interviews around attempted suicide. It is noted that âwe [have already] described a schema for a standard social history, but in the case of attempted suicide there is a good deal of additional information which must be obtained before the significance of the attempt can be adequately assessedâ.

This infrastructure was the basis for deï¬ning the healthy city project that was to follow and involve 4000 citizens through health and lifestyle research, using the health data for interpretation and communication, together with the database of air pollution. Due to the enormous complexity (medical, technological, social, team effort, interpretation, etc.) of this project, a smaller Proof of Principle, or POP for short, was set up ï¬rst, with just 40 citizens. In Chap. 2, we will go into the details of this process and the interaction we engaged in with the citizens involved. Persuasive interaction with citizens became a challenge on its own. Included in phase 1 (air quality data gathering) was a small budget for communication. We had considered the 3D approach presented by the University of Madrid to show layers of air pollution through a 3D animation over the town. We also looked at integrating light codes into the cityâs streetlight system. But at this stage, it was too far-fetched to consider integrating systems. Instead, we decided to set up a website (http://www.aireas.com) with the intention of getting interaction going with the citizens through this means. This worked to a limited degree at best. A website provides highly informative data for those who look for it. Accessing a website indicates a pre-existing level of interest in the topic covered by the site. In the case of air pollution and health, the people who visit the site still need to make up their own minds about what they see and how they interpret the mix of data without the beneï¬t of specialized knowhow. Little interaction was achieved, even though the site served its informative purpose perfectly, especially for a minority of committed citizens."

Reducing class sizes or giving teachers or children laptops will not improve learning outcomes if it does not change the day-to-day experiences children have in the classroom. Increasing access is straightforward, but improving quality is not. Improving quality is painstaking workâmore difficult than building roads or bridges, and much less glamorous than inaugurating new daycare centers. It requires moving slowly with the expansion of services, especially because access to daycare and preschool has already increased dramatically in the past decade in many countries in the region. If they want to raise quality, policymakers need to take the long view. There is still much to be learned. Research from Ecuador shows that kindergarten teachersâoften kindergarten teachers in the same school, teaching comparable childrenâvary dramatically in their effectiveness. But how are these teachers best rewarded, and what can be done to improve the performance of other, less-effective teachers? Research from the United States shows that innovative programs of in-service training, combined with coaching and mentoring, have potential. But little is known about how best to adapt programs like these to the very different circumstances of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Improving quality does require more resources, but what is most lacking is capable staffâhome visitors, daycare staff, teachers, coaches, supervisorsâwho can ensure that the services that are delivered actually benefit children. And raising the quality of services provided to young children in the region demands a virtuous cycle of experimentation, careful evaluation, and redesign."

That was all he ever gave out. I asked one of the partners, âWhatâs this all about?â He said, âThatâs all he ever uses, those twenty drugs.â23 A number of doctors pointed out that tonic preparations often acted as a kind of placebo and that in some respects the demand for them was patient-led. Stanton recalled: They might actually come in and one of the words that people used was âDoctor, I think I need a tonic . . .â which of course was put into their minds, because doctors prescribed a tonic. âLetâs go down [to] the doctor and get a tonic, then Iâll feel betterâ.

And this used to be prescribed and off they went. And to begin with there was little emphasis on trying to find out what it was for or why they needed it.

Awesome with all the immigrants who can ï¬nd their way to Denmark and say âMe have monayâ¦much monayâ In evidence is a form of ventriloquism (cf. Cooren 2012) where the author of the text animates a generalised voice, manipulating pronouns and spelling to convey poor, foreign-accented Danish and, thus, perpetuating the stereotype of immigrants as having poor competences in Danish. At the same time, the content of what is said plays on the prevalent stereotype that immigrants are only interested in receiving welfare beneï¬ts. The ï¬ctive interaction functions as a means of negatively stereotyping an entire group. However, it also serves to hold this group responsible, since it shifts their role from the ï¬gure to the participant roles of both author, i.e. their words, and principal, i.e. their beliefs. Embedded in a sarcastic construction, the implied meaning is that it is far from âawesomeâ that immigrants come to Denmark demanding money and this interpretation is strengthened by the contextual, and generalised, narrative about lack of resources for geriatric care and hospital treatments.

Bartonâs foreword chimed with AEGISâs experience and with the struggles of the witnesses in their own hospitals. It warned of the authoritiesâ likely reaction to the book. AEGIS needed to prepare for potentially hard-hitting negative responses. Kirkpatrick (1967, p. 48) endorsed the accounts of the nurse witnesses, adding that brutality took place in a âminorityâ of hospitals, a tactful, vague and speculative quantiï¬cation, widely used and loosely interpreted politically as meaning anything between zero and 49 percent. Abel-Smith (1967, p. 128) was dissatisï¬ed with answers that referred to a minority of hospitals because he said that ill treatment should not occur in any hospital. Barbara was unprepared, however, for Newsteadâs response at an AEGIS meeting, when she used the word minority to ease the nurses into the discussion. He corrected her zealously: âNow, Mrs Robb, Iâm going to startle you by saying, for the real care of geriatric patients there are masses of bad hospitals . . . letâs be quite honest.â141 Enoch (1967, pp. 136â140) wrote in Sans Everything about moral, ethical and legal issues. He gave examples, such as older people not ï¬tting into âthe materialistic plan of this present afï¬uent societyâ and doctors misusing compulsory orders under the Mental Health Act to achieve their rapid admission. He regarded concern for fellow human beings as a moral and religious problem, and âthe mere fact that they [the Sans Everything events] can occur in our so-called Christian community is appallingâ (p. 136). He lay the blame for the situation on the whole of society, people who were involved in any way and those who did not want to know. Barbara also teamed up with architect Peter Thomson to contribute plans for âProject 70â, a housing scheme on unused farmland around the psychiatric hospitals that would generate income for the NHS (Robb and Thomson 1967). It originated from Barbaraâs meeting with Tooth, who told her that there was no money to rebuild the psychiatric hospitals. Named because of the urgency to get it under way by 1970, it provided a ï¬nancial and housing solution. Homes built on publicly owned land would be low cost.

This covers all of those using the current road system, be it as car drivers, cyclists or pedestrians. Further relevant acceptance subjects include developers and engineers, politicians and businesspeople, or even public research institutes. Acceptance object Acceptance object does not necessarily imply a physical object as such, but rather refers to the adoption of something âon offer, available, or proposedâ ([13]: 89, translation by the authors). This may be engineering or technology, but it could also be artifacts of any type, or people, attitudes, opinions, arguments, actions, or even the values and norms behind such things. In turn, such an object acquires its signiï¬cance only from what individuals or society ascribe to itâthere is therefore no such thing as autonomous driving per se. Rather, the question is what speciï¬c functions autonomous driving can fulï¬ll, and what signiï¬cance individual people and society at large place in the technology. Behind this is the assumption that engineering and technology have no signiï¬cance in and of themselves; instead, this is only attained by the fulï¬lling of social functions, human actions, and their embedding into social structures (see [9]). Acceptance context The acceptance context refers to the environment in which an acceptance subject relates to an acceptance objectâand thus can only be viewed in relation to both. For example, the context of autonomous driving is determined by the current individual and social signiï¬cance of car usage: Why do people use cars? What attitudes, values, expectations, etc. inform (auto)mobile praxis? Does autonomous driving ï¬t in here seamlesslyâor will it change the meaning of (auto)mobility and its system of norms? In the copious literature on acceptance and acceptance research, various dimensions and levels are identiï¬ed where acceptance is visible and, above all, comprehensible.

But it is easier to write or read about this late modern collapse than to put it into action oneself. This is the apex, the raw nerve, of the art of acting. The highest demands are made of the professional actor â impossible for a lay actor â by the paradox present in every production. Every evening, in opposition to the mythology of modernity, he must surrender to the innocence of becoming.19 Again and again he must willfully step into the voltage field of opposed poles, the conflicting powers of this innocence of becoming.

118,619,0.989,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"scientific analyses of radiation, reactors, and regulations. Starting off the program with these lectures implicitly communicated its priority to the students; it was important to know this information first. Throughout the day, the discussions considered how this kind of scientific information was and was not communicated to the public. Many engineers felt that it was their responsibility to do some of this public communicating and also to act as information gatekeepers. One student, for example, remarked that it was irresponsible to risk panic by releasing data to the public before professionals were able to act on it.3 Students also expressed that their role was to model and measure the available data in order to bound problems, but also expressed concerns about how and what to measure. The second day included lectures on the future of reactor design and on the ethics and âsafety cultureâ of nuclear power plants, which fueled a discussion about engineeringâs reliance on utilitarian reasoning. The first presentations from social scientists began midweek, in which new ways of thinking about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident were introduced. Students were asked to reconsider the challenges of building interdisciplinary awareness across engineering and the social sciences, but also across the more specialized fields within engineering and science (e.g., between nuclear engineers and climate scientists). The social scientists provided students with examples of how to study the institutional and organizational factors that are shaping the ongoing events at Fukushima, including the arrangements between regulatory bodies, industry, government, and academia. Instead of framing the accident in terms that are familiar to engineers, such as safety culture, students were encouraged to consider how social conditions and institutions had shaped the definition of safety. A historical perspective, for example, shows us that nuclear power is judged with great severity, in part because of the public fear of radiation. For this reason, analyses that compare the risks of nuclear power with those of motor vehicles or airplane crashes are not always meaningful. Looking back on the events surrounding 3 Mile Island reminds engineers that severe accidents will happen and that it is important to communicate about them openly and critically. After a day of social science immersion, students had an opportunity to begin in depth discussions with one another. This provided an important space for students to identify issues beyond their professorsâ gaze. For engineering students, this is a necessary exercise to facilitate a pedagogical shift away from lecturestyle learning, and to allow each student to develop a perspective and voice that is different than their professorsâ. A recent study of the undergraduate experience of engineers as compared to students in computer science, science, technology, math, arts and humanities, social sciences, business, and other majors determined that engineering students spend considerably more time preparing for class and have the highest number of credit hours, many of which are spent in lecture [21]. Engineering students quickly learn how to intake and apply the information from lectures wherein the focus is on finding the most efficient way to complete problem sets rather than critically engaging each professorâs views. 3 To protect the privacy of the Summer Schoolâs participants, comments are not linked with individuals."
118,672,0.989,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"20.6 Is Communication Essential for Advancing Nuclear Engineering? There is no doubt that nuclear engineers recognize the importance of social aspects including mutual communication with society, as can be seen in the education reform programs, the round table discussions, and the establishment of the SES subcommittee in AESJ. However, in reality, it is not completely clear or convincing for engineers whether mutual communication will really contribute to the safe utilization of nuclear technology and the advancement of nuclear engineering. This is one of the key reasons why nuclear engineers have not been positively involved in mutual communication. Many engineers think that the communication does nothing for the performance and advancement of nuclear technology but is just required to let the general public know the importance of nuclear technology and make them accept nuclear technology. In this sense, the communication with society is often considered to be a reluctant obligation and an additional burden for engineers, and its purpose to change the public perception. Citizens usually do not think that they have to change; rather they think engineering or experts (community) as well as the governance of technology need to change, especially when they participate in mutual communication. The goal of engineers is to change society, while the goal of the general public is to change nuclear engineering and the nuclear expert community. Thus, in most events of mutual communication, both sides cannot achieve what they want; engineers cannot foster public acceptance, while the general public cannot have any changes in the technology and the expert community so as to make them more acceptable to them. Repeating such fruitless communication makes engineers tend to keep a distance from the communication. However, when we see the significance of the communication from a different direction and appropriately define it, mutual communication with society seems vital to safely utilize nuclear technology and to advance nuclear engineering. I hereafter discuss this point from three viewpoints: (1) legitimacy, (2) introspection, and (3) trust."

Arising indirectly from my work on male mental health and this book, I was invited to co-organise a theme on mental health for Exeter Universityâs âGrand Challengesâ â a new and exciting week-long interdisciplinary initiative offered to first-year undergraduates, which allows them to explore real-world challenges and work with experts in the field. Male mental health formed one important aspect of this initiative. As a direct result of this initiative, the University of Exeter signed a university-wide Time to Change Organisational Pledge in December 2014, making a serious commitment to eliminate stigma and discrimination against staff and students with mental health problems. This commitment was testimony to the energy and enthusiasm of the students and staff involved in the Grand Challenges. Sincere thanks must go to James Wooldridge, Mark Blackmore and Libby Peppiatt from Time to Change, and to a host of individuals at the university who made this possible: Janice Kay, Kate Lindsell, Sarah Johnson, Liz Murphy, Mark Sawyer and Kate Hawkins. I am also grateful to Alastair Campbell, Director of Communications and Strategy to former Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2001â2003, for travelling to the university to deliver a plenary lecture on mental illness, drawing on his own personal experience of alcoholism and psychological breakdown. Finally, it is perhaps ironic that the research questions that underpin this book emerged from an earlier project on neurosis and housewives in 1950s Britain. I was struck by the regularity with which the women who were interviewed for that research expressed concern about the ways in which their husbands and other male relatives had struggled to deal with the pressures of work and family life. Repeatedly, I learned how these men often âdrank too muchâ, or became unwell with mysterious physical and psychosomatic illnesses â and yet found it difficult to express emotion or seek help for their problems. I duly became convinced that there were serious questions we should be asking about male mental health and the common perception that women are more likely to develop psychological illness. Although as women we might argue that there are still many hurdles to overcome until we gain equality with men, as this project developed I soon learned that there are also myriad inequalities faced by men, largely in the arena of health. While this book was under construction during 2014, an article appeared in the Guardian online by the columnist Ally Fogg, entitled âBritainâs male suicide rate is a national tragedyâ (20 February 2014).

395,184,0.989,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"Towards the end of the workshop a provocative question was raised by one of the faculty; many industry executives have approved multi-year investments in safety trainingâyet they feel these investments have not been productive. They ask how they can yield a stronger safety performance improvement for their investments. This question prompted an animated debate. The delegates remarked on the range of training options which might contribute to safety performance; new employee induction training, safety leadership training for operational managers, the use of risk control techniques at different levels in the organisationâand non-safety speciï¬c training in core trade skills which support the execution of good work with good tools leading to good results. This authorâs energies have always been focused on safety performance improvement in mining. In most situations, diagnostics and solution development have highlighted training as a relatively low impact mechanism for creating performance change. It is typically an element of the corporate apparatus which supports the status quo rather than driving material improvementâaspects of training are often necessary for compliance and in mining we have seen situations where related training programs are them too cumbersome for the operations to keep up with, and participant feedback has revealed the sessions themselves to have made little lasting impact on how people perform their work and the decisions they make. In mining, experience has demonstrated that to achieve sustainable performance improvement senior management and the architects of safety programs should consider: â¢ The intertwining of what makes humans the creative creatures we are with the balance of goals and incentives we put before workers; the pre-cursors to incidents typically lie with how the organisation is routinely run and the level of acceptance of hazardous activities that this incubates, rather than with the shortcomings or lack of judgement of the unfortunate individuals who so often appear to have âignored the ruleâ; â¢ That each operation is unique; unique risk proï¬le, operating culture and leadership dynamics. This means that creating sustainable improvement requires a tailored approach that targets the most appropriate improvement levers applicable to the individual operationâa local safety improvement strategy; â¢ Improvement strategies need to change how people think about their work, how teams work together and the decisions that individuals make; so they need to be led through a deliberate coalition between line managers and supervisors on the shop floor and their safety function advisors, rather than via a sanitised training setting; and, â¢ Interventions need to cut to the heart of how work is designed and scheduled, an increased sophistication in how teams identify and control the hazards in their work, and centrally, what level of exposure operational leaders are prepared to accept for their people."

They are very similar: both store some local state, call an untrusted piece of code (adv ), and then test whether the local state is unchanged. They differ in the way they do this. Program f1 uses our stack-based calling convention (captured by scall) to call the adversary, so it can use the available stack to store its local state. On the other hand, f2 uses malloc to allocate memory for its local state and uses an activation-record based calling convention (described in the technical appendix) to run the adversarial code. For both programs, we can prove that if they are linked with an adversary, adv , that is allowed to allocate memory but has no other capabilities, then the assertion will never fail during executing (see Lemmas 2 and 3 below). The two examples also illustrate the versatility of the logical relation. The logical relation is not specific to any calling convention, so we can use it to reason about both programs, even though they use different calling conventions. In order to formulate results about f1 and f2, we need a way to observe whether the assertion fails. To this end, we assume they have access to a flag (an address in memory). If the assertion fails, then the flag is set to 1 and execution halts. The correctness lemma for f1 then states: Lemma 2. Let"

In this sense, in Japan there does exist fundamental human talent. In thinking about this background and these achievements, I am confident that Japan will not remain a âproblem-saddled advanced nation,â but rather will use its power to leap forward as a âproblem-solving advanced nationââthat is, a forerunner in addressing emerging problems in the world."

Luke 10, 29 and 10, 36 ff.)), and the beaten man simultaneously becomes his closest (cf. Wolter 2008, p. 391). The Samaritan does not want the injured man to continue to be in the state in which he has been: He does not want that which is. The concern has been compressed, has been turned into volition, substantiated to a volition: to a volition for the sake of the concern. The condition of the injured man ought to improve. It ought, therefore, to be different. It ought not to be as it is. This seems to us to be of decisive importance. The Samaritan takes issue with the situation as he finds it. He sets his will against that which is. This appears to be one important source of the ought: when I posit my will, as it arises from my being, against that which is, when I say: it ought not to be so, but rather how I, for the sake of the other person, want it to be. And this will for the sake of another, I suspect, is a preliminary form of the ought. Thus the Samaritan takes practical action, and as the story continues, he âbound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him [ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼ÏÎµÎ¼ÎµÎ»Î®Î¸Î· Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿¦. et curam eius egit]â (Luke 10, 34). The care-giver then releases the nameless man from his care (Zimmermann and Zimmermann 2003, pp. 54â58): â[35]And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him [á¼ÏÎ¹Î¼ÎµÎ»Î®Î¸Î·ÏÎ¹ Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿¦. Curam illus habe]; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay theeâ (Luke 10, 35). What may have happened after that is not mentioned, but it is not important for these purposes. As I stated, the Samaritan does not want the continued suffering of the nameless man. I can form such a willâI now move away from the connection to the parableâbecause I want to address the concern of the person who has appealed to us: I place my will in the service of their concern. This will is the central element of the story. The will is then transformed. This will, which I bring forth in the course of my care, encounters me once againâseemingly foreign, seemingly having become independentâas a demand made to myself. This ought is by no means to be understood universally. With the help of this âorigin storyâ of the ought, I indeed intend to establish that"

56,291,0.989,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"Familiarity of the Foyer Care homes can feel âforeignâ to older hostel residents in the sense of strange or unfamiliar. As with all older people, hostel residents may be upset by a change in environment: ânew surroundings and language problems lead to significant difficulties in adaptingâ to the care home environment (Sonacotra 2005a). As has been noted at several points in this book, many residents have lived in their hostels for 30 years or more. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising to find that â[t]o leave a residence, in which they have spent the better part of their life, is a difficult actâ (Unafo 2002: 45). Indeed, transferring oneâs residence to a care home can be validly described as a ânew immigrationâ (Sonacotra 2005a). Put simply, to leave the hostel is to leave home, even if it is not everyoneâs ideal of home. Care homes tend to operate according to a model of individualised, personalised residential care. For some of my respondents this approach was tantamount to separating and banishing older people from the wider community, which was anathema to their views on appropriate care for older people. For example, some of my respondents in DembancanÃ© expressed outrage at what they called the âWesternâ model of elder care: older returnees in the village were relieved that they had managed to avoid ending up in a care home in France. What is specific to the hostel population vis-Ã -vis other care home clienteles is the transition âfrom a lifestyle where the collective served as the means to withstand the difficult life conditions which they were made to experience, to a lifestyle where everything is very individualised, inside the EHPA or EHPADâ (senior civil servant). According to this same interviewee: it would be necessary that the EHPAs or EHPADs take into account the specific history of these persons. What has enabled them to survive is life in a group, so itâs very likely for someone who is liable to spend a significant period of time in an EHPA for example, that itâs not just one person on their own, it has to be three or four people who understand each other, who know each other a little."

Good news, surely, for those of us who believe that we are just that: individual agents facing an open future of possibilities. In line with the development of BT, BST and stit, CIFOL is developed from a semantical point of view. The interface with a formal logical language is, however, much more pronounced in the case of CIFOLâthe fact that we are considering a predicate logic necessitates close attention to the syntax as well. (For example, as the framework is required to remain first-order, while lambda-abstraction is unfettered, lambda-predicates may only occur in predicate position.) Naturally, it is to be expected that there can be fruitful discussions of CIFOLâs proof theory and metatheory. Nuel Belnap, in his contribution to this volume, gives a highly interesting overview of a truth theory that can be developed within CIFOL+, a minimal extension of CIFOL. Given the frameworkâs intensionality, it is possible to define terms representing the cases, and based on those, one can develop the theory of the mixed nector âthat Ï is true at case xâ. You will, we hope, not go wrong in expecting further striking results about CIFOL and its connection to indeterminism and free action in the near, albeit open future.

134,39,0.989,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"curriculum is. A curriculum points to what is intended should happen in a programme of learning and the circumstances in which these activities can take place. Those activities are learning activities; and thus a curriculum is a collection of exercises and tasks, which culminate in learning of one type or another. There are three types of learning: cognitive, skillbased and dispositional, and they have different forms and operate in different ways. Cognition is the manipulation of those symbolic resources (words, numbers, pictures etc.) that points to something outside itself. Skill-based knowledge is procedural and not declarative; and dispositional knowledge refers to relatively stable habits of mind and body, sensitivities to occasion and participation repertoires. Significantly, these three types of learning are focused on knowledge-construction and are knowledge-development activities, although there are some important differences between the three types. And what can be inferred from this is that how knowledge is construed will determine how appropriate learning environments are constructed and ultimately how learners then learn in and from them. The learning aims and objectives of a curriculum do not specify how the knowledge, skills, and dispositions should be taught, though teaching and learning approaches are derived from them. As a consequence the curriculum-developer needs to reconceptualise each intended learning outcome into a programme of learning or action learning set. Pedagogic approaches and strategies range from didactic to imitative to reflective and meta-reflective action learning sets, and they have a number of common characteristics. A pedagogic approach specifies: the circumstances in which it can be used in the learning environment; the resources and technologies which allow that learning to take place; the type of relationship between teacher and learner, and learner and learner, to effect that learning; a theory of learning, or, in other words, a theory of how that construct (i.e. knowledge set, skill or disposition) can be assimilated; and a theory of transfer held by the teacher, that is, how the learning which has taken place in a particular set of circumstances (i.e. a classroom, with a set of learners, in a particular way, with a particular theory of learning underpinning it, and so forth) can transfer to other environments in other places and times. Paying due attention to these allows a proper focus on learning, with these being generally neglected in the various iterations of"
277,71,0.989,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"look at how findings were (or were not) actually used in policymaking, we are confronted with an apparent anomaly. In the German case, while the administration did appear to attach more importance to the value of research, often this was decoupled from the take-up of research in practice. An almost naÃ¯ve confidence in the value of research was juxtaposed with a readiness to disregard the âevidenceâ in decision-making. The disregard for research did not simply involve discrediting findings or playing down their importance, but quite blatantly ignoring them in deliberation. It suggested that respect for research on the part of policymakers was often largely ceremonial. A rhetorical commitment to the importance of research was coupled with a readiness to debate decisions on an entirely different basis. In the UK administration, by contrast, far less importance was attached to this form of knowledge base. And yet despite this, officials did quite frequently draw on or commission research to substantiate policy. The most pronounced example of research used to substantiate policy was the research on the economic impact of migration, which was drawn on repeatedly to justify the governmentâs liberalisation of labour migration in the early 2000s. Arguably, this says more about the nature of political contestation over labour migration than it does about the Home Officeâs organisational culture. For a number of reasons (which there is no space to elaborate here), the Labour government succeeded in pitching the debate in quite technocratic terms, shifting the discussion away from more emotive arguments to a discussion of the economic costs and benefits of labour migration. So the demand for substantiating research emanated more from politicians involved in making the case for labour migration, than from within the Home Office. The German debate on the immigration law, by contrast, drew surprisingly little on research findings. Both political discourse and media coverage relied predominantly on arguments linked to values and interests rather than expert knowledge. These insights underscore how important it is to distinguish between the different functions knowledge can play, if we are to develop a more nuanced understanding of different cultures of knowledge utilisation. A particular organisation may show high deference for knowledge in the abstract (legitimising knowledge), but rather limited interest in deploying it for the purposes of substantiating or adjusting output. Another may attach little importance to the activity of collecting background knowledge, but consider research very important in substantiating specific claims. And organisations may find different types of knowledge more or less reliable when it comes to adjusting output, preferring more scientific studies, or knowledge acquired through practical experience. Thus the different functions of knowledge may be decoupled from one another. What are the implications of this for thinking about national âculturesâ of knowledge use? First, the analysis supports the idea that there are distinct German and UK cultures in terms of the value attached to research in the abstract. And this appears to have some influence on the legitimising function of knowledge in the two organisations examined. However, this culture of valuing research does not appear to guarantee that research will be taken up in policymaking. Instead, other factors appear to have more weight in determining how far knowledge plays a substantiating or instrumental function. In the case of substantiating knowledge, what seems to be"

Additionally, a characterization of conflict in user stories is presented but there is no mention of mockupâs conflicts. Mockups tools are gaining attention in the requirements engineering ï¬eld since they help to build UI speciï¬cations in companion with end-users. Also, they help to discover and deï¬ne non-UI requirements in a language that is closer to them, as opposed to plain textual speciï¬cations [11, 13]. Additionally, mockups have been proven to be an effective method to capture fluid requirements [18] â those that are usually expressed orally or informally and are an implicit (and usually lost) part of the elicitation process. The usage of user interfaces prototypes with static structure to deï¬ne conceptual models has been already shown in [12]. While authors in this work show how E-R models can be derived from structured mockups, their approach is not applicable to informal mockups like the ones that are considered in this work. The ICONIX process [17] proposes to start with Graphical User Interface (GUI) prototypes as a ï¬rst requirements artifact. While this may provide some initial guideline, in that work the authors do not provide any language or formal guidance to deï¬ne data requirements. In [14], authors establish a method to work with Use cases and mockups in conjunction, however, Use Cases speciï¬cation require more effort than a lightweight speciï¬cation. In [10] the authors explain that sometimes when documenting requirements in agile this is so customer-oriented, that even if the speciï¬cation is clear for the customer, they might not for the developers, having here conflicts between two actors in software development, and for this they propone Requirement Speciï¬cation for Developers (RSD); each RSD can have mockups associated, and when a requirement is changed the mockup associated has to be reviewed. Regarding requirement consistency, last years we have been researching different strategies to capture Web software requirements and validating its consistency and completeness [4, 19]. These approaches were designed to be plugged into âheavyâ Model-Driven approaches and do not easily ï¬t in agile development processes.

If medical progress required experiments on animals, then the scientistâs cool indifference to vivisecting them signified dedication and self-mastery rather than callousness or cruelty. By the early-twentieth century, vivisection had come to be seen as an indispensable weapon in medicineâs unending âfightâ against disease: to be pro-vivisection was to be for science, progress, and the relief of human suffering, while anti-vivisectionists were enemies of science, whose sentimentality and squeamishness were obstacles to be overcome. To understand the motives of anti-vivisectionists, one must first appreciate the fundamental differences over the nature and goals of science that lay (and perhaps still lie) at the heart of the debate. I have laid particular emphasis on the thesis that vivisection was the expression of a particular view of scienceâobjective, dispassionate, materialisticâ which has now become so familiar it is largely taken for granted, but which was contentious in its time. Anti-vivisectionists also regarded themselves as scientificâthey tried to test their position through experiments such as anti-vivisection hospitalsâbut their idea of what constituted scientific sources extended beyond results acquired in the clinic and laboratory to encompass less palpable forms of knowledge. To them, a scientistâs duty was not simply to investigate physical phenomena but to seek a deeper appreciation of their significance and, by paying attention to ethical and social considerations, to increase the sum of human wellbeing. The spiritual revival, and ânew ageâ utopianism, deeply influenced the anti-vivisection movement. While the most important motives for early anti-vivisectionists were probably their commitment to Christian values and personal virtue, it is striking how many later ones were theosophists, vegetarians, pacifists, and members of various socio-religious orders, unions and groups. For these reformers, vivisection was unscientific because it treated animals as mere matter and ignored the spiritual, aesthetic and moral aspects of life that, though intangible, had to be heeded if humankindâs harmony with nature was to be restored. The idea that the vivisectionistsâ mask of objectivity hid their inability to understand the real consequences of their actions, or even accept"

The number u(Ci,j is the utility of consequence Ci,j , i.e. the utility of making decision i and facing the outcome j. If u(Ci,j ) > u(Ck,l ) then this means that Ci,j is better than Ck,l .

The purpose of this chapter is to raise the question, and to suggest some anecdotal evidence, that monodisciplinarity does put a scholar at an advantage in terms of career advancement (through publication). The problem would affect researchers at different stages of their career: Early career: consider someone who has been recruited as a postdoctoral researcher on a funded interdisciplinary project.

Since they will have to publish in interdisciplinary formats as part of the project they will not be well placed at the end of the period to apply for permanent academic positions if the greatest prestige still goes to peer-reviewed papers in monodisciplinary journals. Tenure: take a scheme where a university actually establishes interdisciplinary tenure-track positions (there are some initiatives of this nature in the US, for instance). The search committee will typically consist of members from different departments who will have to agree on a single candidate with good interdisciplinary credentials. At least from the hiring point of view this is not a handicap, but an advantage. But as one looks ahead to promotion and tenure, problems loom. Typically, the position will be located in an individual department. When it comes to the tenure decision, the department will decide according to the usual criteria. Here again, there is a risk that the bias towards monodisciplinary publications will put the candidate at a severe disadvantage. Senior researchers: the incentive to publish monodisciplinary research will also deter well-established scholars from engaging in interdisciplinary research. Their promotion to more senior levels, such as named chairs, could be set back by the time taken putting together funding proposals and seeing them through. An additional problem, which affects all stages of academic promotion, concerns letters of recommendation. Promotion depends on strong referees and readers (whether chosen by the candidate or not), but there could be a problem if the more trusted and respected readers are"

For most professional volunteers, it is an ongoing process involving complex negotiations at many levels. In one case, a volunteer who spent over a year in Uganda was constantly under pressure not only from her peers but also from the hospital superintendent (in this case, a British volunteer himself) to become involved in routine service delivery and be placed on local staff rotas.15 She battled on a daily basis to resist service-delivery roles for over a year. Sadly, when she returned to Uganda after some months in the UK she immediately found that the expectation had increased. Staff assumed, as she knew the place and had experience of working there, she could immediately substitute for local health workers. In her monthly report she identiï¬ed the âmain obstacles to achieving her objectivesâ as follows: Itâs just that I seem to be left to do things on my own now a lot. Frequently I am doing the ward round alone with or without the intern as the only other midwife on the ward is in the Waiting Home for half the morning. Because I have been here so long the midwives treat me as one of the rota staff, which is lovely as they accept me and trust me, but means I canât do admin and prep for teaching as they assume I am always going to be there to do the ward round. And as there is often literally no-one else to do it I canât really just disappear to do teaching prep etc. so my objectives changed â I think that is probably a natural progression in this type of work after one has been there for a while (V)."

She is also a popular healer for businessmen who are afraid of competitors who might target them with nakaimas to drive them out of business. A healer is therefore often asked not only to bless new businesses, and thus protect them, but also, regularly, to âscanâ the places for sorcery. The healers adjust their treatment to the specific kind of evil that is in question. If a person is possessed by a demon, the healers need to identify the medium though which the demon has gained access to the patientâs body. If the symptoms are different, for instance just trouble at work, in marriage or politics, the cause might not be a demon but nakaimas. However, the healers often articulated that the differences or nuances between instruments or causes didnât matter to them. Whether an affliction was caused by ancestral spirits, urban demons, overseas magic or local sorcery items it still had the one and same origin and cure. It was the result of an opening or a crack in the moral constitution of the personâa crack that had allowed the evil forces inside the self â and the crack had to be closed by the Holy Spirit through discernment and prayer. In Port Vila evil is becoming an absolute phenomenon; there are no âgreyâ areas. There are no forms of sorcery or witchcraft or demons that are only slightly evil. And the question of evil must be located to the integrity of the person affected by it. As an extension of the argument forwarded by Robbins in his article on Pentecostal ritual (2004) we should add that probably the most important factor for explaining the popularity of Pentecostalism must be the role that healing rituals and rituals of discernment play for redefining an entirely new field of âspiritual powersâ around the individual person. The cleansing of neighborhoods, cities or nationsâwhere the ritual is taken out of the church building and into the streets, brings about the change that is the Pentecostal revolution. This is what Robbins calls âthe Pentecostal promotion of ritual as a mode of socialityâ (Robbins 2009: 63). People leave behind the church building and its ritual services and instead cast the everyday as a platform for generalized ritual activity. By ritual, we here imply a form of routinely engagement with forces that lie beyond the observable and tangible, that pertains to the sorting out of invisible forces that have penetrated into persons, things, or relations. The object of the rituals is the discernment of these invisible influences, their cleansing or casting out and the reestablishing of the normality of the situation. In Port Vila everywhere you go you are subject to attacks from these spiritual influences, and so the city is also becoming obsessed"

That decision, as other extreme applications of Goodness, would have unacceptable consequences. No Harm tells us, however, that when we see the occasional jaywalker ethics should drive us to compassion. To avoid harming her, we push the brake pedal. The supreme form of harm is killing. Many stern moralists of the past had no qualms about condoning some cases of killing. It should be a cornerstone of any modern system of ethics that killing stands apart from all other disapproved forms of behavior. Any acceptance of killing humans after birth should be restricted by the most stringent and exceptional conditions. This rule, the Principle of Life, is another quasi-absolute corollary of the Principle of Goodness: before all, preserve human life. The Principle of Life explains, for example, that while we think regrettable to separate a child from his teacher we recoil with horror at the idea of separating him from his parents. The reason is that life is the most important of all human goals, and harming peopleâs life, especially the life of the weak, is the worst possible kind of harm."

Both results were compared and analyzed. Teachers of Yakutia (Figs. 20.1 and 20.2) describe the presence of crisisproducing factors. Individuals in a crisis tend to have higher values for these factors. Such individuals are alienated from others and believe that nobody understand them well that external circumstances dictate their life and that they are not able to determine their own lives. They cannot see the meaning of their life, their inner hierarchy of values disintegrated, things that seemed important on a regular basis changed and they cannot decide what is important and what is not. Such individuals are no longer interested in something new and do not seek to develop themselves. It is important to pay attention to the rate of values, which have the highest points relatively to other factors. Figures 20.3 and 20.4 describe the presence of factors that help to overcome crises in Yakutia survey results. Individuals in a stable condition overcome a crisis and tend to have high values for these factors. Individuals who overcome the crisis are open to people, to the world and they care about not only their own problems but also problems of others and seek to resolve them. Such individuals constantly educate themselves (Fig. 20.4), work on personal development and are interested in new information.

93,266,0.989,Nordic Mediation Research,"If we approach the dialogue from a hermeneutic or phenomenological view of identity, we would look for the needs and interests that weâwith our knowledge about mediation theoryâexpect the victims to express at the meeting. And we would probably consider Joeâs statement (statement 5 above) as a need for an apology. However, if we use an interactionist approach to identity as a contextual performance, we would interpret Joeâs statement concerning the apology as not necessarily âbrought to the meetingâ but as part of the situationâpotentially provoked by the altruistic comments of the other participants. So, from a phenomenological point of view, one might see Joeâs request for an apology as an expression of Joeâs inner needs whereas the interactionist approach would see Joeâs request as an expression that is at least partly a result of the context. In continuation of that perspective one could ask whether Joe would have asked for an apology if the others had expressed anger towards the offender. It is hard to eliminate the possibility that Joe might not have expressed a âneedâ for an apology if the others had behaved differently. Thus the example illustrates how the context is shaping âJoeâs selfâ."

The idea that âcivilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable directionâ also was incorporated into major segments of the social sciences (Ross 2001). Their core assumption is that we can recast the social world in line with our values and ambitions. Thus, according to Keynesian economics, if one correctly sets interest rates and the rates at which people spend and save, one can achieve high economic growth. Sociologists in the post-World War II era held that Head Start, Medicaid, negative income tax, Social Security, and half a dozen other such federal programs will allow us to close the gap between the races and the classes. These were indeed heady, optimistic ages, captured in such mottos as âwhere there is a will there is a wayâ and in assertions that âthe richest nation of the world should be ableâ to accomplish whatever was needed."

Since this is still a very active field of research, it is hard to claim one particular model as the definitive model. We shall therefore focus on a kind of model that has a structure that seems to be more or less agreed upon but, as usual, we attack this problem with simplicity in mind. This also holds true for the way we introduce the effect of a mutation. We start by considering a simple model of the sodium channel, illustrated in Fig. 12.1. The actual functions used in our computations will be given below.

117,261,0.989,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"An Appeal to Regulation There should be a smooth overlap between the way care is provided and the regulation dealing with it, as implied by Trontoâs caring democracy. This viewpoint has clear implications for the content and form of the regulatory framework on seclusion. Thereby, the functions of regulation serve as a stepping stone.25 First, regulation coordinates human behaviour [regulatory function], including in the domain of care. In the event of seclusion, this function is nowadays translated into quality manuals. Coordination, however, is not necessarily the same as determination. As demonstrated in Section âDeprivation of Personal Belongings (âDeprivation of Clothingâ)âand Section âAvoidance of Direct Communication (âAvoidance of Direct Communicationâ)â, manuals can be drafted in a categorical wayâpassing over the caring disposition and thus turning care into a problemsolving actionâor in an open way, pointing at what should minimally be done, but leaving room for more (Noddings 1984, p. 55; Voskes et al. 2014). For good care, these quality manuals are nothing more than helpful guidelinesâgood practicesâthat do not stand in the way of a caring disposition and that in exceptional circumstances could be set aside or at least be discussed (see Section âReduction to Procedure (âLoss of Nameâ)â) (Tjong Tjin Tai 2007, p. 259; Voskes et al. 2014).

Behind the assumed gender neutrality, it is the mothers who in most families are described as having the main responsibility for the housework. Still, for the youngest generation there is nothing strange, comical or special about men doing housework, as was the case in the previous generation. Housework is not per se feminised, even though women do more of it than men. The organisation of work and care in the family may explain the lack of explicit gendering of money and consumption, which we saw in their parentsâ generation. Even though fathers in general earn more than mothersâbecause mothers more often work in the public sector and fathers in the private sector, or because there is more part-time work among mothersâthis is not associated with and not primarily understood as a gendered pattern. Having two working parents, or living with a single parent, also means that this generation of children assist much more in the household compared with what most of the parents did at that age. This is also confirmed in studies of time use from the period when this generation grew up.2 At 18, both women and men in the youngest generation say that they help out at home with things like tidying up, vacuum cleaning, emptying the dishwasher and cutting the grass. Paul, who is upper middle class and the only one with a mother at home (she ran her own business from home), is the sole informant in this generation who says he never helped out at home. At 30, he regretted this as it had taken him so long to learn these necessities of life when he moved out. Daughters more often than sons mention specialised tasks like doing laundry, cooking and baking, and some of them complain about the low level of their brothersâ proficiency in housework. However, only one young woman, Tonje, said that she was expected to do more work than her older brother. Sons of fathers who participate on a more equal footing with the mothers tend to give more detailed descriptions of their own chores, which may indicate a higher"
299,187,0.989,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"A significant number of analysts have shown that automation, especially the kind driven by Artificial Intelligence, is destroying many jobs and is expected to eliminate many more in the near future, including many middle class jobs. This development in turn is held to raise social and political tensions and to raise moral issues. A common response is the observation that such creative destruction always follows technical advances, but that these very advances lead to the formation of new and better jobsâjobs that entail less menial work and that pay better. However, there is some evidence that this may well not be the case this time. The chapter examines these assessments in part I. Several treatments have been offered to deal with the net job loss, should it occur, which some refer to as job collapse or even job Armageddon. These include education reforms as well as training and retraining programs, which are reviewed and assessed in part II. Providing income security to all members of society, whether or not they work, to mitigate the social and political effects of job losses, is reviewed and assessed in part III. Various other suggestions have been made to cope with this challenge posed by automation (part IV). The chapter finds that none of the suggested treatments will suffice and hence calls for a fundamental change in culture and the economy, outlined in part V."
21,80,0.989,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"here, howeverâthis is Nelsonâs party and I donât want to poop it. If you are interested you can find it in my book [1], and the implementation notes are published in the Xuarchives [7]. Iâll just say that it didnât happen the way he wanted it to happen. Nelson had also met Engelbart and seen his landmark NLS system by 1967. The friendship would last until Engelbartâs recent death. (Although Nelson had initially thought this meeting happened in 1967, he found some notes while writing Possiplex and realized it was in 1966. Those notes have since been lost!) He thought Engelbart was warm and wonderful upon first meeting him, though he did not like the âhierarchicalâ structure of Engelbartâs system. He went on to dedicate his book on Xanadu, Literary Machines, to this âvisionary of The Augmentation of Human Intellectâ¦and (what this book is largely about) THE TEXT LINKâ ([9]ââ1987 Dedicationâ included in 1993 edition). Nelson and Engelbart were close: they understood each other on multiple levels. In his passionate eulogy for his friend, Nelson said, âI donât just feel like Iâve lost my best friend. I feel like Iâve lost my best planetâ [11]. Although their visions were different, they shared some similar life experiences. Firstly, Engelbart and Nelson watched their ideas spread around the globe then re-emerge as someone elseâs interpretation, an approximation of a vision. That has upsides and downsides. I remember putting it to Nelson once, in Melbourne, when he was getting a bit despondent about his life, that he has âinspiredâ people. He told me immediately that this was never his intention, and that the problem with inspiring people is that they then try to credit you with things you donât like (Nelson 2011, personal communication). He never set out to âinspireâ people: he wanted to create an entirely new computer world. He wanted to actually build that world, not watch other versions of emerge. The fact that it has not yet been built drives him to continue. Englebart and Nelson also lived through resistance: resistance to those original visions in the 1960s. I donât want to dwell on this, but I think it does need to be said. There have not always been conferences like this one held in Nelsonâsâor Engelbartâsâhonour. Although Engelbart, as an engineer with a prestigious post at SRI, had more basis for conversation with the computing mainstream, what he was doing was not seen as âscienceâ back then either. As the Head of Engineering at SRI told a young Bill Duvall (and Duvall later recounted to me), âYou donât really think what theyâre doing up there is science, do you?â (Duvall 2011, personal communication). That kind of resistance has dogged Nelson for many years. People didnât understand what he was going on about, and neither Ted nor his vision seemed to fit in any one nice explanatory box. As The Economist put it in 1986, âBoon or boondoggle, nobody is quite sureâ (cited in [9], preface). Discussion of Xanadu still positions his work in left field. As others have discussed, in 1974, in Computer Lib, he took his idea to the public, in the hope that he may have better luck there. He argued that computers are mere changeable devices for twiddling symbols that should power this new allsinging, all-dancing media experience for everyone. It was a rallying cry to that cause. Some of the conference attendees were actually around when that book was"

Such explanations ignore the wider social context of higher education, and how being an educated person can make one vulnerable to jealousy, resentment, and violence. Upper secondary schools, colleges, and universities in PNG are important sites for the socialization of an educated elite that understands itself as distinct from the rest of the countryâs largely rural populationânot simply because of the things they learn and the professional roles they eventually take up, but because of how the experience of education disrupts their connection to place, complicating their relationship with the potentially dangerous forces, human, and otherwise, inhabiting rural spaces. I argue that the financial demands of kin and the perceived threat of retributive violence from clients encourage health workers to see themselves as social outsiders. Students narrate their experience of higher education itself as being punctuated by occult violence and Satanic trials, which Pentecostal (and other) church social groups give them the power to resist. Pentecostalism, in this analysis, is less significant for its theological or epistemological stances than for the social function it fulfills: providing alternative forms of belonging that can mitigate the dangers of living between rural and âeducatedâ ways of being. These encounters with diverse forms of evil can be productively mapped onto a Pentecostal universalism that demands direct intervention and resistance: an âinsistence on taking control of the forces of life and death with universality as a key techniqueâ (Rio et al. this volume, 7). As other contributors to this volume have suggested, Pentecostal movements take a strongly practical and active stance against evil. They embrace fully the invisible world and take control of it. They describe the different forms of life and creatures that exist in it, and they offer techniques for taming it and making the invisible visible (Rio et al, this volume). Nursing education encourages a similarly practical approach to the various microscopic threats to human wellbeing, teaching health workers to make them visible and knowable to their clients. If Pentecostalism in Melanesia and Africa is âabout cleaning, dividing, dissecting, observing and healingâ (Rio et al. this volume, 27), then so too is nursing, a profession whose members frequently describe themselves as instruments of Godâs healing power. âWe treat,"

128,351,0.989,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"trajectories would have worked in synergy for all vulnerable groups. On the contrary, we suspected that for some vulnerable groups, individual bonding could in fact reinforce their self-exclusion from politics (cf. the notion of âpolarisationâ in Sunstein 2002). In the case of the unemployed, for instance, self-identification can be hampered by the increasing stigmatisation they face in society at large. The only field where we expected both trajectories to neatly combine was the field of disability, given that solidarity with the disabled can be triggered by both individual and political variables. We expected that the political trajectory would prevail in the field of unemployment, given that solidarity, in this case, is directed towards fellow citizens penalised by specific policies, but with whom it might not be easy to form bonds (especially in terms of self-identification). Lastly, we expected the individual trajectory to prevail as a driver of solidarity actions for refugees, since the latter can be seen as fellow human beings, but not as fellow citizens since their status places them outside the political community. Our results did indeed prove that the individual trajectory and the political trajectory combine in various ways and that they can help to account for variations in the amount and forms of solidarity actions across different fields of vulnerability, even when controlling for important sociodemographic factors like age, education, and gender. Among the expectations that were confirmed by our data was the suspicion that the political trajectory was the only possible driver of solidarity actions in the unemployment field. As expected, French citizens who engage with politics and follow the public debate are also more likely to see unemployment as the consequence of certain political choices and of specific policies, which makes it a problem to be solved by calling for collective action and for public solutions. Solidarity actions will therefore be carried out (mainly in a public and collective way) in spite of the processes of stigmatisation that are at work and that weaken the effectiveness of the individual trajectory. By contrast, the individual trajectory plays an important role in the field of disability, where it combines with political variables in a way to lead to the highest level of solidarity actions across all three fields. However, the main point to emphasise is that results did fall short of our expectations when it came to solidarity towards refugees. While we were initially unsurprised to see that solidarity actions were at their lowest level in this field, and that they were mainly the result of an"

This also means that too many of our boys and girls are just not ready when they begin school. This book forcefully argues that this deficit is not just the responsibility of parents. Governments canâand shouldâmake a major positive difference. According to a landmark study, simple parenting interventions by social workers decades ago in Jamaica produced adults who not only did better in school and earned higher wages, but were also less likely to resort to a life of crime. An investment in a well-crafted government program, using the tools that we know today to be highly effective, can have a huge development impact. Early childhood development programs are the foundations for successful social investments over the lifetime of an individual, especially for the poor. Investing more in this area is one of the most effective ways governments can improve economic mobility. Many governments are taking this lesson to heart and have increased investments in the early years. However, the evidence indicates the region is still spending too little. On a per capita basis, for example, governments are spending three times more on children aged 6â11 than on those aged 0â5. Moreover, early childhood investments tend to disproportionately favor physical infrastructure such as daycare facilities, while neglecting vital training and human capital. Recent research shows that some of the biggest returns on investment can come from modest programs that focus on improving the critical early interactions between young children and adults, be they parents, teachers, or caregivers. Finally, in most of the regionâs countries, no one actor clearly âownsâ the issue of early childhood development. The absence of coordination between multiple actors and levels of government creates a daunting obstacle to improving the quality of services. Today, the challenge is to ensure that we have smarter institutions capable of directing investment toward programs that have a measurable impact on early childhood development. It is not an easy"

Fast-forward three years from that, I had written about a lot of start-ups, I knew a lot of people, and I was part of the blogging ecosystem that was really burgeoning at that time. So it was a network of people who knew each other. Then, we came across the post-election violence and craziness that were happening after the elections. Ushahidi was formed, and I was one of the founders. I remember that I came to Nairobi in August of 2008 and was sitting down with a bunch of other guys at BarCamp Nairobi. There was a large turnout. A great amount of interest, and there was everybody present. All the guys who are now CEOs of their own startups in the ecosystem, but we were still just ordinary tech guys at the time. So, we were sitting around afterward, and we were saying, âWhy is it that the tech guys in the city only meet up once or twice a year at these events? What if we had a place of our own?â And that was the seed that would eventually grow to become the iHub. So why did not somebody else do the iHub? Because it is a lot of work to come up with the money, to come up with the bigger vision of where this thing needs to be. And keep in mind that I was running operations for Ushahidi at that time,"

It is one of the hallmarks of contemporary politicised research-policy dialogues on migrant integration that public officials have most trust in those researchers who depend on them most. And they mistrust so-called âindependent scientistsâ, notwithstanding peer-review mechanisms, because they feel that these people have a (hidden) political agenda and are interested in promoting their political ideals.7 The scientists after all may even propose certain measures on the basis of empirical research and call them âevidence-based policiesâ, while in reality the evidence is not so strong and the recommendations are mainly based on normative preferences. Of course, due to the direct financial links between for example SCP and the ministry it advices, the argument could also be made that SCP researchers are less âobjectiveâ than seemingly untouchable professors at universities. This chapter contended earlier that the current literature on research-policy dialogues in the Netherlands is primarily concerned with politicisation. The section on the three subtopics explored the role of mediatisation and tentatively concluded that more attention to this aspect is warranted. The empirical analysis suggests that mediatised dialogue structures differ from non-mediatised ones as opportunity structures for influencing migrant integration policy. In fact, there may be a new Boundary, which is the one between non-mediatised and mediatised research-policy dialogues. By this we mean that scientists who wish to have policy impact can take two routes nowadays. The first, more traditional route is to communicate with policymakers directly. In practice this mostly happens in private, i.e. without media coverage, in so-called âboundary organisationsâ like committees, advisory bodies and think-tanks, at conferences, informal workshops, dinners, etc. The second route is to communicate with policymakers indirectly, via the media. In the project we have found numerous examples of public intellectuals who have developed media strategies to influence migrant integration policymaking. One interesting avenue for future research, we believe, is to find out whether the two routes âadd upâ, i.e. whether researchers have to choose or not. There is some evidence (also see the British case) that both routes are to a certain extent alternatives. This is because communicating via the media has a âcostâ: put simply, scientists who choose the public route tend to take more critical positions and this decreases the likelihood that they also interact with policymakers directly in more private networks. There are relations between the tone and content of the researchersâ messages, their media presence, and the usefulness of their expertise as perceived by policymakers. For example, some researchers see the world of newspapers as âa totally different realityâ (interview). Scientists who do not have direct, private access to policymakers feel"
275,271,0.989,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"9.1.2 Trustworthiness Trustworthiness is a property of an agent or organisation that engenders trust in another agent or organisation. Trust is a psychological state in which a person makes themselves vulnerable because they are confident that other agents will not exploit them [68]. Trust is also a social feeling of mutual confidence that increases the efficiency of systems, allowing adaptations to externalities and uncertainties [4]. Trust, like empathy, truth telling and loyalty lubricates social interactions. Humans depend on flexible cooperation with unrelated group members that rely on trust [89]. Thus, social success relies both the evaluation of the trustworthiness of others and the presentation of oneself as trustworthy [23]. We can distinguish between the trust we place in individuals, and the general trust we have in our society that affects how we make decisions more broadly, e.g. Adam Smith [87] in the Wealth of Nations noted that a merchant is more comfortable trading within their own society because they can âknow better the character and situation of the persons whom he trusts.â Empirical literature has linked improved trust with more efficient public institutions, greater economic prosperity, self-reported health and happiness across many societies using a range of statistical techniques (see [16]). Within a Nation or society, trust is quite heterogeneous between individuals. Surveys on whether subjects trust a generic personâmeasured on a scale between 0 (no trust at all) and 10 (fully trusted)âfind large interpersonal differences [14]. Economic productivity peaks when the average citizen rates a generic person a â7â level of"

Two important observations can be made about black swans. First, a black swan cannot be described by any of the stakeholders because the event is completely unknown to all of them. Second, while a black swan is a total surprise to all the stakeholders considered, there may be other individuals outside the group of stakeholders for which the event is not a big surprise. As an example, while the economic crisis of 2007/2008 came as a huge surprise to most people, a few individuals, including Taleb [9], foresaw the crisis, even though they could not say when the crisis would occur or exactly how serious the consequences would be. A gray swan is a metaphor for rare global behavior with a large negative impact that is somewhat predictable but typically overlooked by most of the stakeholders considered. It is the âknown unknown,â a rare event that some know is possible but no one knows when or whether it will occur. Because a gray swan is not a complete surprise to all stakeholders, it tends to have less impact than a black swan. However, its impact is still huge. For simplicity, we often neglect to define a set of stakeholders when we discuss gray and black swans. However, the reader should assume that users, owners, software developers, operators, and regulatory government agencies are always among the stakeholders."
275,130,0.989,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"In a first-order theory of mind, the reasoner considers that other people have beliefs, desires, etc. that influence their behaviour; e.g. they believe we are attacking from the opposite direction. In a second-order theory of mind, the reasoner allows that others are doing the same about us and other people; e.g. my co-pilot believes that the enemy believe that we are attacking from the opposite direction. In higher-order theories of mind, this nesting continues; I believe that my co-pilot believes the enemy believe that we are attacking from the opposite direction, and I believe my co-pilot believes I believe this. Such reasoning has received much attention in empirical studies of childrenâs and adultsâ reasoning, e.g. [6, 23â25] and there is considerable evidence that many adults have ToM abilities of levels 3 and 4, with some subjects succeeding in tasks requiring level 5 reasoning, yet even level 2 reasoning is beyond the reach of almost all state-of-the-art planning tools. Multi-agent systems research has contributed a deep understanding of concepts such as group knowledge, group belief, and collective intention, often informed by philosophical and psychological perspectives, e.g. [26â30]. Studies have also examined computational models of ToM, e.g. [8, 31, 32], and also the impact of different levels of awareness that an agent has about the others acting in a team task context, e.g. [33]. Although the tools used in such investigations are highly expressive â typically description logics and rich multi-modal logics, and some bespoke algebraic belief update mechanisms â they are not accompanied by efficient reasoning engines, so fall short of providing practical means for systematically operationalising complex analyses. Existing multi-agent planning tools that do take into account the beliefs, goals, intentions and capabilities of others, e.g. [34], consider a third-person view, in which a plan is constructed for a team, and each member is given their part to execute. When planning must be distributed amongst a team (including, when humans are to be in the loop), a semi-autonomous system must plan for its own actions while considering others explicitly - i.e. such reasoning demands a first-person view."

This can cause increased anxiety and loss of control. â¢ Self-image is often a concern: roles and relationships change rapidly, and often there are feelings of being âon hold,â at the sideline. â¢ How do we facilitate intimacy and address sexual functioning concerns? Nurses understand that body and mind continually interact, and they need to develop skills to structure and interpret their observations. They should discuss this in multidisciplinary meetings and consider appropriate interventions. Nurses need to be taught how to use evidence-based tools that assess and address this aspect of care. The patient is the best source of information about the impact of their concerns, coping in normal healthy life and what might help them at that moment. To promote self-management and shared decision-making, it is necessary that nurses are aware of the diverse resources and how to use them in their own work setting. Even when there are many professionals involved in a patientâs care, it does not necessarily follow that they will work in a multidisciplinary manner. Interdisciplinary working is time demanding: time for meetings, dialogue, and questioning teamwork (Porchet 2006).

56,274,0.989,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"In other situations, left-behind family members are alerted by hostel management to the fact that their husband/father is sick in France and can no longer look after themselves in the hostel. In my discussions with Denis, a hostel manager, he mentioned that in the past managers were not required to ask residents for next-ofkin contact details. It is only recently, as head office began to grasp the extent of ageing and its consequences in the hostels, that recording such information has proved necessary. Thus relatives can be summoned from overseas to escort home a resident struggling with loss of autonomy â provided a visa can be secured, which is not always straightforward as some respondents mentioned (see Table 7.3). The final instance where returns may be constrained pertains to the individualâs social circle within the hostel itself. Instead of seeing their ailing compatriot sent to a retirement home â which is seen as shameful and even as reflecting badly on the hostel residents collectively (Sonacotra 2005a) â neighbours prefer to donate money to a collection fund in order to purchase a ticket to enable the man to return. âVery often, the fellow residents say to the elderly person, âlisten, you go home now; if it turns out OK you can come back, if not then you stay thereââ (BÃ©atrice, health advisor, migrant welfare association). An example of such a situation is found in the casefile in Table 7.2. The spareness and gravity of language by which the suffering of the individual in Table 7.2 is conveyed gives some insight, I think, into the institutional violence which is endemic and latent in hostel living. Such violence occurs, indeed seems inexorable, despite the good intentions of a number of actors. One can only speculate at the fate of this man. His example, anonymous though it is, underlines some of the limits of the hostel as a venue for âhome careâ, to which I now will turn."
140,166,0.989,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Rummelâs work is an integrated worldview: its foundation is that the kind of government is of utmost importance to its own citizens (will our government kill us?) and other countries (will there be war?), so Rummel can by synthesized: regime type matters. This bridges the empirical democratic peace with a powerful prescription: if you want peace, and life, you must choose the regime type that protects it best: democracy. From this worldview comes one general principle, that democracy is a powerful and reliable method of nonviolence, and ï¬ve associated propositions, best set forth in Rummel (1997): ï¬rst, a pair of democracies do not make war on each other; second, the more democratic any two countries, the less their bilateral violence; and third, the more democratic a country, the fewer its own casualties in war. These are about international relations. The fourth is internal: the more democratic a country, the less internal political violence. Finally, the more democratic a country, the less its democide. Ending war and mass murder, and building positive peace, are the highest goals of secular life, and because Rummel offers empirically valid, theoretically sound, practical solutions to that end, I view Rummel as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. To understand this I have found Chadwickâs (2006) Goal-Drift-Actual framework invaluable. The GDA model centers on science, philosophy, and praxis, integrating political science (the empirical, what we know), political philosophy (theory, our understanding and convictions), and political action (what we do). The GDA is a powerful alternative to Johan Galtungâs Diagnosis-Prognosis-Therapy (DPT) model, which treats human interactions as illnesses to be cured. The GDA is less arrogant, lacking the DPTs presumptive privilege of the analyst as wise doctor, and from a power-limiting, freedom-favoring perspective, the GDA is a preferred model. Using the GDA to look at Rummelâs work we ï¬nd extensive political science in his robust empirical work that was essential to establish the democratic peace. There is highly developed political philosophy, from the âthe conflict helixâ (Rummel, 1991), to the three levels of explanation for democracy as a method of nonviolence (Rummel, 1997). Regarding praxis, Rummel argues that because of the science of the democratic peace, and the conviction that democracy reliably reduces violence, there is an imperative to âfoster freedom.â This integration, linked by regime type, offers a transformative politics, transcending realism and liberalism, while negating neither. For Rummel, realism must understand that democracies behave differently, and liberalism must understand that peace is best achieved among democracies."
356,97,0.989,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"An Example of a Surprising Design Outcome: TeamUp The design process outlined earlier takes a great deal of resources and time. To illustrate the concrete benefits of such an involved process, we will describe just one design outcome from the very first piloting cycle. Twenty mini-scenarios were developed by iTEC partners across Europe during a scenario development workshop, organised by the iTEC partner organisation Futurelab (see Chap. 2). Of the 20 mini-scenarios, the nine most convincing and desirable ones were identified using a prioritisation protocol devised by iTEC partners. These were then fleshed out by Futurelab into detailed scenarios. These detailed scenarios presented the basis of the first cycle design process. Six of the nine scenarios described the pupils working in small teams. Teamwork was taken for granted, and just mentioned in passing, as can be seen in the example scenario in Fig. 3.3. None of the expert pedagogues nor our design team, who participated in the scenario development workshops considered that this might be a challenge. When analysing the participatory design workshop summaries from various countries, it became obvious that in most European countries, having pupils work in small teams was not a common practice, and was seen as a real challenge. Teachers from several countries pointed out that they normally do not facilitate teamwork exercises; that following all of the teams and guiding them is a lot of extra work for which the teachers do not have time; and that teams are often dysfunctional, with free-riders or friendship cliques making productive teamwork difficult. This surprising finding lead us to reconsider the content for the first piloting cycle. Pedagogical experts agreed that teamwork is a useful form of learning without recognizing the challenges it may pose in practice, whereas teachers, by and large, saw teamwork as a foreign, time-consuming and problematic mode of working. No teacher denied the benefits of teamwork, but the practical challenges they saw were a clear showstopper."

356,73,0.989,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Innovation with Respect to the Toolkit Process As discussed in section âThe Challenge to Innovateâ, innovation within a scenario is not merely dependent on the technology employed but is a combination of technology and pedagogy. For example, the result of implementing a scenario might be students doing a presentation to illustrate their understanding of biodiversity. A presentation is not particularly innovative, but if the students were responsible for identifying the research questions, designing interview schedules, collaborating to devise and run experiments, etc. the process might be highly innovative. In contrast, placing QR codes around a historical part of town describing the importance of the buildings might have an innovative outcome, but if in previous years the same information appeared on a paper map, the process is not innovative. However, there is more to iTEC than the production of innovative scenarios, importantly there is also the process of creating scenarios. The act of measuring technological innovation can be found in the âOslo Manualâ (OECD 1997). This makes a helpful distinction between technological product and technological process innovations that can be transferred to the context of education. The product is the desired learning outcome as expressed as a teaching objective,"

It was speculated that maybe quarks are so heavy that they would be practically unobservable. Bootstrap thermodynamics was presumably the best way to calculate qq production rates as a function of their mass (applying perturbation theory to this problem was a then fashionable nonsense). The model was used to predict [17] KK, pp, dd, and qq pair production with the result that the production rates of the first three agreed with experiment and that for quarks a mass of 4â5 nucleon masses would make them practically unobservable (with the techniques known at that time), even if they could, in principle, exist as free particles. If anyone had suggested to me then a qq plasma, I would have declared it impossible (alas, again). One often-heard objection to the model was that resonances (inside a fireball) would not live long enough to justify treating them as âparticlesâ. Matthiae [18] proved, using the principle of detailed balance, that they might just live long enough. It was tempting to apply the model to astrophysics: the Big Bang and neutron stars [19]. This triggered a number of papers, notably the one by Huang and Weinberg [20] and by Wheeler [21]. The then proposed âlimited temperature (T0 ) Big Bangâ depended entirely on the (at that time reasonable) interpretation of the model as yielding an infinite energy density at T0 . For an easily readable summary of the situation up to 1972, see [14], where no prior knowledge about statistical bootstrap is required."

For now goodness is not transferred in its entirety along the series. Rather it slowly emerges as we progress from the links Z to Y and Y to X.

223,116,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"before they erected them in reality, a wonderful illustration of how the abstractness of Platonic forms is turned into the concreteness of visible objects. Seemingly a textbook application of practical reason, the intentionality of the plan preserved in the materiality of physical structures. Only seemingly, though, for in the case of the early Zuiderzee polders the impact of technological change was seriously underestimated. To make a long and complicated story short and simple, the constructed places proved to be too many, too small, and too closely packed, the location of the brick-built stores, schools, police stations, and hospitals obsolete before the mortar had dried. In addition, and because roads and houses are costly both to build and to tear down, the spatial nonoptimality tends to stick. The Achilles-heal of every optimizing location theory. LÃ¶schâs remarks about the comparison between rational theory and faulty reality come readily to mind, Hegelâs epistemology of self-conscious reevaluation as well. The reason is that the planning of the later polders, especially the Oostelijk and the Zuidelijks Flevolands, has become increasingly sophisticated. But that development rather heightens than lessens my surprise that Christallerâs static, deterministic, and inelegant theory was used at all. The only excuse I can think of is that we are all children of our own time and place, the Dutchmen of 1930 as much as I at eighty. And what a happy circumstance that is. For what saved the subjects of the great polder project was not the machinations of social engineering but the circumstance that Holland is an open society, its citizens free to design their honeycombs as their fancy fancies. In that respect the Third Reich was obviously different. But what richer pasture could the likes of Konrad Meyer and Walter Christaller have wished for than the newly conquered Lebensraum (living space) of Eastern Europe, a vast area showered down on them as a gift from the FÃ¼hrerâs heaven. Like the Dutch polders, also the territory that the Reichskommissariat fÃ¼r die Festigung deutschen Volkstums (Reich Commission for German Resettlement and Population Policy) was commissioned to settle had the characteristics of a homogeneous plain, the techniques of ethnic cleansing as merciless in Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine as anywhere else. The clearing of sufficient living space in the East was de facto the cornerstone of Nazi foreign policy, the very precondition for the Germanization that was meant to follow, the Entfernung (removal) of foreign elements setting the stage as effectively as the digging of the dikes in Holland. As an amateur artist, Hitler surely knew that without a properly prepared canvas there will never be any painting. And as the Leader of a populist movement he was well aware that no political battle is more decisive than that about the boundary between identity and difference, one and many, us and them, me and you. Such was consequently also the purpose of the charts, tables, and maps that came out of Meyerâs office: the utopia of a totalitarian Herrschaft (rule) projected into optimally located settlements, everything and everyone in its proper place. Seventy-five years later the whole affair strikes me as a Dadaesque blend of Kandinskyâs Bauhaus, Malevichâs suprematism, Picassoâs cubism, Ernstâs surrealism. The irony of the entartete Kunst (degenerate art) in its proper perspective."

Moreover, the constant change of personnel implies a lack of knowledge transfer, as the people who were formerly staffing the office all leave, and the new ones do not necessarily know the area they will be working in. During the ChÃ¡vez era there was a high turnover of both ministerial positions, a series of reorganizations of ministries and institutions, and a high degree of turnover in executive positions at various levels. I repeatedly saw how projects in the communities fell apart because there had been a change in positions, either in a political or in an administrative office. Often grassroots activists had spent a lot of time cultivating relations with political figures and state officials. But when positions were changed, their contact person and leverage also disappeared, and they had to start pushing to find another opening within the office they were dealing with. Such practices also have the consequence that many state jobs are highly unstable, and people cultivate a range of different connections and networks within the state bureaucracy in order to ensure their future (see also Nuijten 2003). This creates strong and crosscutting alliances within the state system, which people also can rely on in order to get their job done. At the same time it should be said that internal recruitment procedures are not solely based on personal and political connections. Job performance does also play a role, though you often need someone to give you an opportunity and open the door for you; you need a door opener."

So even if the applicant is entitled to assume an afï¬rmative answer after the deadline expires, they will still lack the corresponding documentation. To ï¬x this, you need some sort of high-level authority that is entitled to issue the documentation in question. In Georgia, such an authority was not created. As a result, these incidents are handled by the courts, which have the power to force the respective agency to issue proper documentation with the required approval, although this power has never been exercised to date. â¢ Agencies still tend to come up with all sorts of irrelevant inquiries and questions to justify an extension of the deadline. This tendency undermines the entire âsilence is consentâ concept and lets the old regime of constant delays creep back in. We introduced speciï¬c regulation to keep such delays at bay. When an agency asks for additional information, which it is entitled to do only once according to the new rules, the clock restarts as soon as the missing information is supplied by the applicant. Thanks to âone governmentâ and âsilence is consent,â civil servants now think differently about how they provide services to the public. In the past, civil servants did not care how many different types of documents an applicant, be it a citizen or a company, had to submit to obtain a given license or permit, nor did they care how many different agencies the applicant had to deal with for a single application. After the reform, things changed. As one-stop service providers, civil servants were now responsible for collecting all required documents themselves, and inaction would lead to automatic approval of an application. Suddenly, ofï¬cials personally felt the pain of unnecessarily complex rules and regulations. Initially, they were still reluctant to introduce simpliï¬cations that would make one of their colleagues redundant, or simply reduce someoneâs perceived or actual authority and importance. But the new regulations (âsilence is consentâ and âone governmentâ principle), put together, made it clear that their own job security was contingent on their contribution to a more efï¬cient administration. Once civil servants realized that the role of government had changed, and that they could be ï¬red if they didnât play along, they started looking at rules and regulations from a new angle. Before, ofï¬cials treated citizens as petitioners. Now, the customer is king."
78,124,0.989,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"3.5 An Unexpected Success In conclusion, let us first recall that the success of Wikipedia was very unexpected. Before Wikipedia, the models of collaborative encyclopedias, which were based on free and spontaneous public contributions, surprised most of the experts in encyclopedia publishing. For them, it was more of a naive utopian view than a possible reality. As a consequence of the success of the new models, it seems that old models, based on respect for skills and knowledge, are at risk of disappearing. Moreover, the new models, especially the one that Wikipedia represents, raise many questions about the status of knowledge in society, its financing and control, and on those who can and must exercise control. In this regard, there is concern that low-skilled groups, groups funded by governments or private pressure groups outweigh experts. Or, conversely, that the rules too strictly applied restrict the freedom of authors. Regardless of these issues on the new status of knowledge in society, we have here a concrete example of a modern model of governance brought about by the development of ICTs. This model of governance is interesting by itself. But it could also be generalized to other online institutions."

For the content creation process FESTO is focusing on the experts in the fields (i.e. the workers who do something day to day). In order to find out more about how typically strict learning related policies in a company fit in with the goals of PLEs, the interview was conducted with a focus on the philosophy and benefits related to letting workers create their own learning material during their work-time, and how this fosters learning and collaboration in the workplace.

114,285,0.989,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"A Global Revolution Rather Than a Local Evolution We can foresee that healthcare systems will change dramatically in the way they are organised and the way care is delivered. We will need different kinds of hospitals with fewer beds, shorter stays, advanced technologies and new competencies. Much more care will be delivered in the home and community, as we cope with extended life expectancy and the rise in chronic conditions. The consequences for those working in healthcare and the organisation of care are profound. In addition to this people no longer view healthcare as they have in the past and assumptions about what is achievable and what is expected are also changing rapidly. Ageing and well-being are coming to be seen as the right of every citizen with the concomitant expectation of reasonable living conditions, medical support, social rights, pensions, and an ability to maintain a full life in the community. This is an empowering emphasis in most respects but it greatly increases the challenges for healthcare as the demands seem ever growing and sometimes impossible to meet. We are now sometimes seeing a presumption of error and poor care if the outcome does not meet expectations rather than, in the past, an acceptance of the course of the disease with only secondary consideration of the possibility of error. The patient journey is new for healthcare but already replaced in many peopleâs minds with the concept of a lifetime citizen journey. Medical problems are no longer considered in isolation but in the longer term context of a personâs life. Legal aspects of this transformation in mindset are already clearly visible. For instance when a patient is harmed by healthcare and seeks compensations there are legal guidelines for assessing the amount due. This total compensation is assessed on several dimensions which include physical disability, suffering and permanent damage and the impact on personal and professional life, loss of earnings and so on. In France the assessment of compensation used to be restricted, apart from some exceptional cases, to the immediate aftermath of the event with the assumption of recovery in a reasonable time period. However in recent years the legal guidelines on both time period and quality of life have been greatly extended so that compensation can now be made for reduced wellbeing and quality of life in the mid and long term (BÃ©jui-Hugues 2011) We will also need in the coming decade to rethink and adapt the surveillance of the healthcare system, learn more from the introduction of electronic information for the purpose of surveillance, develop accreditation methods which encompass patient journeys, assess the impact of the movement of professionals and patients across borders, and last but not least, rethink the whole payment scheme of healthcare to reflect the growing collective and interdependent nature of care delivered to patients. The list might seem long but these are not suppositions about the future but present realities."
275,92,0.989,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"Trust, then, is inherent in any well-functioning autonomous system in which tasks or goals are delegated to agents within the system. In particular, a Goal Reasoning agent requires a large degree of trust to have the freedom to autonomously determine and adjust its goals. As such, Goal Reasoning pushes the scope of Trusted Autonomy, as the trust of other agents must extend beyond the completion of known tasks or towards achieving a known goal, to trusting the agentâs ability to make decisions regarding its goals. There are many open questions with respect to Goal Reasoning agents and their relation to Trusted Autonomy. What motivates the agent to change its goals? How do humans interact with robotic agents and delegate tasks? When will the agents choose to overrule an operatorâs commands, and why? How can the Goal Reasoning process be framed to promote transparency? How can one ensure that certain safety conditions and guarantees are maintained, despite the additional freedom of autonomy provided to a Goal Reasoning agent? These are just a few of the questions raised by the relationship between Goal Reasoning and Trusted Autonomy. In this chapter, we describe Goal Reasoning and elaborate on some of these important questions. While we focus on a few selected topics of research, there is a large and growing body of work on Goal Reasoning and related topics. For additional reading, see the survey papers [20, 38], or the proceedings of several Goal Reasoning workshops [2â4, 34]. This chapter is structured as follows. In Sect. 3.2, we describe a simple model of Goal Reasoning called Goal-Driven Autonomy (GDA), as well as a domainindependent method for goal selection in GDA, and an application of GDA in a human-robot teaming task. Section 3.3 focuses on a more comprehensive model of Goal Reasoning based on goal refinement, an architecture for ensuring the behaviors of Goal Reasoning agents that use this model, and its application in a distributed robotics task. For both models, we describe the importance of transparency to engendering operator trust. We then describe two extensions to Goal Reasoning in Sect. 3.4, first on how inverse trust can be used as a basis for adaptive autonomy, and then on rebel agents and their relation to Trusted Autonomy. We then conclude in Sect. 3.5."

Indeed, a recurring challenge for researchers who study gender divisions of labour is the issue of how to effectively measure change and to define and assess issues of gender equality in domestic life. In this vein, there has been some critical attention paid to the importance of distinguishing between housework and childcare, both conceptually and methodologically (e.g., Mannino and Deutsch 2007; Perry-Jenkins et al. 2013; Sullivan 2013). However, there has been less attention given to determining what parental responsibilities are and how to measure them. Scott Coltrane has argued that one of the problems is that the field of gender divisions of labour is dominated by an approach that has added childcare and parental responsibilities to household labour without fully considering the conceptual implications of an âadd and stirâ approach. He writes: In most studies, the concept of housework or household labour is rarely defined explicitly, except for explaining how variables are measured and providing some indication of whether childcare is included in its definitionâ¦. Although this concept can include child minding, household management, and various kinds of emotional labour, most household labour studies have excluded these less visible or overlapping types of âworkâ from study â¦ The lack of attention to child care and emotional labour continued to be a major shortcoming of research on housework (Coltrane 2000, p. 1210; see also Perry-Jenkins et al. 2013; Sullivan 2013)."

The arguments that reach the Home Office are more likely to involve the spending of public money and the police, whereas those issues recede in a coronerâs court where it is a question of establishing fault or not in a particular death. This becomes transposed onto the technical question of facilities (which is accepted by both parties) and the question of facilities best equipped to deal with violence. The point is to lay out a field of argument, structured by a specific mental/physical divide, where attempted suicide emerges."

As a result teaching to the test occurs and the curriculum is narrowed to accommodate those learning outcomes that can more easily be assessed. There is some evidence of this occurring in the European Baccalaureate. The reason for separating out learning approaches from assessment approaches is now clear. If these assessment approaches are the same as learning approaches, then this is likely to have a detrimental and reductionist effect on the curriculum and more importantly on the type and content of learning that takes place. However, there are different needs within a system of education, and one of these is that, at set points in time, supra-national (such as the European Commission), national and local educational bodies need to have information about how well the system is doing. This is a very different process from improving learning with an individual learner. However, there must be some connecting link between learning and reporting, so that the latter doesnât distort the former, and this is the role of learning aims and objectives. Learning and assessment practices on a programme of study, such as a curriculum, can be regarded as formative if evidence of a learnerâs achievements in relation to knowledge and skill acquisition is collected and used by the teacher, the individual student, and their fellow students, with the specific intention of deciding on their subsequent programme of learning. As a result, assessment is used formatively when it directly influences the learnerâs cognition. Curriculum developers consequently need to make a clear distinction between summative and formative assessment. If these two functions are combined, then the potential impact of the curriculum is weakened. There are two principles which structure the choice and order of content within a curriculum: a spiral element or a re-visiting of concepts, skills or dispositions at a higher level of intensity and at a later point in the programme of study, and theory transfer from theory to practice and from sites of learning to sites of application. The first of these is the need to incorporate a spiral element into the curriculum, i.e. a set of ideas or operations, once introduced, is revisited and reconstructed in a more formal or operational way, at different stages in the learning programme (cf."

The disadvantage of dynamism is that itâs diï¬cult to predict exactly what will happen with a given function call. This is a problem because the easier it is to predict whatâs going to happen, the easier it is for an interpreter or compiler to make an optimisation.

Scientists see the âcrisis of scienceâ as âa reflection of the crisis that besets our whole societyâ¦ How increasingly instable the integrations in physics are becomingâ (p. 151). The âgolden sphere of harmonyâ had already ceased to exist long ago and even the basic convictions (the philosophemes) of classical physics became untenable. Indeed, quantum physics exemplifies the âshakiness of our metaphysicsâ (p. 151), but also the âawareness of the need for synthesisâ. But this, according to Bloch and his followers, would require a shift, on the level of the philosophemes (beneath the bar: S1), towards dialectic materialism as the new foundation, turning society as such into a kind of university world, with physicists as guardians of the atomic age. According to Marxism, only a classless society may solve the crisis that science (S2 above the bar) experiences today (p. 151), abolishing philosophy by absorbing it into science. Initially, the gadget has a positive impact on the subjects involved in terms of individuation and personal growth. It prompts and enables Sebastian to face difficulties that would have âoverwhelmed him 3 years beforeâ, that he would have been âutterly incapable of coping withâ (p. 178). Thanks to the gadget, he had âbroken through that magic but sterilising cocoon of solipsism that had enveloped him â¦ He had become a human beingâ (p. 179). Yet, increasingly, this process of individuation becomes frustrated and Sebastian eventually emerges as a tormented subject ($ in the lower-right position). Working on the bomb project, Sebastian experiences himself as âa man dividedâ, outwardly self-possessed, but inwardly distraught and tormentedâ (p. 211). A ânameless anguishâ possesses him (p. 213). His new symptoms ($) are no longer the symptoms of egocentrism and unworldliness that troubled him in the past, for the âThingâ changes everything and engenders a series of more unsettling symptoms. He becomes increasingly distant and unapproachable. A sinister change comes over him (p. 256) due to his involvement in âthis fearful Thingâ (p. 257), turning him more and more into a stranger. In the confrontation with the Thing, the position of the scientific expert (S2) becomes destabilised, and the research site becomes an ethical and epistemological clinic ($), sometimes literally, when Sebastian is forced to keep his bed because of exhaustion (clinic is derived from ÎºÎ»Î¯Î½Î·, = bed). According to Tanya, his unsettling tasks make him inhuman and estrange him from humanity. His appalling responsibilities become âa screen separating themâ (p. 260). The Monster creates âa gulf between themâ (p. 288). âWeâve hit on the gadgetâ¦ the Monsterâ¦ the Thingâ (p. 148), Sebastian argues, and this âThingâ, this instrument of wholesale destruction, without parallel or precedent in history, is now relentlessly âchallengingâ him (p. 147). Indeed, his whole being becomes wrapped up in the Bolt; he eventually becomes devoured by it (p. 344). He is âconsumedâ by his gadget, his object a. The Monster will be born; nothing can stand in its way. His whole being seems to rebel against it, but he cannot stop the Monster. He senses that he is âin the grip of a necessity that transcended his own willâ (p. 336). The object a is pulling him towards his destiny. Face to face with the Bolt, he is no longer master in his own house, as Freud once phrased it: He had known for a long time, even before the premonitory shadow of its shape first loomed before him, that his commitment to it was inescapableâ¦ His whole being rebelled, [but] the most important decision of his life was one that he had already unwittingly made (202)."

This chapter is different, in that it is motivated by an envisaged solution to the problem rather than a research field. This envisaged solution â containment of the equipment that we do not trust â consists of two parts. The first part is the detection of misbehaviour. This problem area is discussed thoroughly throughout the book. In separate chapters, we have discussed detection through formal methods, reverse engineering, the static analysis of code and hardware, the dynamic analysis of systems, and software quality management. The other part of the solution is that of replacing or somehow handling misbehaving equipment. For this part of the solution, we are in the fortunate situation in which the mechanisms we need have been studied and developed over decades. This work has been conducted under the headline of fault tolerance rather than security, but the developments work well in our situation nevertheless.

Thus, while we can, in a sense, separate out the two storylines at the level of plot, symbolically they are increasingly entangled by this web of imagery and by complex repetitions and allusions. This is particularly important for understanding the relationship between present and past as it is represented in the novel. The novel does not conceptualise the past as distinct, and separate from the present, but rather as entangled and entwined. For the novel, the Victorians continue to have an embodied afterlife today, as part of our cultural memory, mediated in part by the imaginative texts they have left behind them, which continue to shape the present. Since it is the text that is the privileged medium of the past Roland only embodies the ideal reader when, toward the end of the novel, he realises that as he comes closer to possessing the truth of Ashâs life, he feels distanced from Ash himself. His attempts to possess the end of the story, and thus Ash himself, are self-defeating. This realisation leads him back to Ashâs text as medium. He reads, not searching for allusions to other texts, nor hunting for hints about Ashâs life, but enjoying a reading in which he can again hear the language sing. It is an epiphanic moment that restores to Roland âthe days of his innocenceâ, when he âhad been not a hunter but a readerâ (469â70). It is a reading that, we are told, âis violently but steadily aliveâ (470), engaging both âsensuous alertness and its opposite, the pleasure of the brain as opposed to the viscera â though each is implicated in the other, as we know very well, with both, when they are workingâ (471).8 His is a âsensationalâ reading â one that appeals to and evokes the appetites and emotions at the same moment that it engages the reason and intellect. In her discussion of the âneo-sensationâ novel Kelly Marsh argues that the appeal to sensation in the antecedent genre of Victorian sensation fiction undermined the notion that reason governed (particularly menâs) actions and suggested that there were visceral truths, as well as intellectual ones. The sensation novelist ventured the idea that sensation was a strong motivating force, exploring its effects and evoking it in their readers (Marsh, 1995: 109). She notes that the term âsensationâ is âvexedâ, but traces Thomas Boyleâs etymological pursuit of it which finds that the two meanings of the term given in the Oxford English Dictionary are paradoxical, evoking two"

There are also several open issues for the non-concurrent case considered in the paper (and its future concurrent generalisation). First, our pool of lens composition constructs is far incomplete (because of both space limitations and the necessity of further research). We need to enrich it with (i) sequential composition of (reflective) a-lenses so that a category of a-lenses could be built, and (ii) a relational composition of symmetric lenses sharing several of their feet (similar to relational join). It is also important to investigate composition with weaker junction conditions than we considered. Another important issue is invertibility, which nicely fits in some but not all of our results, which shows the necessity of further investigation. It is a sign that we do not well understand the nature of invertibility. We conjecture that while invertibility is essential for bx, its role for mx may be less important. The (in)famous PutPut law is also awaiting its exploration in the case of multiary reflective propagation. And the last but not the least is the (in)famous PutPut law: how well our update propagation operations are compatible with update composition is a very important issue to explore.

(Volume 4.0),"assess the impact that these problems can have on software development activities.â Although the statement was intended for scenarios with unintended security holes and where the perpetrator is a third party, it does shed light on the extent to which software development processes and quality assurance are promising places to look for solutions to the problem of untrusted equipment vendors and system integrators. If these tools and methods are inadequate to help the developers themselves find unintended security holes, they are probably be a far cry from helping people outside of the development team to find intentional and obfuscated security holes left there by a dishonest product developer. The findings in this chapter confirm the above observation. We have covered the concepts of development processes, quality models, and quality management and have found that they relate too indirectly to the code that runs on the machine to qualify as adequate entry points in the verification of absence from deliberately inserted malware. The field of software quality metrics in some aspects directly relates to the source code but, unfortunately, it is doubtful that all aspects of security are measurable. In addition, counting the number of bugs found has still not given us bug-free software; thus, it is not likely that counting security flaws will provide any guidance in finding deliberately inserted malware. Methods that go deep into the code running on the machine include testing, code reviews, and formal methods. In the present state of the art, formal methods do not scale to the program sizes we require, code review is error prone and too timeconsuming to be watertight, and testing has limited value because of the problem of hitting the right test vector that triggers the malicious behaviour. Even when triggered, recognizing the malicious behaviour may be highly nontrivial. It is clear that these methods still leave ample space for dishonest equipment providers to insert unwanted functionality without any real danger of being exposed. Although these approaches still fall far short of solving our problem, they remain a viable starting point for research on the topic. In particular, we hope that, at some time in the future, the combination of formal methods, careful binary code review, and testing will increase to a significant level the risk of being exposed if you include malware in your products. However, we have a long way to go and a great deal of research must be done before that point is reached."

The government distributes an English translation of the Labour Law, but concerning the rule that employers are not allowed to take away domestic workersâ passports, the Saudi Deputy Minister of Labour, for instance, stated: âIf the law is not imposed, it is not the fault of the Ministryâ and âItâs not our responsibility to make sure that the employers knowâ. In response to the suggestion that they set up a website with all Saudi laws in Arabic and English, an interviewee at the Saudi Human Rights Commission stated, âNo, if we tell them all immediately about all the rights they have, it will be a disasterâ. Other wellknown rules are simply not applied. Many migrants are sentenced to punishments of 3,000 or even 10,000 lashes for zina, or extramarital sex, even though Sharia prescribes a maximum of 100 lashes."

Secondly, asking questions that prompted communities to think about what it means to be more resilient, is not only a way to ascertain how the project has helped improve understanding, but is also key to enabling this resilience. And thirdly, by asking communities âwhat else is needed?â beyond project activities to date helps to inform the details of subsequent activities, and also helps to inform how and what changes to look out for as measures of community-defined success. This example also illustrates that there are practical limits to the âidealâ evaluation process but that it is possible to usefully draw on key principles to inform the approach to evaluating a CCA practice. There were practical limits to full application of a right-based approach, and the extent to which children themselves are included in the development of the approach and the analysis and articulation of learnings. There were also limits to what âcan be known or found outâ through an evaluation about causal relationships between activities and outcomes, when there are a myriad of interacting factors at play. It was nevertheless particularly useful to use the projectâs general theory of change to guide the evaluation, but allowing flexibility for the specific links and relationships â such as how knowledge, combined with formal and informal communication activities would assist communities to advocate for change and influence practice and policy â would emerge. In practice, we developed strong team and organisational partnerships between the NGOs and research organisations involved in the evaluation and the project, which proved particularly valuable given the type of project and the project context. Whilst not âdevelopmental evaluationâ to its full extent â researchers were not embedded in the team on a continuous basis â the approach was far from the âconventionalâ end of the research spectrum where external groups of academic researchers seek out an existing applied project in order to test or calibrate a model or theory. The process involved joint learning and reflection from both implementing and research organisations throughout the project. The project was adjusted in real time to integrate lessons learned from the evaluative research; concurrently, the evaluative approach itself evolved to reflect lessons from the projectâs activities on the ground. Embedding research within practice â in the inherently uncertain context of supporting a community to adapt to climate change â provided new pathways for realising and sharing learnings from the ground, to achieve better adaptation outcomes.

Within those regulations lies a subordinate set aimed at curtailing foreign funding oriented toward changes in individual rights, freedom of speech, and political engagement. The governments in question find this outside involvement an infringement of authority, and they have little or no interest in permitting foreign organizations to meddle with official aims. The second category includes policies aimed at increasing local philanthropy, particularly when it is in line with the governmentâs agenda, and the third set is of laws endeavoring to create more transparency and accountability. On this last count, many governments are aware that if the trust deficit can be mitigated, increased local giving could result. This chapter examines the policies governing civil society in each of these three categories. The definition of civil society is difficult to pin down. In fact, in 2001, the BBC stated, âThe paradox about civil society is that it covers a vast range of activitiesâyet itâs very hard to define.â In an attempt to address this difficulty, the BBC produced a 12-part series called What Is Civil Society?1 Despite this noble effort, the definition still evades us, although we can all agree that facets, goals, and operating norms of civil society differ across cultural contexts. The details give context to the current legal changes in Asia. Civil society is often thought of as the voice and actions of the people, instead of that of companies and of the government. In the Western context, it is considered a basic tenet of a pluralistic society. While not necessarily the case, the term is often used as a contrarian voice against the government and the private sector. Civil society tends to focus on human rights and social justice. Civic engagement is a different story. Civic engagement is the way in which ordinary people can participate in helping their communities and countries, and the term does not carry an antagonistic connotation. Although civic engagement can utilize both political and non-political processes, it is not about pluralism as an endgame but of the human tendency to help one another. But the distinction can become complex. Many efforts start off as engagement only to become advocacy, and vice-versa. It often becomes clear to those trying to solve a problem that systemic change must include the government, and sometimes that implies the government must also change. Over the past decade, we can see a trend in Asia to channel energy into civic engagement while trying, at times with great conviction, to curtail the growth of civil society.

14,285,0.989,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"Emerging Strategies and Paradigm Practices of childhood in different social ï¬elds and negotiation of identity are far from trivial. Our ï¬ndings show how many paradoxical ways of negotiating identity exist in everyday life among children of mixed parentage. The participants negotiate identity by combining various approaches, such as âhaving both feet in both campsâ and practicing situational ethnicity, choosing only one group or simply going beyond any categories in various contexts. Some reject describing themselves with a limited category. They seem to require a new category of their own that expresses having an in-between âmixedâ status. They contest the current categories and challenge this limited way of thinking, which hardly reflects real life. One participant stands out, as he simply declares himself a multi-cultural cosmopolitan and rejects narrow labels. Even the participant who declares herself to be Danish indicates a simultaneously positive awareness of multiple belongings. Our data shows that the participants overall construct their identity based on different negotiating strategies in everyday life (Root 1996). Our theoretical understanding takes into consideration the context and the realities of society which shape the identity of the child and enables us to show how interaction with parents, peers, siblings, and community are important factors in shaping an individualâs life. Along with examining the context, the theory places human existence in a speciï¬c historical time and space; the child can construct changeable identities while adjusting to a speciï¬c social environment. The three strategies mentioned in the theoretical framework bring into focus the changeable aspects of different contexts, as identity is understood as a constantly changing phenomenon throughout life. Such a multi-dimensional model gives an opportunity to have more memberships and multiple identities with different groups (Root 1992, 6; Spickard 1992, 22). In fact, today a child of mixed parentage can choose to embrace some or all aspects of his identity, although within societal constraints (Spickard 1992, 21â22). In this way, social ambiguity and fluid identities are seen as possible ways of viewing oneself as deï¬ned and united. The participantsâ narratives demonstrate that you can belong to multiple cultures. They see it as a strength and advantage, despite clear disadvantages. This notion challenges the simpliï¬ed perception of belonging to just one group, a contrast to the historical perception of mixedness as pathologized (described in the beginning of the chapter). In fact, the childrenâs self-narratives and identities are much more dynamic, having their own complex nature. Although most of the participants are proud of their mixed origin, they also report having suffered from discrimination and bullying. There is a big gap between how they see themselves and how the world views them due to continued ignoring of mixedness at the societal level. As there is no policy focus on the impact of mixedness in the educational and social"

93,96,0.989,Nordic Mediation Research,"âImplementation â how great expectations in Washington are dashed in Oaklandâ starts the title of the classic book by Jeffrey Pressman and Aaron Wildavsky (1984). They point to the problematic nature of and difï¬culties in promoting change and development: the reluctance of organisations to approve intended change and adopt new practices, as well as the failings of or alteration to planned changes. Is change something that can be adopted from above or does it have to be generated from within? Is it once-and-for-all or a series of small improvements, and ï¬nally, is it planned or emergent? The early studies of policy implementation recognised the gap between legislative intent and bureaucratic action (Palumbo and Calista 1990; Bardach 1980; Pressman and Wildavsky 1984). Researchers tried to make sense of why the serious intents did not materialise when put into practice. The metaphor of gap between intent and outcome had its roots in a top-down model of implementation, which considered implementation to be the simple, purely technical execution of a policy makerâs or legislatorâs intention, in which the rules are implemented as they were intended (Mazmanian and Sabatier 1983). A reverse perspective on implementation started to emerge when implementation was understood as a series of change efforts that emerge from within an agency or community, drawing on local knowledge and lived experiences. According to the bottom-up model, implementation is not"

For her, the only possible escape was to find employment outside the home (Diana, born 1976, interviewed by Lambrini Styliou, 1 April 2005). Work ( puna) is an all-important part of Albanian womenâs lives. Regardless of their degree of job satisfaction, work in Greece guarantees a certain extent of autonomy that they do not have at home. Especially women from a rural background, employment in another womanâs home, in spite of the âfemaleâ character of the work, is an empowering experience (Kofman et al. 2000, p. 123). For village women who used to work in the fields, work back home did not count as work, as it was considered to be part of their domestic chores. Domestic work is transformed into remunerated labour in Greece with fixed working hours and wages.17 In their narratives, it is not working skills or pride that appear as core values, but money. It is their money which they can spend according to their own criteria and which allows them to free themselves from the moral standards of their village community, for example, by buying modern, âfeminineâ clothes. In this sense, they considerably value the working experience. In contrast, educated urban women who exercised a profession in Albania view their work in Greece as a downgrading and humiliating experience. They feel trapped in a closed labour market that does not offer them opportunities to practise their skills, owing to the ethnic division of labour. Their narratives convey a strong sense of insecurity, which is linked to the impossibility of their joining the Greek health insurance system independently and thereby obtaining an autonomous residence permit. Therefore, they remain legally dependent on their husbands. Yet even for these educated women, waged labour remains a major pathway to independence and to self-respect. Andrina, who studied economics in Albania and agreed to marry a Greek man through an arranged marriage (they met for the first time at the border), criticized her own decision to marry a man she did not love in order to settle down and become a housewife: I got fed up with being a housewife.â¦ I said to myself, my life is not only to wash up the dishes, to cook the meal. I had other interests, about society. I got involved with educational programmes, with womenâs associations. But most of all I wanted to work, to be independent. And that is what I tell other women. Donât seek a âconvenientâ marriage. Try to find a job first, to be independent and then you can decide to marry.

188,126,0.989,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Guidance and Recommendation Strategies Guidance for learning in the context of PLEs depends on the situation and on who is providing the guidance. Learners can learn in a blended learning situation with teachers structuring the learning process. Peers can be involved in the learning process, if learners collaborate in some way. Learners can also learn on their own without human interaction. In the first case, teachers can provide guidance. In the second case, peers can provide guidance either directly or indirectly (e.g., with peers attempting to master a problem together). In all cases, guidance can also be provided by the system through personalized recommendations. Moreover, the scope of guidance can focus on a variety of things, including the search for learning resources (e.g., widgets, content, or peers), the composition of a PLE, the control over the learning process, and the improvement of self-regulation ability. Evaluating the effectiveness and appropriateness of such guidance strategies requires looking into its preconditions: the given abilities of learners are relevant, since it depends largely on concrete skills of learners, what they can do on their own and where they need help."

Further, this behavior leads to individually varied driving behavior.

In this kind of new capitalism, there is an anxiety about the instrumentalization and commodification of friendship relations. The anxiety of French businessmen about the possible instrumental motivations behind a dinner invitation by a friend seems to be, however, very different from the cases from the Russian data we have described above.

Even ifâand the examples at the beginning show this quite wellâsocial media are an integral part of the organizationâs media ensemble within a translocal, globalized scope (a very âdeepâ degree of mediatization), within the much more local scope of the parishes, the organizations can show resistance to media change at the same time (a much âless deepâ degree of mediatization). And furthermore, it seems that for both scopes there are different requirements for integrating digital media on the part of the religious authorities. New possibilities for media use are not always chosen. Therefore, while the term mediatization grasps manifold interrelations between the change of media and communication on the one hand, and the changes in culture and society on the other, we also should take contrary movements into consideration when analyzing this process (cf. Hepp and RÃ¶ser 2014: 165). By distinguishing a translocal and local scope, on the one hand and different forms of authority constructions on the other, we are able to critically analyze that the organization of the Catholic Church transforms in a more differentiated way when it comes to media: as other research shows, there are, for example, tendencies of âbrandingâ and âprofessionalizationâ on a translocal level. Locally, however, we can observe quite different processes: a reluctant appropriation of the organizationâs media ensemble by the local authorities even though mediarelated communication is considered as necessary for translocal authority figures such as the pope or bishops. Regarding the religious organization, we can observe a tension between a âdeepâ degree of mediatization in regard to a translocal scope in contrast to a âless deepâ degree of mediatization within a local scope. An interesting follow-up question and part of our own future research is how such different degrees of mediatization produce different tempi of transformations: a slower transformation process on a local level in contrast to a faster transformation process on a translocal level, the tensions that emerge and the negotiations that have to be madeânot only between translocal and local, but between different localities worldwide."

The fact that these schools will be an exception and not the norm points to the fact that it is after all only the elite who are being fostered. Finally, indicating that they may even be exempt from national curriculum restrictions, meaning they are stepping outside the norm in terms of what they offer, reflects the extent of the restriction that the present curriculum poses. Surely, if the goal was to foster Japanese with global competencies, then such options should be the norm offered to all the population. Furthermore, there is no public discussion about the role of languages other than English in the national curriculum, even though Japanese society today is far from the monolingual one it portrays itself as (Lie, 2004; Maher & Yashiro, 1995). 11.5.1 Aiming for the top: Global jinzai and university reform? If we examine the action plans towards creating such global talent, as laid out by MEXT in its recently published proposals for reforming universities in order to make them âan engine for social changeâ (MEXT, 2012, p. 11), there are in fact scant references to the issue of global jinzai. Five goals and two plans are listed, the majority of which are aimed at institutional change, and this, again, probably ultimately reflects MEXTâs real motive behind the debate on global jinzai.3 Radically trying to change Japanâs universities by first raising public and business awareness of the gap between present and desired higher education is an effective tool, followed by incentives to change. The results to date, however, have been far from stunning. The much heralded âGlobal 30â4 presently number only 13, and other than these, most universities are either struggling or see little incentive to radically internationalize their campuses other than the usual cosmetic changes. In reality, even a full implementation of the proposals that MEXT is suggesting is hardly likely to lead to any significant advance in overall standings of Japanâs higher educational institutions on any global index. Further, it is unrealistic to expect universities to shoulder the burden of creating such future labor alone. It requires a concerted change in the compulsory education curriculum in general, greater emphasis on career education and more system-wide flexibility. In order for global jinzai to become a driving force for educational reform at the top, changes are required, particularly in terms of educational quality, content, and the system itself. Firstly, faculty must themselves become more âglobally competent,â experienced, or at the very least, inclined."
229,197,0.989,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"that their craft should be considered a noble profession, equal to that practised by university-educated physicians. Surgeons who dwelt on the technical improvement of cancer surgeries clearly believed that in the long term, operative advancements could benefit both practitioners and patients. For the individual sufferer, however, this âlong viewâ could reach unsettling extremes, allowing surgeons to ignore the suffering of individual patients in the service of curiosity, learning or fame. Notably, in scholarship on early modern dissection and vivisection, Sawday, French and Egmond have all noted an imaginative connection between these occupations and that of the surgeon. Concomitant with the intense interest in dissection and anatomy during the early modern period, they argue, was a suspicion that living humans might be next under the curious anatomistâs hand.72 For instance, citing Edward Ravencroftâs The Anatomist (1697) and Thomas Nasheâs The Unfortunate Traveller (1594) as examples, Sawday contends that the idea of a living anatomy possessed a peculiarly compelling horror for early modern dramatists, and that â[i]magining oneâs own dissection was a device unique to early-modern cultureâ.73 It is by no means certain that this fear was unfounded. Egmond mentions âsome evidence of vivisection on human beingsâ, while French notes that â[r]umour ... had it that at least two Renaissance anatomists succumbed to temptation and ventured into human vivisectionâ.74 As Richard Sugg observes: âAvailable data indicates that almost no one was prepared to advocate human vivisection during the Renaissance. By contrast, however ... various figures seemed ready to believe that the practice might be carried out by their contemporariesâ.75 Moreover, it was seemingly accepted that if anyone was to venture into vivisection, it would be surgeons, rather than physicians. First published in 1605, Michael Draytonâs âSonnet 50â vividly imagined that âin some countries, far remote from henceâ, condemned criminals might be used as experimental subjects by surgeons, who would First make incision on each mastering vein Then staunch the bleeding, then transpierce the corse, And with their balms recure the wounds again Then poison, and with physic him restore Not that they fear the hopeless man to kill But their experience to increase the more.

180,49,0.989,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"rules of social interaction such as treating people fairly, doing them no harm, or respecting their rights. Rights often are said to stand in reciprocal relation to duties. Thus, the right to free speech presupposes a duty to respect the right of others to speak or the public health obligation to ensure conditions for maintaining health presupposes a right to health. Deontology as a theory owes most to Immanuel Kantâs view of the âgood willâ and his closely linked account of autonomy. A person of morally good will does the right thing for its own sake, which means acting purely for the sake of duty. Duties are moral rules or laws that bind the will and limit the scope of action. For Kant, basing decision for oneâs action solely on duty without regard to the potential good or bad consequences of the action is the only legitimate basis for moral action. Kant even goes so far as to say that âa free will and a will under moral laws are one and the sameâ (Gregor et al. 2012). Kant conceives duty as the quintessential expression of autonomy, which may come as a surprise to those who equate autonomy with rational free choice or even just following oneâs preferences without interference. However, the meaning of autonomy for Kant derives from its literal meaning in Greek, autos (self) and nomos (law); namely, self-legislating. Autonomy enacts from within the moral rules and principles that bind the will and guide action. However, not every self-originating impulse should be obeyed; only actions conceivable as universal laws morally bind the will. Morally laying down the law for oneself entails legislating for everyone, but universally legislating does not mean asserting oneâs will over others. Nor does it mean that the ethical content of a moral law or duty is valid eternally and everywhere. Rather, it refers to the âcategorical imperativeâ an unconditional requirement for an action to be moral. To qualify as a duty, a rule that commands action must apply to every rational person. Stealing, for example, could never qualify as a duty, because a situation where everyone steals from everyone else would undercut the one-sided advantage of stealing that the thief hopes to exploit. Although selfdirected, autonomous action is necessarily other-regarding. Kant maintains that the categorical imperative can be expressed in two other ways equivalent to universality, namely, ârespect for humanityâ and a âkingdom of endsâ (Gregor et al. 2012). In each, this other-regarding dimension of autonomy is evident. Respecting humanity means never treating persons as mere means or objects but always treating them as ends, that is, regarding them as fellow autonomous agents. Autonomously agreeing on actions, interventions, or policies requires that decision makers mutually consider and understand their reasons for action and be willing to abide by the rules derived from these reasons as laws they collectively impose upon themselves (OâNeill 2002). The idea of a fellowship of mutual consideration comes out most clearly in Kantâs concept of a kingdom of ends. This concept is really the ideal of a systematic union or commonwealth of autonomous individuals making laws that apply to everyone. This ideal presupposes that ethical deliberation places respect for others as ends, as autonomous agents, above self-interest. The core idea is that we only consider actions that could gain acceptance by a community in which all see themselves as sovereigns who lay down universal laws binding on themselves and others."

Indeed, in Arrowsmith, bacteriology is presented as an infectious affliction, spreading from the laboratories of Pasteur and Koch into the United States, with researchers such as Gottlieb as carriers or vectors.8 As Freud argues in Group psychology and the analysis of the ego, there is a strong desire in infected individuals to confer their infection to others, for why should they alone be excluded from the benefits of social life and condemned to an ascetic existence of toil and hardship (p. 134)?

Instead of surrender, paralysis, and frustration, Ndemo went on and brought forth, in his chapter on Kenyaâs policy arena, an example of how entrepreneuringâseeking out ways to actively overcome and remove perceived constraintsâcould set free new possibilities and opportunities. In fact, his entrepreneurial approach during his time as permanent secretary for Kenyaâs Ministry of Information and Communication proved to be pivotal in connecting Kenya to the global optical-fiber grid. In a similar vein, Weiss and Weberâs chapter demonstrated that, in order to see the abundant resources in an environment, an open and mindful mindset is needed that gauges tension and contestation as spaces of opportunity. In particular, in todayâs globalized economy, a global mindset is a key asset for working through challenges and realizing new, global opportunities (Gupta and Govindarajan 2002). The logical consequence is clear, namely that initiatives are needed that take as their starting point the unique societal, communal, and individual conditions of African citizens in order to bring forth projects that can unleash a profound mindset shift. Whether these are from the private sector, government, or civil society, existing initiatives need to be strengthened further, and new initiatives should be developed. In particular, initiatives that extend their work to rural citizens and the poor can help ensure that their pivotal work will be of benefit to the many rather than just the few. Our conversation with Ory Okolloh reemphasized the significance of the links between government, the private sector, and civil society. While common wisdom favors a culture to operate outside the purview of governmentâstaying under the radarâOkolloh pushed back and brought the government back in. Hence, entrepreneuring does not"
78,415,0.989,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"One particular incidence makes up the main background for the argument to be presented below. On July 22 in 2011 Norway faced a tragedy of enormous dimensions. The right winged terrorist Anders Behring Breivik bombed the governmental building in Oslo, the capitol of Norway, and later the same day he cold-bloodedly killed 77 youth of the Norwegian Labour party who attended a summer camp on a small island outside Oslo. In the aftermath it was much debated in the medias how he could possibly be able to carry out this misdeed. We shall leave out all practical aspects here and rather concentrate on one particular moral issue, having to do with toleration. More specifically I shall frame this as a question whether we could possibly tolerate the political opinion upon which this action was based. Breivikâs opinions had been presented in a Manifesto online long before July 22. The author here laid out a conspiracy theory about the threat from inferior races against Arian and European people, and seriously discusses how to solve this problem. Much of his speech is right wing propaganda, presented in a quasi-dialogic form where Breivik interviews himself. Part of the story is his claim that he represents an Heraldic Order lead by himself. Without getting into further details I shall describe this Manifesto as employing fictitious use of reason. One of the issues in the trial was whether there had ever been others but the author himself being a member of this Order. Few believe that there are. For the sake of argument we shall assume that the whole story was fictionalâthere had never been any real public. The main issue is then whether it makes a difference if the public is fictitious, as in Breivikâs case, or rather a real public in the sense of consisting of a certain amount of people. I believe it is not. The most important criterion of the fictitious character is not the amount of participants, but rather the use of reason involved. Thus, the difference between the real and the fictitious is procedurally defined."

Ben is concerned that since his return to work his relationship with his daughter changed. From the points of view of Paul, Guy and Ralf, it is part-time work that really makes a difference for their father-child relationship. Finally, some fathers (Daniel, Jules, Paul and Tim) consider that the leave did not play a primary role in the father-child relation. They argue they would have found other ways to bond if they had not taken a leave, as being an involved father was a strong desire."

No attempts are made to question the underlying epistemological biases of this logic or, put more simply, the fact that metrics have never worked and never will capture the âproblems and solutionsâ facing health systems in LMICs (or indeed the UK). Fundamentally, we are suffering from a form of myopia generated by the domination of medical science perspectives or knowledge paradigms which determine the diagnoses, the interventions and epistemological approaches to evaluation. The quest for statistical outcomes (ideally gained through the gold standard of randomised controlled trials) underpinned by the narrowing blinkers of systematic review restricts our ability to understand social processes. There is also a tendency within this paradigm to pathologise or patronise individuals whilst failing to understand the impact of structural constraints. Despite growing recognition of the importance of context, this is often in the form of lip service at best acknowledging it as a cluster of variables that we donât understand (as external ânoiseâ) or, at worst, rather than understanding and capturing its iterative quality, trying to insulate our interventions from it through vain or inappropriate attempts to control it. Trying to cleanse data through what feminist researchers have called a âsanitisation processâ (Harding 1987, 1991) will not generate cleaner facts. It will take us further away from the truth as the cleansing process strips data of its real value: of understanding the social processes that shape phenomenon. It may be that what we are swilling away in the efï¬uent is that which is of greatest value.

224,431,0.989,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Although Boserupâs work has been praised, some scientists have criticised her articles and rejected her theoretical approaches (Beneria and Sen 1981). She has even been condemned for using a terminology that belongs to the colonial era of Western domination (McCune 2006). I do think that from todayâs perspective, terms such as âunderdeveloped countriesâ, âprimitive societiesâ, and âprimitive techniquesâ, as used by Boserup, are controversial. They sound strange and outdated. They are no longer applicable because they belong to the periods of colonial history and Western hegemony. However, such ideas might still exist because even the use of âdeveloping countriesâ instead of âunderdeveloped countriesâ does not really change the concepts behind these terms. During the 1970s and 1980s, in the time of the Cold War, the West and East were seen as the âFirst Worldâ and âSecond Worldâ, respectively, whereas nonindustrialised countries were known as the âThird Worldâ. Old labels such as âunderdevelopedâ and âprimitiveâ must be avoided because of political correctness. Now we talk about the countries of the Global South and take a post-colonial approach, but I am not sure whether we have really overcome the attitudes that accompanied the former concepts.7 In the time when Boserup was actively involved in research while living in different parts of Asia and Africa during the 1950s and 1960s, the terminology was indeed different. To a certain extent, I agree with the criticism expressed by researchers"

(2005) and Buchan, Jobanputra, & Gough (2005) observe that a majority of nurses from other source countries are also inclined to target the US as a destination. It is the traditional destination for Filipinos who wish to pursue the American dream, as it has what Paul (2011) calls âplace reputation.â In addition, the Philippine nursing curriculum is patterned after that of the US, so less adjustment is required in the workplace. A very large Filipino community is also available to support newly arrived nurses. Moreover, that foreign nurses can have varied career options and a clear career pathway in the US contributes to its popularity as a final destination. In a telephone conversation with a Filipino nurse based in Maryland in June 2012, he noted, âwhile in other countries, there are very few options for nurses, especially Filipino nurses, in the United States there is career development or job promotion. â¦ Here in the US, if you really work hard, you get recognized, you get promoted, you get compensated, kahit sino ka pa [whoever you are].â Filipino nurses in the US not only find opportunities to work in hospitals, but also in other fields such as home nursing care, medical insurance, and nursing-related businesses. They have assumed important positions where they work, such as vicepresident of a health care company or head nurse in a hospital. This study also showed that, in addition to the US, Australia was the other country most preferred by respondents. There are several reasons why Filipino nurses want to remain there for long periods. Australia offers one of the highest salaries and best benefit schemes, such as six weeksâ annual leave, among the destinations. Opportunities for career growth, citizenship, and family reunification are good, and Australia appeals to personal preferences such as the less severe weather and shorter distance"
39,32,0.989,"a History of Force Feeding : Hunger Strikes, Prisons and Medical Ethics, 1909-1974","male and female bodies, British and Irish bodies, politicised and convict bodies, wartime and peacetime bodies. The omnipresent similarity of debate means that historical analysis of force-feeding can be used to shed light on recurrent ethical problems. In adopting an approach that aims to speak to present-day concerns, this study draws upon the ideas of historians including Sarah Ferber and Duncan Wilson who have called for a greater integration of historical analysis and bioethical research. In Bioethics in Historical Perspective, Ferber suggests that history can be thought about in relation to medical ethics in meaningful ways. Knowledge of ideas and events which still bear on the conduct of medicine could be used to contribute to medical policy and practice. Historical reflection on medical ethics, Ferber maintains, can help to find answers to immediate policy issues while also examining how questions about medical practice and policy were posed in the first place.79 It is unlikely that history will always provide firm answers, but it could encourage bioethicists to ask the right questions in the first place by demonstrating how moral positions are rooted in specific socio-cultural and historical contexts.80 Strengthening this line of thought, Wilson points out that historians of medicine are conspicuously absent from the interdisciplinary field of bioethics (which is comprised of professionals including doctors, sociologists, and ethicists). Wilson argues that historians need to overcome their long-standing scepticism towards bioethics and view it instead as an interdisciplinary meeting-ground where historical perspectives could productively contribute. The history of medical ethics, Wilson maintains, does not necessarily have to involve radically critiquing dubious aspects of medical history.81 This study by no means seeks to add to the sensationalistic trend of writing shocking exposÃ©s of the medical past. Accordingly, it refrains from depicting prison doctors simply as brutal torturers intent on shoving stomach tubes deep into the bodies of defenceless suffragettes and Irish republicans. Instead, it offers a more nuanced, reflective, account of prison medical practice and prisoner experiences. For instance, it examines how prison doctors navigated the ethical problems that surrounded forcefeeding; the ways in which the bodies of hunger strikers were monitored, regulated, and cared for; and the diversity of opinion (even within the medical profession) on the need to feed prisoners against their will. Each chapter focuses on a particular aspect of force-feeding. Combined, the chapters provide a broadly chronological account of force-feeding as it took place across the British Isles. Chapter 2 asks: How and why did"
183,113,0.989,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"6.3 Problem Description The poverty experienced by these communities has left the members with low selfesteem. This is because they are unable to meet their basic needs. This population also lacks life skills that would enable them to meet their needs and perform their duties to the optimal capacity. This deprivation has led them to believe that they do not measure up to others who meet their family needs and lead quality lives. Educational underachievement occurs in every school in South Africa. It is caused by various factors and although it has negative consequences for the individual, the school, the community and the country as a whole, teachers and parents tend to simplify the problem by ascribing it to the âlaziness and stupidityâ of the learners. This problem is emphasised in the Northern Areas of Port Elizabeth. An area challenged by severe social problems including poor health, substance abuse, domestic violence, gang fighting and teenage pregnancies. There is currently a big discrepancy in the number of children from the Northern Areas, starting school and those finishing grade twelve. The learners from the Northern Areas are academically underachieving. This is a problem because academic underachievement contributes to a vicious cycle of failure, behavioural problems, school dropout, unemployment, overcrowding, social problems and a general feeling of worthlessness. Children from an early age on a daily basis use drugs. There is a need to understand what will empower the youth to drive change. In a society where people fear for their lives on a daily basis, there is a need to investigate other means of driving change. Currently, the social disconnect in the Northern Areas necessitates alternate forms of communication and support towards change."

169,460,0.989,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The importance of goals and mental models to decision-making becomes clear if the AM cycle is expanded to try to account for the complexity of the policy world (Fig. 16.3). In the assessment phase, all factors in Fig. 16.2 are used to deï¬ne the problem (usually as a trend) and the pattern of likely causes. From the outset this is complicated by the fact that the nature of the problem itself is in question. Problems may have multiple interpretations, based on conï¬icting values and goals (Weick 1995). Even if the basis of a problem is relatively simple and clear, the goals and mental models of individuals and of the surrounding culture and politics will dominate how it is deï¬ned and interpreted. This is because goals and mental models act like a ï¬lter that determines what information is selected and how it is measured in evaluating policy performance or in decisions as to how policy is implemented. One example of this is the physics of increasing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is not complex. It can only cause more heat to be retained, and this reliably predicts why the years since 2000 have exhibited the hottest atmospheric temperatures ever measured. Yet many deny the evidence (that climate change exists at all) or the theory that society is driving it by generating more greenhouse gases. Political conservatives, who often ascribe to hierarchist or individualist paradigms, tend to deny climate change theory or evidence. Political liberals, who tend to subscribe to paradigms centered on community (communitarian) and social equality (egalitarian), tend to accept the science supporting climate change theory (Kahan 2008, 2013). However, both conservatives and liberals are equally likely to interpret data ideologically. There is a third, social and political, aspect involved. As Kahan (2013) concludes: â. . .ideologically motivated cognition . . .[is] a form of information processing that promotes individualsâ interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important afï¬nity groups.â Thus, while the perceived political and economic consequences of climate"

383,46,0.988,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"The description and measurement of risk is about developing an understanding of the risk. It can be done qualitatively or quantitatively. The quantitative risk analysis (QRA) is also called probabilistic risk analysis (PRA). Formally, in a risk analysis, we are attempting to envision how the future will turn out if the decision maker undertakes a certain course of action (or inaction). The risk analysis answers the following four questions: â¢ What can happen? What can go wrong? What can go well? Can we create a list of all outcomes that can happen? What are the positive outcomes and negative outcomes? â¢ For each outcome, if it does happen, what are the consequences? What are the benefits or losses for each stakeholder? Some consequences can be small, some large. For example, an earthquake can have catastrophic consequences albeit with a small probability. Some consequences can be positive, some negative. How outcomes link to consequences? This may not be known fully, so a statistical analysis of causes may be done, or experts can be called for their opinion. Who are the stakeholders, i.e. people affected by outcomes? In the example of Janette getting a job, she is a stakeholder, additionally, her parents are stakeholders because if she gets a well-paid job, her parents do not need to support her as much or at all. Each stakeholder has some attitude toward each consequence; in future, we will call such attitudes the utilities. â¢ How likely is each outcome to happen? What is the likelihood or probability of the wrong outcome happening? What is the probability of a positive outcome? Some probabilities can be large, some very little. Is probability a useful way to measure uncertainty? There are other measures that we will learn later. â¢ What is the strength of knowledge that we have? What do we use to calculate the probabilities of events? Do we use past data or expert knowledge? Do we trust the expert(s)? Are data relevant? Do we have enough data? Are data noisy?

299,498,0.988,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"One major place where the study of bioethics and social justice converge is in examining the normative criteria according to which scarce resources are allocated. For instance, when triage takes place, rationing is called for, and the argument is advanced that after a certain age, senior citizens should be granted only ameliorative care. Here the focus is on questions raised in the United States, as well as in several other countries in the wake of the 2008â2009 great recession, by fears that the economy will continue to grow slowly and suffer from high levels of debt and a high rate of unemployment. Various public efforts were launched to reduce public outlays in general and those set aside for Medicare and Medicaid in particular. Indeed, it was argued that because âentitlementsâ command about 60% of the federal budget, and given that a good part of the remaining 40% is dedicated to defense and interest that must be paid, unless entitlementsâand especially Medicaid and Medicareâwere cut, it would be impossible for the United States to âput its fiscal house in order.â Both legislators and media mavens argued that cutting into the social safety net was not merely necessary to reduce the deficit, but that it was mathematically inevitable. As Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) put it, âWe canât solve our budget crisis without dealing with our entitlementsâ (NPR 2010). The âinevitableâ need to cut into social safety nets is inevitable only if one refuses to collect additional revenues, such as through a carbon emissions tax, capand-trade system, or value-added tax. To give but one example, a carbon emissions tax of $10 per ton of carbon content could generate $50 billion a year and generate several other desirable outcomes. Whether or not one agrees with such revenue generating moves, they demonstrate that cutting entitlements is a matter of choice, not a mathematical necessity. The normative case for social safety nets is often made on social justice grounds. These programs have lifted millions of Americans out of poverty, more than all other federal programs combined, and they transfer a modest amount of resources from more affluent Americans to those less endowed. They are also defended on social contract grounds. Senior citizens and those late in their careers have planned their whole lives around the assumption that the safety nets they paid into would be there when they retired or became infirm. To violate this contract is manifestly unfair. There is another moral argument to consider. If we must make cuts, we ought to first cut those budget items that in effect pay for harmful activities and then those without any discernable social benefits, before we even consider touching those that are beneficialâeven if the benefits are limited and their costs are high. This is a sociological version of the medieval medical aphorism: first, do no harm."
124,190,0.988,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"From that point of view, distinct branching time models represent genuinely different ways a world might be, each with its own branching structure, its own histories, its own internal possibilities. These pastwards-connected branching time modelsâ Belnapian worlds, as we may call them8 âwill be in some respects much like the possibilities represented by the Kripkean worlds of normal systems of modal logic. They will differ from such worlds in at least two respects, however. First, of course, each Belnapian world has a rich internal structure which Kripkean worlds lack. But also, these Belnapian worlds are isolated from one another in separate models, whereas Kripkean worlds coexist within the same model. Accordingly, we might recognize the possibilities internal to a Belnapian world as real possibilities (relative to that world) and recognize the possibilities represented by the availability of other models as merely nominal possibilitiesâother ways the language might have been given application. We will examine this thought again in Sect. 7. At this level, the problem of trans-world identity might be thought to surface again, but our having noted that there is no special problem of trans-history identity within a branching time structure can be the occasion for reconsidering the role different worlds play. If different Belnapian worlds only appear in different models, i.e. if we impose on models the requirement of historical connection, then perhaps we can profit from some reflection on the general nature of formal models, examining the comparative role of different models, and therefore of different Belnapian worlds. So at the risk of being pedantic, let us review the basic features of models."

Thatâs just pragmatism speaking.â A dean interviewed by Cassuto speculated that tenure committees, deans and provosts would be âmore flexible than most might assumeâ but that âthe real conservatism on these questions comes from faculty who are afraid of looking too different from their peersâ.10 However, Sam Burridge was amazed to see how academics reacted to the launch of Palgrave Pivot. She said: âAuthors have responded incredibly positively. In the 18 years Iâve been in publishing Iâve never been involved in a product with such a positive response ... I donât normally get authors emailing me directly, praising us as a publisher.â The hundreds of books published since then attests to that.11 Recently, Goldsmiths University Press was launched in tandem with an invitation for academics to submit proposals for short or mid-length monographs, as well as short book and pamphlet series. Press director Sarah Kember told The Bookseller that the Press sought âthought-inaction, provisional or process-capturing workâ such as briefs, scripts, blogs, storyboards, notebooks, essays, clips, and previews.12 It is also interested in non-standard modes and forms of communication, such as an article in the form of a comic or graphic novel. Indeed, the market for mid-length research seems to be going from strength to strength. There are also now Stanford Briefs, an imprint from Stanford University Press, running at 20,000 to 40,000 words in length. They publish bite-sized original research in essay format, but aimed at a wider, more popular audience (as are Sage Swifts and Policy Press Shorts). In 2013, Palgrave Pivot introduced an Open Access option for authors who wish for their work to be freely accessible and shareable at point of publication.

Real-world (financial) markets do not function as standard economics textbooks suggest. They invite exploitation and other forms of unethical behavior and lead to exclusion and discrimination. Policy interventions (regulation, state banks, etc.) cannot compensate this âmarket cum policy failureâ, leading to a void which needs to be, and can be, filled by âValues 2â in the forms of personal integrity, professional ethics, etc. The debate about the role of ethics in general banking and finance after the financial crisis has made this point sufficiently clear: Profit making without ethical restraint has done damage, and even the largest investment bank of this world, such as Deutsche Bank, are now trying to revive their corporate culture in a way that puts more emphasis on responsible client service, transparency and fairness, not least because this would be good for the banks itself. This applies even more so to development finance, MF and small business finance (henceforth SBF). Endeavors in these fields have always been inspired by the idea that unrestricted markets do not function as one would hope and that therefore some intervention is required that is itself guided by Value 2 considerations.32 These considerations are based on value judgments and beliefs that x opportunities should be distributed equitably, x poor people and those excluded from access to finance need support; x better access to finance fosters economic growth and broad based development and ultimately also democracy and peace; and that in most cases, x host-country authorities do not support broad based finance enough. As I have argued above, in order to be effective, MF and SBF require the existence of solid and stable institutions. In order to be effective for a long time, these institutions must follow a commercial approach. If they are not profitable they cannot survive and grow and create âValue 1â for anybody. But there is the danger that the commercial approach can go too far. The economically sound and ethically legitimate aim of making a profit or, in other words, to cover their full cost including the cost of equity, may suggest profit maximizing behavior. However, outright profit maximization would be contrary to the logic why MF and SBF are created in the first place, since all profit maximizing financial institutions tend to discriminate, exploit etc if they have the opportunity to do so, as the cases in Mexico and India clearly show. Therefore, it is particularly important for commercially oriented MFIs and small business banks that they are solidly based on values in the sense of Value 2. Values are an antidote to an excessive commercial orientation. Given that values are very important for sound, commercially oriented MF and SBF institutions, one needs to take a closer look at what these values and the ob32"

Moreover, as this study implies, there is a tendency that teachers âoften believe that they have little power to effect policy and do not view themselves as implementers of macro-level policiesâ (Mahboob & Tilakaratna, 2012, p. 8). Therefore, it seems urgent to equip teachers with the knowledge and skills to take part in political dialogue and discourse pertaining to education. More specifically, teachers need to acquire astute analytical skills to scrutinize the macro-structures of their educational, political context ( Johnson, 2009). Teachers also need to acquire political tactics to engage in discursive practices so as to negotiate and change realities (see Shin, 2012)."
275,37,0.988,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"The history framework of UAI is more general than MDPs in the following respects: â¢ Partially observable states. In most realistic scenarios, the most recent observation or percept does not fully reveal the current state. For example, when in the supermarket I need to remember what is currently in my fridge; nothing in the percepts of supermarket shelves provide this information.2 â¢ Infinite number of states. Another common assumption in standard RL is that the number of states is finite. This is unrealistic in the real world. The UAI framework does not require a finite state space, and UAI agents can learn without ever returning to the same state (see Sect. 2.3.2). â¢ Non-stationary environments. Standard RL typically assumes that the environment is stationary, in the sense that the transition probability P(s â² | s, a) remains constant over time. This is not always realistic.

Non-stationary environments are automatically allowed for by the general definition of a UAI environment Î¼ : (A ÃE )â ÃA  E (Definition 2). As emphasised in Chapter 11 of this book, the non-stationarity and non-ergodicity of the real world is what makes truly autonomous agents so challenging to construct and to trust. â¢ Non-stationary policies.

212,569,0.988,Life Cycle Management,"In order to effectively communicate with the different target audiences identified in Table 20.1, the life cycle community needs to agree on key messages and deliver them with a global voice, albeit adapted to local conditions. It should be noted in this context that a communication effort should focus first and foremost on decision makers in business and government to drive change. In a second step, together with successful stakeholders in the field of consumer information, the focus will need to be extended to target also the general public. In this context, bringing together the life cycle community as a clear stakeholder is critical to establishing a global voice, but the collaboration with other stakeholders is equally important in developing communication tools and capability that resonate with people outside of the LC community. It is also important to consider that communication is a two way street. Whilst the life cycle community needs to educate decision makers and the general public about the advantages and benefits of taking a life cycle perspective, communication also needs to work in the other direction. In this context it is crucial that the community is visible, approachable and receptive for feedback from different voices in society. In the end it will be important to acknowledge that if societal change is the objective, it is of utmost importance to interact closely with society. Here it will be important to proactively identify opportunities to discuss sustainability challenges and support other relevant communities and actors."

Spreadsheets is an iPhone app that promises to measure and quantify our sexual activity. Similar to one of its forerunners, Bedposted.com, its purpose is to create a log of each time you have sex, but while Bedposted.com required you to enter the information yourself (J.W. Rettberg 2014, 87â8), Spreadsheets monitors your sex life automatically. That is, Spreadsheets tracks every aspect of sex that an iPhone can automatically track when placed on a bed: frequency of thrusts, total duration of thrusting activity and the decibel levels of the participants in the act. Thatâs really all an iPhone can automatically measure about sex: motion, sound and when that motion and sound begins and ends. As Whitney Erin Boesel (2013) points out in a blog post to Cyborgology, that means that this app can only measure a very heteronormative idea of sex as thrusting penetration. The Spreadsheets app applies a technological filter to its representation of sex. The representation is constrained by what an iPhone can measure. Interestingly enough, though, the way a machine â or specifically a smartphone in the early twenty-first century â can understand or perceive sex is very close to a strong cultural understanding of sex that we are familiar with from traditional pornography. Sex seen through this cultural filter is all about thrusting hard and fast, screaming loudly DOI: 10.1057/9781137476661.0007"

In other words, I imagine that a different concept and practice of communication would have created a scenario quite different from what actually happened in the wake of 3/11. We might have witnessed a breathtaking, nationwide, coordinated emergence of individual human resources via a grassroots crisis management movement.

The governments, in turn, rely on these institutions to design and implement appropriate programmes. One of the most important actions in this programme, which has made Mexico an international model, is the National Programme for Payment of Environmental Services (PES), which covers 3.25 million Ha of forest. The ProArbol Programme establishes the principle of ï¬nancial compensation for all actions that retard deforestation and promote the recovery of forest soils. The teachings that have brought the Mexican experience into the limelight concern potentials and limits of projects that are âtruly alternativeâ, and which at some point need to rely on the stateâs capacity for action. In a way, this shows that nothing can be done without the state, but that with only state support nothing can be done at all."
275,204,0.988,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"environment makes them somewhat noisy. However, the potential noisiness in the state transitions may be greatly reduced if the agents also learn an implicit model of the other agentsâ behaviors. If they can predict how those other agents will act, they can learn to predict what effect their choice of actions will have on their next snapshot view of their world with high accuracy. Thus it is possible, in principle, for the pairing of a sufficiently powerful computational device with a sufficiently powerful learning mechanism to learn to use an egocentric view of the external state as if it were an internal state, for systems such as the Legion II game. Future work must pursue this concept to determine what the limits of such a mechanism are. Does a feed-forward network embedded in an environment that it can manipulate become as powerful as a Turing machine? The ad hoc use of plots of an ad hoc metric for detecting the legionsâ division of labor in Sect. 5.6 also reveals a need for developing methods of behavior analysis. When studying agents in visible environments such as games and simulators, behavior is paramount [3]. Meaningful behavioral metrics are essential, and it would be useful to have methods that are abstract enough to be portable across application domains, and sensitive enough to detect similarities or differences in behavior when a domain involves more subtlety than a switch between two discrete behaviors. Work in this area is already underway, and will be a major component of the study of visibly intelligent behavior in the future. The Legion II ATA experiments also revealed a special challenge for the application of computational intelligence methods to agent behavior problems. The goal of a simulation as understood by a machine learning algorithm â e.g. minimizing pillage in the Legion II game â may be satisfied by some abstract optimization, with little or no regard for the appearance of details of the learned behavior. For example, the legions in the Legion II ATA experiment learned to switch between appropriate roles on the basis of context, but some of the details of their behavior are not satisfactory to an observer. The garrisonsâ learned behavior often produced âmindlessâ oscillations in and out of their cities when there were no barbarians nearby to threaten pillage, and such behavior would likely be the subject of ridicule if seen in the behavior of the agents in a commercial game. In principle such details of behavior can be addressed by careful specification of the goals of the training regimen, such as an evolutionary reward function that penalizes undesirable behavior, but for applications as complex as a commercial game it may be as difficult to specify an appropriate reward function as it has proven to be to write a script that covers all situations adequately. Therefore work is underway on suppressing such oddities of behavior and inducing other desirable traits that will make agents look intelligent to observers, rather than merely acting out some abstractly optimal solution to the problem they have been trained for.

So, even though a statement may not constitute hate speech in the eyes of the law, it might still reveal the discriminatory attitude of its producer, to the extent that it could also be considered to be detrimental to the feeling of self-worth of members of a minority group. What is crucial in this respect is, of course, to take into account not only the explicit content of a given statement, but also the particular context in which it has been produced. One of the most extensively researched categories of implicated meaning is that of irony, which can be easily identiï¬ed in the example that follows: (29) We need to thank the geniuses who agreed with us signing the Dublin 2 convention. They want us to ï¬ngerprint immigrants to make it easier for them to identify and deport them back to Malta.33 At face value, the comment above has a particularly positive undertone, as it starts off with positively charged words, like âthankâ and âgeniusesâ. Yet, when looked at in its particular context, it is clear that it is meant as a negative comment against the Maltese politicians who signed the âthe Dublin 2 conventionâ,34 thus agreeing to Malta being solely responsible for the examination of asylum applications by refugees who enter the EU through its territory. The implicitly communicated negative meaning of this comment is derived from the combinatorial meaning of the two sentences it comprises, with the second sentence providing an explanation as to why the ï¬rst one is intended as an ironical statement. In this second sentence, the user creates a distinction between âusâ (=the Maltese) and (the ï¬rst, exophoric) âthemâ (=other EU countries) to relay the information that âimmigrantsâ35 are unwanted and that the EU is using Malta as a dumping ground for this undesirable group of people. It is therefore evident that the user employs irony to communicate that the signing of the Dublin II convention was an unwise decision that has had negative effects on Malta. And even though the implicature at hand strongly communicates the userâs dismay at a particular political choice, it also carries a weaker negative stance toward migrants, since the irony of the ï¬rst sentence in"
209,150,0.988,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"Group discussion is a central feature of deliberations and is particularly relevant to expectations regarding attitude change and polarization. Indeed, various scholars in psychology, communications, and political science have studied the effects of group discussion on attitude change, some even focusing specifically on the implications for public deliberation. All in all, the results of empirical work on the topic are mixed and suggest a range of possible outcomes of group discussion during deliberation as described earlier. In our first few studies, we sought simply to examine if attitudes differed as a function of whether or not students discussed the issues with a group or not. As such, in Studies 2 through 4, we randomly assigned some students to discuss ethical scenarios related to nanotechnological development in groups and others to consider the ethical scenarios alone, on their own. In Study 3, some students were also placed in one of the two conditions using an online wiki forum, which we used simply as pilot data due to the lack of random assignment (see Chap. 2). Surprisingly (given the extant literature on the subject), we found no significant effects on attitudes of being in a group versus being alone when considering the ethical scenarios except for a few marginal and contradictory differences. This could suggest that the primary attitude changes that occur during consideration of the ethical aspects of scientific and technological development are due mainly to thinking about the issues prior to discussion, rather than during discussion with others. This would cast some doubt over claims about the power of social influence over peopleâs attitudes, at least when it comes to deliberation about science and technology. On the other hand, discussion with others may play a role in motivating people to read and consider new information in more ordinary contexts in which people cannot be told to sit and think about an issue."

On the Planning Council he âupset a fair proportion of the leading academics, lay planners and men from industry . . . by a curiously unendearing brusqueness in the chair and a proneness to cut off respected experts in mid-expositionâ (Anon. 1967). Hackett was knighted for services to the RHB and to the Planning Council (Anon. 1970c, 1970d). Undoubtedly some positive events happened in the region under his leadership, such as building and opening Northwick Park Hospital. However, one wonders how much his knighthood related to who he knew rather than what he did and how much he sought recognition for himself rather than beneï¬t for those he represented, particularly the most vulnerable and stigmatised people in the psychiatric hospitals. Crossman described Hackett as âgloomyâ and a âboreâ.138 In Shearerâs words, Hackett was âan idle jobsworthâ.139 Robinson and Hackett contrasted with Crossman in their responses to Barbara and to the issues that concerned AEGIS.

356,29,0.988,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Implementation Challenges Despite widespread support from participants and stakeholders in iTEC, a key challenge in the exploitation of the results was engaging the attention and support of a wider group of key education influencers and persuading them to mainstream the projectâs innovative practices. To achieve this, project outputs must continue to be communicated effectively to those key influencers to encourage them and move them to action. Clear messaging must continue to be developed and communicated, for those specific stakeholders. Messaging should highlight compelling evidence, and address where appropriate, factors that might be used to diminish or undermine progress. HLG members, representing the perspective of senior policy makers provided valuable insight into perceptions of such stakeholders and identified challenges that might present barriers to policy maker engagement. Different Results in Different Countries While the project involved practice in over 2500 classrooms, geographic distribution of classrooms was not even across Europe which could suggest that iTEC results are more appropriate to some countries, and less appropriate to others. With 20 pilot countries, it is perhaps not surprising that there are differences in approach that, arguably, should be further explored. Structures and systems, capacity for innovation and change, pre-existing relationships between students and teachers, and attitudes toward professional development all contribute to the differences in results between countries. Timing might also be considered important, with each country at a different stage in the cycle of reform, and travelling in quite different directions. A finding here is that resistance is often not caused by scepticism and can be mitigated by better contextualising the use of tools and approaches, such as in iTEC, in terms of readiness for classroom innovation. Suggesting the Results of iTEC Are Influenced by Classroom Self-selection It could be suggested that projects introducing emerging ICT only work in schools with teachers who are already innovative and enthusiastic. As a result, it could be proposed that scaling may not be possible because the precondition of innovative and enthusiastic teachers may not be in place. However, the first counter argument"
192,203,0.988,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In the early twentieth century, group behaviour had become an urgent topic. Societies were becoming mass societies; modern media were creating mass audiences; politics had become the domain of mass movements; and even science itself was expanding in scope and scale: new universities were established and new types of scientific institutions were founded (such as the Rockefeller Institute, founded in 1901). The question how to manage and organise large groups was not a purely academic one. In Arrowsmith we see a chronic tension/collision between two types of groups (two types of callings), highly dependent on one another, and yet apparently mutually exclusive, namely (impure) medical practice and basic (pure) research. For Martin, there are many incentives for choosing a medical career: the income and respectability of the profession, the possibility of marriage and of upward social mobility, in combination with the public acknowledgement of its relevance. Yet, what is lacking, to a deplorable extent, are inspiring personalities. One by one the fatherâfigures in Lewisâs novel (representing medicine and public health) are ridiculed as hypocrites, endorsing unsubstantiated claims and leading uninspiring lives. On top of that, Martin himself is not a good physician at all, lacking âbedside mannersâ and communicative skills, while his drinking habits are symptomatic of his ambivalence: his repressed yearning for pure inquiry. Gottlieb, by contrast, seems to stand out as a beacon of integrity, a scientific prophet, a window into the future. Their first meetings give rise to âimprintingâ, as it were. No matter how hard Martin tries to ârepressâ his admiration for his hero, his exposure to Gottlieb prevents him from developing a wholeâhearted commitment to medical practice. Indeed, although he had âgiven up Gottliebâworship and his yearning for the laboratory â¦ something of Gottliebâs spirit remainedâ (p. 115). Having mesmerised Martin during his lectures, and subsequently during the laboratory hours they spent together, Gottlieb continues to draw Martin towards him.7 Gottlieb considers âmedical scienceâ a contradiction in terms. He is a genuine scientist, devoting his life to intellectual aspirations, willing to work excessively hard and to accept the risk of failure. Martin is in awe of Gottlieb, the ideal âfather figureâ he is looking for (Parry 2008, p. vii), an egoâideal or intellectual conscience, encouraging him to work harder. Indeed, Gottlieb âindoctrinates him into the religion of a scientistâ (p. viii). Already during the very first lecture he attends, a rapport is established, and Martin identifies himself with his lifeâlong mentor. The novel describes how, at the beginning of the lecture, Professor Max Gottlieb is about to assassinate a guinea pig with anthrax germs, displaying his masterful technical dexterity, claiming that âtechnique is the beginning of all scienceâ (p. 36). As Lewis phrases it, the class was âa mobâ (p. 35), âshudderingâ (p. 36) in response to the idea that even a small sample of anthrax bacilli could easily produce a lethal infection. But Martin is simply enthralled by Gottlieb. Indeed: âMartin Arrowsmith already saw himself doing the same experiment and, as he remembered Gottliebâs unerring fingers, his hands curved in imitation â¦ He had begun, perhaps in youthful imitation of Gottlieb, to"

All this should undoubtedly be seen as the discursive and practical strategy of a relatively homogeneous group possessing a degree of unity in its representation of reality and its activities. The issue is less about dividing reality between professions that are âreallyâ deï¬nable as such, and others that are not, than about understanding the efforts made by groups that are constituted to varying degrees to achieve recognition for the value of their professional activity and their contributions, efforts in which some groups are more successful than others. From the perspective of symbolic interactionism, it is not possible to decide deï¬nitively and objectively which groups should be recognised as professions and which should not. Instead, there are professional dimensions that run through all the groups, but their speciï¬c nature as a group varies and these forms of professionalization also differ in their robustness. There are struggles, both individual and collective, of varying intensity, to achieve recognition for the activity practised, for its value to the common good"

To review and categorise existing reference models having a connection to the IoT field (or underlying disciplines, as IoT as such is more a technology umbrella). Example of the reference models reviewed by IoT-i are ETSI M2M, IETF Core, EPCglobal, Ucode and NFC to name just a few (IoT-A D1.2); 2. To put online a survey, the goal of which was to capture, people understanding and expectation, as far as reference models are concerned. This exercise was very important because people have generally different understanding about what are reference models, architectures and what they should consist of; 3. Finally, to come back on reference models introduced and summarised in previous versions of this deliverable and to do a reverse mapping exercise towards the IoT Reference Model. The goal of this exercise was to show that the reference model as defined by IoT-A is expressive enough in order to allow a modelling of those (pre- IoT-A) existing IoT reference models using the IoT-A one. In other words, if we would consider that IoT-A does not attempt to define what is an IoT system using sentences and words, but defining models where any IoT system (from the IoT understanding) shall fit, then all those existing reference models would be IoT systems reference models. In this Section we aim at giving some details about this reverse mapping exercise applied to ETSI M2M, EPCglobal and uID. Some of the material in this Section comes directly from the IoT-A D1.5 deliverable (Carrez et al. 2013) (especially the UML figures and concept tables). In order to improve readability, we do not use direct citations, although the work presented in the following Section was performed by the IoT-A project and reported in their deliverable D1.5. In addition to the standards that we have mentioned above, we also apply the IoT Architectural Reference Model to a concrete architecture, namely the architecture of the MUNICH (MUNICH 2010) project in order to validate the IoT ARM against a real system in contrast to an abstract standard. Furthermore we show a reverse mapping to the information model of the IoT-related research project BUTLER1."
3,132,0.988,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"the transformation of education from a didactic process of information transfer to one of construction of knowledge. In this chapter, to provide context and to help the reader understand the seeming dichotomy of learning goals of scaffolding, I first situate scaffolding relative to the calls for the enhancement of content knowledge and higher-order thinking skills in the NGSS (Achieve, 2013; Krajcik, Codere, Dahsah, Bayer, & Mun, 2014; National Science Board, 2010) and the Common Core State Standards (McLaughlin & Overturf, 2012; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). Second, I expand on the intended learning outcomes of scaffolding. Variation in intended learning outcomes of scaffolding largely aligns with differences in the theoretical underpinnings of scaffolding, which were discussed in Chap. 2: âInstructional Scaffolding: Foundations and Evolving Definition.â I also explore if the effectiveness of scaffolding varies according to intended learning outcome, as informed by the meta-analysis results. Just as it is important to consider intended learning outcomes, it is also important to consider how learning is assessed (Belland, 2012; Belland, French, & Ertmer, 2009; Furtak & Ruiz-Primo, 2008; Messick, 1989). Indeed, one is often advised to consider assessment before even designing objectives and instructional materials/strategies (GagnÃ©, 1965; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). By considering how scaffoldingâs influence on cognitive outcomes varies according to how it is assessedâat the concept, principles, or application level (Sugrue, 1995)âone can see if scaffolding as a whole delivers stronger impacts on content learning or various types of higher-order thinking skills. It is important to consider this alongside the intended learning outcome, as (a) just because an intervention is designed to increase content learning or higherorder skills does not necessarily mean that it does, and (b) just because scholars claim that scaffolding is intended to help students enhance their skill in a particular area does not always mean that the learning is being assessed at that level. In this chapter, I discuss these ideas, and present meta-analysis results comparing scaffoldingâs impact according to intended learning outcome and assessment levels."

To recognise the often overtly or implicitly normative nature of social innovation literature and to do homage to one of the most famous âSpaghetti Westernsâ, we have ordered our argument in terms of the âGoodâ, the âBadâ and the âUglyâ. âGoodâ signifies what innovations can contribute to a societyâs ability to cope with change and, more precisely, to do it in a way that change can be thought of as progress in civility. âBadâ signifies the shortcomings of social innovationsâespecially their limited impacts in an overall averse social and policy context. âUglyâ stands for discourses that regard social innovations as something elseâusually as market-based products and technologies."
78,406,0.988,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"ger.6 There should be a defined limit or test for what is state security risk and what is acceptable radicalized discourse in the online sphere. While this is a part of a wider debate about the state, the public and information in the post 9/11 world, the harvesting of online data so radically realigns the power relationship between the harvester and the subjects that this debate becomes much more pressing and urgent. It also would appear that governments lack the self-restraint not to monitor a wide swathe of citizens in the name of national security. The revelation in June 2013 that the National Security Agency in the United States was tracking huge tranches of mobile phone records drew attention and debate from Americans about government surveillance, but the more critical issue of the potential to track citizen behavior via the online sphere at a far more granular level still does not seem to be understood by citizens. 2. Individuals own their own data. This is a bold statement, in that the business model of many ISPs is based on the harvesting and sale of data to advertisers. This is not to suggest that ISPs could be stopped from collecting individual data, but the idea of the right to oneâs data should be considerably strengthened. While many people easily recognize that information that they enter into a computer (such as names, dates of birth, bank account numbers) is data that needs to be protected, there is far less awareness of the more subtle and personalized data patterns, essentially digital fingerprints, that are created by individuals in their daily internet interactions (particularly search behaviour). There can be two views here that are compatible within the idea that individuals own their own data and the public own public data. In a cooperative move with ISPs, the data can be shared. For example, Google makes public a great deal of its aggregate data via Google Analytics in an attempt to show the value of search data in informing economic, social and political life. However, Google does not make its data archive linked to individuals public unless forced to do so by national lawsâand as shown by its withdrawal from China, Google will resist this where possible. (However, the NSA scandal suggests that Google may be compelled to share data on individuals more frequently than they are able to report.) In a more pro-active approach, society can choose to block or severely limit the way in which individuals are monitored by ISPs. European states have moved in this direction recently by requiring ISPs to inform users about cookies and having users âopt inâ instead of âopt outâ. The notion of informed consent imposed by law is an important and useful direction. 3. Everyone has a right to a personal life. This is linked to the issue of privacy as discussed above, but it is somewhat different. No one should have to friend on line a teacher, student, co-worker, client, etc. There should be clear delineation between what is an online business/ education tool and what is a social/personal tool. Part of this is an issue of ISP design. Facebook, created by U.S. college students, is based on the American ideal of networking in which personal and professional relationships are encouraged to merge. However, as has so often been the case with online interfaces, the sheer scale and scope of Facebook has intensified this relationship in unhelp6"

147,139,0.988,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"Research on operations management has developed a strong literature on efficient opportunity exploitation in terms of the intermediate and tactical issues related to efficient exploitation. However, we argue that operations management can also be applied to develop a clearer understanding of (1) what knowledge and motivation are needed to identify a potential opportunity, (2) what assessments entrepreneurs make of an identified opportunity to decide whether it represents an opportunity for them specifically, and (3) what influence feedback from the exploitation of a current potential opportunity has on the identification and assessment of subsequent potential opportunities. We now turn to future research paths available at this interface. Operations Management of Opportunity Identification and Evaluation The entrepreneurial process begins when the entrepreneur identifies an opportunity for someone, also known as a third-person opportunity (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; e.g., GrÃ©goire & Shepherd, 2012; GrÃ©goire et al., 2010; Haynie, Shepherd, & McMullen, 2009). This process of identifying a third-person opportunity happens in an environment characterized by high uncertainty (Knight, 1921; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006). For instance, an individual may develop a new technology to detoxify water that helps conserve the natural environment. While knowing this new technology is an opportunity that someone can exploit, the individual must decide whether he or she has the knowledge and motivation to exploit the opportunity, which is the next stage of the entrepreneurial process. The ability to focus (the individual or the firm) is a key mechanism underlying why some people are able to identify opportunities while others are not able to or take longer to do so (Bakker & Shepherd, 2017; Shepherd et al., 2017). Managing attention to identify opportunities. Previous research has established that individuals (Kahneman, Treisman, & Gibbs, 1992) and firms (Ocasio, 1997) have limited attention and that this limited attention can lead individuals to develop blind spots, shielding them from detecting information signals about the environment and causing them to miss opportunities (Shepherd et al., 2007, 2016; Tripsas & Gavetti, 2000; Zahra & Chaples, 1993). While scholars have explored competitive landscapes (Felin, Kauffman, Koppl, & Longo, 2014; Levinthal, 1997; Peteraf & Bergen, 2003) andâto a lesser extentâsystematic search for opportu-"

Under such extreme conditions, traditional black body radiation no longer remains, but rather the conditions are found akin to the high-energy collisions of nucleons. And then when strongly interacting matter is present the temperature cannot be infinite, but only about 1012 K, and the pressure is not anymore proportional to the energy density but only proportional to its logarithm. This is a different scenario of the beginning of the Universe than was previously thought. A beginning is seen in experiments at CERN, where a proton melts with another for 10 23 s into boiling primordial matter. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that even entire stars consist of boiling primordial matter. We can wonder if this Big Bang, the origin of everything, including the beginning of time is an equally unsatisfactory assumption as is the existence of the very final building blocks of matter. Just as you can ask: and how did that building block come about?, so you can ask: and what was before Big Bang? How did it happen? We do not know. Maybe we will find one day that this question in a similar way is irrelevant asâpossiblyâthe one about the final building blocks.

28,260,0.988,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"In looking for causes of DSH [deliberate self-harm] it is important to consider self-laceration separately in order to discern psychopathological mechanisms which may be peculiar to it and which are not shared by those who take drug overdosage.102 Again, the importance of this claim can be seen retrospectively from the point in the early twenty-first century, where self-cutting and self-poisoning are significantly different. Morgan mentions a number of âAmerican writersâ who tend towards a stereotype of a self-cutter being âan attractive young womanâ and suggest that self-cutting is âin the nature of a schizophrenic psychotic reactionâ. Like Myre Sim (see Introduction), he is unconvinced about the femininity of the stereotype, noting that â[o]ur Bristol survey demonstrated that, at lease in one provincial English city, men outnumber women amongst patients presenting at Hospital Accident and Emergency Departments following self-lacerationâ and thus the âbeautiful and femaleâ stereotype is simply âone amongst manyâ.103 Thus there is both influence and distance from the American studies from British-based clinicians. Self-cutting emerges from its inpatient context and takes on renewed significance as a psychological object in its own right, whether presenting in an inpatient institution or at A&E. Morgan sees self-laceration as concerned with an altered state of consciousness, a need to obtain relief from tension and a high incidence of obsessional, phobic and narcissistic tendencies. Immediately after this discussion, as if to restore a sense of balance, he states that âDSH cannot be understood entirely in terms of intrapsychic pathology. There is a massive body of evidence testifying to its close relationship with interpersonal social events, and not merely as a blind reaction to themâ.104 Remembering that, for Morgan, DSH refers to both self-cutting and self-poisoning, it is clear that the behaviours are still linked, even if self-cutting requires a level of differentiation and discrete concern."

170,45,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"Court and Young 2006; Stone 2009). Stone (2009) argues that researchers and policymakers operate with different values, languages, timeframes, reward systems and professional ties to such an extent that they live in separate worlds. Moreover, for some, researchers cannot understand why there is resistance to policy change despite clear and convincing evidence, while policymakers bemoan the inability of many researchers to make their findings accessible and digestible in time for policy decisions (Court and Young 2006). According to Grejin (2008), researchers often live in very separate worlds from policymakers, civil society organisations and practitioners. As a result, researchbased evidence is often only a minor factor when policies for development are formulated and practices shaped. Too often new public policies are rolled out nationally with little trialling or evaluation. In effect, governments experiment on the whole population at once. Even where there is plenty of evidence, there may be a failure to ensure that the evidence being collected and analysed is made relevant to the needs of decision-makers and is acted upon (Mulgan and Puttick 2013). Additionally, as Datta (2012) suggests, researchers in any one field tend not to speak with one voice, and not all researchers see policy engagement as part of their role. Shanley and LÃ³pez (2009) go further by claiming that strong organisational disincentives dissuade researchers from engaging in outreach beyond the scientific community. Others indicate that researchers working in universities and other publicly funded institutions report structural barriers to engaging in knowledge translation activities, suggesting that a failure to transfer knowledge has been attributed to the âtwo communitiesâ problemâan explanation that points to cultural differences between researchers and users as barriers to such engagement (Jacobson et al. 2004). As a result, says Carden (2009), policymakers lack confidence in their own researchers. Despite these misgivings relating to the prospects for development research having an influence over development practice and policymaking, there is room for optimism. As de Vibe et al. (2002) put it, notwithstanding the assumption that there is a clear divide between researchers and policymakers (the two communities model), which underpins the traditional view of the link between research and policy, literature on the research-policy link is now shifting away from these assumptions, towards a more dynamic and complex view that emphasises a two-way process between research and policy, shaped by multiple relations and reservoirs of knowledge. Accordingly, much of what emerges from the literature review presented here by way of recommendations for bringing these two communities closer together argues the case for overcoming these perceived gaps, and offers prescriptions for doing so."

147,291,0.988,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"(Chap. 3). Here, we focus on an entrepreneurâs decision to voluntarily exit his or her business and the process of assessing and choosing between sources of exit. For instance, what decision-making process does the entrepreneur go through when deciding whether to exit a successful venture? It is likely that venture success and other venture traits (e.g., number of employees, benefits created for other stakeholders, links to personal identity, and presence of a family member successor) impact the exit mode. Furthermore, entrepreneurs likely have diverse reasons for deciding to exit as well as different career/lifestyle possibilities after exit, both of which could influence their likelihood of exit, their timing for doing so, and/or their exit mode. Researchers could also explore the emotional outcomes (i.e., type and intensity of emotions) associated with the various modes of entrepreneurial exit. What emotional outcomes come from a successful exit? Does the entrepreneur experience positive emotions (which he or she likely assumes will occur) and/or negative emotions from ending a (successful) business? Do emotional reactions after exit vary in intensity, and if so, does such variance effect later outcomes (e.g., decisions to start another venture, and enter corporate life)? Perhaps feelings of grief are more intense for those who exit successful businesses as opposed to failing businesses or for those who had more control over when to exit than those with less control. We hope researchers further investigate these important relationships. Decisions on Funding Entrepreneurial Actions Although entrepreneurship has a long tradition of investigating the decision making of venture capitalists (Fried & Hisrich, 1994; Shepherd, 1999; Zacharakis & Shepherd, 2001) and to a lesser extent the decision making of business angels (Maula, Autio, & Arenius, 2005; Maxwell, Jeffrey, & Leveque, 2011), recent research on funding entrepreneurial endeavors has begun to focus on crowdfunding (e.g., Belleflamme, Lambert, & Schwienbacher, 2014; Mollick, 2014). According to Mollick (2014, p. 1), âcrowdfunding allows founders of for-profit, artistic, and cultural ventures to fund their efforts by drawing on relatively small contributions from a relatively large number of individuals using the internet, without standard financial intermediaries.â Although crowdfunding research could be a new fad, we doubt itâwe think it has âlegs.â We believe that the phenomenon of crowdfunding itself will rapidly change over the next few years, but future research that moves beyond descriptive statements of"

Many solutions need to be communicated at the different level than the level of specification of component interfaces. For example, we need to describe generalized solutions to the problem of representing trees as part-whole hierarchies. This problem cannot be flexibly solved by plugging in any component. We need to describe how the components are joined together and how they collaborate to accomplish the task. This encompasses the cases when there is need to reuse the idea of how to accomplish task using component collaboration. Imagine the benefits of having captured such knowledge in reusable form and the advantage of being able to reapply it anytime you need to represent data and accompanied operations in a tree-like structure. This is where the concept of a pattern comes handy. The pattern can be defined as abstracted and generalized solution to the recurring problem, which can be applied over and over to similar problems. In other words, it can be characterized as a reuse and conceptualization of ""a glue"" that holds components together and form the essence of a solution. The advantage of reuse of this ""glue"" over reuse of components within application design has been recognized and reported in Brown et al (1998), Chapter 2 on design reuse. As this work is not intended to question and argue over benefits of the pattern conept, we will just summarize benefits of this mode of reuse (adapted from Shalloway et al, 2001, Chapter 5):"

137,62,0.988,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"(1983) reported many years earlier, namely that being in charge of the children alone seemed to be the âcutting edgeâ with respect to fathersâ positive feelings of involvement and competence. Interestingly, Radin and Russell also reported that solo fathering was important when it came to feelings of overload and discontent/ distress. The proportion of fathers who took care of their children when the mother was not home was low in their study, and several other studies that have examined the amount of time fathers spend with their children reveal that fathers are more likely than mothers to spend time with the children in the presence of the other parent (Craig 2006; KitterÃ¸d 2003). Hence, there should be plenty of room for fathers to increase their level of involvement by parenting alone. In a study in which the fatherâs quota is analysed from the perspective of the child, the findings show how fathers, through having to interpret the wordless language in interacting with babies, develop a relational competence (Bungum 2013). In our previous study from the early years after the fatherâs quota was introduced, the fathers were very determined that their primary task when on leave was to take care of the child. Ascribing meaning to the leave, the father-child relationship was front and centre, while housework was not understood as part of the deal for fathers on the father quota leave. The study reported conflict and tension between the parents with respect to housework. Moreover, there were many ways in which fathers sought to adjust: outsourcing, reducing and downgrading the standard, but there was also a slow acceptance with some fathers that doing housework was part of being home on leave (Brandth and Kvande 2003a). Norwegian time use studies measure how much time fathers use on family and work, and how this has changed over the last few decades. Recent time use data documents that today most fathers of small children do housework on a daily basis, and that this is a change during the period that the fatherâs quota has existed (KitterÃ¸d 2013). It will therefore be interesting to explore what the fathers report when on leave alone for a longer period of time. The previous study of the fatherâs quota focused on what fathers actually did when they had their quota alone. Thus, it was a contribution to a research question that still requires more exploration (OâBrien et al. 2007). In this chapter, we ask what fathers report when on leave for a longer period of time and in a normative context, in which fathering might have changed during the 20 years it has existed."

One could not be cruel or heartless to a Cartesian automaton that lacked feeling, and perhaps not to animals that had, as some Christians claimed, been put on earth solely to provide for human needs. The art critic and social reformer John Ruskin (1819â1900), addressing the Oxford branch of the Victoria Street Society in 1884, said that: âIt is not the question whether animals have a right to this or that in the inferiority they are placed into mankind, it is a question of what relation they have to Godâ¦â.1 To see animals from a divine perspective, it was necessary to decide whether they possessed rational souls, and what happened to those souls after death. For most of the nineteenth century, the idea that animals might have afterlives was a decidedly unchristian one. The epitaphist of Lord Byronâs dog Boatswain (d. 1808) derided the sort of Christians who disapproved of memorialising a dead dog for trying to keep âa sole exclusive heavenâ for themselves.

We may call this âcontest illusionâ. This contest illusion was applied to science in England for the first time under the Thatcher government in the 1980s. Afterwards it was quickly copied in other countries. The Thatcher government, inspired by its belief in markets and competition, would have loved to privatize all institutions engaged in academic activities and to let markets decide which kind of science was needed, and which was not. However, this proved to be impossible. Basic research constitutes, for the most part, a common good which cannot be sold for profit at a market. Privatization would therefore completely wipe out basic research. Thus, artificially staged competitions were created, which were then termed markets (internal markets, pseudo-markets), even though this was false labeling. Connected to the euphoria about markets and competition, there was also a deep mistrust towards independent research taking place within ââivory towersââ, the purpose of which politicians often do not understand. What does the search for knowledge bring apart from high costs? On these grounds, the former British minister of education Charles Clarke characterized ââthe medieval search for truthââ as obsolete and unnecessary.1 Modern universities should produce applicable knowledge, which can be transformed into growth of the gross domestic product, and additionally make it more sustainable. Universities should think ââentrepreneurialââ and adjust to economic needs (see Maasen and Weingart 2008). For this reason, governments in many countries, particularly in the EU, started to organize gigantic research programs. Instead of making research funds directly available to universities, they are now in competition with each other, so that only the ââbestââ get a chance. This should ensure that above all practice-oriented and applicable knowledge is created and government funds are not wasted (e.g. for ââunnecessaryââ basic research). Hence universities are forced to construct illusionary worlds of utility and pretend that all research serves an immediate purpose (KÃ¶rner 2007). How can you impress the research commissions responsible for the distribution of funds? This is mainly achieved by increasing measurable output such as publications, projects funded by third-party funds, and networks with other institutes and universities. In this way, ââexcellenceââ is demonstrated, in turn leading to easier access to further government research funds. Competitiveness has therefore become a priority for universities and their main goal is to perform as highly as possible in measurable indicators which play an important role in these artificially staged competitions. The underlying belief is that our knowledge increases proportionally to the amount of scientific projects, publications, and intensity of networking between research institutions, which in turn is supposed to lead to more progress and wealth. This naÃ¯ve ton ideology is widespread among politicians and bureaucrats."

Therefore, the term âroleâ should be questioned. Considering the possibilities of moving towards more dynamic conceptualisations, we need to recognise womenâs agency and respect their bargaining power. Many WID studies assume that women are vulnerable. Such studies do not sufficiently value womenâs strength and power in managing the challenges of everyday life within the household and the community. To consider such relationships, we cannot use models and terms that are too static, which may obscure the gender arrangements embedded in the complex structures of personal, social, and cultural dynamics. This is important in the field of agricultural production as well as in the food security debate. In general, strategies for attaining food security are still based upon an image of women that depicts them as vulnerable or deprived, and that wholly underestimates womenâs active share to food and household security. The visible and the invisible contribution of women have not yet been fully recognized and appreciated in the mainstream of food security debateâeither in Iran or at the international level.

An instructional approach grounded in activity theory takes a decidedly postmodern approach, in that it allows for multiple approaches and recognizes the importance of individual perspectives and those of members of the culture in which the student is operating (Friesen, 2012; Hlynka, 2012; Solomon, 2000). Furthermore, such an approach would welcome the type of critique and dialogue that one would expect to see in a scientific laboratory or conference/publishing venue. Thus, such approaches would likely involve addressing a central, ill-structured problem (Jonassen, 2011; Jonassen & Rohrer-Murphy, 1999). Furthermore, students would be provided considerable latitude to address the problem in the manner that best suited them."

By the end of the project, this had improved to âusuallyâ with many students selecting âalwaysâ. As a project, we successfully applied for a signiï¬cant number of Commonwealth Professional Fellowships which enabled us to bring Ugandan colleagues working in these facilities over to the UK for periods of between one and six months. This has played a very valuable role in augmenting relationships11 and exposing them to the environment in UK universities and hospitals. The Fellows continue to play a very valuable role in supporting student information days, awareness raising and induction processes. In the evaluation, no students reported any concerns about the level of supervision they received from local staff since many received sufï¬cient supervision from a PV. Students believed they could access supervision quickly should it be required as the following excerpt suggests: Obviously being a student and being unsupervised isnât ideal however if I ever had any questions or needed support I could always call [the PV] and she would inform me about what to do or come over if it was an emergency.

315,256,0.988,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"In the following, we introduce some advantages and limitations of our method that emerged during the implementation of this procedure. At the end of the section, we discuss possible future applications of the method. Several scholars have argued that the use of a history calendar, as compared to a standard biographical questionnaire, improves the validity and quantity of the data collected (Barbeiro and Spini 2015; Belli 2007; Belli and Callegaro 2009; Glasner and Van der Vaart 2009; Martyn and Martin 2003). The calendar is a flexible tool that allows the development of sequential (in the same column or domain of life) and parallel (by comparing the data in different dimensions of life) retrieval strategies (Belli and Callegaro 2009: 35). In addition to the advantages related to the use of a history calendar, there are specific advantages in combining it with narrative biographical interviews. First, during the interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee can compare the data on the calendar to improve the quality of the data. If the interviewee remarks on a difference, he or she can correct what he or she said or correct the date of an event or period on the calendar. If the interviewer observes some differences, then he or she can point it out and ask for more precise information. Sometimes, during the in-depth biographical interview, the interviewee remembered and added some life events on the calendar (particularly for the last column about subjective life events). Second, the graphical representation of the respondentâs life trajectory proves to be very useful at the moment of the narrative interview. The interviewer can ask questions about a specific dimension and life period and concretely point to it on the calendar with a finger. The interviewee can situate the question on his or her own life course and easily understand the question. Alternatively, it is the interviewee who tells his or her own story, also while answering to a question, while pointing at the relevant event or year on the calendar with a finger.. Third, the calendar may make possible the narration of a difficult life event (parental death, illness or negative critical events) that would otherwise be left aside in the narrative interview. In fact, it is sometimes easier for the interviewee to write"
93,312,0.988,Nordic Mediation Research,"After the pilot projects had proven very successful, the legislators wanted a national arrangement. The arguments for placing this in the Mediation Service were (1) an emphasis on the restorative aspect was desired, (2) as part of the punitive system, the new sanctions would have to be based in a state-based structure, and (3) there was a desire for the new sanctions to be substantially different than the existing ones and thus there was no wish to place them in an existing punitive structure. Furthermore, one of the pilot projects had been anchored in the Stavanger konï¬iktrÃ¥d seemingly without disadvantages to either the project or the local service. And so the decision was made. Lasse RolÃ©n, on the one hand, thinks that placing the sanctions in the Mediation Service can help ensure a more restorative focus in accordance with the original mandate. On the other hand, he does acknowledge Christies warnings, sharing concerns that a classical, sanctioning approach is sneaking up on the work with the young offenders: K: âSo your notion is that you might have been pulled a little too far towards that which already existed?â"

The jungle meat meals I observed were therefore events in which law makers (politicians) and law officers (policemen) ritually and publically broke the law they were charged with upholding and enforcing. Since in many cases those paying for the meal were potential partners for illicit or corrupt deals, my understanding is that the meal, alcohol, and sex paid by the hosts were not only a direct form of bribe but also a conduit to future relations: the co-diners were breaking a relatively unimportant law together, creating bonding, trust, and mutual dependency that would stabilize ongoing cooperation. While I never shared a meal with corrupt officials, my interlocutors described these culinary events several times, shifting from condemning attitude toward the official corruption, to the description of their own pleasure during these meals and accompanying activities. They made it clear that they felt blackmailed by the officials, who made them pay for the expensive food and services in return for things such as licenses and permits, which they were entitled too in any case, or for things that were clearly illegal, such as the postponing of military draft. In most cases I was told that they did not like the company of the officials themselves who were greedy and took advantage of their position. But when I asked about the food, they often commented that it was very delicious. In some cases, they also mentioned that the food had an impact on their libido and their sexual relations with the beer-girls. The comments about the good food and sexual relations were often followed by inviting me to join such a meal. I was first confused by this shift: how was it possible that they felt blackmailed and yet enjoyed the food, drink, and sexual services so much? And why would they want to repeat this experience with me? I gradually realized however, that this combination of shame, guilt, and pleasure was very attractive, and that one way of dealing with the negative aspects of shame and guilt was by arguing that everyone (i.e., all men) take part in such practices. I was invited to join in to not only share the pleasure with me but also the shame and guiltâshare the burden as it were and relieve my friends of some of it. An invitation to dine at a jungle meat restaurant (and to a lesser extentâat a goat meat restaurant) is therefore an invitation for male"

Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"autonomy is experienced, necessitating assistance with everyday tasks, regular comings-and-goings must cease and the men are forced to make a choice about where they will see out the rest of their days. This decision clearly is related to their long-term care needs, but I will not discuss this in the current chapter, which focuses on more acute medical care (to treat illness), postponing discussion of long-term elderly care until Chap. 7. This distinction between acute medical care and longterm elder care may appear counterintuitive in the light of conventional models of health, such as the World Health Organistion (WHO) definition: âa state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmityâ.2 Indeed, this definition has been incorporated by the hostel management companies, as this interview with a senior manager confirmed: âWhen one ages, one is not necessarily ill, but one can have difficulties with mobility, difficulties completing daily tasks.â However older hostel residents tended not to see it this way, often showing a clear disinclination to be helped in everyday tasks. Asked about this distinction between more acute medical care needs and long-term elderly care, Sonia (elder care coordinator, Val dâOise) agreed. In terms of medical care, the residents âwill get themselves cared for, they know the way to the doctor or the hospital, they know the steps to follow.â By contrast, âthey hardly ever make use of [elder care services].â For the older hostel residents, health means the sensation of physical pain and the presence of somatic symptoms. One older Moroccan remarked that while French pensioners are very well cared for, North Africans âdonât have the same cultureâ of going to the doctor at the first sign of a problem. Indeed, from my conversations with healthcare professionals, it became apparent that most older hostel residents tend to have recourse to medical care only in cases of acute ill health and pain. âThey let the healthcare side of things slide, itâs rather marginal with themâ, notes Abdou (outreach officer, migrant rights association). They wait until the last minute, when they are âreally troubledâ before getting checked out (Unafo 2002: 49). BÃ©atrice (health advisor, migrant welfare association) concurred: âWhy do they seek medical care at the very last moment? (â¦) They came for work, so as long as they were in a state to work, they worked. To be sick meant to be in oneâs bed with a fever and not be able to move.â Residentsâ State of Health The first point to note regarding the health situation of the older men living in the migrant worker hostels is the lack of reliable national-level statistics (Hadjiat and Fevotte 2008: 331). This is compounded by the legal prohibition on ethnicity-based statistical data in France, including in healthcare statistics, making it impossible to infer epidemiological trends in the hostels from wider population data, although the correlations between ethnicity and certain health conditions are by now well-established (Bhopal 2014). A geriatric doctor at Sonacotra-Adoma admitted that there was very little data she could draw on with Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York 19â22 June 1946. http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print. html [accessed 25/3/2010]."
10,96,0.988,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The Governance Assessment Tool is rooted in a theory of policy implementation that is labelled Contextual Interaction Theory (Bressers 2004, 2009; De Boer and Bressers 2011). It views implementation processes not top down, as just the application of policy decisions, but as multi-actor interaction processes that are ultimately driven by the actors involved. Thus it makes sense to explain the course and results of the process from that simple starting point and to place these actors and their main characteristics central stage in any analytical model. This is also relevant because in the history of implementation research hundreds of crucial success factors were proposed and used to analyse all kinds of different cases. This can be theoretically interesting when one can try to carve out the impact of a single factor from those of all the others. In practical reality however practitioners must deal with situations in which all factors are around simultaneously, and thus with combinations of all factors that are thought to matter (Bressers and OâToole 2005). Even in a rather simple model of ï¬fteen factors having each only two possible values there are some thirty thousand different combinations of circumstances that can be imagined. That is not only unworkable as an analytical tool (Goggin 1986), it is also overdone. There are no thirty thousand (or more) fundamentally different implementation settings. But since interaction processes are human activities, all influences flow via the key characteristics of the actors involved (Bressers and Klok 1988). Thus, it is possible to explain the course and effects of implementation processes with a set of three core factors per actor. Such explanatory model is far more parsimonious, at least to begin with. All other factors, including governance conditions, are regarded as belonging to the context that may influence this set of core factors. In Fig. 3.1 we include these factors: their motivations that may spur the actors into action, their cognitions, information held to be true, and their resources, providing them with capacity to act individually and power in relation to other actors. Among the actors involved in the process there need to be a sufï¬ciently"

Students in this situation should be carefully monitored as they learn to read, with special attention to broadening their vocabulary and increasing their facility and comfort with the academic language of the schools. If the interventions come early and with sufficient intensity, the odds are good that students will gain the necessary skills and breadth of language that they need to succeed educationally. The new evidence of robust and positive long-term effects of Head Start is particularly promising in this regard.38 Once in school, students continue to learn conversational and academic oral English through the first years of schooling as they are also learning how to read and comprehend text. Without a strong language base, reading comprehension in the higher grades is a great challenge. By middle school, the teachers in the content areas assume that a student can understand the language in the classroom, integrate knowledge with past experience, and understand complex literary and nonfiction texts. Secondary teachers often have too little time and too many students to systematically identify and help students who are struggling to keep up.39 The need (and opportunity) for strong language development has been intensified by the college and career-ready standards recently adopted by most states. These standards emphasize learning to use oral language to explain answers to problems, make a logical argument based on evidence, interpret text, and retell stories. Academic language is part of word problems in mathematics and in science explanations. History, as told in books, movies, or video, is a matter of understanding a complex story; without strong language skills a student struggles. The assessments for the Common Core mathematics standards contain problems with large âstemsââtwo or three paragraphs of setting out the problem before the questions are posed. Even in math, the capacity to understand the language of the problem is critical to knowing how to set up and execute its solution (see Bransford et al. 2015; Snow et al. 1998). For students who come to school speaking a language other than English at home, language development takes a particular form and challenge. On the one hand, the research is pretty clear on the cognitive benefits of bilingualism for all students.40 In addition, in an increasingly global economy, students with native fluency in other languages and cultures can be a wonderful national resource. On the other hand, English language learners (ELLs) in schools face the double challenge of learning increasingly sophisticated and demanding content and learning a new language at the same time. Combining instruction in their native language with instruction in English can be an effective way to increase acquisition of English, ensure higher levels of content learning, and enable maintenance and development"
28,148,0.988,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"These descriptions are folksy and idiosyncratic, but draw upon Asherâs well-established interest in psychology. The intent in these cases is articulated through common-sense ideas of communication: âappeal valueâ and âshowing offâ. Despite the casual tone, the practices used to elicit these objects are remarkably labour-intensive. The information used to construct the above case histories is only fully obtained âafter carefully, and sometimes repeatedly, questioning patients and their relativesâ.23 Thus at Guyâs and the Central Middlesex in London, in Gateshead and in Birmingham, âattempted suicideâ emerges. Referral enables a series of transfers between separated therapeutic regimes. In Asherâs case, it is his eclectic (boundary-crossing) interests that are crucial. The object appears with increasing frequency, and yet the irregular, impermanent nature of the practices negotiating the split makes these clinical objects seem like so many miscellaneous, disconnected occurrences. There is certainly not much sense from the articles surveyed that attempted suicide is a national problem. The potential for an epidemic is clearly there, but it requires more high-level coordination and intervention to be fully realised. As the provision of mental-healthcare is rethought and reconstructed in the late 1950s, new objects appear. Too great a fixation on 1959 is unhelpful because the act removes restrictions to mental treatment. These are largely irrelevant, in one sense because this particular phenomenon presents first as physical injury. The 1959 act does not enact integration, it merely removes legal obstacles. Whilst the 1961 retraction of the law from suicide and attempted suicide is similar in one sense, the government is much more pro-active, prescriptive and practical, so the Suicide Act repays this kind of closer scrutiny."
329,16,0.988,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"In the chapter on changing government policies we will explain in greater detail why this is the case, but the simple answer is that within the Asian context, there is far less appetite to fund efforts that publicly criticize government. Although there has not been perfect harmony between the views of government and private businesses or individuals, they have often worked in tandem on aligned agendas related to economic growth. While that is true to an extent in other parts of the world, we will see throughout this book that there are important differences between Western civil society and Asian civic engagement. What are the roles of philanthropic and non-governmental, SDOs in Asia? The primary role is to help others in need because it is possible to do so. Helping others is an integral tenet of what it means to be human and has been promoted through the ages in civilizations around the world. The premise and intent are clear. More difficult to determine are the differences in definition and motivation between charity and philanthropy. Are they alike? Charity is the act of giving money, food, or other kinds of help to people who are poor, sick, or need other types of help. Philanthropy is an active effort to promote human welfare. In other words, philanthropy is a formalized and systematic process of being charitable. This book deals with organizations and organized, systematic approaches to helping those in need. The context for such efforts necessarily includes government. Individual and corporate philanthropy is on the rise, but it is a small amount compared to public spending. In the United States, with the largest and most active philanthropic sector in the world, American foundations together spent about $375 billion on all programs and sectors, compared to $3.8 trillion in federal spending for 2015. Of that federal money, more than $1 trillion went to health and human services. Private donations remain much smaller. This means that even in the United States, with the largest and most robust philanthropic organizations, private funds equal only a small fraction of the financial resources spent by the government. As a result, one effective use of philanthropic investment is in areas not ordinarily underwritten by government. This thinking results in pilot projects, basic research, riskier ventures in a variety of sectors, and much of the support for arts and humanities. Our research shows that in Asia, there is an implicit social contract at work. As will be described in greater detail later in the book, Asian philanthropy tends not to go to advocacy organizations, but is in line with"
315,384,0.988,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"members of this group do not identify as religious, although they do access cultural elements that often have religious associations. Lakshmi, a 22-year-old Indian American whose relatives migrated from India to East Africa during British colonial rule, exemplifies this global-secular trajectory. Lakshmiâs maternal grandparents relocated to Uganda while her paternal grandparents settled in Tanzania. When dictator Idi Amin expelled the South Asian population from Uganda in 1972, her extended family resettled as refugees in England, Canada and the US. As a result, Lakshmi came into regular contact with secular Indians scattered across the globe. Growing up, she says, it was not uncommon to stay completely within this ethnic milieu or to venture out tentatively, always knowing one would return. Lakshmi reports she is in constant contact with friends and family, phoning, texting or Skyping them regularly. This is a group, she says, that lives, works and studies abroad and is as comfortable in London as they are in Bombay because they have the money and the cultural capital to recreate Indianness anywhere. Although she has only been to India once, she proclaims proudly, âI identify as an Indian. Even though I might not be super-religious, itâs still part of my identity. I think going to college had a huge impact on thatâ¦ I ended up joining the South Asian society and took a lot of classes and learned more about my cultureâ. Now, as a medical resident, Lakshmi wants to put into practice the values her parents taught her by working in global public health. She hopes one day to return to Uganda or India in order to spearhead a long-term public health project. When asked what compels her to give back to others, she explains, âI do feel a responsibility to do some form of service work. But I wouldnât say I feel itâs my responsibility as a Hindu or as the daughter of my parentsâ¦ I just feel it comes from being a good human beingâ. She has internalized the values she learned at home and aspires to serve by being a âgood personâ rather than a âgood Hinduâ. She is also motivated by elements of a widely-circulating neo-liberal global values package that emphasizes development, modernity and progress. Lakshmi locates herself squarely within a secular, Indian global space, although she lands there in part through her direct and indirect connections to global religious actors. She traverses religious and non-religious channels to arrive at a secular destination. From where she sits, religion and culture often overlap. While some of her cousins associate more strongly with religion, she identifies more closely with Indian culture. Yet both end up feeling connected to other Indians around the world. Not just the Hindu young women in our sample identified as global secularists. Zahira, like Lakshmi, was also raised in a large Indian family scattered across the globe. She, too, maintains especially close ties to her cousins and wants to feel part of the secular global community. But as an Indian Muslim women, she feels pushed toward religion because the Indian cultural groups she encounters do not make space for those who identify with Islam. Growing up, Zahira was often mistaken as white because she is light-skinned and does not appear âtypically Indianâ. To meet other Indian Americans when she first went to college, she attended meetings of the South Asian Student Club but came away disappointed. She found that because she was Muslim, the members dismissed"

However, itâs also a fact that once we set a deadline and went about it wholeheartedly we accomplished our goals. This of course is not something we are going to manage right away, but I think that by setting our goals and giving it go we should be able to do it.

13,447,0.988,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"upbringing in post-war Scandinavia seems to have played a crucial role in the processes of change because it could connect to many other societal trends pointing in the same direction. The positive feelings connected to family and family obligations, duty and hard work lost their material and structural basis. The disidentifications and cross-identifications with parents in this generation of children lead to the psychological challenge of redefining the meaning of oneâs own gender through an identification with the other. Heterosexuality became a way for the men to confirm the masculine side of their identification once they came of age, which meant that the now-blurrier gender border became important to safeguard. The women put the heterosexual relationship in the service of liberation from their parents. This put them in a paradoxical situation where they exaggerated traditional femininity in order to become free. As young adults they recognised the futility of this strategy and instead headed for becoming individuals themselves. The tension between women and men in this generation concerns how to interpret the gender border. The women tended to see it as a source of power and inequality and wanted to degender work and care, whereas the men could identify with care work only if the gender border was upheld with regard to money and sexuality. In the narratives of this generation the most forceful emotional link identified in their life choices is represented by the women who wanted to be different from their mothers and more like their fathers, and who had the expansion of the educational system and the increasing demand of female labour on their side. The men complied passively as they had a drive towards becoming better fathers than their own fathers had been, but they did not identify to the same degree with housework and joint responsibility for the home. They felt attacked by the connection the women made between gender and inequality, and feared that the women would disappear as attractive sexual objects. The womenâs project of becoming individuals could eventually draw on the arguments from the Womenâs Movement and the emerging gender-equality politics. The way forward was less clear for the men in this generation. What is a man if the sexual gender border disappears or he embodies more and more feminine psychological capacities? And what happened to the attendance he was accustomed to from his mother? The result was the dual-earner family, where the norm was to"
253,228,0.988,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Because vehicle-to-vehicle communication options are currently very limited and unreliable, a wide variety of glances, actions, and action sequences are used to communicate with unprotected road users. Depending on the circumstances and the state of mind of the people involved, interpersonal negotiations can have varying levels of intensity. The rules applied in these cases are highly culturally speciï¬c. In particular, the expectations placed on the other person vary widely from culture to culture, so it would not be possible to compile universal rules for robotic vehicles. Another problem arises merely due to the fact that the vehicleâs driver, the robot, is unrecognizable. This is evident for driverless cars, at any rate. If a person is sitting in the driverâs seat of the autonomous vehicle, any communication would likely be misdirected at the presumed human driver. Mixed trafï¬c including cyclists and other vehicle types would be difï¬cult to implement without the ability to recognize other road usersâ glances and gestures. This is especially true in low-speed settings. As the speed increases, this form of communication plays a less signiï¬cant role for a variety of reasons: â¢ It is not 100 % explicit. â¢ It requires feedback from the other person, which would take too long. â¢ At high speed there is a limited ability to assess the other road userâs reaction. There is not enough time to evaluate another driverâs gaze, for instance. What requirements does this create for ensuring functionality based on communication with other road users?"

How much could you rely on investments from Kenya to ï¬nance BitPesaâs operation? I would love to have had local investors invest the whole amount, but I have not found that much financing available for FinTech (financial technology) start-ups. I would love to have not traveled so much away from my family and my business to find investors. There are very few earlytech investors in the region. We have just received financing from a few Nigerian investors, which is exciting because their expertise is essential to our growth across West Africa. What do you think is the missing puzzle piece to get more Kenyan or African investors on-board? Well, there is currently a lot of opportunity in relatively familiar investment options, like real estate. So why would an investor go into an unfamiliar, and seemingly higher-risk, area like tech? Why would they want to invest in a âvery first of its kindâ business? We still need to see more buyouts and M&A activity in the sectorâsome successful exists. I think those exits will act as data points for Kenyan and African investors to realize that FinTech is a viable investment opportunity. You are one of the few tech companies with a female executive team. Was that a coincidence or a deliberate decision? I hired people that were talented and experienced and that I was convinced would work hard to build something new. In Kenya, you often find tech start-ups with groups of friends from high school. I did not go to high school here, so my first hire was a fellow financial services consultant, Charlene Chen, with whom I had worked on a few projects over the years.

186,40,0.988,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"Fyodor Dostoevskyâs short description of two ladies who have fallen into poverty is highly evocative thanks to his use of the term âdignityâ. It conjures up an image of quiet pride and resilience in the face of hardship, as well as a sense of preserved self-esteem. While Dostoevsky does not speak of extreme poverty, as Mandela and Johnson do, it is noticeable that he ascribes dignity to a way of coping with poverty. Thus, going back to the two riddles, Goethe rather than Kant would be right in claiming that dignity requires effort and striving. They had always been very close to each other, united by indistinguishable close bonds of love and intelligence â¦ They had never seriously quarrelled, never been parted, never doubted each otherâs complete honesty â¦ Their love had grown, nourished daily by the liveliness of their shared thoughts.

This may include things like tapping into existing community groups that have little or nothing to do with NRM (e.g. local childcare centre, dog training groups, pony clubs, and CFA/ Rural Fire Brigade). The purpose of engaging through these non-conventional channels is simply to connect with people who may have an interest in the NRM work.

Given that we arenât necessarily going to get the capital from somewhere, we need to keep earning money while we also try to hit our targets. On this point, I think the question of whether or not parts manufacturers are going to compete over research and development plays an extremely big role. All of the main components for the first-generation Prius were developed and manufactured by Toyota. However, once parts manufacturers come to think of this as a new business opportunity, the total number of engineers involved increases dramatically. Those people all wind up competing for us. In that sense, we fully recognize the importance of our stakeholders. The Environmental Challenge 2050 is not a matter of Toyota arbitrarily coming up with targets that we can achieve through our own efforts. Collaborating with equipment makers, parts manufacturers, and distributors among other is indispensable. Furthermore, in the years ahead energy companies will also be part of it. To reduce the CO2 emissions of new vehicles to zero, we naturally are keeping an eye on developments with fuel-cell powered vehicles, for example, as well as would-be âhydrogen societyâ The questions of whether Japan as a country can make hydrogen part of its core infrastructure and whether the energy industry will wade into the field are extremely important. Nobody is going to build a hydrogen-fueling station if you ask them to do it just because Toyota has built a fuel-cell powered vehicle. We are doing this because once everyone thinks that hydrogen is going to become an important part of the infrastructure we would then decide to put out vehicles that use hydrogen."

82,377,0.988,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"7.5 Making Coins We have formally proved that an infinite series of higher-order probability statements is strictly equivalent to an infinite justificatory chain of the probabilistic kind. However, we might still have qualms: how can we understand the matter in an intuitive way? Being able to check all the steps in an algebraical proof is one thing, it is quite another thing to âsee throughâ the series, as it were, and to appreciate what is actually going on. In this section we will try to allay these worries by offering a model that is intended to make the above abstract considerations concrete. The model is completely implementable; it comprises a procedure in which every step is specified. The model gives us a probability distribution over all the propositions as well as over their conjunctions. It satisfies the Markov condition in a very natural way, and we do not have to assume this condition as an external condition.26 Imagine two machines which produce trick coins. Machine V0 produces coins each of which has bias Î±0 , by which we mean that each has probability Î±0 of falling heads when tossed; machine W0 , on the other hand, makes coins each of which has bias Î²0 . We define the propositions q and A1 as follows: q is the proposition âthis coin will fall headsâ A1 is the proposition âthis coin comes from machine V0 â . 26 In Herzberg 2014 the Markov condition is imposed as an extra constraint.

275,203,0.988,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"Such capabilities are essential for the agents embedded in many types of game or simulator. Games often provide multiple agents of some generic type â e.g. the settler type in the Civilization game â which must as individuals pursue differing activities that contribute to the success of the team rather than the individual. And those agents must be adaptive in their choice of activities, taking account of the game state, including the choices being made by their peers. Yet the scripted behavior of agents in commercial and open source games commonly fail at that requirement, making decisions that appear to take little account of context. For example, in strategy games, even when the agents are not autonomous and a higher-level AI is able to manipulate them according to some plan, individual agents are frequently observed to make piecemeal attacks that are suicidal due to a lack of supporting actions by their peers. To a human observer, such agents simply do not seem very intelligent. Appropriate computational intelligence methods should be able to take game intelligence beyond the brittleness, inflexibility, and narrowness of scripted activity, and for many games or simulators the context-awareness and adaptivity of the agents in an ATA will be a necessary part of any successful solution. In the field of evolutionary robotics, Floreano et al. also examined homogeneous teams controlled by ANNs evolved by team selection, in a study of hypotheses for explaining biological altruism [8]. Altruism does not play an explicit role in Legion II, but their study found that a homogeneous team evolved by team selection performed better than three other architectures examined, producing robust altruistic behavior in the process. Altruism, when appropriate, is an important facet of trusted autonomy in multi-agent environments, and can contribute to the appearance of intelligent behavior as well. It is interesting to note that the necessary adaptivity for our ATA was obtained using a simple feed-forward network for the legionsâ controllers. We know that artificial neural networks are powerful computing devices (see e.g. [7, 25]), and that genetic algorithms are able to train them to sophisticated behaviors (e.g. [1, 3, 15, 26, 27, 29]). To a first approximation it may be concluded that the Legion II controllers have been trained to partition the gameâs state space, as seen from an egocentric point of view, into two classes, and to choose a behavior on the basis of which class the current state observation falls in to. However, what they actually choose is one of seven atomic moves, none of which can be uniquely associated with either of the two behavior classes. For an agent to pursue a coherent higher-level behavior across many game turns â i.e., to give an appearance of intent-driven behavior â would seem to require access to some internal state, i.e. an ability to ârememberâ what it is doing. Conjecturally, the Legion II agents have learned a workaround whereby they effectively store their internal state in the external environment. I.e., in addition to whatever else they learn during training, they learn a mapping from their egocentric view of the environment to a virtual representation of whatever internal state information is necessary for ârememberingâ what they are doing. The flow of information is in fact recurrent: the fact that the agents move within their environment causes a transformation of their next view of the environment. In an otherwise static environment those transformations would be deterministic; the presence of other agents in the Legion II"

Instead of creating one mind map for each user story, we started creating a single mind map for the entire module and updating it in every user story. These mind maps also included things common to the entire module like the visual specs or google analytics events that would be fired on specific actions. Figure 1 shows one our mind maps. This process was working fine, but I realized we had a problem: we were creating all these mind maps for every user story and modules and they were very useful while we were testing. But after that, they were stored in a folder and they were never used again. We understood that this was quite wasteful because we had so much valuable information being basically thrown away after the first utilization. Linking Everything.

Nendaz and Bordage were able to show that second-year medical students could learn to use semantic qualifiers to describe case features. The use of semantic qualifiers was associated with better case information recall but not with better diagnostic accuracy (Nendaz and Bordage 2002). Thus, learning how to talk like physicians should be viewed as a prerequisite condition for developing diagnostic reasoning competence, which in itself requires more. Teachers can encourage preclinical students to begin learning and using the vocabulary of such a semantically driven discourse. Using a clinical example to illustrate the translation of a patientâs story from lay language to semantic qualifiers, consider the following brief clinical history as conveyed by the patient: Alicia A. is a 55 year old woman who for the past 2 months has had stiffness of her hands on awakening each morning that lasts for 1â2 hours. She has felt weak and fatigued on several occasions. She has noticed swelling of both wrists and pain when attempting to make a fist. At first, the stiffness didnât bother her. Now, as a basic scientist with an active experimental laboratory, she is having difficulty using micro-pipettes to create her cell cultures."

This is important so that the right type of data is collected. At the same time, students need to understand that not all problemsolving strategies need to involve the use of mathematics. Rather, attempting to see where the presented problem and an idealized, qualitative model depart from each other is a viable problem-solving strategy (Nersessian, 2008). 4.2.1.4.1.3 Interpret Data and Other Information Appropriately Students need to be able to analyze data in a systematic manner, but also realize that the job is not done until such analysis is interpreted in light of a theoretical framework (Giere, 1990; National Research Council, 2012). This is important because many individuals have the mistaken impression that scientific investigations always take place in a theoretical vacuum. To the contrary, theoretical frameworks always drive the design, conduction of, and interpretation of the results of research (AbiEl-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011; Ford, 2012; Giere, 1990; D. Kuhn, 2010). For example, theoretical frameworks can influence the choice of problems to investigate and the selection of variables on which to focus in an investigation (Lather, 2012; Miles & Huberman, 1984). Furthermore, knowing that differences in property A are statistically different between two objects means little without interpreting the finding in light of a theoretical framework. This is important both as something to do when investigating scientific phenomena, but also to remember that other scientists themselves do this when investigating scientific phenomena (Abi-El-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011; Giere, 1990). 4.2.1.4.1.4 Arrive at Reasonable Conclusions Much of arriving at reasonable conclusions involves interpreting findings in light of a theoretical framework (Abi-El-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011). But it also involves actively searching for conflicting findings in the literature. For K-12 students, the literature includes books, interviews with experts, and Internet resources. K-12 students need to be able to reconcile conflicting findings to arrive at reasonable conclusions. This can involve looking for what the preponderance of studies show, privileging findings from more reputable sources, considering limitations and delimitations of studies, and synthesizing different elements of findings to create a cohesive whole (Britt et al., 2014). This is a challenging activity for such students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011), who often are blinded by my-side bias (Britt et al., 2014; D. Kuhn, 1991; Stanovich & West, 2008). 4.2.1.4.1.5 Engage in Scientific Discourse Patterns Students also need to know and be able to apply and interpret patterns of STEM discourse, including explanations (Britt et al., 2014; Sandoval, 2003) and persuasive and dialectical argumentation (Bricker & Bell, 2008; Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958).

48,157,0.988,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"who will actually complete the task, typically referred to as actors. The underlying idea is that actors are personally involved, motivated to finish quickly, and consequently biased. In contrast, observers have no stake in the performance and will tend to give more objective and less overoptimistic time predictions. The results from a study on students and their assignments support this argument. The study found that those who were required to hand in the assignment (the observers) tended to be overoptimistic, but those who predicted the completion date for another student (the actors) were not [9]. The actors believed they would complete the work an average of 1.3 days earlier than they did. The observers, who predicted the completion time of other students, were too pessimistic and predicted a delivery time an average of 1.7 days later than the actual delivery time. Thus, observers may be less optimistic, but not necessarily more accurate. When it comes to the prediction of time usageâand not completion times, as in the study aboveâthe improvement by use of observers instead of actors is even less clear. One study found no difference in accuracy or bias between predictions of how long the actors themselves would spend building a computer stand and predictions of how long the average person would take [23]. Another study, predicting time usage in voicemail operations, found that observers with a high level of experience were even more optimistic than novices performing the task, whereas intermediate observers, perhaps with a better recollection of the difficulties of learning the operations, were more realistic [24]. There are often good reasons for letting people predict the time usage of their own work. In particular, this is the case when people know a great deal about how they plan to solve a task and how much time they have spent on similar tasks in the past. Several studies on software development have shown, perhaps for this reason, that predicting oneâs own time usage is associated with higher accuracy and with no increase in the level of optimism compared to predictions of other peopleâs work [43, 44]. Judgements by observers may be more accurate than those by actors when assessing the uncertainty of time predictions, such as predictions of confidence intervals of time usage. This seems to be the case particularly when historical information on past prediction accuracy is available. One study found software developers to be strongly overconfident about the accuracy of their time predictions for their own tasks even with historical prediction accuracy information easily available, whereas observers, in this case other software developers, gave much more realistic uncertainty assessments based on the same information [45]. It seems as if actors tend to emphasize their specific knowledge about how to solve the task and neglect information about their previous time prediction accuracy. Observers, on the other hand, have little to rely on besides past time prediction accuracy. Information about previous time prediction accuracy is, as argued earlier, typically a better indicator of time prediction uncertainty than knowledge about how the specific task will be carried out. Take home message 1: Actors, that is, those completing the tasks, tend to give more optimistic time predictions than observers in some contexts. Nevertheless, there are several contexts in where time predictions become more accurate when people predict"

What women and men in this generation agree on is natural differences in sexual behaviour and that the body is a womenâs issue. As we saw, both women and men in this generation adjust their attitudes somewhat to the new practices of their children and grandchildren, but it is not difficult to see the connection between their principal view and their generational feelings of gender. The idea of gender equality has more emotional appeal in the middle generation, where many of the men want to develop their relational capacities and become more present fathers than their own had been, and many of the women want to get away from their mothers and have a more independent life. The views of the women in this generation vary from a radical stand for womenâs right to self-determination and against individual discrimination, to a general support of gender-equality policies addressing social rights on the group level, and to a more pragmatic individual approach, where issues of equality come second to what is convenient or necessary for the family. Whether the fight for gender equality should take place mainly inside or outside the family is also a dividing line. For the men the discourse of gender equality in work and care is a much more palatable idea than the discourse of feminism and womenâs rights which puts the blame on them. Yet, the problem of following up the housework in practice and the importance they attach to the sexual gender difference make almost all men in this generation somewhat awkward when they address the issue of gender equality, even though they support it in principle. There is a time lag, but also partly a different agenda between women and men here: for the men gender equality is about getting close to their children and preventing quarrels with their wives; for the women it is about the fairness of sharing and getting the same opportunities as men in the labour market. For the radical women it is also an engagement against the sexualisation and objectification of the female body. In the youngest generation the emotional appeal of gender equality has diminished for both women and men, not because they are against the idea, but because to a large extent they find that it has already been achieved with regard to work, care, skills and sexual norms. They feel more like individuals than as gender, and therefore only reluctantly identify with the gender categories that are the foundation of any gender-"
269,49,0.988,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"Tracking your process It is startling how few studies of interdisciplinarity in action there actually are, despite the almost daily injunctions for researchers to collaborate with people from other disciplines (and in striking contrast to the numerous processual and outcome-based evaluations of working practices that otherwise dominate the arts and sciences fields). On the one hand, this is a source of frustration for those keen to know more about such practices, as well as about the ontological stakes of such endeavours (e.g. see Greco 2013). On the other hand, it presents an opportunity: it means that researchers in interdisciplinary projects have access to data on an important and under-researched topic within the landscape of contemporary knowledge-production, viz. interdisciplinary collaboration. We have attempted this kind of reflection previously (see e.g. Fitzgerald et al. 2014a), working mainly through auto-ethnographic reflection. In the course of our current work in Hubbub, however, we are trying to set out specific methods for capturing collaboration in action. One of us (DF) is keeping a field diary, both as a form of attention to his own current project â on how urban spaces get imagined, and intervened-upon, as locations of noise and restlessness â and more generally on the work of âcollaborationâ in its own right, which is also one of the guiding logics of"

By definition, he argued, âit excludes most depressive phenomena, even in the westâ.64 Kleinman developed these ideas over a long career as a psychiatrist and anthropologist, expounding the notion that âcultural values and social relations shape how we perceive and monitor our bodies, label and categorise bodily symptomsâ, and that we therefore âexpress our distress through bodily idioms that are both peculiar to distinctive cultural worlds and constrained by our shared human conditionâ.65 Kleinmanâs ideas were soon well-established and later expanded by a group of other anthropologists and psychiatrists interested in crosscultural psychiatry. Laurence Kirmayer, whose interest in the subject was rooted in his own familyâs experience of immigration to Canada, became another key researcher in the field.66 Kirmayer pointed out the conceptual confusion in the use of the term somatisation, setting out three distinct meanings that could be found in contemporary literature. In western biomedicine, for example, patients were expected to recognise that the roots of their distress lay in psychological or social conflict and articulate them as such to a physician. However, if somatic symptoms presented without organic cause, patients were assumed to be somatising. A second interpretation, and the one promoted by Kleinman, was that somatic symptoms present in place of an emotional problem where the body is a metaphor for social and emotional experience. Finally, psychoanalytically inflected theories of somatisation inferred that emotions could give rise to somatic signs and symptoms.67 Kirmayer pointed out that, despite the differences in these interpretations, they nonetheless all shared a common core: that âsomatisation always involves a discrepancy between where an observer believes a problem, concern or event is located, or how he expects it to be expressed, and the subjectâs experience and expression of it in the bodyâ.68 There has been criticism of the broad notion of somatisation on a number of levels. Biological psychiatry claims that the concept is relativistic: if our perception and presentation of symptoms is entirely culturally determined, there can be no âtrueâ psychiatric disorders, proving problematic for clinical practice and treatment. Some also argue that the notion of somatisation somehow buttresses a dualistic concept of medicine, which presumes the physical body is isolated from the mind, proposing instead that emotion is âembodiedâ in bodily processes.69 These matters are still widely debated and are difficult to untangle.

A lively debate on the implications of DA-RT has since ensued especially among primarily US-based political scientists (see https://dialogueondart.org and https://www.qualtd.net). Whereas US debates on transparency have been motivated by concerns about scientific legitimacy and reliability probes, recent European initiatives promoting âopen scienceâ have been more government-driven, arguing that data-sharing accelerates innovation, and could give Europe a competitive edge. In practical terms, they have focused on developing institutional digital storing and archiving capabilities rather than on changing editorial practices of journals (Directorate-General, Research & Innovation 2016). In a recent position paper, Germany and the Netherlands proposed the fast-track development of a âEuropean Open Science Cloudâ (EOSC), which is to be âa trusted, open environment for European researchers for the handling of all phases of the data life cycle and generated resultsâ. The principle underlying the cloud is âto make research data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR)â (Joint Position Paper 2017, 1). What these European policy plans have in common with the US initiatives is the sense of urgency and universal applicability with which its proponents contend that all data should become open to all, as soon as possible. Some scholars have already published their reflections, particularly in response to DA-RT, on tensions between transparency obligations and protection of respondents in specific authoritarian contexts (Driscoll 2015; Shih 2015; Lynch 2016). However, these comments tend to focus more on why DA-RT and JETS are problematic than on what should be considered best practice. And unlike DA-RT and JETS, the European âopen scienceâ initiatives have yet to generate extensive debate within the political science profession. Hence, we find more extensive reflection, and making recommendations, on standards relating to writing up and publishing research-based authoritarian fieldwork desirable. While, as we have reflected in previous chapters, the sources we collect in the field are much broader than interviews, we will focus the discussion on interview practices, because this is the area where the tension between transparency and the âdo no harmâ imperative is most evident.

In Being there, citizens engage extensively with media celebrities, in Videodrome, desperate people call confessional radio shows for help and in Truman, fans seek comfort in the constant presence of a ârealâ person on television. Still, the degree of alienation is even more profound in Disconnect and Her, where the erosion of personal and social bonds has evolved to a point where real-life relationships are depicted as almost completely dysfunctional. In Disconnect, the main characters prefer mediated relationships, whereas in Her, love is transferred to robotic systems and characters are really âalone togetherâ (Turkle 2011, ch. 5). With strong community bonds gone, also morality is at stake; in different ways, all ï¬ve ï¬lms portray moral erosion. Videodrome, Truman and Disconnect depict situations where media operators completely disregard professional ethics, ignoring intense human suffering in their quest for âthe good story.â The changing morality is not least visible in the portrayal of sex, which in all ï¬ve ï¬lms is available without emotional commitment or moral consideration.

As an exception to situation in many other countries, the VERSO programme has had an opportunity to work as a nationwide programme due to the co-operation and economic support from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. This situation gives also the basic ground and advantage for systematic evaluation and development of the approach and practices offered by the VERSO programme. Quantitative data discussed in this paper gives some understanding of the progress of action. When having both pupils and staff members trained to mediate, mediation can be used ï¬exibly as a method for early intervention to conï¬icts before social tension escalates to more traumatic misbehaviour. This co-operation between pupils and staff members is valuable not only from the point of view of social learning and creating atmosphere of trust to each other, but also because challenges a hectic rhythm to school days often cause to daily work and social life in schools. However, this paper does not discuss the quality of the practices or deeper experiences reached in practice. Neither does this paper describe how restorative principles in practice in schools has been fulï¬lled. Peer mediation has been implemented in Finnish schools since 2001, and the trainings for whole school restorative approach have been offered since 2010. The activity of trainings and ongoing need for the trainings, as well as the feedback of the practice, give an understanding that a restorative approach and mediation are valued more and more in the ï¬eld of Finnish education. It is obvious that academic research is still needed to study the effectiveness and results of restorative approach in schools. It is important to evaluate such issues that are producing the beneï¬ts that are connected to restorative practices in order to ï¬nd and understand the elements that creates quality in practices so that the schools can fully beneï¬t from a restorative approach. Both pedagogical and youth cultural aspects should be included in these observations. Currently, the report of the doctorate research on restorative approach in Finnish schools is under completing work by the writer of this article. In that research, it has been asked if and how restorative values has been implemented and how restorative practices and mediation have affected the daily profession of educators that have actively used a restorative approach and mediation in their work. The research is based on qualitative data, and the analysis has followed the Grounded Theory process. As ï¬rst ï¬ndings of the results, it seems that to produce a whole school restorative approach there are three needs for educators to be fulï¬lled: adopting a restorative mindset, practicing actively restorative participation and considering conï¬icts as learning possibilities to be managed with restorative mediation.

From a sociological perspective memory is not a simple restoration or reproduction of the past but a reconstruction of the life trajectory; this partly depends on the situation respondents are in when asked to recollect information on their experiences (Halbwachs 1994[1925]). For Halbwachs the recollection of events is the result of two interrelated thinking strategies. The first consists of âlocatingâ an event in its social context in terms of time and space. Like some sort of time travel people progressively place themselves in a frame that facilitates the recollection of personal events. In the second mnemonic process people transfer their focus from one single event to another focusing on its nature and its meaning (Halbwachs 1994 p. 201). The meaning of what is recollected has a social frame that depends at the same time on the different social groups the participant was a member of when a particular event occurred and on the social groups the participant belongs to at present. Coenen-Huther (1994) mentioned for instance that reports of past events differ according to the respondentsâ gender age or social class. In the case of gender she argued that women tend to structure their memory according to family events while men structure their memory in relation to the professional domain. In Halbwachsâ perspective some events and objects fade from memory because they are no longer meaningful if related to a social frame that no longer exists. For example when a specific social group to which the respondent belonged no longer exists at the moment of the interview the respondent is more likely to omit events experienced in relation to that group or situation. Such omissions are therefore not due to the fact that the events were not important in the past but because they are no longer relevant at the time of the interview. A comparison of two life events calendars completed by the same respondents the first completed 5 years after they left school and the second one completed 9 years later showed some time differences in the job history (CouppiÃ© and DemaziÃ¨re 1995). For example respondents were more likely to omit precarious jobs and short spells of unemployment in the second wave if the respondents had been employed in a permanent position between the two waves. Memory is therefore a dynamic process which generates information reconstructs life events and attributes meaning according to both current and past conditions. Answering retrospective biographical questionnaires as with any autobiographical process is thus not only a means to provide information on social phenomena but also represents processes of social construction that attach meanings to questions and answers. When respondents use biographical memory to communicate life events and experiences to others (e.g. an interviewer) they organize their memory in an ordered and coherent way in which casual and unexpected events may take on a coherent (and sometimes causal) structure (Bertaux 1981; Ricoeur 1985). The respondent becomes the author of a narrative in which he or she is the main character attributing a sense of coherence to his or her life. In other words in the autobiographical narrative respondents order their life events into a matrix that is culturally and socially constructed and gives sense and meaning to what happened (Bruner and Weisser 1991).

100,182,0.988,Migration in The Southern Balkans : From Ottoman Territory To Globalized Nation States,"A full analysis of the shifts in policy in each of these different national settings is beyond the scope of this chapter. What I want to underscore through these comparative examples is that legal status is a contingent category that is not decided in accordance with, for example, the right to mobility as a fundamental human right, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.5 Rather, legal status is designated through the interplay of the sometimes complementary, sometimes competing, forces around political interests, international relations, and the demands of the market. The migrants who continue to do in 2009 what they were doing in 2006, or in 1998, or in 1989, may thus find themselves constantly walking the tightrope between legality and illegalityâperforming as best they can a balancing act amidst constantly changing visa regulations. The next section seeks to capture how migrants themselves experience states of âlegalityâ and âillegalityâ, with the aim of demonstrating not only the arbitrariness of state policies where migrantsâ lives are concerned but also the inadequacy of the terms âlegalâ and âillegalâ in both the normative and empirical sense."
163,44,0.988,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"producer does not have any contact with the consumer, who instead buys from an intermediary via an institutionalized shop. Buying a litre of milk in contemporary Sweden is done from any kiosk, service station, grocery or supermarket and is hardly ever bartered from a person owning a cow. A sweater is purchased on appearance and a book on content, but the consumer identifies the product with the store or the brand and not with the salesperson. If the product is faulty and the consumer complains, the response to the complaint most likely influences the next purchase. If the milk is sour itâs poured away, and itâs no big deal unless it happens again. If the sweater shrinks or the book has pages missing, it does not live up to expectations. The salesperson is an intermediary with whom to negotiate, but is seldom the direct target of blame. When buying a commodity for money, the spirit of the provider of the gift is gone. The spirit of the transaction can help explain the quality of the relationship between the counterparts in the exchange, regardless of whether the transaction is a pure gift or a market deal. Talking about spirits within a modern market transaction can sound strange, but there is something beyond the simple exchange of money for a product/commodity. There is a lingering feeling of getting good value for money spent, some sort of spirit residing with the object bought. If what is bought doesnât live up to expectations, doesnât work or fails for some reason, we blame the providerâ producer. The thing acquired can be exchanged for a new object, backed up by receipts and warranties and the entire legal structure behind these simple pieces of paper. When exchanging services, there is no object exchanging hands. Thus, the spirit, if we continue to call it thus, of the transaction dwells within the resulting work, even more explicitly with the provider if the work done exceeds our expectations. And the opposite is equally important: poorly done work irritates us. This feeling remains with the work done even after the service has been rectified and the provider and customer ought to be quits. Even the latter examples demand varying amounts of reciprocityâfood is bought at the local grocery to support local industry, a friendâs garage is used for car repairs in order to sustain the friendship: it is the repetition of market exchanges that creates relations. Reciprocity can be discussed and defined theoretically, but reality depends on the context (Gregory 1994: 936). Although the self-interest increases with the distance in the relation (Komter 2014: 161), we can see that the accumulation of exchanges creates reciprocal relationships regardless of where the exchange takes place."

One is that it is unnecessary, since most parents agree on care arrangements. Another objection involves fear that children shall be made to feel responsible for decisions, and that they will be involved in conï¬icts between parents or ï¬nd themselves in a conï¬ict of loyalties. Other objections are that children may feel manipulated by their parents and under pressure to make certain statements, or tell lies (see e.g. Bondevik and Meren 1997; Langballe 2007; Schoffer 2005). Such objections may be characterised as concern that the involvement of children in mediation may be a further burden on children who already ï¬nd themselves in a difï¬cult, high-conï¬ict or stressful life situation. It is particularly the latter that is being addressed here. Our aim is to make the wishes of children visible, as well as their experiences, assessments and preferences on the inclusion of children in the mediation process.3 The questions we are trying to answer in the article can be summed up as follows: â¢ Do children want to participate in the mediation process? â¢ How do the children view their own participation in the mediation process? â¢ Do children involved in different divorce processes want to participate in the mediation process? â¢ What are the important âmessagesâ communicated by children to their parents by participating in the mediation process? â¢ Which general recommendations about participation do children who have participated in the mediation process give to other children? â¢ Are the childrenâs experiences and assessments of their own participation related to the conï¬ict level, mediation type or level of problem accumulation in the family?"

Since relaxed accesses do not provide synchronisation, we disallow ownership transfer through them. Therefore, we require that the release predicates connected with the relaxed messages are satisfiable with the empty resource. This condition, together with the requirement that the released resources satisfy acquire predicates, forbids ownership transfer via relaxed accesses. The resource missing from the discussion so far is the write resource (modelling the WÏ (x, X) assertion). Intuitively, we would like to have the following property: whenever a thread adds a message to the memory, it has to own the corresponding write resource. Recall there are two ways a thread can produce a new message: 1. A thread performs a write. This is the straightforward case: we simply require the thread to own the write resource and to update the set of value-timestamp pairs recorded in the resource accordingly. 2. A thread promises a write. Here the situation is more subtle, because the thread might not own the write resource at the time it is issuing the promise,"
51,48,0.988,How Generations Remember,"Counter-versions may emerge at the same time as a dominant narrative is told or after years of silence (see Foucault 1977; Gal 2002; Ochs and Capps 1996; Saikia 2004). Within an authoritarian state, such narratives are likely to remain in the private sphere or outside of state control (e.g., in the memories of dissidents). In this context it is tempting to view the dominant discourse as oppressive and negative, and the discourses that contest it as positive and closer to âtruthâ. However, rather than asking about the truth of the official or counter-narratives, the more relevant and significant question, also for this book, is about the relationship between them (see Fentress and Wickham 1992). They are necessarily interrelated, since any counter-narrative always relates to the dominant discourse (see Schramm 2011). Moreover, as will become clear in Chaps. 2 and 3, which deal with the memory politics and historiography of the Yugoslav period and in the present, the status of narratives is not fixed: a counter-narrative can become the dominant narrative manifested in historiography and vice versa. Nevertheless, even if we no longer treat history and memory as antithetical concepts, it does not mean that no distinction between the two should be made. Instead, I suggest that the question of interconnectedness should be explored within the specific ethnographic context. By opting to speak of narratives of the past, I seek to avoid drawing too clear a distinction between memory and history. It is not useful to draw a strict line between memory and history, neither analytically nor ethnographically. With regard to the latter, Birth argues: To ethnographically explore the fluid, interdependent relation between history and memory discards an inflexible bifurcation of the past into âhistoryâ versus âmemory.â This dichotomy plays a role in both the purported objectivity of history and subjectivity of remembering. In this contrast, history becomes contextual, and âmemory,â whether it is collective or individual, becomes a dimension of intersubjective significance. (Birth 2006: 177)"
277,147,0.988,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"5.2.2 Frame Reflection and Intractable Policy Controversies Consultative commissions are often set up in response to issues that defy resolution through established governance channels. As such, we can expect that consultative commissions are established with the aim of doing more than just providing instrumental policy suggestions. Rather, we expect consultative commissions to reflect more fundamentally about how problems are defined and what policy paradigm should be adopted. Thus, we hypothesise that consultative commissions are especially fit for inducing frame reflection on so-called intractable policy controversies. The social scientists Rein and SchÃ¶n have posed the question of how critical dialogues on such unstructured policy problems or âintractable policy controversiesâ can be organised in such a manner that agreement can be reached on the level of problem framing and subsequently first steps can be made towards problem resolution. Intractable controversies involve situations that are characterised by a multiplicity of frames or âmultiple social realitiesâ (1994: 4). This means that within the context of a problem situation there are actors that carry different frames: they name the problem in different terms, they have different ways of categorising and labelling groups, they explain the phenomenon in different ways, and also carry different normative ideas about it (Scholten 2011). Consequently, intractable controversies bring about âframe-conflictsâ, or âstruggles over the naming and framing of a policy situation, ( : : : ) symbolic contests over the social meaning of an issue domain, where meaning implies not only what is at issue but what is to be doneâ (SchÃ¶n and Rein 1994: 29). Such frame-conflicts differ fundamentally from disagreements about more structured problems, or situations in which the framing of the problem is relatively uncontested (HisschemÃ¶ller and Hoppe 1995). Migrant integration can clearly be identified as an intractable policy controversy in most European countries. In spite of policy efforts, fierce public and political debate persists on what approach would be effective in promoting immigrant integration. This has led to fierce controversies in various European countries, such as the controversies over multiculturalism in the Netherlands, but also to sharp differences between various national approaches, such as the French colour-blind Republicanist approach and the British colour-oriented race-relations approach (Bleich 2003; Favell 1998). In problem situations that are characterised by a multiplicity of frames, like migrant integration, the involved actors tend to disagree about the nature of their disagreement. As long as actors remain unconscious of their usually implicit or tacit frames or unwilling to critically reflect on their own frames, these situations will lead to dialogues of the deaf rather than rational controversy resolution (Van Eeten 1999). Actors will often be disinclined to become aware of their frames, as these are âtaken-for-grantedâ or naturalised in everyday discourse and are often also strongly embedded in the actorsâ normative perspectives. Nevertheless, SchÃ¶n and Rein (1994) argue that critical reflection on problem frames is possible. Building forward on a tradition in sociological thinking on"
164,254,0.988,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","on the attachment representations of children. I was particularly interested in understanding how massive trauma events trigger further trauma and psychopathology in children, and whether social trauma has distinctive clinical signatures in that change among communities, families, and individuals from both the inside and the outside. The findings of that work are not the focus here, but rather I present a subset of findings about post-disaster adversity and the social marginalization of young girls who I interviewed in the Kutch district of the western Indian province of Gujarat. I worked there with children who had survived the debilitating 2001 Gujarat earthquake. In order to better understand childhood in the rural Gujarati/Indian context, I interviewed children from both working-class and middle-class families, which also offered a control sample that I needed for my disaster trauma research. Visiting schools in the villages of Lodai and Khengarpur, the city of Bhuj, and in Adriyana in the Surendranagar district was an eye-opening experience for me. While the young boys played with my laptop and camera, and surrounded me asking questions about where I was from, what I would do in my research, and generally sharing with me about their lives in the schools and villages; the girls seemed disinterested, withdrawn, and rarely came forward to greet me. In my ignorance I overlooked this for a while and thought that perhaps the boys were simply less inhibited and that perhaps the girls were not as well-educated or accustomed to outsiders. My âattachment interviewsâ were video recorded and those involving girls were uneventful, as they spoke very little there were often long pauses, and a profound silence would accompany anything they described. They did not make eye contact, there was no liveliness in their tone or discussion content, and I was always struck by something heavy building-up inside myself when I listened to these children. Besides practical details such as the video camera losing power, the interviews were getting accomplished without much content and I was getting behind schedule because single interviews lasted more than an hour. One interview after another felt similar. After nearly 30 interviews with the girls and three to five group exercises with the children my experiences confirmed to me that something was indeed problematic with the girls here. My first reaction was to get irritated by their reluctance, thinking of them as somehow less intelligent or engaging than the boys, who seemed more free spirited and childlike. In psychology as in other disciplines such as anthropology, a researcherâs own feelings and intuition are powerful tools for understanding individuals and social interactions. There were other difficulties that contributed to this situation, such as the impossibility of hiring a female translator for the work with the young girls. No female translator could be contracted because women in this region do not normally travel or work outside their homes or the confines of their own village or town. There was a local saying, âno women stepping outside the darbargarhâ (an ancient fort inside the nearby city of Bhuj), that also seemed to be an obvious boundary for women, symbolizing their confinement inside the old city. Several girl participants were hesitant to be interviewed or tested by a male translator, and the translator, as an adult male, brought a certain power dynamic and unique cultural angularities into the testing situation that appeared to me as if they could potentially interfere with deriving the information needed from the participants. On several occasions I realized that a"

All the Barnahus we visited were clean and tidy, and the furniture and materials seemed to be of high quality. The picture below (Photo 2.1) is an apt illustration. The nice interiors of the Barnahus are the institutional settings for childrenâs testimony about difficult and possibly traumatising experiences of violence and sexual abuse, which sometimes involve close family members as the perpetrators. Prior to the establishment of Barnahus in Norway, children were summoned to such interviews either at the local police station or courthouse, and few if any special measures were taken to reduce the stress and possibly re-traumatising effect of participating in the legal process (Bakketeig et al. 2012, 121). The Barnahus premises clearly represent a very different physical environment for childrenâs testimony. Against this background, I will highlight and discuss the âaesthetic-spatial supportâ (cf. BjÃ¸rnholt 2014) that the Barnahus locality, layout and design may represent for children and families. What is it meant to communicate, and how do children and their caretakers perceive it?

303,184,0.988,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"status often depends entirely on their employers, thus depriving them of any chance of challenging their bosses. In particular, for âirregularâ or âillegalâ female workers, the only remaining option is to remain silent in spite of their constant âinsecurity.â Regardless of whether remaining silent is instigated by force or by oneâs own will, unless the resulting âinsecurityâ surfaces, the phenomenon will never become a subject of security studies. Consequently, the âinsecurityâ of FODWs has remained under-studied until very recently. Those researchers who try to introduce gender perspectives into security studies argue that the concept of âsecurityâ needs to be redefined in a way that reflects the economic, political, or social conditions surrounding a particular individual or group.13 Whether one feels âsecureâ or âinsecureâ depends on oneâs position. Thus, what should really be examined are the economic, political, and social structures within which âsecurityâ and âinsecurityâ are constructed (Tickner, 1997, p. 624). In the 1990s, migration studies researchers began to learn from gender studies, thus becoming exposed to a new understanding of âsecurity.â Since the late 1980s, they had already begun rectifying the stereotype of a migrant being male and single. Yet, their efforts fall short of transforming their analytical approach wholeheartedly; female migrants are still often simply added alongside their male counterparts as further issues of concern. Some critics thus described this new approach in migration studies as âadding women and stirringâ (Curran et al., 2006, p. 209). In the early 1990s, academic interest within the field further shifted to network formation in a transnational setting, especially on the basis of, and with an emphasis on, race, ethnicity, and nationality. Meanwhile, those academics sympathetic and devoted to gender perspectives became concerned that what they had learned in the late 1980s might once again be forgotten in the new agenda. This time, in paying attention to gender issues in the context of transnational settings, they attempt to present analytical frameworks under which one does not merely âadd women and stir,â but that rather bring âgenderâ as a relational concept into a holistic perspective. This new analytical framework focuses on the way in which gender relationships are constructed beyond national borders. Henceforth, the treatment and identity of FODWs also becomes subject to transnationally constructed gender relationships (Donato et al., 2006, pp. 3â26). Among various scholarly works that aim to bring gender into migration studies, that of Pessar and Mahler presents an analytical framework based on âgender geographies of power (GGP)â (Pessar & Mahler, 2003, pp. 812â846). This deserves special attention. The GGP framework has"
299,270,0.988,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"So far, combining liberal and communitarian principles has been attempted mainly by dividing the relevant turf. When the absorption of immigrants was examined, we found that the elements of unity can be communitarian and those of diversity, or pluralism, liberal. In studying homeowner associations, we saw that individual rights can provide a framework within which communities can follow their particularistic preferences. Moral persuasion (which communitarians favor) best precedes law enforcement (when rights are challenged). However, there are situations in which the two principled approaches come into direct conflict. Here, instead of assuming that one value takes precedence over othersâfor instance that liberty trumps other values, unless one can make a compelling case that liberty must be curbedâa liberal communitarian assumes that there are two set of values of equal standing: rights and the need for thick, lasting, meaningful relationships. If one can draw on the notion that one value trumps others, one must ask what criteria one uses when two values of the same standing come into conflict. The way a liberal communitarian would deal with this is next illustrated by studying the clash in one major public domain, between security (a common good) and privacy (a human right). Three criteria help specify the liberal communitarian approach to this domain (Etzioni 1999). First, a liberal democratic government will limit privacy only if it"

It seems that the hostility against migrants and the political polarization of Nicaraguan society has diminished the possibilities of collective action. Additionally, political parties in Nicaragua do not recognize emigration as a challenge for their own agendas and, except in electoral periods, ignore their co-nationals in Costa Rica. What seem to matter are remittances, not those who produce value. The possibility of larger migrant organizations able to produce their own ways of demanding recognition and distribution in different forums (Fraser 2008) seems to depend on the recognition that any collective action project has to be grounded in the communities. Rather than a fixed agenda and rigid ways of working, collective efforts have to be strategic, based on limits and potentialities. Again, translation, rather than a sort of master plan, seems to be the key. However, translation implies actors who are able to be present at different scales. The intellectual division of work between community work and national or international advocacy is without reservation an impediment for translating agendas and the triangulation of efforts. In other words, the challenge not only refers to ideas or proposals but also to the âsituatednessâ of academic, social, and political actors. Migrant communities are impoverished and share a vast number of limitations, but at the same time they are vital to a number of key economic activities. In interviewing women who work in the pineapple industry â Costa Rica is the leading world exporter â they recounted how they stopped a pineapple processing plant because they did not receive a minimum wage. Instead their income was based on the amount of fruit selected, and they received very little money if the number of fruits selected for export declined. So they wrote a letter to justify their refusal to continue working. The managers agreed to change the payment scheme (Sandoval/Brenes/Paniagua 2012). Such experiences have to be channelled into a long-term effort of constituting political subjects, and social science research can contribute to this. The key may reside in the articulation of efforts and mobilizations rather than in mutual disqualification. One step in the linking work may consist of facilitating possibilities for political formation in communities, so that those who participate in community initiatives may also acquire competencies to participate in national or regional networks. In other words, independent of the migratory condition, pedagogical processes need to be facilitated that strengthen what Davis, MartÃ­nez, and Warner (2010: 87) call âsubstan-"

In fact, by the time this book goes to press, there will be hundreds of new apps on the market and nations newly acceding to disruptive changeâalongside new movements to restrict rapid technological advancement. It is hoped that the book will help policymakers approach policy differently than they have done in the past. Looking at policy from various perspectivesâsuch as the entrepreneurial approaches explored in Chap. 1, âInside a Policymakerâs Mind: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Policy Development and Implementation,â by the author of the present chapter (and co-editor of the book)âas a strategy for dealing with some of the more pressing challenges could revolutionize how we tackle development challenges in general and help the world make real progress toward the United Nationsâ Sustainable Development Goals. Opening access to hospital registry records, for exampleâwhich can help researchers discover new patterns of diseases and ultimately improve health systems across the globeâis one such strategy. When historians write Africaâs digital story, Kenya will likely assume its place as the cradle of ICT revolution on the continent. Never before has an African nation gone through a disruption such as the digital transformation that is still underway in Kenya. With so much creativity and innovation going on, the nation is witnessing a gigantic paradigm shift. It is a revolution of a kind that is empowering ordinary citizens and reshaping their communities and lifestyles, heralding a new way of thinking about and understanding entrepreneurial opportunities and how to exploit them."

African respondent Af11 had been invited by the management of museums to hold seminars, which in turn helped in the running of the establishment. Conclusion Our interviews and workshops brought out that humanists engage with the world in many ways beyond the traditional academic practices of teaching and scholarly publication. However, most examples concerned a one-way rather than a two-way communication of knowledge, thus not very often being truly translational. Furthermore, it is clear that much of this activity depended on the individual and that very little institutional support was in place. Indeed, many colleagues will be sceptical or even disdainful about such practices and it is unlikely that time invested in translation is matched by career progress. As a concept translational humanities may benefit from the insights of translational medicine, but in practice the two are worlds apart. Perhaps As13âs response summarises the sentiment of those who take a positive view of translational practice: When it comes to translation, I feel like a sacrificial lamb. I have to sacrifice my own research. Itâs time consuming. Itâs difficult to create a team and sustain it. It does not benefit my research career but it does give me a sense of pride."

Even a great number of hibakusha and anti-nuclear weapons activists were uncritical of nuclear energy production.6 In a July 2011 interview, Terumi Tanaka, Secretary General of Nihon Hidankyo (Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations), said: âI have been thinking since the nuclear accident, perhaps we hibakusha may not have thought very much about nuclear power. These days I think that we need to revisit and more thoroughly study the background of the technology, the system of management, how the industry and government addressed it, etc., and continue to debate about what we can say and do as hibakushaâ (my translation).7 In sum, in the pre-Fukushima dominant imaginaries, future Japan is ecological, efï¬cient, economically prosperous, and equipped with clean energy and strong science and technology, and these objectives are facilitated by nuclear technology. In this vision, technological prowess is an important part of the countryâs national identity (see Hecht [13] for the French case), and major social and economic problems are solved by advances in science and technology, which are supported by both the government and market forces. Also implied in these imaginaries is the so-called âdeï¬cit model,â in which the publicâs skepticism toward and/or rejection of a speciï¬c scientiï¬c or technological development is attributed to its ignorance and incomprehension. In this model, knowledge is monopolized by experts, and solutions to the public objection consist of educating them with more and better information about science and engineering and raising their âliteracy.â Scholars in the ï¬eld of science and technology studies (STS) have presented various critiques to this model, showing how sophisticated and productive âlayâ knowledge can be [9, 40, 41], how âlocalâ and parochialâas opposed to âuniversalââexpert knowledge can be [41], and how increased scientiï¬c âliteracyâ does not always lead to acceptance and appreciation of science and technology [4]. These insights have problematized how decision-making about science and technologyâenormously consequential to the whole societyâis left to a small group of experts and the political and corporate elite, and challenged us to explore more democratic approaches to science and technology. For instance, critics of the deï¬cit model have called for public engagement in various aspects of science and engineering: not only ï¬nal assessment of a given option for policymaking objectives (e.g., public hearings, consensus conferences, deliberative polls), but also"

Taking pattern or ï¬eld orientations into account allows for foreseeing what kinds of tasks the students might solve successfully. Initiating a learning activity does not only focus on the current task situation but requires also taking past learning experience and future goals into account. Tools, e.g., diagrams, do not belong to the kernel of the theory. Its kernel encompasses the concept of activity and how a learning activity can be shaped, initiated by tasks, and created by the learner with the help of the teacher. The teacherâs role is crucial. Referring to the example above, one intended application is concerned with the problem of which further tasks the teacher can choose in order to assist the students in building the concept of Â¾ to be represented by various shapes. The strength of this approach is its prescriptive nature for initiating learning activities, while diagrams may serve one kind of resource among others. While both approaches share the sensitivity towards acting, the core concepts (e.g., diagram) of the one theory lie more in the periphery of the other (e.g., as a resources for a learning activity). If we take a networking of theories view and coordinate the analyses by using the two theoretical views, the empirical situation presented may be investigated according to two complementary questions: (1) what and how can acting with diagrams express mathematical ideas and (2) how can a task with certain goals be designed to initiate basic actions, such as identifying and realizing in a speciï¬c stage of the course of instruction, that are built on prior knowledge and preparing future goals to achieve cultural knowledge. Thus, both approaches complement each other and may enrich each other to inform practice (see TME program): coming from the learning activity we may zoom into (see Jungwirth 2009 cited by Prediger et al. 2009, p. 1532) diagram use, and coming from diagram use we may zoom out (ibid., p. 1532) to embed the diagram use into the whole course of the learning activity.

118,592,0.988,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"With regard to the press conference, first of all, the spokesman should be trusted by the public and should be a person who can take responsibility. In this context, he or she should be a politician. Furthermore, the information should be given not only by the spokesman but also by experts in order to deliver precise information to the public and to meet the demand of reporters. Misunderstanding due to ambiguous explanations by a non-professional can lead to harmful rumor and panic. Taking these aspects into account, the press conference after the Fukushima nuclear accident should have been given in cooperation with both the chief cabinet secretary and experts from such agencies as the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan, at the same time and place. We discussed the above useful and transparent communication in an emergency situation, and the American students also agreed on this point in the summer school. The next illustration is the distribution of information through the web. After the accident, a huge amount of information was distributed day by day through the web about the reactor conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, water level) and environmental conditions (e.g., radioactivity concentration in air, dose rate, surface contamination density). In other words, the public with access to the web was exposed to this huge amount of information without explanations of how to understand and act on it. Of course it is very important to disclose all information, but the sender should always pay attention to the recipient when information is sent out. In this context, the sender should have added the essence or intelligence that summarized the huge amount of information. We should also pay attention to the problems of how to deliver the information to the public without access to the web, such as evacuees. One solution may be a newsletter to the evacuees that summarizes the current situation on reactor and environmental conditions. This information should be delivered to those who really need it for their lives near the site. Finally, what is needed when the information can be transmitted smoothly is âpublic trustâ over nuclear safety. The loss of public trust was widely discussed in the summer school and we know that it will be extremely difficult to restore it in a short period of time. Thus it is our responsibility as the younger generation to keep going to achieve the long-term goal."
191,522,0.988,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Translating Across Age: Issues of Autonomy The demarcation of both Norwegian Barnahus and Project Karin is in police-reported cases, while November has taken a more open approach and includes cases that are not yet reported and perhaps will not be. The issue of police reporting is not just a matter of priority, however. It evokes a more general question of victim autonomy that is central to the difference between a multi-agency model for children compared to one for adults. To put it very briefly, as far as children are concerned, the suspicion of violence or sexual abuse would always result in some kind of police involvement. In the case of domestic violence against adults, the question of police involvement is more open and contested. Arguments for collaborative arrangements in tackling domestic violence against adults often refer to the challenge of breaking the cycle of abuse. It is argued that prosecution needs to be supplemented by other types of support in order to create sustainable change in the lives of victims and perpetrators lives. Adding civil to criminal remedies is both an aim in itself and a tool to increase conviction rates. Some see psychosocial support primarily as a tool to improve and enhance the punitive process, by motivating victims to cooperate with the police, giving evidence and remaining âcooperativeâ witnesses. Others argue that psychosocial support is needed to improve victim autonomy and choice about how they want to live their lives. The latter set of arguments is often framed in terms of victim empowerment (Hoyle and Palmer 2014). In discussing what an empowerment approach means in a domestic violence context, Hoyle and Palmer define it as helping clients to understand the choices that are available to them and to make informed choices, as well as supporting them in the choices they make. According to Hoyle and Palmer, empowerment thinking is still relatively rare within the criminal justice system. They claim that focus is more on âproviding services in the interest of the victimâ, than engaging with victims about what they see as the best solution to their problems (Hoyle and Palmer 2014, 3). Such issues of autonomy and choice were also raised in the interviews with November staff. One of the informants pointed to differences between the police and the psycho-social professions when it comes to approaching so-called reluctant victims. She explained that the police"

It should be changing to accommodate current projects, responsibilities/workload. Despite the flexibility, the roles of individuals should be well-defined at any moment with clear responsibilities and their time span. Some roles are predefined and needed to make it all function smoothly, such as project manager or secretary. Based on theory and practice we can identify demand for people of different profiles/talents to fit that predefined roles, e.g., a project manager with good research and programming skills. We also need to ensure condition to support people in their work, e.g., appropriate space and equipment. With the progress and expansion of the group, new roles may be articulated (e.g., separate financial issues from secretarial). We can get demand for new roles due to the change in nature of work (e.g., project logistics to be handled separately from project management) or approach (e.g., need for programming sensor platforms). The internal organization should be preferably almost flat facilitating personal and group progress. Any hierarchy should emerge naturally based on contributions that individuals have to the group and different aspects related to supporting the group, such as coordinating work of students, managing research projects, ensuring funding. There are different ways for a successful research group to grow. We have experience of organically growing a group out of enthusiasm for programming, research and sharing with others. We were lucky to get support from several established researchers when we were still students, several years before we got into shaping our own group."

The common ground for both above mentioned trendsâthe âdeprofessionalisationâ of science journalism and the âdeinstitutionalisationâ of science communication at largeâis the remarkable amount of laypersons finding their voices online and the self-conception of civil society organisations demanding to be involved in the science communication process. As much as this inevitably shatters the economic base of science journalism and as much as it may force the science establishment to reinvent its communication practice, we should be grateful for the degree of communication from âscientific citizensâ. Thereby the challenge lies less in permitting (or even embracing) bottomâup movements as such, but rather more in resisting the use of public dialogue as a means to an end. While valorising âcitizen scienceâ as an overdue âco-productionâ of authoritative social knowledge, Fuller warns us not to treat broadcasts of consensus conferences, citizen juries, etc. simply as better or worse amplifiers for the previously repressed forms of âlocal knowledgeâ represented by the citizens who are now allowed to share the spotlight with the scientists and policy makers. (2010, p. 292) The questionable success of most of these public engagement campaigns has increasingly been challenged recently. Grassroots initiatives like âWissenschaftsdebatteâ or âForschungswendeâ in Germany criticise openly the fact that pseudoengagement has merely served as a fig leaf excuse for the legitimisation of research agendas which are still being built topâdown. Instead it will be necessary to supplement the dragged-in rituals of âend of pipeâ dissemination with a fresh paradigm of âstart of pipeâ deliberation. Undoubtedly such initiatives cater to the transparency and true public engagement pursued by the ideal of Open Science. Thus within the âbig pictureâ we should embrace the opportunities of the OSC era, and in particular the interactive online technologies driving it."

Other illustrations could be citizens making claims they are not entitled to in terms of subsidies, using social insurance unjustly or claiming unemployment benefits while working (often svart). There are thus different reciprocal relationships at play. Here they are the result of redistributive taxation policies and of unequal spending of tax revenue. The point is that tax policies invoke different types of reciprocal relationships; between citizens and between citizens and their state. Schumpeterâs proposal, that in order to understand any society and its political life one of the best starting points is the tax system (1954), forgot one important issue. If we study a tax system in order to understand a society, it is clear that we also have to include the exchanges where taxation is avoided; not only the holes and the glitches forgotten by the tax system but how people respond to them in their everyday transactions. We have to look at both sides of reciprocityâboth the positive and the negative."

For example, the term migration itself comes with particular preconceptions of human movement in a particular region. For us, it was valuable to consider the role of circular migration in mediating (poor) health outcomes in both sending and receiving communities. Considering various ways of approaching migration in the region represented a first effort to engage and connect different people who can contribute to research, policy, and practice related to migration, urbanisation and health. At our meeting, the main focus was figuring out ways to speak that were less alienating to those engaged in practice, and those for whom urban or migrant health was a more peripheral part of their work. There needs to be multiple layers of engagement and multiple entry points into understanding linkages between migration, urbanisation and health in SADCâfrom research that serves to dispel myths, to that which builds much deeper knowledge in the region. In addition to exploring ways to use language and approaches that not only speak across disciplines, we wished to understand ways to directly engage with those who are mobile, and who may experience health penalties as a result of their mobility or migration status. These methods shouldâwe feltâbe participatory, highly local, and support participatory action. Our focus on local, rather than reproducible, large scale, or transferable, kinds of knowledge, reflected a need to understand and foreground our local context. Place-based contextual knowledge allows for opportunities to connect and understand local policy and practice. Being connected to and engaging with the state is vital in our research, as the state is a key actor â both in defining who migrates, and in defining their experience of migration."
170,233,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"2.8 Limitations: Motivational Stage and Linkage with General Socioeconomic Inequality Aside from the (maybe too) general approach (which some may consider as a limitation, but we consider it one of its main strengths), the main weakness of Selwynâs model refers both to the lack of a motivational component and to the absence of a direct theoretical linkage with non-ICT inequalities. Despite some people conceptualizing a motivational stage as the first level of the divide (Van Dijk J. 2005), motivations or attitudes towards ICT are complex, multicausal and affect all of the three ICT stages of the proposed divide model in circular ways. From the household perspective, positive attitudes towards ICT could encourage the purchase of digital commodities, but on the other side, without the possibility of access, individuals will not be able to get to the usage stage even if absolutely motivated. Also, motivation could increase the chances of usage (Van Dijk 2005), but usage could lead to the acknowledgement of what can be achieved with ICT and, thus, motivation or appropriation or both. The second weakness of the version we adopted from Selwynâs approach is the lack of any direct linkage within ICT inequalities and socioeconomic-based ones (e.g. social class, Bourdieuâs capitals). It is not that Selwyn forgets to include these subjects (Selwyn 2004), but for the sake of simplification, we excluded them in the specific framework. Obviously, differences in access, usage, appropriation and also motivation related to ICT are determined, at least in part, by socioeconomic inequity (Dodel 2013), and at least some kind of theoretical linkage between the two was already stated in this chapter (the regressive effect of ICT without public policy intervention)."

147,133,0.988,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"1997), and laboratories (Arkes, 1991). Perhaps with additional theorizing, these concepts can be applied or blended for the staged decision making involved in the innovation process and in the development of entrepreneurial projects. We offer four examples below. Stage Gates and Real Options Reasoning Real options reasoning is an approach to making decisions in a way that manages uncertainty. Under real options reasoning, the decision maker invests in a real option that provides him or her the right but not the obligation to continue investment (McGrath, 1996, 1997; McGrath & Nerkar, 2004). Such an approach requires a mindset that is less focused on achieving success and avoiding failure and more focused on how the two fit together. For example, when one pursues higher-variance entrepreneurial projects, the failure rate will likely increase, but this could lead to highly favorable outcomes if the cost of failure is bounded (McGrath, 1999). When entrepreneurial projects are considered to be a real option, it appears that real options reasoning could be applied to the gate at the end of the first stage of the innovation process. The value of the option is what can be learned at that stage. However, how can real options reasoning be applied to subsequent stages of the innovation process, especially as the investment in the project is greater? Is this greater investment worth it vis-Ã -vis the projectâs option value? It would seem that real options reasoning becomes less and less valuable as the entrepreneurial project moves through the stages of innovation because uncertainty is reduced, and option value is lower when uncertainty is lower. Even if a real options reasoning approach is useful only in the first stage, this first gate is critical to completing the project and reducing the costs of innovation. The mindset underlying real options reasoning fosters learning while preventing a strong commitment to the optioned project. Indeed, this seems to point the way toward a hybrid stage-gate model wherein real options reasoning helps with the go/kill decision at the early stages of the innovation process by enabling learning and flexibility when one makes a decision under high uncertainty. However, for later stages, more focus is given to choosing and setting stage gates because with reduced uncertainty, decision makers are better able to pre-determine the criteria for subsequent gates to manage risk. Further research on this optionâstagegate hybrid will likely make an important contribution to the innovation and entrepreneurship literatures."
51,102,0.988,How Generations Remember,"this, the emphasis on their Herzegovinian identity felt like a political statement declaring that if the Croats of Herzegovina could not be part of Croatia they could at least distinguish themselves from Bosniakdominated Bosnia (and perhaps in the future win a separate Croat entity). I experienced this position most strongly among HerzegovinianCroat academics who, when I said Bosna (Bosnia) instead of Bosna i Hercegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina) for the sake of brevity, told me I always had to include Herzegovina because I would otherwise be making a political statement (see Å½epiÄ 2006). In regard to questions of identification it was interesting to learn not only about my interlocutorsâ present identity but also about their pre-war identifications. Most told me that they have always identified themselves as âBosniakâ or âCroatâ. Apart from a few exceptions, only those who still declare themselves as Yugoslavs told me about their former Yugoslav identification. The percentage of cross-national marriages is often taken as proof that Yugoslavia overcame national cleavages. However, these numbers are interpreted very differently by different scholars of the region. Nikolai Botev and Richard Wagner (1993), for example, try to deconstruct the popular notion that national intermarriages increased during the postWWII socialist period. Their analysis is based on data from 1964 to 1988. It shows that mixed marriages were not as common as often assumed and constituted only 12 % of marriages in Yugoslavia. âThe major finding from examining the resultant homogamy parameters is that endogamous, rather than exogamous, marriages remain the norm in Yugoslaviaâ (Botev and Wagner 1993: n.p.). However, in urban areas in BiH, such as Mostar, mixed marriages were much more common and constituted around 30 % of all marriages. The difference between rural and urban places is most likely linked to a process of increasing individualism in the latter: âInterethnic marriages are justified in terms of individualism, and the idea of individual uniqueness contradicts ideologies of ethnic loyalty and tight ethnic incorporationâ (Eriksen 1998: 130). This important factor helps explain why in cities, such as Mostar and Sarajevo, crossnational marriages were more common than in rural BiH. Moreover, we have to ask ourselves what the number of mixed marriages tells us. Is a low rate of such marriages necessarily a sign of a distance"

Even such a small thing as failing to give a betel nut to a witch could potentially result in retribution. There were plenty of stories to be recalled and retold about the sorts of things witches could do and had done. While to be sure, there were a few witches living in our own villages, it was those witches, in those villages, who were truly to be feared. Witches in this context are both inside (relatives, in neighboring villages) and outside (not-exactly-us-but-those-people). They are the outside threat that is also intimate and internal, as argued in the introduction to this volume. There is also a gendered distinction. While men can be witches and women can be sorcerersâ these are symbolically gendered categories. In practice, the majority of sorcerers are men, and witches predominantly (but by no means exclusively) women, though my Trobriand interlocutors were adamant that the gendered categories were not absolute. This may be an example of what Sanders (2008: 161) refers to as a performance of gender, in which gendered ideals are performed or enacted irrespective of menâs and womenâs sexed bodies. To return again to Malinowski, he states it thus: The magic of illness and health, which can poison life or restore its natural sweetness, and which holds death as it were for its last card, can be made by men and women alike; but its character changes entirely with the sex of the practitioner. Man and woman each have their own sorcery, carried on by means of different rites and formulae, acting in a different manner in the victimâs body and surrounded by an altogether different atmosphere of belief.

211,22,0.988,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"Those who have prior knowledge about the health problems of others are likely to be the individuals who identify opportunities to improve these othersâ health. Many individuals personally deal with health-related problems or gain familiarity with such problems by caring for loved ones. By directly or indirectly experiencing a particular health problem, an individual not only develops a strong understanding of the specifics of the problem but also gains in-depth knowledge of existing treatments and how those treatments fall short. In turn, this knowledge can lead the individual to recognize latent demand. For instance, Han Pham was infected by bacteria from a mishap with a dirty vaccination needle. Later, while in graduate school for design, Pham recognized an opportunity stemming from her needlestick injury and developed the YellowOne Needle Cap, which is a yellow cap made of plastic. The cap turns cans for soft drink into a safe receptacle for discarded needles by preventing the needles from coming back out (www.designtoimprovlife.dk). While individuals who directly or indirectly experience health problems may recognize an opportunity for someone, they may not have the knowledge required to personally act on the opportunity (McMullen and Shepherd 2006). Acting on an opportunity to develop a new product to overcome a health problem, for instance, might require knowledge of marketing, production, and management in the particular health sector as well as the resources to do so. Take the example from above again: Phamâs invention of the YellowOne Needle Cap ultimately resulted from the design knowledge she gained in graduate school. Acting on an opportunity to overcome health problems could be an especially significant context in which individuals who create and use innovations to solve their own health problems begin a process (perhaps unintentionally) that results in the development and exploitation of the health opportunity. It appears that studies on this process could build on the concept of user innovation (Shah and Tripsas 2007; von Hippel 1988). This perspective might be useful to develop the field of health entrepreneurship. While they have different knowledge from individuals who have directly and indirectly experienced health issues, people who have not experienced problems with their own health may also possess knowledge that leads to the identification and exploitation of health-improving opportunities. For instance, some people have a deep understanding of technologies with the potential to become health solutions, such as engineer Dean Kamien. Kamien realized that many people who live in third-world countries do"

Withholding when indigenous ethics mandate giving constitutes a violation of norms, one that may provoke a witchcraft attack. MacCarthy was warned that if a woman complimented her on her clothing, netbag, jewelry, or other valuable, she should give the item away immediately to forestall such an attack. Refusing even a betel nut to someone who wanted it could result in âretribution,â witch-style (ibid.: 139), she was told.3 Wherever witches are thought to assault consanguinesâor affines, for that matter (see note 3)âwitchcraft becomes central in the study of kinship, alliance, and exchange, as their âdarkâ side. This point was made over two decades ago by Eytan Bercovitch, in his article on Nalumin (PNG) âhidden exchangeâ (1994). The Nalumin live in small settlements the residents of which are connected through affinal and consanguineal ties. Local norms dictate that peace and harmony be achieved through benign reciprocal transactions. Yet allegations of witchcraft arise within these small, socially close networks. The explanation Bercovitch offers is of general interest. Anyone has too many exchange obligations to meet, putting the person in the position of having to renege on some of these obligations. It follows that to give is also to withhold, the âinescapableâ problem of exchange (1994: 520). There is a benefit to giving to others, but this is offset by the risk taken in giving: âthe harm that comes from not giving to othersâ (ibid.: 523). To avoid the conflicts such exclusions could engender, Nalumin conduct their transactions in secret so as not to antagonize non-recipients. Auslander echoes Bercovitchâs point, albeit for the Ngoni, an eastern Zambian group. âNgoni frequently stress that any act of giving or sharing may potentially trigger later dangerous acts of witchcraft or poisoning by those left out ... the witchâas the âexcluded otherâ (Munn 1990: 3)â reciprocates by retaliating and âendangering the communityâ (Auslander 1993: 178). That witchcraft is the dark side not only of kinship but exchange is implicit in the recurring figure of the devouring cannibalistic witch. In Bertelsenâs chapter, for example, the Germans are imagined as nocturnal bloodsuckers (this volume, p. 43) and as undertaking âsavage hunts for childrenâ (ibid.: 39), who are âkidnapped or devouredâ (ibid.). Similarly, Asaro witches are depraved, necrophagous consumers that loiter near graves, where their next meal lies (Strong, this volume, p. 73). They are âfigures of unmitigated, cannibalistic hunger or greedâ (ibid.) who feed at night âon the internal organs of persons or pigs, slaking"
299,126,0.988,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"advertising does next to nothing to increase individualsâ knowledge about a subject (Lee 1997),8 and instead seeks to sway them subconsciously.9 Moreover, studies support the popular assertion that advertising is primarily about âmanufacturing needâ (Phillips 2011)âthat is, firms do not produce goods in response to peopleâs preferences but, instead, induce preferences for the goods they seek to market. Individuals never âneededâ deodorant until deodorant manufacturers convinced them that their odors were âbadâ ones that required correction. Appeals to impulses are antithetical to the idea of an informative advertisement intended to help ârationalâ consumers carefully reason about which product best suits their actual needs. In short, advertising demonstrates that the economic perspective on preference formation is far from completeâand that attempts to maintain it are guided by what Daniel Kahneman calls âtheory-induced blindnessâ (Kahneman 2011). In brief, the discipline of economics has historically âlack[ed] an empirical theory about the content of individual preferencesâ (Witt 1991, p. 563), and attempts to resolve this deficiency have so far been unsatisfactory. All of these observationsâ and the criticisms of these observationsâshow that a plausible theory of choice behavior must incorporate the social and psychological factors that initially form and continuously modify preferences, and must provide a specific model of how they do so."
117,7,0.988,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Defining Care In order to understand care, one may start by attempting to devise a general definition of this term. Such a definition of care must necessarily be broad if it is to cover as many important aspects of the phenomenon as possible. Care in healthcare comprises many elements including the physical interactions between care providers and patients, the observation of hygiene requirements and the completion of paperwork. Joan Tronto and Bernice Fisher have offered an influential definition that classifies as care all activities that help to âmaintain, continue and repair âourâ world so that we can live in it as well as possibleâ (Tronto 1993, p. 40). This definition can be fruitfully adapted to the healthcare context by replacing the term âactivityâ with âactionâ, which specifically indicates goal-directedness and intentionality. Healthcare activities are triggered by patient needs and requests; they follow professional obligations, and are shaped by institutional demands. Thus, activities in this field are usually goal-directed, which is to say they are actions rather than activities. In the same vein, the verbs âmaintain, continue, repairâ may be changed to âmaintain, improve, restoreâ.

Assuming that Hannah J. did not overreact and become hysterical as a result of the release of the tension that had been building up so long, and assuming it was not just petulance, what was her misery made of? Was it the threat of being haunted by the specter of the art of acting? Was the sudden power of resignation in the middle of felicitous play overpowering, more difficult than failure in infelicitous play, because it broke an unspoken rule? Was it a taboo6 that sought immediate revenge for having been broken by destabilizing Hannah J.âs idea of herself? Was it the fear that goes hand in hand with the ânoblest of all nations, the resignation,â7 as the philosophizing troublemaker Johann Nestroy ironically put it? Did fear begin to gnaw at the maxim of selfassuredness?

303,280,0.988,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"Yet the difference seems to be an overwhelming feeling that by sending students abroad can be fostered such talent; it is not something that can be easily nurtured domestically. This most likely stems from the fact that multiculturalism is seen as something that exists in other settings but rarely in Japan, and special skills are required for people to be able to adequately deal with it. Such skills can only be fostered overseas. A commitment to making classes of an international standard and offering flexibility in academic calendars (the likes of the touted âGap Year Project,â Ashizawa, 2012) are two possible options. Here âinternational standardâ does not mean to imply that present levels are necessarily low, rather that the systems supporting the curricula are not international. For example, the numbering of classes (to facilitate cross crediting) is undertaken by only around 7% of the nationâs universities (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2012). Because global jinzai requires intercultural communication abilities and a greater understanding and acceptance of diversity (a fundamental of multiculturalism), there is also an urgent need to internationalize campuses in Japan to provide for such learning opportunities for those students unable (or unwilling) to study abroad, or for those who return to further hone their skills. More use of dual degrees, offering greater diversity in international programs (volunteer abroad, international internships, and so on) could be faculty- or university-wide possibilities. Meanwhile, at the class level, providing greater evidence of student learning which is internationally compatible (learning outcome assessment, portfolios, etc.) is another option. Without doubt, the fostering of global jinzai has become a foundation stone of numerous policy initiatives and even the driving force behind the creation of some new faculties. Yet global jinzai refers to multi- and interdisciplinary skills usually acquired from disparate departments. Rather than new faculties, it would be more appropriate to give greater consideration to the offering of courses or qualifications that span disciplines and/or departments. Further, to lead to the fostering of global citizens, a much more transparent, focused, and open curriculum is required than exists at present. This leads on to a final question: is the ongoing push for global jinzaiâhowever its goals are definedâan outdated and inadequate policy nowadays anyway?"

However, empirical studies of white-collar inmates do not support the special sensitivity hypothesis. Rather, empirical studies support the special resilience hypothesis, which suggests that white-collar offenders are able to adapt to prison life more successfully than other inmates. In this section, we argue that the theory of convenience can provide support for the special resilience hypothesis. If a white-collar criminal should end up in jail, defense attorneys work hard to make prison life as easy as possible for the client. Attorneys argue that it is much worse for a member of the elite to end up in prison than for other people. After a short while, the white-collar offender typically gets most of his freedom back in an imprisonment setting to avoid too much damage. However, research indicates that it is easier for a white-collar criminal than for a street criminal to spend time in prison. White-collar offenders tend to find new friends more conveniently, and they are able to sleep all night, while most other inmates may have trouble sleeping and making friends in prison (Dhami 2007; Stadler et al. 2013). Evidence of neutralization by denial of responsibility can be found in autobiographies by white-collar criminals such as Bogen (2008), Eriksen (2010), Fosse and Magnusson (2004), and Kerik (2005). Bernard B. Kerik was the former New York police commissioner who served three years in prison. He seems to deny responsibility, to condemn his condemners, and to suggest normality of action. Evidence of neutralization can also be found in autobiographies by those who were accused of misconduct, but never prosecuted or convicted. An example is ex-Lehmann Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan who presents herself as a victim rather than an offender (Montella 2016). In this chapter, we argue that there is lack of evidence for the special sensitivity hypothesis for white-collar inmates. The autobiography by Kerik (2005) is used in our case study of lack of evidence. Rather, there is support for the special resilience hypothesis that we discuss in terms of convenience theory in the next chapter."

Clearly, it is necessary to take into account that these are largely personal and cannot be transferred from one care worker to another in every case. Indeed, not all care workers put as much creativity into the negotiation with residents. For instance, when Joani told Lucia about the foot bath she had given to Mr Bakker, Lucia replied âI am not going to do that!â."
13,318,0.988,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"a stronger polarisation in the youngest generation where some women experience greater success when it comes to disciplining themselves, since there is hardly any indifference involved. The polarisation is also quite striking when it comes to social background. None of the women from working-class families report a negative relationship with their bodies, and most of the ones with a positive body image are mother-identified and have a positive relationship with an attentive father. Stine describes how she showed off her new dresses in front of her father, since he was âthe only man in the houseâ. Reproductive and bodily femininity appears to be more threatening to middle-class girls. They also seem to receive more ambiguous messages from their parents, ranging from feminist celebrations of their first period to hints about watching their weight. Their relationship with their fathers is based on intellectual qualities than a positive evaluation of femininity. Perhaps it does not involve a direct devaluation of femininity, but rather neutralises its embodied aspects? The experience of gendered embodiment may therefore be a greater subjective obstacle for a father-identified girl than it is for a mother-identified boy. Feminine appearance is a demanding act of balance for a middle-class girl: not too little, not too much, and appropriate in time and place (see also AmbjÃ¶rnsson 2004). The more or less suspect femininity that a young middle-class girl has to avoid in order to become a modern, autonomous girl might also no longer be represented by her own mother in the way it was in the middle generation, but rather might be experienced as a more obscure, inner threat to her perceived identity. The body that is so central to modern self-construction has become a potential enemy, which they either manage to control or that lets them down by being beyond their control (Rudberg 1995). Thus, in spite of the young men taking a much more active interest in their appearance, there are only sparse signs that men and women in the youngest generation have become more similar to each other in the way they talk about and relate to their bodies. Among our informants, the ârisk groupâ with regard to anorexic tendencies seems to be fatheridentified athletic girls from the middle class, who hate becoming what one of them describes as âa proper femaleâ. At the same time, there is a female family heritage involved, sometimes going as far back as the grandmotherâs generation. Oda remembers how her mother used to stand in front of the mirror and complain about how fat she was, while her daughter who stood beside her clearly saw that she was chubbier than her mother."

As a result, recent research on entrepreneurial opportunities has generally centered on an individualâs assessment of whether a particular situation signifies an opportunity for someone (i.e., third-person opportunity) (e.g., Cornelissen & Clarke, 2010; GrÃ©goire et al., 2010; GrÃ©goire & Shepherd, 2012; Gruber et al., 2013; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005) and then whether it signifies an opportunity for him or her personally (i.e., firstperson opportunity) (e.g., Autio et al., 2013; Fitzsimmons & Douglas,"
170,135,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"policy narratives that convey the reasons for decisions being put forward (Bellettini and OrdÃ³Ã±ez 2011). In the case of ICT4D, the broad conceptual frameworks in relation to the development process have been discussed before. However, there is space for developing the theory about ICT policies that respond better to the needs of developing countries. Conceptual research identifies trends and phenomena but does little to identify why or how they happen. Planning research is the category that seeks to explain the factors that cause or hinder a given outcome. This type of research sheds light on what the policy priorities could be and how these could become crucial for the expected outcome. An interesting case of this type of research is Cecchini and Scottâs (2003) which prioritises public policies for ICT4D initiatives to be successful. This type of research frames the possibilities of action for policymakers to consider. Research in the planning category leaves a blueprint of what should be done and in what sequence, at best. The next challenge which policymakers face is actually making a decision and implementing a policy, programme, or such to address the issue at hand. The research for planning refers to the one that identifies the key factors that affect a development outcome. In the case of ICT4D, research that finds key aspects to make a technology useful or an intervention successful would be relevant knowledge for planning. To plan a policy, the debate should focus not only âon what worksâ but also on the factors for success. Is it the capacity to use a technology, its availability, or its price? These questions allow policymakers to focus, from a myriad of options, on those that could have the most impact. Ty et al. (2012), for example, have discussed the use of ICTs for environmental planning. In their analysis, they conclude that it is not only necessary to integrate more data with the use of technologies but that, for it to be meaningful, changes in the planning process must occur. This research could inform policymakers of the need to change internal processes and not only introduce new technology. Instrumental research refers to identifying new actions or reforming current existing programmes. It is probably the most innovative aspect of research for policy. This type of research aims at creating solutions. Considering local context, specific needs, and constraints, it creates options. In this sense it is inventive and creative. Many ICT4D projects could be framed as instrumental research. These projects, however, are usually carried out outside the governmental arena. Research that takes into consideration the limitations, possibilities, and requirements for scaling up could support policymakers to view some of these ideas as valuable policy options. Action research is the fourth proposed category. Its primary focus is changing behaviours or actions through direct interventions. These types of research seek to connect researchers and practitioners directly in solving issues encountered during the implementation of an idea and tweaking issues in the process. These are usually endeavours best carried out in smaller settings with direct and constant interaction between researchers and those involved in the policy (i.e., teachers, bureaucrats, extensionists). For such research to be meaningful, strong links are necessary and researchers become not only observers but participants. In this sense,"
56,145,0.988,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"Despite the lack of data, observers on the ground tend to observe the same types of illness affecting older hostel residents. These include: problems relating to eyesight, hearing, dental health, rheumatology, arthritis, back pain, cardio-vascular disease, gastro-enterology, urinary infections, and respiratory disease (Adoma 2007; Aftam 2006; Migrations SantÃ© 2003; Sonacotra 2005). The range of illnesses experienced by residents, therefore, is no different to the rest of the elderly population (Unafo 2002). Dr. Ismail (geriatric doctor) confirmed that âitâs more or less the same schema as everywhere else in the worldâ, listing (i) cardiovascular conditions (high blood pressure, heart attacks) and (ii) âdisabilityâ linked to work accidents (back and knee pain). However there are a few specificities in hostel residentsâ health which are noteworthy. Firstly, health professionals observe a general degradation in health which afflicts hostel residents over the age of 55.3 As Anne-Marie, a crisis social worker at a hospital in the northern Paris suburbs, put it, â[those in the hostels] have let a whole load of things slide (â¦) there is a whole list of factors which bring them to hospital, generally they donât arrive for just one thing only.â Residents themselves are conscious of a certain decline in terms of health. The words of Saleem (60, Tiznit, Morocco) are characteristic in this regard: It's fine, I'm in good health, but each time I feel a negative side (â¦) I went to see the doctor, he gave me the treatment [for a prostate problem], but I don't know â what it might become or if it is going to become another illness, you just don't know. Because we â we're beginning to deteriorate inside, even if you feel OK like this, you don't know what life holds for you tomorrow."

Also in this generation, social class appeared to influence the womenâs wishes for their family life more than those of the men. At 18 some of the working-class girls felt attracted to the idea of staying at home for some years while their children are small, but said that it would depend on economy. They reacted positively to the idea of the father staying at home for a period of time, but had not really thought about it, and wondered whether he would be willing to do so. They thought housework âought toâ be shared equally, but were not sure if it would happen. The working-class girl Kine said that the most important is that someone is at home when the child is young and that she âprobably would demand that everything is to be shared equallyâ. However, she might like herself to be the one to stay at home, at least for some years. The value of sharing housework and childcare was much more prominent among the middle-class girls; for them it was a requirement, not an âoughtâ or a wish."

134,172,0.988,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"Some Concluding Thoughts This chapter has dealt with the relationship between the European Schools and higher education progression pathways. This is more significant than just considering how students move from one to the other on the educational conveyor belt common to most eighteen year olds. Whilst superficially successful in academic terms, these same progression pathways clearly demonstrate some of the more negative aspects of the wider European Schools System. By this we mean inclusion issues, as well as the deployment of a dated curriculum structure that is becoming increasingly out of step with the offer of many other European institutions. This is something which was clear in our conversations with alumni, who described being well prepared for a different kind of degree course to that which they had ultimately experienced, with theoretical rather than applied skills at the forefront of their schooling, and language skills that did not always link closely enough to workplace needs. In addition, very small teaching groups and perhaps overly conscientious tutorial nurturing sometimes contributed to low levels of individual resilience later on. The European Schools System was built with good intentions, but the product it was delivering had become decoupled from wider society. To the credit of the wider European schools family, it is the awareness of this situation as well as a desire for reform that is driving engagement with alternatives, combined with an extensive redrafting of its curriculum offer. In this way, they are challenging the effects of the very limited external moderation and scrutiny that has been the practice until now, which has allowed the system to become increasingly introspective over the decades. There is also a growing understanding that the current high cost, high academic attainment model, one of the most expensive in the world, has moved away from the original intentions of its founders, who emphasised inclusion rather than elitism. While internationalism has always been a clear and distinct strength of the system, in a globalised knowledgebased economy, this has started to hamper innovation in the face of an older curriculum model that emphasises traditional forms of knowledge. Current success in higher education access for European Baccalaureate graduates disguises a system under threat from changes to the external"

However, many challenges to realizing the goal of full inclusion remain reflecting, in many cases, gaps in implementation of the law, due also to economic constraints. Even in more advanced inclusive system, most laws have yet to be fully implemented. While it is considered perhaps the most inclusive education system in the world,62 Italy serves as an important reminder about the many challenges of translating the language and values of law into practice. Article 24 of the CRPD calls for an inclusive education system which should be flexible to meet the special needs of people with disabilities. Adjustments are especially needed to address ASD pupilsâ needs, for whom education cannot rely on centrally-determined curricula and teaching methodologies and, therefore, an individually tailored educational plan based on a set of individualized objectives should be provided. Qualified by the OHCHR has a good example of support measures consistent with Article 24 (2) (d) of the CRPD, the Individual Educational Plans (IEPs) take into account the needs of the individual child and his/her family, and require to adapt the childâs schedule and educational environment, both in and out of the classroom. In order to meet the needs of pupils with ASD, such plans should be intended as a global plan including didactic, rehabilitative, social and welfare aspects, like the PEI in Italy and the EHC plans in England. There will be some pupils with ASD whose autism is so severe that they will need a specialist support, but it does not need to be in a segregated setting. The best model is where the child with autism belongs to his peer group teacher but has the support of staff with expertise and a âhavenâ in which to recover when needed.63 There is still a role for specialist schools, but to be consistent with Article 24 of the CRPD they must have a better reason for their existence than that they pick up those who âfailâ in mainstream schooling. As it is occurring in Europe, specialist schools should be centres of excellence, pioneering new ways of working with ASD and dealing with the most extreme cases. They should be centres of research as well as teaching and have a role in working alongside mainstream schools to bring about more effective inclusion. However, special schools must be seen more as supports for an inclusive system rather than an alternative to it."

It is within this interplay of different actors, including local ones, that the (un)success of EULEX should be discussed. Yet this does not imply that EULEX could not have performed better in several areas. Last but not least, before discussing the implications, one might also question the attempt to isolate the added value of EULEXâs involvement in the rule-of-law reform and argue that certain achievements or failures have been the exclusive result of EULEXâs work. Neither EULEX nor any other international engagement in Kosovo has managed to change the fact that people in this former Yugoslav provinceâalmost 20 years after the Serbs (the FRY) de facto lost power over Kosovoâstill largely rely on particularistic networks to access resources for survival. Yet, it would be too much to expect this local characteristic, peculiar to several post-conflict societies, can be effectively reversed by a single actor. As rightly argued by Skendaj (2014, 181), every war produces economic scarcity, insecurity and generalised distrust, whereby relying on local components often literally amounts to âwho you knowâ and âwho can help youâ to provide basic needs that in more developed parts of the world are typically addressed by more or less efï¬cient state administrations. What does this mean in practice? In everyday life, which may still be improved in the direction of a modern state (supposedly always working for the greater equality and well-being of its citizens), could the rule of law have been better implemented? A wide network of people who beneï¬t directly from engaging with international actors is developing around all the international organisations in Kosovo and foreign countriesâ embassies in this ânew-born countryâ. By deï¬nition, this means some people are privileged over others and that meritocracy in, for example, the situation of getting a job is not always the case. This is yet another and hardly disputed characteristic of several post-conflict societies, not just Kosovo. The insistence of âinternationalsâ, including those of EULEX, on an inclusive concept of peacebuilding has led to the scenario whereby some locals are invited to take part in projects solely to comply with donorsâ requirement to ensure the inclusion of locals. The result in practice is that locals often agree to become subcontractors or collaborators of international organisations or foreign embassies in exchange for being awarded a project that directly beneï¬ts them in several ways (good ï¬nancial remuneration, international travel, educational and training programmes funded by international actors, and other opportunities for internationalising the careers of âchosen individualsâ). The more resourceful the international organisation, the wider the network, with EULEX being an excellent case in point. Yet, faced with limited chances to lead a decent life, the locals cannot be blamed for taking advantage of such opportunities, at least not until they work legally and work to help stabilise the country. What then are the lessons the EU and CSDP can draw from this? EULEX withdrew relatively early from its involvement in the customs reform. Given the above ï¬ndings, some might propose that EULEX similarly consider withdrawing its involvement in the Kosovo Police because the continuation of its presence there is today questionable and adds to or exacerbates the localsâ dependence on âthe"

In Chap. 5 we discuss our actual experiences with electronic surveillance; here we describe our preparations for it. We take it as given that, as Gentile puts it â(w)hen doing fieldwork in countries ruled by authoritarian regimes it is possible that phone calls, emails and letters are monitoredâ, and further assume that any online activity, or documents on online servers or in virtual clouds, may be subject to scrutiny. Our most elaborate fieldwork preparations as a group related to data security, in particular contact details of respondents and interview transcripts. Before our fieldwork, our project had organized a few digital security training sessions from an expert in this area. With hindsight though, we have come to second-guess some of our initial learnings from these sessions, which were very much inspired by a post-Snowden focus on digital surveillance and online intrusions at the expense of thinking through more traditional security threats and basic travel precautions. One common device we had agreed on was to take two laptops into the field: one for web browsing, e-mails, and so on and one secondhand laptop that never went online, but acted almost as a typewriter, for transcribing interviews. We would keep these separate from the actual contact details of these respondents. We have found, however, that applying high levels of digital security also has disadvantages. Now, we tend to think data security more in terms of trade-offs. The first is that it is simply time-consuming and cumbersome. In Kazakhstan, our researcher initially used two computers and two phones, with three SIM cards. Both the China and the Malaysia researchers took no less than three laptops into the field, a heavy load. Transcribing interviews on an offline laptop protects respondents from electronic surveillance and would make their identity hard to detect, but of course it does not offer absolute security. It also increases the chances of losing transcripts. Indeed, our researcher in Gujarat,"

In understanding nuclear engineering as a profession, the third generation must grasp that technical approaches are necessary, but not sufficient, and that both social science literacy and professional ethics development are required to achieve solutions to contemporary nuclear engineering problems with any modicum of practicality. A social and political awareness will always frame nuclear engineering issues and this must be internalized as part of an inherent sense of professional responsibility. This may not be fully achievable currently, but if the third generation can begin to think about the profession with a more expansive scope, then their role can grow stronger, professionally.

Unfortunately the variety of pedagogical responses required an increased number of teachers. The rapid increase in teacher requirement, coupled with low remuneration and state support, created a significant gap in capability. Fortunately, it seemed at the time, science had an answer. The teacher was a deep learning, online bot designed to provide the best information available. However there was no doubt of the non-natural system nor its origin. Everyone sat in front of curved screens within airy classroom. While, technically, learning could take place at home - the information was cloud based and really it was just a stack of circuits - the training systems were very expensive and clunky. No school wanted to risk de-linking the training system from the traditional training space. You could almost say that it was almost a matter of state control. That said, despite the obvious artificialness of the training artifact, the information was presented well. It took into account if you were a visual, aural or kinesthetic learner and adapted the delivery of material appropriately. Though, admittedly, there was little these systems could do for kinesthetic. The frustration however came from the requirement to learn a new training system. Fiona felt like she had used a different system every year. Sure, in the old days, the human teachers rotated like a carrousel but at least they looked the same and the teaching was the same.

The decisive question is this: Is the incompatibility due to some external factor or is it founded in the possible objects themselves? A clear case of extrinsic incompatibility is provided by (Example 1), because there is nothing in the possible children themselves that explains their joint incompatibility, which rather rests on those external factors determining the maximum number of children a woman can bear. A clear case of intrinsic incompatibility can be found in (Example 3), because it is due to the very nature of some possible daughter cells that they are not possible siblings and hence are incompatible. (Example 2) might be less easy to classify, but the strict reading of the principle of the necessity of origin we adopt for its scope would tip the scales in favor of construing the time of conception as an internal factor, because of its individuating force. Thirdly, all three examples taken together provide ample evidence for the importance of the metaphysical phenomenon of ontological competition: Some possible individuals can come to be only by cutting off the chance of existence for others (of course, they do not literally struggle). We think that this phenomenon has not received the attention it deserves. So, let us get on with modeling it in our formal ontology! Extrinsic incompatibility is easily accommodated in the general framework laid out in Sect. 3, at least if we decide to invest species membership into a model. We need only add to Ï a species-relative cardinality constraint on the number of direct descendants of any pair of possible parents, and there will be only possibilities that conform to the intuitions behind (Example 1). With intrinsic incompatibility, however, we reach the limits of what our theory of possible ancestry in its current state can achieve. There just is no natural way to model those cases of incompatibility that are due to the nature of the incompatible possibilia themselves by any general statements that act as constraints on either the global or the local level.21 In the scenario of (Example 3), what leads to the incompatibility of the possible cells D1 or E1 is no property that they might share with some other possible cells, but their individual nature. How are we to enhance our theory of possible ancestry to give it the power to model intrinsic incompatibility? There is the somewhat brutal way of adding an arbitrary filter that admits only some of our admissible sets: To the structure of possibilia âD, âºâ§ and the admissible sets defined in terms of it we add P, which is a subset of the set of admissible sets. No element of P may contain any collection of possibilia that according to our intended interpretation are intrinsically incompatible. We obtain the theory TPAcarve+filter from 20 Brandom (2008), 123. 21 We could model intrinsic incompatibilities by adding a large number of singular statements as"
384,96,0.988,Practical Economics : Economic Transformation and Government Reform in Georgia 2004â2012,"Even though inï¬ation targeting is the main policy of many central banks, still the targets themselves mostly are not derived from the best possible mix of economic growth and acceptable level of inï¬ation. As it has already been mentioned previously, central banks are charged with a gatekeeper-from-inï¬ation role, and for them keeping inï¬ation as low as possible is the top priority â not taking in consideration the economic growth forgone due to such policies. Let me take the argument against overly rigid inï¬ation control one step further. I believe that moderate inï¬ation can be a good thing â not any kind of inï¬ation, and not in all situations of course. In the twentieth century, inï¬ation has wrecked many economies and inï¬icted incredible hardship on many people. But I have also seen inï¬ation act as an investment accelerator, and I think governments should take advantage of this phenomenon. While high inï¬ation is bad, deï¬ationary pressure can also have detrimental effects on the economy â less dramatic perhaps, but potentially more prolonged. And if demand-driven economic slowdown and deï¬ationary pressure coincide, even strong economies can suffer and ï¬nd themselves facing a recession. Examples include Japan, for the past three decades, and the European Union, for almost past decade. Look at it this way. Assume you want to buy a house. Prices go down, so you decide to wait a while. You want to get a good deal, and what is the harm in holding out for a few weeks? An investor considering to buy another company will behave in much the same way, hoping that the valuation of the target will decrease. Or put yourself in the shoes of a manufacturing company. You need to buy materials, but consumer prices are now lower than they were when you made your proï¬t calculations, and"

Academic libraries help to ensure that their contents are available to inform the thinking of future generations, playing an important role in cultural continuity. This chapter argues that the academic book may evolve into something very different in the future, but that the passion of librarians for ensuring that books in whatever form are made freely available will continue to drive forward innovation and collaboration, even in the face of major social and technological changes.

How can tensions between the goals of efficiency, financial viability, and quality be resolved? What weight should be assigned to each goal by the hospital board when evaluating your performance? 5. At least in the short run, the new reforms seem to be prioritizing efficiency, viability, and quality over equity. Should a health system attain the former goals before tackling the problem of equity, or should it insist on equity from the start? 6.

170,90,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"2.2 ICT4D Model In spite of these agreements, our disparate backgrounds came into play and eventually led to contentious debates that, upon the prompting of Ballantyne, we conceded to be attendant to the process of convergence and synthesis. The opposing discussions, in fact, generated a model that many will consider coherent yet comprehensive, elegant yet parsimonious. Characteristic of the development discourse that we represented, there was an initial tendency to use the terms model, theory, framework, construct, and concept interchangeably. Indeed, the interfaces between some of these terms were quite significant. As we progressed, however, the differences became more distinct. We began to refer to a framework as a structured set of conceptual boxes wherein we can situate a narrative or approach the study of ICT4D. By theory, we meant an explanation of the causal relationships among the elements that make up the ICT4D phenomenon. By ICT4D model, we meant a visual representation of how elements making up the ICT4D phenomenon interacted. At The Hague meeting, the ICT4D model became the visual representation of the ICT4D framework. The elements are, in effect, ICT4D concepts, and a statement of relationship between two or more of these concepts was considered a construct. Constructs Theoretically, the model takes off from a generally acknowledged construct: Communication can effect developmental changes in societies. This proposition had been tried and tested since the 1950s through the 1970s in the works of Beal et al. (1957), Rogers (1962), and Quebral (1973). In fact, this idea is being actively revived in the current C4D (communication for development) initiative within UN agencies."
212,223,0.988,Life Cycle Management,"In most companies, sustainability goals are set top-down. In the corporate sustainability strategy, goals are set for energy, water and climate change, for example. Business units and departments are then given the task to achieve these goals and start various projects to realize these goals in the timeframe given. The projects are topic, location or process specific and do not take trade-offs into account. Based on the goals, companies want to measure the results to report on them and improve their performance. Often it turns out to be quite hard to report and improve the goals. They were not really substantiated by insights on a business and product level which is where the improvements have to be achieved (left column of Fig. 9.2), and let alone the negative trade-offs these improvements could have. LCA is much more a bottom-up approach as it starts at a product level. In the product or service life cycle it is identified where a product has its impact. LCA can deliver insights in what impacts occur for each impact category and life cycle stage. It enables us to identify hotspots and improvement opportunities, from material selection to pinpointing the most impactful supplier, from process innovations to contributions of each phase. However, at the same time LCA struggles to link these hotspots and improvement opportunities to the KPIs of the company (see column 2 of Fig. 9.2), especially as these are often formulated in a different language. TSC has done some great work to link hotspots to KPIs, but adding the top-down route is essential to make it company specific and meaningful for management. An integrated approach provides a unique opportunity to achieve maximum alignment of product and corporate strategies (Furfori et al. 2014). To increase the impact of LCA, the LCA practitioner and the LCA department need to connect the dots. To take the lead in this you can create an overview of business and project KPIs and combine these with the hotspots you identified through LCA studies (Fig. 9.2). Based on those insights and KPIs, projects for improvement can be identified. This approach helps to link the product level with the business/ corporate level. It brings together the sustainability insights on a corporate and product level. By doing this you can identify sweet spots, overlap in hotspots as well as blind spots. It also brings together different departments when it shows they need to collaborate to achieve their goals. The same applies for suppliers; based on the hotspots the most relevant suppliers for the sustainability goals â which is not the same as the most important suppliers in terms of costs â can be pinpointed. By doing this the sustainability strategy gets more substantiated and goals become"

It is precisely this capacity for joint attention that causes us to feel lost in the inordinate flow of requests, messages, instructions and information so well described by Gergen (2000). Our capacity to join into othersâ attentional spaces, read intentions from minimal traces, attribute meaning and co-ordinate around presumed shared mental states, means that we are able to collaborate on the reduced fragments of data because we can fill in the gaps. Clearly, when the experience is impoverished or the intentions of the other are too opaque and it is difficult to assume that the system is actually functioning with a principle of relevance, the communicational process becomes extremely costly. This cost may be part of the subjective feeling of loss and fatigue. In this case, the issue of attentional strain is not one of overload or excess, but of impoverishment, unintelligibility and incompleteness."
93,346,0.988,Nordic Mediation Research,"As described, restorative justice theory often entails a triangular approach to an offence with the corners made up by offender, offended party, and community. In the practices I have observed, especially the involvement of the âcommunityâ seems to pose a challenge. What is the community? How can/should it be involved? In my observations there are different takes on this matter: In Northern Irish conferences, the âcommunityâ is involved if relevant. In the restorative meetings of the Norwegian sanctions it seems to be the public ânetworkâ of the young offenderâfor instance, a teacher and/or a local police ofï¬cerâwho largely stand in for the role of âcommunityâ. In the Florida conferences, the role of âcommunityâ was played by a board of civil volunteers from the area who had no connection to either offender, offended party or offence. To me the diverse interpretations of âcommunityâ in the three models suggest that the triangular model of the restorative theories might be just thatâtheoreticâbut often difï¬cult to put into a meaningful large scale practice. And as I see it, with no offended party present, and with the estranged âcommunityâ boardâhaving no direct relations to the offender of offenceâthe restorative/conï¬ict theories of Zehr, Braithwaite, Christie, and VindelÃ¸v seem extra hard to recognise in the Florida programs."
309,98,0.988,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"Conclusion Over centuries, Vietnamese taste preferences evolved as new ingredients and new dishes became available. People in power made evolving claims about what foods Vietnamese people ought to eat, or ought to avoid. The disjunction between what a person ate (or wanted to eat) and what society said they should eatâbased on their class, gender, or ethnicityâwas definitely a source of anxiety. Had a youth outgrown the right to pillage the âwandering soulsâ offerings? Was it nurturing for a wife to adjust meals to her Chinese husbandâs tastes or a sign she was losing her culinary culture? Was feeding milk to oneâs children just maternal love, or a sign of collaboration with the French? Despite such concerns, for many Vietnamese in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the larger problem was simply getting enough food to eat. When the French controlled the region, individual French people felt little concern about where their next meal was coming from. Instead, the blatant illegitimacy of their rule led to protracted anxiety about losing"

Through stepwise and comparative empirical research on media-related changes in certain communicative figurations, we can gain a bigger picture that shows the more complex processes of societal transformations. In this introductory chapter, we want to outline this figurational perspective and in so doing develop an approach for empirically investigating transforming communications. To do this, we will first reflect on our changing media environment, which we understand as marked by deep mediatization. Second, we will argue that mediatization research is right to emphasize the domain specificity of (deep) mediatization. However, we need to sharpen the idea of social domain. On this basis, we want to argue how far it is helpful to investigate transforming communications by analyzing changing âcommunicative figurationsâ. Finally, in the conclusion we will make some remarks about what this means for practical empirical research."

Pain continues to be one of the symptoms that people with advanced disease fear and yet research clearly shows that pain management is not always achieved in a consistent and a robust manner. This may be as of a result of a number of reasons including lack of knowledge around â what is meant by pain, which drugs to use, the most therapeutic doses, non-pharmacological approaches and failing to understand what pain means to the individual. While pain is often classified as nociceptive, neuropathic, refractory, breakthrough, chronic or acute and this is important to consider when assessing pain and choosing treatment options, pain can also be understood as a disturbance or a disruption in personal relationships which should be considered (Table 14.4).

The inherited image of the prophet is that of an inspired individual conveying a message that is vouchsafed to him by virtue of his special proximity to the divine. He then gathers around himself a band of followers who may reduce his teaching to writing. He and they have an ambivalent relation to the temporal authorities of the societies in which they emerge. The core creed of democracy is faith in the constructive genius of ordinary men and women and therefore as well in the dissemination of prophetic powers among them. The democratic answer to the question âWho is the prophet?â must be: everyone. Everyone can and should act, according to his circumstance, in a prophetic spirit. Society and culture may be so organised that they either nurture or discourage the widespread development and exercise of such powers. The social innovation movement must be, in this sense, prophetic. It must both act in a prophetic spirit and use the instruments characteristic of prophecy under democracy. Therein lies the larger meaning of the method of foreshadowing. The second practice distinguishing the movement is the method of incursion â innovation in our economic and political arrangements, proposed and launched from a base outside both the economy and politics. The innovators have a seat in civil society outside both the state and the market. The powers of society are never reduced to the activities of market exchange or of governmental politics alone. It is in society, insofar as it is not wholly shaped by our economic and political arrangements, that the social innovation movement finds the cradle in which it is nurtured. The category of the âthird sectorâ is inadequate to describe this reality; a set of âthird-sectorâ or non-governmental organisations is no more than a fragment of this vast part of social experience, which towers, as if it were a horizon, over both the market and the state. It is from some place in those trans-political and trans-economic parts of society that the social innovators most often begin their work. (Social innovators may also take their point of departure from some place within either market action or governmental activity. Then they often have to face, at the outset, obstacles that the innovators who start outside the economy and the state would have to confront only when they later began to challenge economic or political arrangements.) Regardless of where the social innovators take their initial steps, they do not end where they began. Having started in one part of social life,"

In approaching risk communication and learning, we test different ways and methods from 2004 to nowadays. Here we describe two cases study we develop in the last four years in which students and experts have collaborated in preparing (1) a participated exhibition on the 2011 flood that severely hit the land of La Spezia and surrounding, and (2) a flipped-up learning tool. The participated exhibition is Piovono Idee! (Cloudy with a Chance of ideas!) and it is the result of expertsâ interaction directly in school, focus groups and hands on activities. Students involved had experience the disaster and could put their emotion into their products. Exhibits of the interactive path tell us their own history. Primary and secondary schools in areas strongly affected by the flood of the 25th October 2011âBorghetto Vara, Brugnato, Monterosso, Vernazza, Riomaggiore, Pignone, RiccÃ² del Golfo, Aulla and Ragnaia (Aulla)âand secondary schools from the city of La Spezia were directly involved in the participatory action. Planning, creation and exhibition were the three main phases of the action to improve their speciï¬c scientiï¬c knowledge with hands-on activities, while exploring feelings and emotions triggered by the experience of a flood. The learn-by playing approach is also used to instil appropriate behaviours and the awareness that every actions we take derives from a choice: we can chose whether or not be respectful towards nature. Even little actions can turn into negative or positive consequences as it is sudden evident in Piovono idee!. Indeed the learning path starts with the question: âIs nature scary?â shows a colored and smiling Nature full of gifts, which can became angry simply poking on it. The discovery of hydrogeological risk continues focusing on the importance to respect territory and on the correct land use with different totems, exhibits, experiments, scientiï¬c games. It emotionally involves the participants to favor reflective learning (Piangiamore et al. 2014, 2015). The latest activities are two role games to enforce eco-friendly behaviors for hydrological risk mitigation. A few years later, Piovono idee! was updated and the exhibition got fully portable since 2015 and ready to travel the schools of the country to involve as many citizens as possible. The second edition of Piovono idee! (Fig. 4) is also an example of peer-education activity as students of the High School of La Spezia and of the Secondary school of Lerici, that were not directly and emotionally involved in the disaster, have played the role of the guides for general public (BernhardsdÃ³ttir et al. 2012; Piangiamore et al. 2016). The flipped-up learning tool is the EAS Floods: what to do?, an application of the Episodes of Situated Learning (EAS) method to natural hazard education (Rivoltella 2014; Piangiamore et al. 2015).

Articulate a shared objective In addition, the articulation of a common objectiveâthe creation of a sense of âweâre all in this togetherââmay also help connect the actorsâ contradictory, divergent, and misaligned perspectives on technology entrepreneurship in Nairobi. Often, the actorsâ differing backgrounds and interests overshadow their shared common interests. Most saliently, this manifests between local and foreign actors, where the localsâ mantra of âThis is how we do things in Kenyaâ stands in opposition to foreignersâ stance of adhering to their own ways of doing things. Emphasizing a larger overarching objective, such as the goal of building one of Africaâs first sustainable technology entrepreneurship communities, could align the actors under a shared vision and help bridge their differences. Policymakers and technology thought leaders who reflect on the role of technology entrepreneurship in Kenyaâs economy at large may be especially well positioned to articulate such a shared vision. A more explicit articulation of the specificities and visions associated with technology entrepreneurship in particular might allow the nonlocal actors to root their expectations and perspectives in local realities rather than in unexamined hopes and expectations about what it might have meant to build technology businesses in Nairobi."

All of the networks have weaknesses that could be addressed to help them become more successful engines of social innovation. Innocentive could become better at building the kind of community observed in OSE, which might lead to a greater degree of collaboration in developing innovations past the initial idea. OSE might benefit from becoming less reliant on the leadership of Marcin Jakubowski and the relatively insular OSE community, perhaps by promoting its ability to share ideas as widely as TED has done (and indeed its success is in part due to TED) and by finding new ways to attract resources (as Innocentive did). Finally, TED could, perhaps, benefit from finding concrete applications for ideas and forming a community willing to help make ideas a reality (there are signs that this is happening). However, in each of these cases the platform in question risks losing something by expanding its remit. Innocentive might become less diverse by building a stronger and more committed community; OSE might become fragmented by turning away from the vision that drives it; and a more action-oriented TED might come to be seen as a political actor rather than a neutral repository of knowledge, reducing the breadth of its appeal. Ultimately, perhaps it is very difficult for any single platform to be effective in all stages of the development of a social innovation. As might be expected, based on network theory, there are trade-offs involved in choosing to support either the formation of a strongly bonded community or shadow network or the formation of more loosely coupled cross-scale communities. Equally though, there are opportunities to draw on mechanisms that the platforms themselves were not doing enough to exploit, such as Innocentiveâs failure to promote greater use of its forums or TEDâs hesitation around mobilising its potential as a network organisation. Ultimately, this study suggests that those interested in promoting social innovation should make greater use of the full range of collective intelligence platforms in order best to use the strengths of each. However, it is acknowledged here that more work is needed to investigate further the patterns suggested by this exploratory study."

This means that patients can now register whether they allow all or no organs to be donated, whether they want only some organs to be donated, or whether the decision is to be made of next of kin. Another example of enhancing an already existing system is the program for colon cancer screening, which all Danes between 50 and 74 years are offered. Through sundhed. dk, it is possible to opt out of this screening. Third, sundhed.dk also utilizes and repurposes already familiar infrastructures for their users. For example, authentication that citizens are familiar with from banking and other public electronic service was introduced in 2009 (i.e., NemID). By exploiting an authentication method, which is available to and widely used by the Danish population, sundhed.dk is readily available to the Danes. Although existing data sources, systems, and registries are repurposed through the e-health portal, the organization behind sundhed.dk avoids âdata managementâ responsibilities. Rather, the solutions and data repositories which sundhed.dk links to or integrates with are themselves responsible for data management. For example, if the user has questions regarding data presented via sundhed.dk, the entities in the health service, which provided the health service and subsequently health data, are the point of contact. The role sundhed.dk has had in terms of being a public, authoritative site on health without having any form of responsibilities for the data displayed was ânew turfâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). The fact that Danish health authorities have a long tradition of registering data and providing local health services challenges the repurposing and enhancing of existing data on the portal. For example, the partners have started to discuss and agree upon who owns what and how (representative, SSI). Furthermore, the repurposing and enhancing of existing healthcare services has gradually changed the way in which partners perceive the organization behind the e-health portal. They have started to question the role of the portal and they voice their critique of sundhed.dk for not having ensured that its strategy is aligned with that of the partners. They question the overall direction of the portal: âIt seems that it is the jukebox principle that defines what services are developed. To us it is not clear what are the criteria for prioritizing servicesâ¦ the strategy is not clear and sometimes I wonder if the strategy is technically driven in the sense of âwe have this new thingâ and then they build it without any overarching strategyâ (representative, the regions). For sundhed.dk, establishing a clear strategy is further challenged by the fact that there is not one common strategy for healthcare in Denmark: âIt gets really complicated when you have so many strategies in play â the Digitization Strategy and the Healthcare Digitization Strategy at a national level, the Healthcare IT Strategy at a regional level, and then the municipalities have their own strategyâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). Whereas there is a common understanding of the overall vision of sundhed.dk, the existing ideas and strategies among the partners seem to be difficult to reconcile. In addition, partners question whether a regional strategy is more important compared to a national initiative. These concerns reflect the third mode of capitalizing on the installed base, which has to do with the engagement of multiple stakeholders, as we discuss next."
309,131,0.988,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"bonding reinforced by partaking in activities that are both illegal (hunting wildlife is banned) and morally problematic (overindulgence, drunkenness, and extramarital paid sex). Following my working rule of âaccepting every invitationâ (Avieli 2012b), I never refused an invitation to join in a jungle meat restaurant or jungle meat meal cooked at home, though I generally prefer to stay away from illegal activities, and despite my objection to wild life hunting. I also found it very hard to eat the flesh of animals whose death I witnessed. This turned out to be awkward: joining the table but avoiding the meat was not merely a refusal to âbreak breadâ, but also abuse of the trust bestowed upon me by my hosts. They allowed me to observe them breaking the law and transgress moral standards, but my refusal to eat the food and embody the transgression, as it were, meant that now I had potentially implicating information about my hosts, but since I did not partake in the actual eating, they did not have the same kind of implicating information about me. My hosts were therefore adamant that I eat or, at least, try the meat, and were visibly upset when I refused. This dynamic was also common in cases were hostesses and potential paid sex were involved. Engaging in paid sex is perhaps the least kept secret of Hoianese men. The subject would come up in many male-only conversations and meetings, usually as a joke or a comment. But if I wouldnât protest or otherwise signal reservation, the conversation would very quickly turn into straightforward discussion of the potential of the waitress or some other women as a sex partner. This would often develop into an ambiguous invitation to pursue sex. I was interested in the subject and the discourse surrounding it, so I usually âpassedâ the first stage, with jokes turning into serious conversations regarding sexual practices, qualities, choices, availability, and price. However, the fact that I took notes and my eventual refusal to engage in paid sex were often met with dismay and discomfort. If I would have avoided the subject or presented a critical/moralistic position to begin with, it would probably be ok. But engaging in a conversation and asking for details that only practitioners would know, and later refuse to take part in the activity itself, was not only surprising but also perceived negatively by people who did not know me well."

The main distinction between the two ârealitiesâ is not, however, whether they are virtual as opposed to real, but rather whether thay are fictitious as opposed to public. The use of reason is still to some extent public in Arkadievitchâ case, while fictitious as far as Breivik is concerned. However, although the virtual character of the communication is not the main source of the problem, there still seems to be a non-trivial connection between virtual environments and a fictitious public, as virtual realities appear to be a necessary, though not a sufficient condition for fictitiousness. It could easily be argued that the distinction between the real and the fictitious equals the difference that could be drawn between the real and the virtual.7 This is, however, misleading, as a virtual reality may very well be communicative in e.g. a Habermasian sense, where communication is based on public use of reason. As an example there have been several occasions of political activist actions starting with mobilizing people in a virtual world online before spreading offline (Thorseth 2006). By contrast, the public in Breivikâs case is based in fictitious use of reason, while pretending to make appeals to a real and universal audience. As mentioned earlier, Cass Sunstein and many others have written extensively on the problem of filtering and group polarisation. A distinction between real and virtual worlds is anticipated to be the relevant distinction, and the virtual tends to be associated with a radical threat to public reason. From the arguments above I shall claim that this is partly misconceived, as the real threat rather has to do with fictitious publics. Against this one could of course object that the fictitious character needs not necessarily be associated with a threat to public reason since there need not necessarily be an internal link between extreme ideologies and their fictitiousness. This is the reason for my claim that the fictitious character should be procedurally defined. The fictitious character of a claimed public should be defined by its communicative methods. As a consequence it is an open issue whether fictitious publics need to prevail. This procedural criterion is based on an argument developed in Thorseth, arguing in favour of a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate paternalism in polyethnic conflicts (Thorseth 1999). Briefly, the salient point is that a claim on publicizability is basic to recognition. Unwillingness to discuss publicly what has already become contested in the public domain is in some cases based on procedural fundamentalism, as e.g. depriving others of autonomous âyesâ of ânoâ.8 Here I want to establish that real and virtual publics are not moral opposites, while the contrast"
3,65,0.988,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"2.4.1.3.1 Theoretical Background The knowledge integration framework was built off of the knowledge in pieces theory (diSessa, 1988), the anchored instruction framework (The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990), situated learning in collaborative groups (Brown & Campione, 1994; Lave & Wenger, 1991), and research that suggests that learning outcomes in science instruction would be best served when one focuses on a smaller number of core concepts (Bierman, Massey, & Manduca, 2006; Eylon & Linn, 1988). These perspectives are explained in the paragraphs that follow. According to the knowledge in pieces theory, students come to school having developed intuitive theories of how physical objects behave under particular circumstances; some of these mini-theories come close to describing phenomena of interest accurately, while others are farther away from describing said phenomena accurately (diSessa, 1988; Taber, 2008). Such mini-theories are not developed as most theories areâthrough careful reflection on a variety of observations in light of other research and theories. Rather, they are âabstractions from common experiencesââsuch as the idea that force can move objects (diSessa, 1988, p. 3). These mini-theories do not together constitute a larger, more comprehensive theory. Furthermore, students do not have the right pieces of knowledge to together explain how physical objects behave in a scientifically accurate way. Some research has suggested that such incomplete mini-theories do not necessarily prompt the teaching of correct information to replace the existing mini-theories (Spada, 1994). Rather, instruction needs to help fill in the gaps in studentsâ knowledge (diSessa, 1988). In anchored instruction, studentsâ learning is centered in an authentic problem situation, which prompts students to define and pursue learning issues (Bransford,"
124,267,0.988,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"2.2 Saying Versus Asserting In light of the speech act/act of speech distinction, it should also be plausible that one can say that P (for some indicative sentence P) without asserting P. Oneâs saying that P may not even be a speech act, as in the microphone case above. Or one might put forth P as a conjecture, guess, or supposition for the sake of argument instead of asserting P. All this would be too banal to merit mention were it not for the fact that some prominent authors have used these terms in idiosyncratic ways. For instance, Grice uses âsayâ in such a way that one who says that P must also speaker mean that P. (This is why he treats ironical utterances (âNice job!â said to a server who drops a bowl of calamari on my lap) as cases of making as if to say, rather than as cases of saying; otherwise Grice would fall in line with more common usage according to which the speaker said, âNice job!â but meant something else (Grice 1989))."
23,111,0.988,Anti-Vivisection and The Profession of Medicine in Britain : a Social History,"The same might have been said of any hospital, but vegetarianism troubled the BMA because they thought doctors were recommending it on religious or socio-political grounds rather than medical ones. Whether a regime worked in practice was immaterial if it was chosen for the wrong reasons: what the BMA was opposed to was ideological medicine, insisting that the individual patientâs best interests must be addressed disinterestedly in every case. Of course, one could find many examples where mainstream medicine was as ideological as any of the alternatives, but the principle that doctors should not impose their own moral values on patients left vegetarians and anti-vivisectionists vulnerable to accusations that they were pushing their own ethical agenda. The Master of the Rolls (Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal) did, however, dismiss an objection from the professionâs leaders that a vegetarian hospital should not operate as a charity because its primary purpose was âthe propagation of a fadâ rather than the treatment of the sick, though the courts later came to the opposite conclusion with regard to antivivisection charities, with dire consequences for their funding.18"
297,997,0.988,The R Book,"Errors may be non-normal for several reasons. They may be skew, with long tails to the left or right. Or they may be kurtotic, with a ï¬atter or more pointy top to their distribution. In any case, the theory is based on the assumption of normal errors, and if the errors are not normally distributed, then we shall not know how this affects our interpretation of the data or the inferences we make from it. It takes considerable experience to interpret normal error plots. Here we generate a series of data sets where we introduce different but known kinds of non-normal errors. Then we plot them using a simple home-made function called mcheck (ï¬rst developed by John Nelder in the original GLIM language; the name stands for âmodel checkingâ). The idea is to see what patterns are generated in normal plots by the different kinds of non-normality. In real applications we would use the generic plot(model) rather than mcheck (see below). First, we write the function mcheck. The idea is to produce two plots, side by side: a plot of the residuals against the ï¬tted values on the left, and a plot of the ordered residuals against the quantiles of the normal distribution on the right. mcheck <- function (obj, ...){ rs <- obj$resid fv <- obj$fitted windows(7,4) par(mfrow=c(1,2)) plot(fv,rs,xlab=""Fitted values"",ylab=""Residuals"",pch=16,col=""red"") abline(h=0, lty=2) qqnorm(rs,xlab=""Normal scores"",ylab=""Ordered residuals"",main="""",pch=16) qqline(rs,lty=2,col=""green"") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) invisible(NULL) }"

Townsend reiterated the need for more support for older people living alone, and for families caring for them, to prevent âdumpingâ (Townsend 1962, pp. 106â108, 1965, p. 233). GPs held the key to community medical and nursing resources and to hospital services. Stephen Taylor (later, Lord Taylor of Harlow), a physician, investigated thirty outstanding general practices, aiming to depict practice worthy of adoption elsewhere. Taylor noted diverse views about older people. Some GPs thought that, with time and patience, working with them could be rewarding. Others viewed them as âdifï¬cult, and even unpleasant . . . often inarticulate, hard to get to know, and slow to respondâ (Taylor 1954, p. 413). One husband and wife GP team, Cuthbert and Beatrice Watts, wrote gloomily that âsenile demensiaâ (sic) is common in the âlast decade of lifeâ, âNothing can be done for these unfortunate peopleâ and older people âcan be most difï¬cult and tryingâ (Watts and Watts 1952, pp. 140,145). Some GPs were aware of the need to support families, but others thought it best to advise them that providing care âcan only have an adverse effect on their own lives, without beneï¬ting the patientâs in the slightestâ, and because âno additional help can be sufï¬cient to make it bearableâ, admission to long-stay care was preferable (Gibson 1957, p. 111). Conveniently for GPs, this ï¬tted with psychiatristsâ views that their hospitals had an obligation to fulï¬l GPsâ requests âto admit the elderly dementing type of patients from the catchment areaâ.19 Psychiatrists genuinely tried to help older people by admitting them when they had nowhere else to go and no one to help them with the essentials of daily life,20 but neither GPs nor psychiatrists were keen to actively work with them (Watts and Watts 1952, p. 140). Tensions existed between GPs and the psychiatric hospitals, as David Enoch, a consultant psychiatrist at Shelton Hospital, Shrewsbury, described in the early 1960s: GPs used to ring us up and say: âAn old bird is on the way to you.â Sometimes we were lucky if we even had a message at all! When we went round in the week we were told that there were three people over 80 that had been âpushed in.â The matron and the chief male nurse just had to ï¬nd a bed. These patients merely appeared. I have great respect for the local authority and those trying to deal with the chronic sick â but Shelton was the âdumping groundâ for this county. I think the hospital deserves a medal.21"
163,186,0.988,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"Abstract Taxes are repetitive exchanges that trigger taxpayersâ expectations. In this sense taxation can be said to be a âtotal social phenomen[on]â which, according to Marcel Mauss, has three obligations: to give, to receive and to give again. Taxes have been givenâtaken is perhaps more appropriate as most taxpayers do not have a choiceâbut there is clearly an expectation of receiving something in return. Taxation also create expectations on other members in society; that they also give and receive something backâon approximately the same level as I do. Seeing taxation as creating reciprocal relations makes for a deeper understanding of why people both comply with taxes and avoid doing soâincluding the everyday quid pro quo exchanges.

282,53,0.988,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"For corporations, the argument has been developed most extensively in stakeholder theory. A stakeholder, in the original definition of R. Edward Freeman, is âany group or individual who is affected by or can affect the achievement of an organizationâs objectivesâ (Freeman, 1984, p. 5). The normative claim is that stakeholder groups should have a say in important decisions of the institutions they are affected by. Again, in Freemanâs words, each of these stakeholder groups has a right not to be treated as a means to some end, and therefore must participate in determining the future direction of the firm in which they have a stake. (Freeman, 2001, p. 39) What Freeman is advocating is much more than just consulting stakeholders before taking decisions. He envisages a system in which the claims of other stakeholder groups have the same weight as the interests of shareholders. The goal of his theory is to replace âthe notion that managers have a duty to stockholders with the concept that managers bear a fiduciary relationship to stakeholdersâ (Freeman, 2001, p. 39). Kenneth Goodpaster calls this the âmulti-fiduciary stakeholder synthesisâ and explains that this would involve a management team processing stakeholder information by giving the same care to the interests of, say, employees, customers, and local communities as to the economic interests of stockholders. [â¦ And] all stakeholders are treated by management as having equally important interests, deserving joint âmaximizationâ. (Goodpaster, 2002, p. 53) Stakeholder theory thus falls clearly into the category of arguments justifying accountability on the basis of power. Stakeholders include those who are influenced by a companyâs activities.7 They are said to have a right to be included in decision making, which means that the company has the corresponding duty to establish an accountability mechanism working through participation. Many advocates of stakeholder theory simply assert that there is a moral basis for this claim, rather than argue for it.8 As his last quote indicates, however, Freeman does make the normative argument and bases his claims on a Kantian deontological approach to ethics.9 According to this approach, acts are ethical when they are guided by considerations of rights and duties, not consequences.10 For Kant, the defining characteristic of humans is their capacity to reason. Reason enables humans to transcend their desires, make ethical judgements and act accordingly. This free will gives humans dignity and constitutes their unconditional worth."
299,309,0.988,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"First, the potential offenders must be members of an identifiable group, such as a close-knit religious or ethnic community. Second, the legal sanctions must actually compromise potential offendersâ group social standing. That is, the affected group must concur with the legal decisionmakerâs estimation of what is, or should be, humiliating to group members. Third, the shaming must be communicated to the group and the group must withdraw from the offenderâshun herâphysically, emotionally, financially, or otherwise. Fourth, the shamed person must fear withdrawal by the group. Finally, the shamed person must be afforded some means of regaining community esteem, unless the misdeed is so grave that the offender must be permanently exiled or demoted. But, Massaro adds, the âcultural conditions of effective shaming seem weakly present, at best, in many contemporary American cities.â While granting that it is unfair to say that âAmericans have no commonly shared instincts about crime or about shame,â Massaro believes that âAmerican subculturism, or cultural pluralism, is pronounced enough to make broad conclusions about our moral coherence suspect, and thus to undermine the likely effectiveness of widespread government attempts to shame offenders, absent significant decentralization of criminal law authority and the delivery of formal norm enforcement power to the local subculturesâ (Massaro 1991, p. 1923; see also Markel 2007, p. 1385). Massaro and others who draw on communitariansâ arguments do not take into account that while communities clearly are much weaker now than they were in, for instance, colonial days, they are not powerless, especially in smaller towns and in what have been called urban villages, numerous ethnic concentrations in big cities that form rather strong communitiesâChinatown in New York City, for instance. Otherwise shaming would be no punishment at all. People are, however, very reluctantâashamedâto drive around with a DUI marker on their car or to take ads in their town newspaper that contain their picture, apologizing for their offenses. Indeed, an accountant, who was sentenced to stand in his neighborhood with a sign âI embezzled fundsâ seemed deeply distraught when interviewed, and mused that he might have been better off if he had instead accepted a jail sentence. Hardly indifference. A woman convicted of welfare fraud in Eau Claire, Wisconsin preferred to be jailed than wear a sign admitting, âI stole food from poor people.â In arguing about these matters with liberal criminologists, I picked up a useful distinction between two kinds of shaming, one that isolates and is to be avoided, and one that reintegrates offenders into communities and is to be preferred. Liberal criminologists worry that once a person is shamed, he will be cut off from his community and withdraw into himself or worse, into a criminal subculture, and hence will be unlikely to be rehabilitated. Instead, criminologists suggest dealing with crimes in a way that restores people to good standing in their communities. The measures they favor include face-to-face meetings of the offenders and the victims, âfacilitatedâ by community members; the offenders making amends (for instance, rebuilding a fence their car demolished); and closure, a ritual of reconciliation and forgiveness, all of which restore the offender to full membership in the community. David Karp (1998, p. 292), a criminologist, adds, âThese efforts may be through"
175,1078,0.988,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","9.5.9 Interactive Methods Interactive methods allow participants in the planning process to explore the range of possible decisions without having to generate all of them, especially those of little interest to the participants. One such iterative approach, called the step method, requires, at each iteration preference, information from the participants in the process. This information identiï¬es constraints on various objective values. The weighting method is used to get an initial solution on the efï¬ciency frontier. The weights, wj, are calculated based on the relative range of values each objective j can assume, and on whether or not the participants have indicated satisfaction regarding a particular objective value obtained from a previous solution. If they are satisï¬ed with the value of, say, an objective Zj(X), they must indicate how much of that value they would be willing to give up to obtain unspeciï¬ed improvements in objectives whose values they consider unsatisfactory. This deï¬nes a lower bound on Zj(X). Then the weight wj for that objective is set to 0, and the weights of all remaining objectives are recalculated. The problem is again solved. The process is repeated until some best compromise plan is identiï¬ed. This step method guides the participants in the planning and management process among non-inferior alternatives toward the plan or solution the participants consider best without requiring an exhaustive generation of all non-inferior alternatives. Even if the best compromise solution is not identiï¬ed or agreed upon, the method provides a way for participants to learn what the tradeoffs are in the region of solutions of interest to them. However, the participants must be willing to indicate how much of some objective value can be reduced to obtain some unknown improvement of other objective values. This is not as easy as indicating how much more is desired of any or all objectives whose values are unsatisfactory. To overcome this objection to the step method, other interactive methods have been developed. These begin with an obviously inferior solution. Based on a series of questions"
136,216,0.988,Principles and Practice of Case-Based Clinical Reasoning Education : a Method For Preclinical Students,"Course Development for CBCR Introducing just CBCR on top of a medical curriculum that already exists is possible and does not require a major organizational change in infrastructure and a long timeline to fundamentally reform a full undergraduate program. In fact, the introduction of a CBCR course following the format presented in this book can be relatively simple. However, a case-based clinical reasoning course as described in earlier chapters exemplifies many of the characteristic of what has been called a âmodernâ medical curriculum, since an acronym for that (SPICES) was introduced in the 1980s (Harden et al. 1984): Student centered (particularly through the peer teaching approach), Problem based (clinical problems are the focus), Integrated (its differential diagnostic approach crosses the boundaries of clinical specialties, and applied basic science can be incorporated), Community based (depending on the cases used, this can be a focus), elective (the course is usually mandatory but can be elective), and Systematic (CBCR is an example of a very systematic approach to clinical education). Introducing CBCR in an existing traditional curriculum, as has been done in several Eastern-European countries, can be a first step to a school acquainted with modern approaches to medical education. In Table 9.2 steps for course development are suggested, with reference to both Kernâs six-step approach and the definition of a curriculum given earlier. As CBCR is only a course, the development is simplified. The implementation of a new CBCR course should be planned well ahead. Particularly the writing of high-quality cases can take much more time than one would initially think or hope. Some clinicians are excellent, naturally born case writers; others need a lot of assistance and editing support. Given the fact that many will do this in spare hours, the planning ahead of a new CBCR course should take at least one full year before the real start."
334,328,0.988,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Peutz and De Genova have pointed out how deportation âthrough its routinized practiceâ obscures how âdeportability is produced and imposedâ (2010, 6). The case of the Alliance against Deportations shows that employing the broader meaning of deportability can lead to a deeper understanding of anti-deportation protests. This framework makes visible the struggles and consequences of the protests that go beyond the moment of a deportation or prevention. For our analysis, we have looked at isolation, private visibility/ public invisibility, and uncertainty as crucial dimensions of deportability. Through applying these concepts, we asked how the collective protests in OsnabrÃ¼ck, which brought together a wide range of participants with and without secure residence status, confronted these dimensions. We found that the collectivity of the protests in OsnabrÃ¼ck was, in itself, part of how the participants questioned deportability. Namely, by getting to know each other and in some cases also building relationships of trust, people with different positionalities were challenging the isolation produced by the exclusionary policies"
237,50,0.988,The Academic Book of the Future,"Any thoughts about this topic must first rip off the physical covers of the âbookâ and move swiftly into the digital realm. This thinking immediately raises a number of issues around form, substance, supply chains, delivery platforms, and discoverability. Questions then spring up around business models. Thereafter, heated ideological, philosophical, pedagogical and political debates leave people either exhilarated or exhausted. One thing is clear though. The meaning of the word âbookâ itself will change forever and will never again be confined to that of a physical object to be held, admired, loved, subject to spilt coffee or burning by dictators. The âbookâ will be defined more around its function than any of its other characteristics. Books have evolved alongside academic practices, which form an increasingly complex interdisciplinary web. These academic practices and realities have the potential to change with exponential speed, courtesy of digital technologies and knowledge infrastructures that are rushing (some would say struggling) to catch up. The concept of âknowledge infrastructuresâ is a useful lens through which to focus on this topic. Christine Borgman defines knowledge infrastructures as the âecology of people, practices, technologies, institutions, material objects and their relationships within each disciplineâ.1 Publishers are part of this ecology. How are these infrastructures being transformed by the new digital affordances? What impact are these changes having on scholarly communications? And, what are the implications for the academic âbookâ? Its function will be determined by where it finds itself located within these new infrastructures. Whatever the new functions of the âbookâ are to be, they will be influenced by the existing scaffolding around scholarly communications â as built up by publishers, libraries, intermediaries, funder requirements, tenure committees, and so on. The transition we are experiencing is taking place within a charged environment of conflicting and competing forces. Many are excited about these new digital affordances. But in reality, there are sunken investments in existing scaffolding within the ecology, entrenched interests in the status quo, and very real concerns about the varying speed at which good people who care about scholarship are able to adapt (or not) to the new world. At a workshop convened by the Sloan Foundation,2 participants agreed that some of the most salient features of the new knowledge infrastructures are that: â(1) borders of tacit knowledge and common ground are shifting; (2) complexities of sharing data across disciplines and domains DOI: 10.1057/9781137595775.0011"

Skills and available information are however a constraint to consumption of those goods that require a higher level of skills or information. Next to absolute limitations of personal aptitude, the necessary money and time needed to acquire the specific skills can be a relevant obstacle to consumption. Examples are leisure activities such as operating a small sailing boat, constructing the own furniture, or playing the piano. However, the idea of a knowledge based society and the growing offers of online courses for virtually everything and instructions and courses offered by do-it-yourself markets are however eroding the limitation of information. At the same time, the process of learning the required skill may be a key part of the activity and the success to have mastered the skill can be an important contribution to the individualâs needs fulfilment.

191,177,0.988,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Interview Protocols and Guidelines The scientific perspective of investigative interviewing backs to the German scientist William Stern (1903/1904). Stern was occupied with examining techniques that acquired the most valid information from children and introduced the distinction between open (bericht) and closed (verhÃ¶r) questions. He demonstrated the superiority of open questions, showing that they gained more and a better quality of information compared to closed questions. This benefit of using open questions is stated in nearly all interview guidelines used by the police internationally, highlighting the following three points (Oxburgh et al. 2010): 1. When children are encouraged to do most of the talking, this helps to transfer control from the interviewer to the child, which is more compatible with a witness-focused approach (Fisher and Geiselman 1992). 2. Elaborate responses during the rapport-building phase provide an opportunity for the interviewer to gauge the childâs level of language competency, so that they can adjust the subsequent questioning style accordingly (Saywitz and Camparo 1998). 3. An open-ended rapport-building style sets up the expectation that the child will do most of the talking throughout the duration of the interview. Central to the development of interview guidelines has been knowledge of how memory works, childrenâs developmental capabilities and the conditions that improve a childâs ability to discuss their abuse"

We found that socially relevant themes were prominent (though less so among the European interviewees) and that interviewees often identified cross-fertilisation as the way forward, especially interdisciplinarity, collaboration and comparative research. The second part considers a set of epistemological questions: how do researchers conceive of their work? Do they see themselves as seeking to advance the frontiers of knowledge, making discoveries and sometimes even breakthroughs? Or do they consider that such attitudes are more suitable to the sciences? We found that most researchers believed that the humanities do produce knowledge but were pessimistic as to how society perceives and values the humanities."

As obvious as it may seem at first glance, this disadvantage accumulation is a key point of the framework: ICTâs effect is non-assured; it could be null, positive or even some combinations of assets, i.e. of low access and poor usage; and it may have negative effects on several aspects of wellbeing. We think it is useful to remember that we are assessing ICTâs effect and not blindly preaching about its potential; it is not only logical but scientifically desirable, we think, to find empirical evidence of situations in which ICTâs effect is not clearly positive."

Through this remark, Yoshida integrates his decision into a wider context of action. This is to be compared with observations from current research in Natural Decision Making (NDM) that aims to account for decision making in the presence of changing conditions, ill-deï¬ned tasks, time pressure and signiï¬cant personal risks in the case of error [11]. In these conditions, the decision makerâs accounts of their decision making âdo not ï¬t into a decision-tree frameworkâ; they are not âmaking choicesâ, âconsidering alternativesâ, or âassessing probabilitiesâ, but they see themselves as acting and reacting on the basis of prior experience, generating and modifying plans to meet the needs of the situation [12]. The decision maker acts on the basis of heuristics, then develops a mental simulation to assess the feasibility of the proposed response. These studies are consistent with those of Gilboa and Schmeidler [8], who axiomatized a Case-Based Decision Theory, which postulates that the decision maker acts by comparing the current situation to one already experienced.6 Coordination and leadership modalities also change when tasks are unpredictable and interdependent, as is the case in an emergency context [13]. However, if the context for the intervention of ï¬reï¬ghters or emergency room surgeons is sometimes called an âextreme situationâ [14], in practice these âdynamicâ situations constitute the predictable working environment of the decision maker. The problem relates more to the deï¬nition of the case in question, than the solution once the diagnosis has been made. Ultimately, the âextremeâ nature of a situation is assessed differently by different researchers and does not necessarily imply that the decision maker is completely overwhelmed or out of their depth [15]. Such individuals have substantial resources at their disposal, a well-established set of procedures and the impact of their actions is limited at the scale of society. In addition, whether they focus on decision making processes based on scenarios or on more empirical approaches, investigations of the influence of stress [16], a hostile physical or social environment [17], or the formal organization [18] on the performance of the decision maker are simplistic. They lead the analysis to be focused on the physical or emotional factors that could have led Yoshida to make errors (for example his decision to evacuate the site). This cognitive approach is indicative of the common sense meaning of âemotionâ, i.e. a complex state of consciousness, usually sudden and momentary, accompanied by physiological disorders.7 However, this perspective largely ignores the role played by emotions in decision making [19]. Ellis [20] considers that emotions and values are necessary components of a decision, which does not mean that the decision becomes âirrationalâ. This assertion is illustrated by the way in which the plantâs staff decided to return to the ï¬eld following the explosion at Reactor 3 on 15 March. According to"

The mainstream belief system, they continue, âhas given Wall Street a de facto veto over public policy making that no other group or industry enjoys.â Simon Johnson, another MIT professor and former IMF chief economist, is cited by them: âby 1998, it was part of the worldview of the Washington elite that what was good for Wall Street was good for Americaâ (all from Scharmer/Kaufer 2013: 71)."

13,426,0.988,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"she and her mother are of the same gender, and is more abrupt for the boy as he is of a different gender. Femininity will be constructed in the generational dimension: the girl is little, the mother is big, but they are of the same kind. This gives the girlâs gender identity a safe ground, and her subjectivity becomes more clearly relational in its character and with good capabilities for intimacy and empathy. However, the development of autonomy and establishing psychological borders between herself and others may become restrained. For the boy, on the other hand, separation takes place in the dimension of gender, which implies a more dramatic relational cut-off from his primary identificatory object. This may give him a better capacity for autonomy, but constrains his relational capacity. Chodorow summarises the gender identity development in a way that emphasises the advantages for the girl and the problems for the boy: âgrowing girls come to define and experience themselves as continuous with others; their experience of self contains more flexibility or permeable ego boundaries. Boys come to define themselves as more separate and distinct, with greater sense of rigid ego boundaries and differentiation. The basic feminine sense of self is connected to the world, the basic masculine sense of self is separateâ (Chodorow 1978: 169). The other element of the gender identity model is the sociological framing of the separation-individuation process in the post-Second World War family arrangement (white, middle-class) family, where the mother is the primary carer for the child and the father is a more distant figure. For the boy, the establishing of a masculine identity becomes more precarious when he does not have a model at hand to show him what masculinity implies. He does not know exactly what a man is; he only knows that a man is not a woman. Thus, masculine identity becomes abstract and negatively defined, and based on a repudiation of femininity. He will fear and denigrate everything connected with the feminineâ closeness, weakness, careâand deny its existence in himself. Care may be received as long as it takes the form of service and does not turn him into a baby. For the girl the problem is rather that the closeness she has with her mother also makes her vulnerable to the motherâs psychological conflicts, which again stem from the motherâs own restricted agency. This means that the already ambivalent relation between mothers and daughtersâwhere the girl both wants to stay close and have freedomâ"

However, in the overwhelming number of cases, the project is described as a hopeless affair. Almost all the women remember having very negative feelings about their own bodies as young girls, and their stories circle around the new concept of âflawsâ, a word only used by the women in our interviews in this generation. The contrast to the men is striking: the image of the relatively unproblematic bodies, where only penis size and embarrassment when purchasing condoms were issues to worry about, is countered by the womenâs long list of flaws, complaining about being too big, too fat, too tall, too thin, too flat-chested, having too big a nose or too large a space between the front teeth. âI got nowhere with my looksâ, Dagnyâs daughter Drude says, even if her motherâlike most of the upper middle-class mothersâtold her that she was pretty. Even women who show us pictures of themselves as lovely young girls remember how unhappy they were with their appearances. This is also the first generation that mentions dieting and exercising to keep their weight down. Olaug kept a record of her weight and always compared it to âMiss Norwayâsâ, of whom she had a picture on her wall in her bedroom. Some of the women remember weight loss that would have been understood as eating disorders today, but at that time their parents just wondered if they might have some caught some infection that caused them to lose weight. Youth in this generation coincided with the period of the âsexual revolutionâ, which obviously had an impact with regard to both discourse and behaviour, but again in quite gender-specific ways. No one in this generation waits to have sex until they are engaged or married, but for the women, their first time is most often with the partner they later marry, whereas for the men it is not. The fear of pregnancy is present for both genders and it appears to have been well founded, since the use of contraceptives is quite haphazard. The dread of pregnancy is in this generation not due to social shame, as it was for the women in the previous generation, but threatened freedom. Pregnancy meant that one âhad to marryâ, and quite a few of both the men and the women in our sample experienced exactly this."

Drawing on theoretical insights and grounded research, the SVP operationalised the principle of âco-presenceâ to protect against lone working and labour substitution and foster the kinds of relationships conducive to optimal knowledge exchange and co-learning. Recognition of the externality effects (unintended consequences) associated with service delivery (by volunteers) has led to an increasing emphasis on âcapacity-buildingâ amongst key stakeholders and funders. And, in most cases, this has been interpreted to imply that professional volunteers should be primarily engaged in training/education and knowledge transfer activities. Chapter 3 reported evidence of the role that professional volunteers (in carefully structured programmes) can play as âboundary spannersâ and knowledge brokers. However, whilst transferring knowledge is evidently possible, it also reï¬ected on the failure of these approaches to stimulate and sustain lasting and effective systems change. Put simply, the knowledge is being shared but the impact is minimal and short-lived, rarely extending beyond volunteer stays. Chapter 4 addresses the âwhyâ question: why is systems change so elusive even in an environment of carefully managed knowledge transfer, translation and exchange? These concerns, drawing directly on a wealth of lived/empirical evidence, stimulated the authors to search for theoretical insights capable of throwing light on the dynamics involved and informing future interventions. It is highly unusual to place a chapter of this nature towards the end of a book. The fact that it is where it is reï¬ects the essentially iterative quality of our research journey and the inter-weaving of theory with empirical work. In this case, it is the empirical work that led to our search for new theoretical ideas to help us to understand our ï¬ndings as they emerged and then, in turn, stimulate new empirical questions. Theories exist to facilitate understanding and explain social phenomenon. Sadly, they are (almost always) associated with the construction of concepts and language that render them inaccessible to anyone outside the narrow disciplinary conï¬nes responsible for their development. Disciplinary silos tend to generate exclusive language that restricts the very objectives of theorisation (understanding) to the point at which small groups of people are essentially communicating only with each other. This chapter seeks to interpret a complex (if not comprehensive) range of theory to assess the potential for more holistic, multi-disciplinary, insights into the dynamics of health worker behaviour."

No term adequately captures the group of states examined here. We initially referred to âemerging powers,â a term that derives from âemerging markets.â However, countries like Brazil, Turkey, and India eschew this label since they either are or have in the past been powers in their own right. The term âmiddle powersâ also is appropriate for some of these states, but derives from a realpolitik framework that emphasizes traditional military prowess and aspirations that do not reflect the way that these countries see themselves today.

363,212,0.988,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"the moment when the nullity of reality rises up against history and takes it back to itself. Indeed, the real is associated, for Decoste, ânot simply with the death of meaning but with more concrete deaths, more material destruction, as wellâ (ibid.: 382). I want to suggest that this attributes to reality a materiality, design and an intention that the novel is not supported by the novel. This can be seen has his playing out, on a smaller scale, the course of narrative history that Decoste observes in the novel on a larger scale. Tending to insist on final answers without appeal, on stable but restricted definitions of the meaning of things, the narrativisation that fuels the making of history carries with it, too, the desire to simplify, finalise, and even brutally exclude. In its fulfilment of such narrative desires, history works to bring forth apocalyptic conflagrations to burn away that which does not conform to the answer sought, the âproperâ end of the storyâ (ibid.: 390). As we have already seen, Tom also provides two explanations, one mythic and the other more realist, for Ernest Atkinsonâs actions in the novel. Focusing on the evocation of a âfairy-tale placeâ, Hanne Tange argues that the description of the Fenland setting does not place the Fens in the wider context of the map of England, and that this is to emphasise the marginality of the locale, claiming âno initial attempt is made to place this landscape on the map of England, for the rest is of little significanceâ. I agree that the Fens are represented as somewhat insulated from a British centre. And, moreover, that Tomâs ultimate relocation to London marks, in some sense, a commitment to national history. However, the introduction, so early in the novel, of the precise geography of the Fens does seem to attempt to place the Fens on the map of England, and this is important to the depiction of âmaking historyâ, in all its resonances, in the novel (see Tange, 2004: 78). Indeed, Brewer and Tillyard assert that Swiftâs novel attempts to be âa universal story of the human conditionâ (Brewer and Tillyard, 1985: 50). My reading of the novel aligns human nature with natural history and therefore identifies it as a category of the real, in opposition to history, stories and making things happen. It therefore counters Decosteâs association of the real with âinhumanityâ, because of the death and destruction he attributes to the real (Decoste, 2002: 395). Cooper, too, notes that Tom âmaps her desirabilityâ in these terms. For Cooper, Mary is âstereotyped and essentialized as a kind of âeternal feminineâ â¦ less a character than a placeholder or conduit for desire: a dioramic sequence of paradises lostâ (Cooper, 1996: 385). See also Pamela Cooperâs argument that âin Ernestâs passion for Helen the trajectory of imperialism is reversed; its expansive energies are redirected towards an interior space of desire, neither subjective nor objective, but abject: the body of the daughterâ (Cooper, 1996: 380). Indeed Brewer and Tillyard argue that the novel traffics in the âcult of naturalnessâ, what they call âthe notion of ânaturalnessâ as somehow both better and more realâ and which âhas become one [of] the most tiresome clichÃ©s of the modern ageâ (Brewer and Tillyard, 1985: 51). The novel certainly does seem to support this reading, although it is countered, as we shall see, by Tomâs own belief in the value of artificial history and the civilisation it supports and makes possible."

93,201,0.988,Nordic Mediation Research,"parties dispute. In the substantive elements, for example, we see many elements besides the monetary issues that are at the core of the civil case, such as performance of work exchange of things, divisions of property etc. We also see this in the procedural elements where there is a bulk of practical descriptions regarding how to fulï¬l the agreement. Secondly, we ï¬nd traces of creativity in about 65% of the agreements studied. Hence, it is safe to conclude that many court-connected mediations result in creative agreements. However, we believe that there were more creative potential in the cases. About one-quarter of the agreements studied were highly creative, but the rest of the agreements had a lesser and more marginal degree of creativity. Nevertheless, the creative touch, independent of amount, can be interpreted as a sign of selfdetermination in the agreements. In order to reach creative solutions, interests and needs have probably been brought to the mediation and, in some cases, also other issues than the legal claims. This is probably based on knowledge that only the parties possess and occurs based on the involvement of the parties in the resolution of their own conï¬ict. Results from these ï¬rst two analyses are, therefore, in line with what one could expect from mediated settlements based on mediation theory regarding selfdetermination. They appear tailored to the case and reï¬ect the involvement of the parties in the outcome of the conï¬ict. The result of our linguistic analysis is different. The principle of self-determination relates to process and outcome. Our understanding of self-determination includes inï¬uencing the way the agreement is formulated and includes being able to read and understand oneâs own agreement. Our linguistic analysis shows that the latter is hardly the case and one can seriously question whether the parties have inï¬uenced the way the agreement is drawn up. The wording of the agreements is so highly judicial and bureaucratic that they are hard to read and understand, at least for laypersons who are not educated within the judicial domain. Also, the agreements exhibit extensive use of standard phases and appear quite scripted in their set-up. This, in combination, suggests that when it comes to formulating agreements, self-determination of the partiesâ seemingly ends. Rather, the professionals take over and the tailor-made aspects of the agreements seem to stop at the formulation of these. Court-connected mediation is a curious practice because it happens within the court systemâa well-established institution with a well-known practice regarding both the process and the outcome. The judicial practices are institutionalised during literally hundreds of years. When court-connected mediation was introduced in the 1990s in Norway and 2000s in Denmark, an interesting situation arose: legal professionals should offer and carry out a new process, namely court-connected mediation, but do so within the well-established judicial system. They were supposed to act differently and do so based on a new ideology of conï¬ict resolution. The professionals needed new practices to fulï¬l their new role and scope. To explain and understand how practices in an organisation develop, the newinstitutional theory from organisational theory might be helpful. Since the 1970s this theoretical perspective has been widely used to understand the mechanisms that works in and within organisations (e.g. DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Gooderham"

On the other hand my notation has the advantage that it allows one to write several hypotheses, whereas Kostaâs arrow notation allows just one source for the arrow; for my application in (7) above, that would have been a fatal flaw. As all this illustrates, there are some quite subtle relationships between notation and concept, and they are very sensitive to the purpose that the notation will be put to, and the mathematical context in which it will be used. But elsewhere Kosta forgets the variables. For example he asks [4, Â§5]: Can inferences be reduced to consequence relations? So that having an inference from A to B means just that B is a consequence of A. where should the variables go?

This does not mean that the conflict does not exist but, as the German cases clearly show, it may assume the form of âmeta-conflictâ or âconflict over the nature of conflictâ (Horowitz 1991), a struggle over the framing and narrative used to label and explain the conflict. As we said at the beginning of this section, the symbolic capital held by neighbourhood policy communities gives them a role in this process. We can thus conclude that the ability of any given local policy community to construct its own narrative is crucial to making a neighbourhood resilient against disruptive external narratives and thus to building a more cohesive local society."
252,144,0.988,The Ethics of Vaccination,"In order to fulfil a requirement of fairness and to be consistent with other cases of conscientious objection (in particular towards military service), we might envision a second variant of the same approach, wherein those who refuse vaccination should make some alternative contribution to societyâone that is independent of the actual risk that a specific case of non-vaccination poses on others and that is roughly equivalent to the contribution one would make to public health by being vaccinated. For example, in the same way as those who refuse to enrol in the military are typically required to provide alternative social services (such as working in public libraries, assisting with provision of services for people with disabilities, etc.), people who refuse vaccination could be required to make some alternative contribution to public health, such as preparing healthy meals for children at school or participating in fundraising activities in support of infectious disease research. This is what has been called the âcontribution modelâ for non-medical vaccine exemptions (Giubilini et al. 2017): the point here is that those who refuse vaccination should not be âpunishedâ, but rather required to make their fair contribution to the public good in question, or to a roughly equivalent good, in other ways. While this model of dealing with vaccine refusal is preferable to the ones described so far in that it goes further than the alternative ones in promoting liberty, expected utility, and fairness, it does have its own shortcomings. For how are we to determine this rough equivalence? The problem is that the rough equivalence between the two types of contribution cannot be measured in terms of the actual impact of individual behaviour on the good in question, since in either case such contribution is likely to be negligible. So the equivalence needs to be measured in terms of the societal benefit of the (public) goods to which one is required to contribute. But the problem is that the alternative public health goods contemplated by the contribution model are not really commensurable with herd immunity: herd immunity is very likely to prevent illness and even death from vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, an outcome that would be extremely beneficial to many individuals and to society. The goods promoted by the other suggested contributions to public health are either less beneficial (such as giving children healthy food) or of more uncertain and of longer-term realization (funding research to find cures for dangerous infectious diseases). What we want when implementing vaccination policies is the realization of herd immunity through a fair distribution of the burdens entailed by herd immunity itself. None of the alternative contributions proposed would go in this direction. Therefore, none of the alternatives would promote fair distribution of the burdens"

117,370,0.988,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"The findings of the studies raise questions. First, why do the nurses know so little about ethics committees? Storch and Griener ask whether this goes back to a lack of knowledge that is induced by medical politics or whether it could be understood as a strategy of nursing administration maternalism that keeps staff nurses and head nurses removed from such information, or whether it might be simply a problem in communication within the hospital (Storch and Griener 1992, p. 25). In a study by Gaudine et al. (2011), nurses still report about a lack of knowledge about HECs as well as lack of experience. A second question is whether ethics committees support existing structures and power relationships in the hospital rather than a shift to a democratic way of multi-professional discussion of ethical dilemmas and conflicts of care. The comments from physicians, nurses and administrators give credence to the view that HECs merely support the existing power structures."

He is the son of Helge, the hands-on father in the middle generation who did not want to âmarry a housekeeperâ, but who later felt deceived by the Womenâs Movement. Henrik, however, saw his mother as a positive and competent person, who, he says, also had good looks. He believes that he has always been more in favour of gender equality than most girls and refers to the influence of his feminist mother. He gets irritated by women who do not fulfil their potential or do not dare to âgo for itââor who think they have to become unfeminine to do so. He likes beautiful women with the capacity to make their own choices. At 40 he has experienced that life is more complicated than in his motherâs feminist agenda. He appreciates sexual difference, but also thinks that individual differences are often more salient than gender differences. Today he feels somewhat estranged from the whole concept of gender equality, but emphasises that he certainly needs âno moral lecture on gender equalityâ. He believes in diversity, has organised courses at work about it and thinks that diversity also is key to economic growth. Henrik, who is among the most genderradical men in the youngest generation, combines a positive relationship with his mother with having had a hands-on father.

It is used to educate people, train them about response (e.g. through drills), gather baseline data and map risks. In fact it can be observed that there is a narrower understanding of EWS (i.e. detection, monitoring, modelling, and forecasting of the hazards as well as warning preparation and dissemination, based on risk knowledge and legal/institutional arrangements), and a wider understanding of EWS (i.e. corresponding to the 4 components) as adopted by EWC III in 2006. Both are widely in use. The problem with this wider understanding of EWS is that an EWS then becomes almost indistinguishable from DRM. EWS also apply to long-term, âcreepingâ changes that can change baselines and indicate trends â often only recognised once a speciï¬c threshold is crossed and often not being hazards per se but influencing other hazards and slow-onset hazards in addition to the quick-onset ones. For example, while climate change may not be a hazard itself, the process could still be warned of, partly to address the causes and partly to deal with the consequences. In this regard the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) can be understood as an EWS for climate change by assessing and synthesising climate change science and presenting actions that are needed. In theory, the earlier a warning is available, the more time there is to prepare for and hopefully respond effectively to the potential impacts of stressors, threats and hazards. An EWS for slower and gradual changes should therefore give more time to design prevention and adaptation to new hazard regimes, plan a response and integrate that response into day-to-day life and longer-term development. No single agency can be responsible for all EWS-related activities. While there may be an ofï¬cially designated EWS"
78,207,0.988,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"common is what is being described as âburn outâ. This is characterized by the paradoxical feelings of being permanently exhausted, overloaded, under pressure, and yet not being able to achieve what is expected and losing productivity. While not new as a set of symptoms, the expectations of permanent availability and self promotion associated with the professional model of the âentrepreneur of the selfâ has heightened the sense of disorientation. Controlling the attention of others, and dealing with the constant solicitation of others, is accompanied by a dramatic sense of loss of self-direction, intentionality and planning. The French expression of for intÃ©rieur can help us understand the human issues at stake here. In Latin, âforâ means jurisdiction. The common understanding (not the ecclesiastic one) of the for intÃ©rieur is the jurisdiction that each person applies to her/himself; it corresponds to what in social sciences is called a sense of agency. Managers and employees in organizations that are heavily reliant on digital environments, such as banks, public administrations, large corporations, describe a sort of permanent blurring between their interior life and their life online. They describe the difficulty of making their for intÃ©rieur exist vividly in their daily lives. They talk of burning from the inside. This sense of disorientation is not unique to workplaces, and seems to be emerging in the home. The feeling of losing a sense of control when engaged with digital devices is described equally by gamers, online shoppers, video consumers or social media participants. Invariably, users talk of their devices as âtime sucksâ, as environments in which they lose their intentions and agency. Another facet of the same problem is what R. Sennett (1977) describes as the current tyranny of intimacyâthat is, the central position of intimate relations in the perception of self-realization. In contrast to traditional patterns of social interactions, organized through distinct roles where individuals were more easily categorized as workers, lovers, parents, citizens, we now observe a greater fluidity and confusion of boundaries. Nowadays, observes Sennett, the king is naked. Social distances, masks and shelters have disappeared. Individuals have no sanctuaries to retreat to and hide from the scrutiny of others, but feel always visible and transparentâ¦ raising obvious questions for the plurality of social identities. To some extent, this explains the increasing position of the home and of the inner circle of the family as a protective cocoon and the growing success of activities such as cooking and gardening, which restore the sense of duration, agency and privacy. On the digital side, we also have evidence of a retreat into the private, intimate and controllable. There is ample evidence showing that all new digital communication channels, from texting to Skype, from Facebook to instant messaging, are being used to strengthen peopleâs closest and most intimate relations (Baym 2010; Broadbent 2011; Madianou and Miller 2012). Contrary to common public discourse, people have not hugely extended their social network nor do they spend much time communicating with unknown digital acquaintances. Close scrutiny of what people actually do, with all the channels they have at their disposal, shows an intensification of exchanges with a few close ties, often less than five, leading to the strengthening of these relationships. A recent survey of 3,000 teenagers in Belgium (Gallez and Lobet-Maris 2011) confirmed the results of similar studies in the US (Ito 2010), showing that most of the participants had an âbetween usâ connectivity"
158,1,0.988,Microfinance 3.0 : Reconciling Sustainability With Social Outreach and Responsible Delivery,"Fifteen years ago, microfinance was looked upon as one of the most promising concept to lift poor people out of poverty. Microfinance was perceived to be âgood per seâ. Many institutions proved successful both in development and in financial terms. Today, after an impressive pushing of the âfinancial frontierâ, financial inclusion seems to have a mixed record: While it is true that many people in developing countries still lack access to finance, we have also witnessed the opposite âtoo much/easy accessâ led to overindebted clients, unable to serve their several microcredits offered by (too) many institutions. In some markets, this implied a move into pure consumer lending, partly replacing the traditional lending to micro-entrepreneurs. âGoodâ responsible microfinance institutions were not able to continue to operate in these âcontaminated marketsâ. In this context, the question (re-)emerged: isnât it, after all, unrealistic to believe that pursuing a development mission can go hand in hand with financial success, particularly in the context of commercial microfinance? I do not share this view. In fact, I believe the two goals are intertwined in the sense that without financial viability, clients cannot be served in a sustainable way, and that institutions which do not understand their clients with their financial needs will hardly be financially successful. However, this does not happen automatically: on the contrary, it takes a lot of efforts to achieve both objectives: a high degree of professionalism and a strong commitment to a responsible service delivery. It also takes responsible regulators and more efforts to promote financial literacy of clients. This book is part of a publication series initiated by KfW on selected topics in the field of financial systems development, one of the core competencies of KfW. This edition addresses the ethics of financial systems development which have been under scrutiny in âdevelopedâ markets as well as in developing countries. As âbankingâ seems to have become a questionable activity, we will take a special look at the institutions that provide microfinance services. âMicrofinance 3.0â intends to provide a new âframeworkâ for the future of microfinance which builds upon past success stories as well as upon lessons learnt from bad practices and errors. It contains nine contributions, written by different microfinance experts, distinguished practitioners as well as observers and analysts of microfinance for more than a decade. Some of these contributions were presented at the KfW Financial Sector Symposium in late 2012 in Berlin, where the future landscape of microfinance was discussed. These contributions touch upon some of the âingredients of âmicrofinance 3.0â: the values needed to provide financial services responsibly, the appropriate busi-"

Within these contexts, Le Dantec's (2016) proposition that âtechnological change stratifies us based on our willingness to incorporate it into our livesâ holds true in that actors are perhaps more accurately classified based upon their use, rather than their access to ICTs. This use is more likely to reflect levels of overall social inclusion, rather than solely digital. A shared concern that underlies many of these applications is discerning, and ultimately fostering, the factors or drivers that actually encourage and motivate the implicated actors to which a particular intervention is targeting, to install an application or ICT and then to use it. That is, with technological access, technological adoption does not necessarily follow without some kind of âhookâ to encourage buy-in and drive voluntary uptake (Kvasny and Keil 2006)."
249,304,0.988,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"1 Fregeâs Question Gottlob Frege opened his seminal paper Sinn und Bedeutung [3] by asking what the epistemic difference is between the equations a = a and a = b.1 His proposal to distinguish between sense and denotation (or reference) of a term turned out to be one of the most fruitful conceptual advances in the history of philosophical logic. Modern Possible Worlds Semantics draws on this distinction: the sense of a term refers to the full variety of possible worlds (in the way that we have to consider the denotation of a term in every possible world), while the (Fregean) denotation has to take into account only the actual world. As appealing as this view might be, there are (at least) two problems with it. First, it comes with a concept of rigid designators. Second, it is not applicable to mathematics, because mathematical equations hold equally in every possible world. While many approaches try to attack the problem from a semantic perspective, here we would like to provide a syntactic account, which takes up Fregeâs original question 1 In fact, he doesnât put this directly as a question, but rather states that âa = a holds a priori"
155,314,0.988,New Vision 2050 : a Platinum Society,"The Platinum Society is a model for growth in a mature society. A mature richness in terms of quality and a vision that seeks QOL is not confined to certain regions or countries, cities or countryside, or outlying islands. However, specific ways to achieve such a vision or initiative differ with each area. In looking at areas across Japan, there are many examples to be found that exhibit various kinds of resourcefulness and clever ideas. Areas experiencing certain problems may be able to get some hints by looking at how other areas with a similar problem handled it. By exchanging each otherâs ideas and knowledge, it may be possible to come up with something even better. Joining hands with each other will lead to a bigger movement giving them the power to demand legal and social reforms. From this kind of idea, the Platinum Network Society was launched in August 2010 by its 46 founders. Even if social reforms are known to be necessary, all of society moving together as one is not a reality. So, first of all, the frontrunners need to go ahead and increase the number of supporters. Then, when critical mass is reached, everyone can move together. The people gathered here are the frontrunners who can make a move before others. More than 6 years have passed since the Society was launched. The Society has grown into a large organization and as of September 2016, the Society has 84 corporate members, 154 local government members, 56 special members, and 6 members from outside of Japan, making a total of 300 altogether. As mentioned earlier, the Platinum Network Society conducts various activities such as developing various educational programs for fostering human resources, publishing the Platinum Society Handbook, holding symposiums, establishing individual working groups for health management, and holding discussion meetings to generate ideas (Fig. 6.15). Amongst such undertakings, the Platinum Vision Award, inaugurated in 2013, has been often mentioned in the media and is credited with making Platinum Society ideals better known. Recipients of the Platinum Vision Award include local governments, corporations or organizations that have created a new industry through some kind of innovation, or are aiming to resolve regional problems by ingenious measures. Through their efforts, these governments, corporations, and organizations represent a society that is aiming to become a platinum society."

321,152,0.988,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"School Education Is Losing Diversity One current problem facing school education is that the presence of isolated students is tolerated less as society matures. The teaching certificate system is also becoming excessively complex over time. When I was a college student, educational psychology and other pedagogical subjects were available to students whenever they decided to obtain, even belatedly, a teaching certificate. Some prospective applicants did not even take such subjects. At that time, however, necessary credits were sometimes given to students when they took a 1.8-liter bottle of sake (called an isshobin) to the professor in charge to ask for a credit. There was something easygoing about those days. Today, such a practice as bribery with an isshobin would not be tolerated, of course. Instead, the fact is that students are now obliged to decide whether they want a teaching certificate as early as their high-school days and take the required teacher training program in college. Only those students are qualified to teach. Thus, educational venues are losing diversity of human resources. Diversity has also been lost in the lives of students. No parents want their children to become delinquents. It is a pity that today we have few people, including parents, who can give advice to would-be delinquents from their own experience by saying that they were once delinquents but they now live like this, or by giving them examples from overseas. To build such an environment, we need people who have diverse experiences. The loss of diversity among school teachers may be a significant factor in current educational problems. To improve the educational system, it is advisable to send about three sufficiently experienced working people, for instance, to each elementary school or junior high school as instructors to give lessons at least three times a week. Currently, there are a few cases in which well-known TV celebrities or media personalities give lessons at their old schools. Such activities are not part of education in the true sense of the word. The basis of school education lies in giving 45-minute classes for several hours a week, throughout the year."

334,310,0.988,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"However, our interviewees described numerous and diverse practices through which structurally conditioned isolation could be disrupted: Visits to the accommodation centers by No Lager activists and members of the neighborhood initiative AG FlÃ¼chtlingshilfe, political and festive get-togethers in the autonomous social center as well as encounters through German classes, bike rental offers and other forms of voluntary support. Notably, some of these practices preceded the first deportation preventions and had the explicit aim of questioning the social marginalization of asylum seekers. The described encounters challenge deportability not only through acts of support and collective protest, but also by making the danger of deportation âsometimes simply irrelevantâ (Interview D5_3). While the logic inherent to deportability tends to make a personâs legal status the all-dominating frame of their daily life and social ties, the interviewees described how friendship created spaces and experiences beyond deportability (Doppler 2015, 7â8; see also Mokre 2018). In a group interview with her friend Wazir, Linda, an activist with secure residence status recalled: We really became friends between the demonstrations and your [attempted] deportation [â¦] I remember this one night, [â¦] we simply stayed longer after plenum, turned on some music, got drunk, and talked so much [â¦] and yes, then we realized that we like each other a lot.

166,314,0.988,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),However Annette was exposed to social risk in two regards: the first related to the necessity to end her first job; the second related to the non-availability of a place in the day nursery at the end of the maternity leave. If she had not found a new job or if the unavailability of childcare would have been longer the vulnerability of her situation would have been more serious. The initial expectations would not have been fulfilled creating a potential situation of psychological distress as well as a redefinition of the household economy and family roles. In the months preceding the important social transition of becoming a parent the partners project themselves in the future with baggage full of personal and social norms. We thus speak of the birth of the first child as a normative event that generates a series of expectations and plans. When these expectations are not fulfilled the potential for parents to experience negative outcomes and remain constrained by the situation is greater. Unexpected events may have significant consequences. The Devenir Parent LHC constrained individualsâ life trajectories into sequences of events concerning two life domains: employment and childcare. Thus the analysis of the LHC alone does not indicate what happened outside these parameters. The LHC in the Devenir Parent was only one part of a more complex survey. A different approach would be to use the LHC to directly collect data on unexpected or unwanted events in each of the life domains. The next example shows how life calendars can be used to tap non-normative (i.e. unexpected) critical events.

93,347,0.988,Nordic Mediation Research,"Who decides who gets to access a restorative process? And on which basis? These are central concerns in my PhD study. In all of the observed models, the offender has to admit to the offence and wish to take part in the restorative process. Apart from this the approaches of the three observed countries are very different: The Florida model is only accessible to juvenile ï¬rst-time offenders who have committed less serious offences, and it is up to the prosecutor to offer diversion of the case to the programs. Further to this, the zip-code of the offender decides which model might be available. In Northern Ireland it is the young person who gets to decide whether he or she wants a restorative process, and only a few case typesâmurder and particularly violent rapesâare excepted, because there are mandatory sentences for these offences in the law even for juvenile offenders. In Norway, in principle all case types are open to restorative processes, but it is up to a judge or a team of professionals (depending on the seriousness of the offence) to decide whether a restorative process is an appropriate choice for the speciï¬c offender having committed the speciï¬c offence(s). The Norwegian model is more elaborate, invasiveâand also more expensiveâ than the Northern Irish one (and, of course, also than the Florida program).

Any scientific analysis is only as good as the data used, and data on fish stocks gathered by survey vessels and partially validated by fisheriesâ data is often unreliable and always incomplete. Further, ecosystems such as maritime environments are a dynamic entity with stochastic effects and uncertain dynamics. There are increasing calls for improved concepts of uncertainty treatment and improved methodology in the characterisation, consideration, communication and management of uncertainty for scientific assessment and advice. It has been argued, for example, by Dankel et al. (2012), that a better understanding of how to characterise scientific uncertainty and its implications are needed. However, according to our interviewees, the underlying problem has still not been resolved, namely, that DG MARE wants numbers, whilst ICESâs scientists prefer to give more qualitative and nuanced information. This poses a fundamental problem for the whole management process: ICES is expected to deliver recommendations as sound and clear as possible in order for DG MARE to draft proposals for action. ICESâ advice, on the other hand, has to be legitimate and definitive, i.e. it cannot be open to different interpretations by different stakeholders (Wilson 2009: 124). That there is uncertainty, however, has to be somehow communicated for the advice to become credible, but how exactly uncertainty should and can be communicated to DG MARE is an ongoing discussion, not least because of different understandings of uncertainty between ICES and DG MARE. This is referred to as âinstitutional uncertaintyâ (Linke et al. 2014). Industry representatives in all countries generally felt more comfortable with management decisions made by the Council of Ministers, partly because the latter did not fully follow the advice of ICES. Industrialists felt that NGOs read ICESâ advice all too literally. They on the other hand understood the uncertainties involved and thus expected decision makers to set different TACs than those of ICES. Unsurprisingly, NGO representatives were very much in favour of the precautionary approach to scientific uncertainties. They felt that given the lack of or the unreliability of data, the precautionary approach would better address concerns of sustainable management of resources. Representatives from ICES on the other hand were less perturbed. They saw themselves as delivering a service to DG MARE based on the available resources and knowledge. In their view, their assessment was mainly a biologicalâeconomic one. They did not see a threat of species extinction. Rather, they were concerned that if TACs were set too high, economic problems might arise. DG MARE representatives saw the problem similarly and referred mainly to the challenges of data reliability and communication of uncertainty. Further, they felt that local and anecdotal knowledge about fish stocks should be taken seriously."
346,266,0.988,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","This statement sets the stage for this chapter. wilschut points both to the dynamic nature of the contexts of history teaching and to the fact that the particular constellation of the factors is to some extent open to interpretations. The constellation can change quite quickly even in the same country, and history educators even in the same time and space can perceive the relative weights of contextual factors quite differently (see kello 2016). Educators face a multiplicity of understandings and expectations from the different fields, and often they need to navigate between contradictory understandings and expectations. There is a continuous discussion and dialogue between the fields over aims, contents and functions of history teaching (wilschut 2010). In lay and political representations, serving national identity and patriotism is still perceived as the main function of history teaching in many countries. However, since its beginnings, the school subject has always served what Carretero and Bermudez (2012) call âenlightenedâ approach aiming at the more general education of the students. The compatibility of the âpatrioticâ and âenlightenedâ tasks depends on how the latter are understood. âEducating studentsâ, if conceived as transmitting information without much reflection, need not interfere with the patriotic aims. In contrast, âcritical enlightenedâ history teaching demands recognition of divergent experiences and perspectives, critical (self-)reflection and contesting celebratory myths and narratives (Carretero and Bermudez 2012). The present chapter is set on the backdrop of such variety of understandings and expectations of history as a school subject. we take a look at different positions that history teachers take towards their subject and its contexts using material from in-depth interviews with Estonian and Latvian history teachers.

185,182,0.988,The Essence of Software Engineering,"3 Personal Software Architecture The imaginary screenplay between the venture capitalist and the start-up entrepreneur found in the Introduction section could very plausibly arise from a common scenario. An individual, the entrepreneur, learns programming in college and then decides to use his new skills by writing an app for his iPhoneâwriting it both for the pleasure and interest of doing so, and also because he has a particular way he likes to plan and record his vacations. His app, âMyTravel,â allows him to record an itinerary, include photos and commentary, and export to his personal blog. Naturally by doing good development work, his friends are impressed, want their own copy, and later ask him to add additional features. By word of mouth the popularity of the app increases until the group of friends decides to form a small company to further enhance and market the product. Sometime later as success grows, the need for venture capital appears and the âno stinkinâ architectureâ dialog ensues. But why would the inventor be so resistant to talking about architecture? Simply because of how his company evolved. At the outset of his efforts, he was just âmessing aroundâ and the project just accreted features in a haphazard fashion after that. He was just working for himself, with no intention of ever forming a company. He never took the time to focus on âarchitecture.â There is a deep falsehood in this narrative, however. Unless the developer was truly ignorant, he will have used Appleâs app developer tools, such as Cocoa, the XCode software development kit, the Quartz framework, and user interface guidelines. And prominent in those materials is this statement: âMVC is central to a good design for a Cocoa application2.â That is, Apple is directing developersâ attention to a particular architectural style, MVC (Model-View-Controller), and saying that it is of critical importance in the design of new iPhone applications.

118,678,0.988,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"20.6.3 Trust Frequent concern has been raised on issues of public trust on nuclear technology and the expert community. In the discussion of trust in science and technology and in the professional community in general, the decrease in trust of society and citizens is often emphasized. Possible reasons for the degradation of trust are anxiety of citizens about the closed expert community and disappointment due to that opinions of society not being reflected in the technology utilization and the governance of the professional community. Moreover, there is another point that we should not miss: not only is there public distrust toward technology, engineers, and their community, but also engineersâ distrust toward society and citizens. There has been a structure of mutual distrust of each other. Some engineers may claim that this is because some people and mass-media have irrationally criticized engineers and technology due to lack of knowledge and a biased standpoint. Indeed, there were a number of cases where the âdeficient modelâ can explain the situation, although we should recognize the insufficiency of the âdeficient modelâ in many cases. Engineers are also human beings after all, and thus painful experiences such as receiving irrational criticisms were deeply and subconsciously inscribed in their minds. In addition, it was transferred to younger generations via education and as culture. Consequently, there are quite a few experts who believe that they have to promote nuclear energy utilization even without endorsement and appreciation from society, because they are convinced that nuclear energy is really needed. Some experts even ignore skepticism and criticism of citizens, relying on the own belief. However, it should be recognized that this attitude is quite inappropriate for professional engineers, and that this attitude further enlarges distrust, disappointment, and opposition of citizens toward the nuclear professional community. The trust from the general public may facilitate the utilization of nuclear power plants, the site selection of radioactive the waste disposal facility, etc. However, if this is all that is intended, trust cannot be achieved in most cases. Rather, more importantly, public trust is essential for engineers to work positively and proactively. And such positive and proactive attitudes are essential for nuclear experts to deal with a high-risk technology, which the accident reports require that TEPCO and the regulatory body have. In this sense, âtrustâ can be replaced with ârespect.â A professional community which is not respected and is not appreciated for its outcome due to distrust and which distrusts the society which they should serve is not a professional community which proactively and continuously makes progress so as to increase"
350,92,0.988,"Protecting The Rights of People With Autism in The Fields of Education and Employment : international, European and National Perspectives","Interventions should be intensive with an individually organized specialistpedagogical effort on a daily basis and an important role of family. According to the NAP, counseling in the home and courses on ASD should be offered to the parents and the family should be an important partner for the municipality. In the evaluation of the childâs need for support the NAP requires to take into account the childâs functional level, while all interventions for preschool should be carried out only by professionals with specific knowledge of autism.77 As for school age, the NAP outlines that the number of children with ASD is significantly higher in the later school years than during the early years of schooling because most children are not diagnosed until they reach school. At the same time, the school age is the phase of life in which the need for support varies more.78 For these reasons, the NAP recommends that many different types of services should be made available for children with ASD, both in the framework of school, spare time, respite care and residential homes, and that services should be highly individualized and specifically adapted. The NAP gives a series of detailed advices on the methods to follow concerning the relationship with autistic children, pointing out that all pedagogical efforts should be based on the understanding of the cognitive nature of the functional disability and attention should be paid to the development of independence in all regards. Concerning youth, the NAP specifies that is a phase of life during which a person usually develops his/her identity and gains independence, but a high number of people with ASD never achieve these objectives. However, also for persons with autism youth often represents a period of changes (i.e. changing in daily activities from school to work or day-initiatives, education at all levels) and for these reasons the NAP recommends to ensure to young people with ASD the necessary support to be evaluated on the basis of the individualâs functional level. A mentor or a support/ contact person (often parents) may represent the right way to compensate the difficulties young people with ASD encounter in this phase of life. As for education, the Plan requires that young people with ASD should have the possibility of a flexible course of education, regarding both duration and contents, because many young people with ASD try out several educations before deciding on one."
249,368,0.988,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"argumentsâ. My ideas, as should be quite clear from my paper, are very far from Aristotle. They come from categorial proof theory, a mathematical field at the border of category theory and proof theory. Wilfrid seems to think that speaking of priority and primacy means one must be speaking about âwhat can be defined in terms of whatâ. One may reasonably claim that for explaining how an organism functions physiological notions, like for example homoeostasis, have primacy over anatomical notions, like for example parenchyma or stroma. This does not mean that the later notions are definable in terms of the former ones, and not vice versa. In defining anatomical notions concerning organs one may, but need not, rely on physiological notions, but one would equally rely on anatomical notionsâin particular on the notion of organâwhen defining physiological notions. In general, in the order of explanation, it seems indisputable that one may claim precedence for the notions of a science that seeks laws accounting for phenomena over the notions of a taxonomical science (see [1], Sect. 10). Nearer to the field of logic, theoretical linguistics and its notions would have for explaining how language functions precedence, primacy, over descriptive linguistics and its notions. In a different register, in the order of exposition and not the order of explanation, some notions can have for deep and natural reasons precedence over others without this meaning that the later notions are simply definable in terms of the former. In logic, one usually has that in the order of exposition the connectives of propositional logic have primacy, priority, over the quantifiers of predicate logic, without the latter being definable in terms of the former. In the foundations of mathematics, one usually has that in the order of exposition logical notions, the connectives and the quantifiers, together with the axioms concerning them, have priority over the set-theoretical membership relation, together with the axioms concerning it, without the latter being definable in terms of the former, as some authorities still expected a hundred years ago. I will return to matters of primacy towards the end of this note. I argue in [3] and elsewhere that the notion of inference should not be understood as the notion of consequence relation. I donât understand what Wilfrid means by saying before (1.10) that I forgot the codes of inferences. It is quite the opposite. I argue that an inference should not be taken as an ordered pair made of the premise and the conclusion, an ordered pair which is a member of a consequence relation. With inferences we do not have a relation, but a graph in the sense of category theory, which is given by a function assigning to every arrow an ordered pair of objects (some graph-theorists call that a directed graph, and others, following [8], could call it a directed pseudograph). Wilfrid finds after (1.9) that a notation for derivations (does he mean by that the same as I mean by inference or deduction?) in which he draws triangles âhas the advantage that it allows one to write several hypothesesâ. The usual notation in the style of Gentzen with sequents plural on the left can claim the same merit. In the context where we are interested in identity of inferences there is no mathematical loss, and there is a gain in clarity, if we restrict ourselves to the categorial format with a single object as the source of an arrow. Since the premises are finite in number, we can replace a plurality of them by their conjunction, and the absence of them by the propositional constant true. If on the other hand we are interested in the question of"
4,288,0.988,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"How to Invest in Early Childhood Overall, in comparison with developed countries, and in comparison with the expenditures made later in the life cycle, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean spend very little on the early years. In the region, for every dollar that is spent on a child 5 and under, more than $3 are spent on a child between the ages of 6 and 11. At first glance, these figures would suggest that countries in the region simply need to spend more on young children. To some extent, this is correctâgovernments spend too little on early childhood. However, more spending will do little to solve the problem of poor development in early childhood if resources are not spent well. In particular, what is critical is the quality of services (parenting programs, daycare, early schooling) provided to young children. By and large, however, the quality of the services that many young children in Latin America and the Caribbean receive is dismal. In fact, some of the services are of such low quality that they may harmârather than helpâthe children who use them. What is quality? At home, in daycare centers, and in early school, quality refers to a large extent to the interactions of children with those who surround them. Research in neurology shows that the interactions young children have with each other and with adults shape a childâs brain in ways that have lifelong implications. When adults are sensitive and responsive to childrenâs cues and needs, children begin to develop. When they provide early stimulation and focused instruction, children learn. Because improving quality is, in large measure, about changing the nature of the interactions of children with their parents, caregivers, and teachers, spending on physical infrastructure does not by itself help. Parenting programs do not require infrastructure, but they do require well-trained, carefully supervised home visitors who can establish a relationship of trust with families and deliver a given curriculum with high fidelity. Building state-of-the-art daycare centers does nothing for child development if children are not actively"

28,262,0.988,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"In 1982, the first edition of Keith Hawtonâs and JosÃ© CatalÃ¡nâs Attempted Suicide is published. Itcontains a special chapter entitled âSelf-injuryâ,105 which details a tripartite division between: âsuperficial self-cuttingâ, which is âusually of the wrist or forearm, associated with little or no suicidal intentâ; this is followed by serious self-injury, which involves deep cuts that endanger blood vessels or tendons, as well as shooting, hanging and jumping from buildings which, as they note, âare usually associated with serious suicidal intentâ. Finally, there is the category of self-mutilation that âmay result in disfigurementâ and is associated with psychosis; it may or may not be life-threatening. It is obvious that much nosological effort has been expended here. Differences are minutely examined and categorised in multiple ways. The authors mention that in Oxford, âparticular care has been taken to try to identify all cases of self-injury coming to the general hospital, irrespective of whether they have been referred to the hospital psychiatric serviceâ.106 Hawton and CatalÃ¡n note that wrist cutting has been treated as a distinct syndrome (referencing the North American literature), but they are unconvinced, adding that it is âdoubtful whether this is a useful approach to the problem, especially for clinical purposesâ. They rehearse the now-familiar picture that â[t]he predominant sensation is one of tension, which steadily mounts until it becomes unbearable ... Immediately before cutting, a sense of numbness or emptiness may be describedâ. Crucially, this differentiates the behaviour from selfpoisoning. They argue that âclinical teams which manage attempted suicide patients should be familiar with the special problem of patients who deliberately injure themselves, and not just deal with them as if the behaviour was the same as self-poisoningâ.107 This is exceptionally clear. In the second edition of their guide, they further note: âWristcutting, which is predominantly a behaviour of younger patients, is often repeated and in many cases appears to be a different phenomenon in psychopathological terms from self-poisoningâ.108 We areâ so to speak â arrived at the present. And this context is that of the 1980s, where the relationship between the state and social life is being radically reimagined (rolled back), and where neo-liberal ideas of self-reliance and independence are dominant (see Conclusion)."
124,509,0.988,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"5 Ontological Competition In the past sections we have looked at structures of possibilia mainly under the aspect of co-possibility, investigating possible collections of possible beings that can (or even must) be grouped together. We now turn to the contradictory aspect of incompatibility. Let us have a look at three examples from the realm that is to provide the material interpretation to our formal theory, which we will consider as test cases for its power to model phenomena of incompatibility. (Example 1) A human couple, Elizabeth and Peter, actually have a lot of children and they could have had even more children, or a distinct lot of possible children, or another lot, or â¦ However, there clearly is an upper limit to the number of children they could have had, determined (roughly speaking) by the minimum length of a pregnancy and the maximum duration a woman can bear children. So, the number of the possible children of Elizabeth and Peter exceeds the upper limit of children they could have had by far. Any collection of possible children of a number that exceeds this upper limit is not compatible. (Example 2) Two possible mammals, A and B, are such that they not only have the same ancestors but result from the very same sperm and egg, while their dates of conception are a few seconds apart. For the scope of this example we understand beings of the kind of A and B to be individuated by their time of conception (among other things). Hence we must see A and B as incompatible individuals. (Example 3) A cell of a kind that reproduces by fission actually splits into the two daughter cells D1 and D2 , but it could have split in a different way (e.g., distributing its material in a different way) that would have led to the two possible daughter cells E1 and E2 . But every cell can split only onceâthough its daughter cells may split in turn, it is no longer there to split up again. Hence D1 is incompatible with E1 , D1 is incompatible with E2 , and so on. In fact, as there plausibly are many possibilities for a cell to split up, there will be a large plurality of incompatible pairs of possible daughter cells for each cell. These examples illustrate three general observations that are relevant to the task of modeling phenomena of incompatibility. Firstly, incompatibility need not be a twoplace relation. It may well be that each two of the many possible children of Elizabeth and Peter of (Example 1) are compatible, but clearly no collection of a hundred of them is a population of any possibility.19 Robert Brandom makes a corresponding observation with respect to sentences or claims: âthe claim that the piece of fruit in my hand is a blackberry is incompatible with the two claims that it is red and that it 19 Here we are bracketing the intuitions behind (Example 2) and (Example 3). But even taking into"
245,755,0.988,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"they are complemented by a generous loan system (e.g., the UK) than in a country where loans are non-existent (e.g. Romania). This is of course to some degree a matter of trial and error, but it underlines the need for research to not only identify âwhat worksâ, but âwhy it worksâ. A ï¬nal point of note here is that the deï¬nition of âwhat worksâ is much less ï¬xed than it seems. Superï¬cially, one might think it simply meant any policy which is consistent with higher rates of participation or completion for students from under-represented groups. But when results are politically unwelcome, one frequently ï¬nds that the deï¬nition of âwhat worksâ changes. For instance, to take the example of minority ethnic groups in the UK, student campaigners tend not to applaud the fact that Black and Asian participation rates are up; rather, the fact that these students will begin their working life with considerable debt is evidence of inequity, as it may limit their choice of career or place of residence. Such restrictions on graduates are of course valid policy concerns, but they stretch the deï¬nition of equity considerably. With those caveats out of the way, we can look speciï¬cally at the kinds of programs which have a positive track record in terms of improving equity. With respect to early intervention programs targeted on under-represented groups, at a very general level, observers have noted that the most successful programs are the ones which (among other things) are highly intrusive (i.e. require frequent contact with young people), set high academic expectations, and empower students and parents and help them believe that they can succeed (Swail et al. 2012). In general, the programs which are most successful seem to be the more intensive ones, which combine some elements of academic support, mentoring and promises of ï¬nancial support. Interventions which only attack a single one of those areas are less likely to promote access, though it is possible they may be more cost effective. One widely-noted randomized ï¬eld experiment (Bettinger et al. 2012) involved offering low-income parents a chance to have their childâs ï¬nancial aid form ï¬lled out by a tax professional and to receive information on both tuition at nearby schools and their childrenâs likely aid package. The result was an 8 % increase in college enrolment rates among the treatment group compared to the control group. With respect to reserving places for under-represented groups, the evidence from India and Brazil is that this system does increase access for under-represented groups in a brute-force kind of way (Carnoy et al. 2013), but there has been little follow-up with respect to subsequent success for these groups. However, as the example of the former socialist countries in Europe can attest, large-scale reservation of places for universities based on social background is a recipe for breeding cynicism about the quality of higher education. With respect to ï¬nancial interventions, there is a fair bit of research from the United States which looks at student price-response (Dynarski 2003; Heller 1997; McPherson and Schapiro 1991; Leslie and Brinkman 1987)âthat is, at the overall elasticity of demandâsome of which also looks speciï¬cally at student price-response among underserved groups (mainly lower-income students. Broadly speaking, the American research says that a change in net cost of $1000 increases enrolment by 3â5 % points and that elasticity of demand is greater among students"
96,155,0.988,Networks in the Russian Market Economy,"shoved aside completely in the name of non-instrumental friendship (Boltanski 1990; Kharkhordin 2005, 2009). In the remaining text of this section, justification theory is first described in short and then, in the next section, applied to the Russian managersâ interview data. The basic idea of justification theory is that the normal, conventional course of action â for example, running a business â tends from time to time to drift into a dead end. Justification theory focuses on these âcritical momentsâ â crises, conflicts, and disputes â which force the disagreeing parties to argue and justify their actions by referring to âa common goodâ recognized and accepted by both parties.7 In order to settle the dispute, the parties have to establish a principle of equivalence, against which the arguments presented in the dispute can be evaluated, and the âworthâ (grandeur) of the disputants can be measured. Boltanski and ThÃ©venot describe six different orders of worth, each of them referring to a different principle defining the âworthâ, âsizeâ, or âgreatnessâ (grandeur) of the disputing parties. They distinguish six common worlds based on these principles and on the beings (persons or things) that inhabit these worlds.8 First, in the market world, the greatness (grandeur) of an actor is defined by wealth and ultimately measured by markets. The greatness of a physician in this world, for example, could be measured by her commercial success in medical business. Second, in the industrial world, to continue the example, the same physician may be valued â irrespective of her commercial success â by her efficiency and measured in concrete terms, for example, by the number of patients handled per day. Third, in the domestic world, the greatness of the physician is evaluated by her position in the system of mutual dependency. Valued or âworthyâ in this world is oneâs trusted family doctor who has been treating all the members of the family for years and with whom one can always jump the queue to get an appointment. Fourth, in the civic world, a doctor is evaluated by her willingness to treat all patients equally as citizens. Fifth, in the world of fame, a great person would be a well-known media figure (such as Dr. Phil), whereas in the inspired world such a figure would be a genius surgeon who is the only one able to conduct certain operations because of her unique, God-given artistic capabilities.9 In this book the focus is mostly on the domestic and market orders of worth and the tensions between them. It is important to note that economic relations are not to be identified with market worth since a firm, for example, may be analyzed as a âcompromising deviceâ between the market and industrial worth (ThÃ©venot 2001)."

158,83,0.988,Microfinance 3.0 : Reconciling Sustainability With Social Outreach and Responsible Delivery,"4.2 Relevant Changes in the Discourse About Microfinance While the Compartamos IPO and its problematic aspects did not have a great deal of impact in the general press, the events surrounding the SKS IPO and the ensuing Indian microfinance crisis and the intrusion of purely commercial lenders who pushed consumer lending under the misleading name of MF made headlines in the press. One very prominent American business magazine published several articles about the âdark side of micro lendingâ; the highly respected German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine bluntly declared that the model of microfinance had failed, and others declared that microfinance would be almost dead, at least as far as its ethical appeal is concerned. Even more important is the change of attitude in the more specialized microfinance-related literature. For the sake of brevity, I only want to briefly comment on three widely read and discussed recent books on MF. The first one is âConfessions of a Microfinance Hereticâ by Hugh Sinclair (2012) As the title suggests, this book is highly provocative in its tone and content. The author recounts his negative experience with several MFIs and MF support organizations for which he had worked. He demonstrates that these organizations and the leading people behind them are irresponsible, profit and power seeking and not in the least socially and developmentally responsible. Of course, there are institutions and individual people in the MF business that deserve to be criticized in the way Sinclair does it in his book and related publications and public appearances. And it is justified to point out that the former MF hype may have encouraged the entry of shady characters into MF. However, Sinclair refrains from explicitly generalizing what he documents for individual cases. Therefore, one might say that he was unfortunate to run into black sheep several time in his career as a MF consultant. But apart from his caution of not explicitly making very sweeping statements, his book conveys the impression that what he reports represents a general feature of todayâs MF and that there are many black sheep. In this sense he contributes substantially to the current trend of putting MF down. The second book is more important and richer in substance. In âWhy Doesnât Microfinance Work?â Milford Bateman (2010) attacks what he considers to be central weakness of the relatively new breed of MFIs. The subtitle âThe Destructive Rise of Local Neoliberalismâ suggests what his answer to the title question is. In equally strong words like those of Sinclair, Bateman attacks aid-supported MFIs and donor support for these ânew style MFIsâ as cementing underdevelopment and poverty instead of fostering development and making a contribution to poverty alleviation, as has again and again been claimed by thousands of MF enthusiasts. As a conclusion, he recommends to simply discontinue the policy of supporting MF with technical and financial assistance from the advanced countries. I see two main arguments in this study. The first one is that modern MF is a manifestation of a neoliberal policy that grossly underestimates the role that government interventions can and should play for economic development. Much of modern MF is indeed inspired by anti-government and pro-private sector"
51,179,0.988,How Generations Remember,"In this excerpt, the lecturer reinforces his disapproval of nationally divided universities. He claims that even so-called national subjects do not have to be taught separately so long as they are based on objective science. In the case of history, the lecturer argues that objective history is possible only if one excludes (national) emotions. If history is based on facts and excludes emotions, it can be objective and therefore attractive to all students regardless of their nationality. However, when we examine the last paragraph of the interview cited above, it becomes evident that the decision of what is defined as an objective fact lies solely with the respective historian. It is the authority his words are granted that enables him to claim objective history for himself while denying it to a national counterpart. As will be explored further in the remainder of the chapter, the victimisation of the Bosniak people is at the centre of the Bosniak local history representation. This is also the point from which the lecturer begins his narration, as indicated in his last paragraph cited above, in which he legitimises what happened to the Bosniaks as objective historical fact by using phrases such as âhistorical tragedyâ, a âtrue tragedyâ and âobjectively one true tragedyâ in the same sentence. As I will explore in the next section, the Bosniaks, unlike the Croats, do not draw the same conclusion about their perceived historical role as victims."

Our terminology reflects that for one agent to have a âtheory of mindâ of another agent is for the first agent to have beliefs (etc.) about the beliefs of another agent. An early, if not the first, use of the phrase âtheory of mindâ in this sense can be found in [39] â but there the discussion is non-computational, based as it is on experimental psychology, entirely separate from AI. Early modeling of a classic theory-of-mind experiment in psychology, using the tools of logicist AI, can be found in [3]. For a presentation of an approach to achieving literary creativity specifically by performing actions that manipulate the intensional attitudes of readers, including actions that specifically violate what readers believe is going to happen, see [23]."
315,227,0.988,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"This category, of whom the majority are female, lives in the neighborhood. They stand out from the other three groups due to the level of study they have reached. All the young adults in this type have gained a qualification, two-thirds of them having taken their baccalaurÃ©at (usually following a professional or technological stream). Equally, three-quarters of them were employed, usually as office workers, although almost half only had temporary contracts. Although these youngsters believed that their schooling would ensure their upward mobility, they today find themselves in an insecure situation and underqualified in the labor market, which leaves them feeling very frustrated. They match the profile of Beaudâs (2002) â80% in their baccalaurÃ©at â¦ and then what?â youngsters, which corresponds to the massification of upper-secondary-school and higher education which took place in 1985. Their deception is the greater because, having been influenced by their parentsâ dreams of upward mobility, they truly believed that they could achieve this through educational success. However, once they find themselves taking degree courses at university (in Law and Economic and Social Administration in particular), after having followed a technological or professional curriculum at school, they fail. Some âstick at itâ but only gain a lower qualification, leaving them still in subordinate professional positions. This loss of social position is felt all the more strongly because they have to go on living in the neighborhood: insecure, they have to continue living with their parents. They entirely reject the neighborhood, with its norms and practices, and its inhabitants who contribute to its degradation. The only way to avoid being subject to these âharmful effectsâ is, on the one hand, to spend as little time as possible there and, on the other, to make oneself as invisible as possible when obliged to be there. As with the second type (the Invisible Proletarians), they live a double life: all their activities and their friends are outside the neighborhood. Being âinâ and being âoutsideâ the neighborhood represents two split social worlds â where one is tolerated, the other represents their aspirations. An end to their professional insecurity would enable them to succeed in accessing this new way of life, far from the neighborhood. They possess all the resources needed for this â qualified, experienced, they"
334,230,0.988,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"cases we studied all received (prominent) media attention. However, our sample includes one case (CH1) with weak public attention, where the political access mechanism was activated silently. Here, negotiations with the decision-makers allowed for a compromise which included the deportation and the arranged postdeportation return of the beneficiary thanks to the acquisition of a work permit for particular talents. Even if deportation could not be impeded, a possibility of return and regularization could be achieved by the protestersâa case outcome that can hardly be seen as a complete failure and that we will come back to in the conclusion. We ultimately have to acknowledge that, on our level of observation, the political arena where decisions are produced appears to a large extent as a black box. This black box contains negotiations behind closed doors, such as those of Hardship Commissions, and deal-making with persons who are able to decide on or influence the decision-making process in a particular case. As political scientists such as Kenneth Shepsle (1998, 238) have shown, âpoliticians engage in deal-making all the time,â making it appear as a key feature of institutionalized politics. It lies in the nature of deals that they are secret, reciprocal in character, and at the moment of the deal âvictimizing one of the partiesâ (ibid.), because the payoff for the other party comes only later. These features of deal-making are therefore often difficult to accept for civil society actors who do not participate in the deal-making, especially in cases of negative decisions for the beneficiaries of anti-deportation protests. The case studies show on the one hand that political, administrative, and judicial decisions suspending the enforcement of deportations are doubtlessly influenced by protest activities. These, on the other hand, are influenced by other processes we can hardly assess. One example is case D2, of a Roma family. The negative decision of the Hardship Commission might have resulted from the fact that one of the commission members had been harshly accused of ethical impropriety by the familyâs father (interviews D2_2, D2_3); it might have been grounded in the desire not to create cases of precedent for further Roma (at that time, about 7000 were threatened with deportation in one city alone, interview D2_8). Given the non-transparent character of the hardship decisions and the competing interpretations of the interviewees, alternative explanations need to be considered. To sum up, processes aiming at political access are methodologically difficult to fully reconstruct. Our sample nevertheless contains one case that was obviously successful due to political access, direct negotiation, and deal-making. In case CH2, an intervieweeâa politician participating in the protestsâtold us that the person that pronounced the final decision owed him a favor. This debt was settled through the regularization of our intervieweeâs protÃ©gÃ© (Interview CH2_4). This dimension might be worth exploring for future research.

180,120,0.988,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"CEA systematically departs from judgments many people will make about what is fair. The priorities problem asks how much priority we should give to people who are worse off. By constructing a unit of health effectiveness, such as the QALY, CEA assumes this unit has the same value, regardless of who gets it or wherever it goes in a life (âA QALY is a QALYâ is the slogan). But intuitively, many people think that a unit of health is worth more if someone who is relatively worse off (sicker) gets it rather than someone who is better off (less sick) (Brock 2002). At the same time, people generally do not think we should give complete priority to those who are worse off. We may be able to do little for them, so giving them priority means we would have to forego doing more good for others. Few would defend creating a bottomless pit out of those unfortunate enough to be the worst off. Similarly, CEA assumes that we should aggregate even small benefits. Then, if enough people get small benefits, it outweighs giving large benefits to a few. But intuitively, most people think some benefits are trivial goods that should not be aggregated to outweigh larger benefits to a few (Kamm 1993). Curing many peopleâs colds, for example, does not outweigh saving a single life. Finally, CEA favors putting resources where we get a best outcome, whereas people intuitively favor giving people a fair (if not equal) chance at a benefit. Locating an HIV/AIDS treatment clinic in an urban area may save more lives than placing a clinic in a rural area, but in doing so, we may deny many people a fair chance at a significant benefit (Daniels 2004)."
363,113,0.988,History and Cultural Memory in Neo-Victorian Fiction,"Like this collector, Cropper seeks to know the past through possession of its objects and dead relics. His Ash scholarship prioritises a kind of literary tourism; he walks in the poetâs footsteps on the journeys he took and possesses any object he touched, some of which, like Ashâs watch, Cropper keeps on his own person. Ashâs texts, including his correspondence, become more of these relics to be possessed. The novel ties Cropperâs acquisitiveness to his American nationality. A current of anxiety circulates throughout the novel about the loss, during a period of economic decline for England, of English cultural artefacts to rich Americans, like Cropper, who, having purchased them, return with them to their own country. The physical description of Cropper dwells upon his nationality, so that he even purses his lips âin American, more generous than English pursingâ and he has âAmerican hips, ready for a neat belt and the faraway ghost of a gunbeltâ (95). John J. Su observes that this evocation of the âmythos of the Wild Westâ links his national identity âto the threat he represents to the other characters in the novelâ (Su, 2004: 684), the threat that he will appropriate and remove national artefacts. This anxiety centres ultimately upon the clandestine correspondence of Ash and LaMotte, and the fear that Cropper will purchase it and remove it from England. Blackadder, in his attempts to prevent this, comes up against the inscrutability of Thatcherâs economics: Blackadder had written to every public body he could think of who might be concerned with the Ash-LaMotte correspondence. He had lobbied the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art, and had requested an interview with the Minister for the Arts, which had resulted in a dialogue with an aggressive and not wholly gentlemanly civil servant, who had said that the Minister was fully apprised of the importance of the discovery, but did not believe that it warranted interfering with Market Forces. It might be possible to allocate some small sum from the National Heritage Trust. It was felt that Professor Blackadder might attempt to match this sum from private sponsorship or public appeal. If the retention of these old letters in this country is truly in the national interest, this young man appeared to be saying, with his vulpine smile and slight snarl, then Market Forces will ensure that the papers are kept in this country without any artificial aid from the state. (398) England is implicated in these transactions, and if the novel parodies acquisitive America then it also excoriates the compliance of Thatcherâs England. It is clear, in the novel, that the small sums Blackadder might"
48,60,0.988,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"predictions they were almost certain not to exceed. The extra buffer in the planned use of effort was used for improvements in quality, training, testing, and documentation (exploiting Parkinsonâs law). For the company, this decrease in productivity was not beneficial and it soon stopped rewarding accurate time predictions. The strategies of producing accurate time predictions by lowering productivity in situations with too high time predictions or cutting corners in situations with too low time predictions require the work process or product to be flexible. This is the case for much of what we do in life. If I make a bet on how long it will take to drive to work, I may be able to win the bet by adjusting my behaviour, especially if the prediction is high. If my prediction is as long as 60 minutes, I can drive slowly, stop at the gas station to fill up the tank, and spend time on searching for the perfect parking spot. If my prediction is a bit on the low side, for example, 25 minutes, I can drive fast, violate traffic rules, and park illegally. We could call the first prediction accuracy strategy work stretching (stretching work to fit a high prediction) and the second work shrinking (shrinking work to fit a low prediction). These strategies are common. Without them, our time predictions would look worseâsometimes much worseâthan they currently do. Stretching and shrinking may sometimes be acceptable, but these strategies may violate other important goals, such as productivity and quality. Take home message 1: Time predictions may affect the work, especially when it is highly flexible. Time predictions that are slightly too low may increase productivity, while those that are much too low or too high may decrease productivity. Time predictions that are too low may also lead to reductions in the quality of the work. Take home message 2: Rewarding accurate time predictions is usually not a good idea, particularly if people behave strategically and stretch the work (lower work productivity) or shrink it (lower work quality) to fit the prediction.12"
13,404,0.988,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Sexuality in the oldest generation is felt as exclusively male, just as the preoccupation with the body is felt as female. The men in this generation tend to split sexuality and tenderness. Only men are seen as having sexual drives, and for some of them this leads to pretty rough seductive manners towards âcheap girlsâ. For others, especially those with a sentimentalised relationship with their mothers, sexuality becomes associated with guilt because it may hurt and harm the kind and innocent woman. Women who initiate sexual contacts are dismissed as prostitutes or even monsters by both categories of men. Ideal femininity is a moral thing, connected to the inner qualities of a woman rather than to sexual appearances and activity. In the middle generation the feelings of guilt and the protection of innocent and vulnerable women have disappeared. This does not necessarily mean that all the men of this generation behave as sexually unrestricted and irresponsible people, but some do, and now not only towards âcheap girlsâ. Seen from the perspective of the men, all girls may be more or less sexually accessible and it is up to the men to test out the limits. Since masculinity is now almost only based on sexuality, this also forms their image of the attractive woman: she should look good and be sexy. She is not the prostitute of their fathersâ generation, but neither is she a relative of their own kind and caring mothers. Yet, their identification with their mothers as âlike subjectsâ may still have made them more perceptive to the increased subject status of women in their own generation. In combination with the more liberal sexual norms in the 1960s and 1970s, this may also have conveyed an understanding of women as more active and responsible for their own acts, and thus have contributed to allaying the feelings of guilt for male sexuality that we saw in the older generation. But since masculinity is so strongly connected to sexuality, it is important to be in charge. Sexually forward or aggressive women are still felt as wrong, but now maybe more threatening to their fragile masculinities than morally condemned. The gendering of sexual initiative is much less prominent in the youngest generation. The men in the youngest generation tend to like women who are active and who initiate encounters, but not to the extent that it makes them feel treated like objects. They prefer sexuality as part of an intimate relationship, but also experience it as two different dimensions"
252,143,0.988,The Ethics of Vaccination,"requests (Blank et al. 2013; Omer et al. 2012; Rota et al. 2001). For example, in Michigan, one year after the implementation of the inconvenience model in 2106, exemption rates fell by 39% (and by 60% in the Detroit area) (Higgins 2016; Navin and Largent 2017). A second approach is slightly less favourable to considerations of individual liberty, but still aims to strike a balance between liberty, effectiveness of vaccination policies, and fairness. According to this approach, individuals who are exempted from vaccination mandates should be required to compensate society for their failure to contribute to herd immunity. In this way, people would still be free to refuse vaccination, but they would be discouraged from doing so, and would have to pay a price if they did refuse. There are two ways of understanding this requirement. Both interpretations are based on a comparison between conscientious objection to vaccination and conscientious objection to the military service. According to one version of this view, as we saw in Chap. 3, individuals who refuse vaccination should be required to make an alternative contribution to society in the form of a tax, in lieu of their contribution to herd immunity through vaccination. The size of this alternative contribution should depend on the extent to which non-vaccination is likely to harm others, which in turn depends on factors such as the severity and morbidity of the disease in question (Clarke et al. 2017). However, while this approach points in the right direction by giving some weight to considerations of fairness, there are two problems with it. The first is that any case of non-vaccination is unlikely to harm others where herd immunity exists, and therefore people would be required to make an alternative contribution only where vaccination rates are low, which would contradict a requirement of fairness. Second, people who are exempted from military service are typically not taxed, but are required to make an alternative contribution to society. But a tax in this context would look a lot like a financial penalty, rather than an alternative contribution. Overall, the problem with this approach is that, while it is similar to my suggested model of compulsory vaccination in that it proposes a financial penalty for non-vaccination, it only applies this tax/penalty in proportion to the actual risk posed by non-vaccination. The implication is that if the risk is negligible, vaccine refusers could simply get away with non-vaccination and free-ride on herd immunity, failing to make their fair contribution to the fulfilment of the collective obligation to realize herd immunity."

8,295,0.988,"Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks: From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN: With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn","with these tricks we can only go so far, because in order to express how small an elementary particle is and how large the currently observable part of the Universe is, we must use numbers that are again beyond our direct comprehension. There are as many protons in a centimeter as there are for example centimeters in the diameter of Earthâs solar orbit, and as another example consider the many Earth orbitâs diameters needed to reach from here to the furthest visible spiral nebulaâ that is to say, somewhere between 1013 and 1014 . Who can comprehend the number 1013 ? With an effort I can have a feeling for one million, 106 : a million teaspoons of water is about one cubic meter. But even 109 âa billionâis difficult. Do you want to be a billionaire? Put aside a Swiss Franc every second for 32 yearsâthen youâll be one. One million years yields 3  1013 s. String protons together, one each secondâin a million years youâll have a chain barely 3 cm long; string together centimeter-sized pearls, one each second, and in a million years the chain will reach from here to the sun. Lay together an Earth orbit every second, and after a couple million years you will reach the furthest visible spiral nebula (or to be precise, where that spiral nebula was a couple billion years ago, when its light started in our direction). And a last example, which we all know: on a distant island is a diamond mountain, and every hundred years a bird sharpens its beak on the mountain. When the mountain has been whetted away, the first moment of eternity will be finished. Mont Blanc would be whetted away after 1040 s (the Milky Way is only 1017 s old!) and for just as long must one lie proton next to protonâone each secondâto reach the furthest spiral nebula. After this attempt, to make the incomprehensible more comprehensible, I propose my assertion: In order to explore the enormously gigantic (1014 diameters of the earthâs orbit), we must apply our knowledge of the extremely small (10 13 cm). In large things the Universe follows the laws of macrophysics: mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics, relativity and hydrodynamics. For most part we encounter conditions that differ vastly from those surrounding us. They are more akin to those present in a nuclear experiment carried out at a cosmic scale. How can the inner structure of matterâthe extremely smallâbe the building principle of the Universe, determining for the large part the emergence of galaxies and stars and the course of their lives? All this originates and depends nevertheless on these so unusual circumstances to which matter is subjectedâor perhaps one should say, conventional conditions, a statement allowing for the fact that the conditions under which we live are extraordinary. Under these circumstances one can anticipate that each new step in understanding the extremely small develops new relationships in the extremely large and leads us further on the way, which we hope, succeeds in bringing us to a new theory capable to explain simultaneously the functioning of the Universe in both the very large and the very small. The most recent step into the very small began a few years ago, and it leads today to few if any consequences for our conceptual understanding of the Universe; I believe, however, that these will come soon. With the last step I am referring to the"

The first mode was simultaneous with the processâwe discussed each experience intensely together and with the cameraman, exchanging thoughts and feelings about what was surprising, disappointing, or delighting us. The second was a preliminary review of the results based on transcripts we made of the recorded material, which we presented at a conference a month later (Berthoin Antal & Friedman, 2009). As interesting as that material was, however, we soon realized that we, like other colleagues, had âfallen prey to the dominant approach to studying organization, by relying on discursive materialâ (Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007, p. 209). We had in our hands the pictorial material those colleagues yearned for after the fact, but we had focused on the written words we had typed up! We therefore decided to write this chapter based entirely on what we could see happening in the film material. After considering different methods of analyzing these data, we decided to apply a grounded-theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) rather than use a formal coding system derived from existing theories"

They add memory to a circuit to give it a history of whatâs gone on before. Imagine trying to count if you couldnât remember anything. You wouldnât know what number you were up to and what number comes next! Similarly, a circuit that counts (which Iâll show you later in this chapter) needs flip-flops. Flip-flops are found in a couple of different varieties. What youâve just seen is the simplest and is called an R-S (or Reset-Set) flip-flop.

She reflects that there is no one else to remember her in relationship to her childhood friend, and first love, Ellen: no one is thinking of us. We no longer exist to anything in the world. Maybe, in that forest thereâs a tree that remembers your touch when you stood there, close against it, waiting for me, over twenty years ago. Maybe that patch of bark you laid your hand on is now farther up the tree than I could reach. (96) In addition to suggesting that objects might hold a memory of touch, this passage also stresses the importance of collective memory. It suggests that if there is no one to share a memory of what is lost, then the loss is felt afresh. Isabelle lost Ellen during childhood but the realisation that there is no one to remember them together, since her parents have now died, produces a second loss. Similarly, when Eldon dies, Isabelle feels it as a loss not only of Eldon, but of the memory he embodied: he was a place she had been that still glows dimly in the memory of her flesh. Now that he has died he has taken their whole shared past with him and she is left â¦ What is she to do with her understanding of him? ... And what about her? Will anyone ever know Isabelle again, as long and as well as Eldon did? He has remembered her, so she doesnât have to â¦ the truth is that Eldonâs death means also that Isabelle will never be as she was, will not exist as strongly as before. (238) This adds a further resonance to the notion, in each novel, of embodied memory. It is not only that the past inheres in individual bodies, but that memory is held collectively by bodies, and the death of the body necessarily involves a loss of memory too. This, in turn, threatens erasure. Isabelle becomes ghostly.19"

Collective goods often also have the property that their nonconsumptive use by one person does not prohibit or infringe upon their use by others. Community flood protection is an example of a public good. Once protection is provided for one individual, it is often simultaneously provided for many others. As a result, it is not in an individualâs self-interest to volunteer to help pay for the project by contributing an amount equal to his or her actual beneï¬ts if others are willing to pay for the project. However, if others are going to pay for the project (such as the taxpayers), individuals may exaggerate their own beneï¬ts to ensure that the project is undertaken. Determining what beneï¬ts should be attributed to a project is not always simple and the required accounting can become rather involved. In a beneï¬t-cost analysis, economic conditions should ï¬rst be projected for a base case in which no project is implemented and the beneï¬ts and costs are estimated for that scenario. Then the beneï¬ts and costs for each project are measured as the incremental economic impacts that occur in the economy over these baseline conditions due to the project. The appropriate method for beneï¬t and cost estimation depends on whether or not the market prices reflecting true social values are available or if such prices can be constructed."
309,14,0.988,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"concerns of food safety and security all touch uponâin one way or anotherâthe ambiguous nature of food itself, and also indicate discontinuities of broader social transformations. Food anxiety is the bookâs common lens through which such ambiguities are considered. The very act of incorporating food constitutes the moment and the process in which materially and culturally transformed matter crosses the boundary of the body, thereby dissolving the dichotomy between âinsideâ and âoutsideâ, between the self and the world (Fischler 1988, 279). In this understanding, boundaries are crossed at various scales, connecting but also disconnecting the eating body with the multiple contexts it lives in. It is exactly the linking and disrupting quality of foodstuffâa foodâs transgressive capacity (Goodman and Sage 2014)âthat accounts for its ambivalent nature and makes us speak of âfood anxietyâ. Therein, we understand the lens of food anxiety as constitutive for unravelling social theoretical insights into the relationship between the individual and society.3 What we observe in the vast field of food-related literature is that âfood anxietyâ is more often than not used without further conceptual explanation or becomes boiled down to paramount incidences of food scandals.4 We argue that âfood anxietyâ has more to offer than being a descriptive term for the emotional and institutional management of food safety risks, as we will detail below. This volume brings together authors from various disciplines and while their contributions are united in that they all deal with dimensions of food anxiety in Vietnam, the authors follow their own distinct methodological and theoretical approaches to food. Likewise, this introductory chapter should be seen as one, namely the editorsâ interpretation of what follows in the outline of the book parts. By applying our lens of food anxiety, we will frame the three thematic dimensions along which the book is organised: âBodily Transgressions: Identity, Othering, and Self â (Part I), âFood Safety: Trust, Responsibilisation, and Copingâ (Part II), and âThe Politics of Food Securityâ (Part III). When it came to naming this edited volume, food anxiety as the contributionsâ mutual lens quickly asserted itself into the title. Since all contributions focus on Vietnam, adding the countryâs name was also an easy decision. But then it took multiple attempts of testing the conceptual sound of âVietnam and beyondâ and the like to finally come down with"

Students reported an overall positive experience of using the PLE. Using a Likert-type rating scale with a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) all but two students either agreed or strongly agreed with the specified statements, such as âI find a PLE useful for my work,â âI accomplish my work more effectively with a PLE,â âI find the exercises provided in the PLE helpful for my learning,â âIt is easy for me to use a PLE,â âIt is easy for me to use a PLE,â and so on (see Appendix x for the detailed results of this PUEU survey). Interestingly, the two negatively formulated questions, namely âI find using a PLE frustratingâ and âI find interacting with a PLE requires a lot of my mental effortâ received less positive answers, namely 7 students agreed or strongly agreed, and 13 students were neutral or disagreed. Several questions in the PUEU survey inquired whether students would like to modify their PLE by adding new widgets or by replacing widgets. The majority of students (15 or more) agreed with this premise. Furthermore, the perceived value of specific widgets was also investigated. They remarked that they thought that the preassembled PLE/Moodle space was well designed. This manifested as very positive ratings for all widgets. The actual Moodle usage logs, however, indicate that only a few ROLE widgets were actually used by the students (mainly the translation tool and some of the exercises), although the teacher encouraged usage in every class. The results from the survey, therefore, can be seen as representative of potential interest rather than reflecting active ROLE widget usage. Significantly the English students completed fewer surveys than those on other courses, and correspondingly their rating was also less positive. In the English courses it appears that the focus was on the exercises and, in contrast to the German/ French courses, where the English teacher used the PLE/Moodle spaces less frequently in class. The survey also revealed that the majority of English students did ânot know what was meant by PLEâ (more than half of the given answers). Those English students who declared an understanding of the term PLE also rated the perceived usefulness and ease of use positively albeit less than those students in the German/French courses. It also appears that the English students also are less inclined to assemble or change widget spaces (as evidenced by the answers to the respective questions). In addition, the responses relating to the perceived value of the provided tools appear to be mostly average, with only the translator and exercises being rated slightly more positive. Results from the Activity Recommender and To-Learn task list: In addition SJTU also conducted a further evaluation of two specific widgets, namely the To-Learn list and the Activity Recommender, within the Business English class. The To-Learn list enabled students to define and work on to-do-lists specific for learning. The Activity Recommender supported students in preparing a presentation, and can add tasks to the To-Learn list if the student agrees. For this evaluation, the students were given the mandatory homework of preparing a set of slides for a product presentation and also needed to use a PLE space that contained the two"
310,53,0.988,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"Here, the reader commenting on the article categorises the LGBT community as engaging in nonsensical activities. In order to understand the defence mechanism at play here, we need to focus on the event described in the article, the gay parade, which the reader seems to be hostile to (despite him/her stating that everyone is free to privately express their sexuality). This hostility manifests itself not only in relation to LGBT community members but also to anyone supporting them (e.g. the mayor and city council). This extension towards anyone related to this social group represents a mechanism of generalisation juxtaposing âI, myselfâ from âthemâ, thus highlighting the fear of an attack to oneâs own identity. On the one hand, the commenter seems to be in favour of sexual freedom as a commonsense principle for all individuals, but then on the other, ironically labels gay parades as âridiculous nonsenseâ. We would like now to go through an example of a xenophobic comment taken from the Italian weekly news magazine Lâespresso, addressed against the Roma community, which is often discriminated against in Italy: (3) Quando vedrÃ² un ROM onesto nevicherÃ  il 15 di Agosto! Eâ lâora di farsi sentire, di far capire a questa feccia che prima vengono i diritti degli onesti cittadini e poi i loro. Non se ne puÃ² piÃ¹ di vivere col terrore che ti vengano a svaligiare casa, causandoti molti danni per pochi euro di refurtiva. Basta!!! Che se ne tornino nei Balcani, devono capire che lâItalia deve essere un paese deromizzato.3 When I see an honest Roma person it will be snowing on the 15th August! Itâs time to raise the voice. The time has come to make this scum understand that the rights of honest citizens come ï¬rst and then theirs follow. Enough with living with the fear of burglars who cause lots of damage for just a few euros of loot. Enough!!! Let them go back to the Balkans, they need to understand that Italy has to be deromanised! More so than the previous examples, this comment shows how the phenomenon of stereotype-forming is deeply rooted in society. With a strong emphasis on the use of (cynical) sarcasm, the reader underlines how being honest and being a Roma person is contradictory and essentially âas odd as snow in mid-Augustâ. The readerâs cognitive process follows the line of advocating a common ï¬ght against a foe (âthemâ) with a clear defence strategy of âus honest peopleâ against âthem, dishonest Romaâ (as in the eternal ï¬ght between good and evil). The xenophobic climax is reached with the use of the term âscumâ to deï¬ne the entire Roma group. This is a case where a stereotype is taken to an extreme, becoming prejudice, and where categorisation becomes a hate instrument. Roma people are pointed at as thieves or brigands from whom Italians have to defend themselves. In this sense, a strong nationalism underlies this particular example of categorisation, which is deeply rooted in the readerâs belief that the country needs to be âderomanisedâ. All in all, what is perceived as a huge social problem is given an extreme solution: as in the"

185,138,0.988,The Essence of Software Engineering,"1.2 The Importance of Measurement As noted above, and following Lord Kelvin, it seems promising to suggest that a path to understanding of the nature of software might be through grappling with questions about how to measure it. The Empirical Methods community has been a key focal point of ongoing efforts to measure software. A central challenge the community has faced is the continuing effort to measure the size of a piece of software. Some attempts have focused on how to count the number of âlinesâ of computer code, others have grappled with trying to measure the size of non-code artifacts, and the complexity of any and all of these artifacts. Other attempts have instead focused on process issues, suggesting that measuring the time, money, and effort taken to develop a piece of software might also be a good way to measure the size of the software item itself. These ongoing efforts do not yet seem to have led to universal agreement about how to measure the size of software but they have demonstrated correlations between many of the suggested measures. The magnitude of this ongoing challenge suggests the profundity of the question, and also suggests that growing understandings of how to measure size may well be leading to important deep understandings about the nature of software as an entity. We now suggest that these attempts and preliminary successes might be of value and interest to practitioners in other computer-software-like areas. And it indeed raises the question of whether these other practitioners might have had some success in measuring their own artifacts that could be of interest and value to computer software engineers."

As in Germany, the PISA project on education has also had some impact in Austria. In the area of education, the Italian case highlights the importance of the personal commitment and interest of policymakers in a specific issue. Furthermore, prior governmental influence also emerges as an important factor: dialogue contributions directly solicited by the government seem to stand a better chance of being used instrumentally, that is to modify existing policies or legislation. This, however, does not rule out symbolic uses. From a comparison of all DIAMINT case studies we may conclude that symbolic knowledge utilisation is most prevalent with regard to the theme of accommodating new religious diversity. In comparison to naturalisation and education, religious diversity is also the theme most frequently covered by the media and where the influence of media is strongest. This is not surprising. All over Europe religious diversity is closely associated with the growing presence of Islam. This is a very sensitive and highly politicised issue that leaves little room for serious consideration of research outcomes. With regard to naturalisation, the Austrian case signals a lack of willingness to use the outcomes of international research, particularly if these are not in line with national ideas on policymaking. This phenomenon is by no means unique to Austria. If knowledge produced by third parties, for example by international bodies, is unwelcome, governments may argue that the organisation that commissioned the research, such as the EU or the OECD, holds no responsibility for the policy area at stake and is therefore not qualified to pronounce on national policies. It is again the PISA example that shows the limited validity of such arguments. Finally, it should be noted once more that academics sometimes actively seek to engage in research-policy dialogues via the media, thus following their own âsymbolicâ interests, such as the wish to reproduce their expert status or to secure the relevance of their academic work or their specific organisation. This not only occurs at the level of individual researchers, but also at an institutional level. In the UK and the Netherlands in particular we found universities and research funders to be quite keen on generating media attention for their projects.

The AIXI formula is a natural answer, as it specifies which action generates the highest expected return with respect to a distribution M that learns any computable environment in a strong sense (Theorem 1). The question of optimality is substantially more delicate than this however, as illustrated by the common dilemma of when to explore and when to instead exploit knowledge gathered so far.

Currently, Devs felt that DevOps mostly meant that they get additional operations tasks to deal with once in a while, and when they are completed, they go back to developing. Clearly, this view is counterproductive for improving collaboration between the teams, and to avoid this, guidance and instructions are a necessity. Had a third round of interviews been performed later into the adoption process, it is likely that the collaboration between the teams had been further improved, and that DevOps had stabilized more. When the second round of interviews was performed, however, employees were still adapting to the new responsibilities. Since people change slowly, it is not surprising to see certain instability, uncertainty, and reluctance among the employees."
124,528,0.988,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"What this suggests is introducing a richer modal language for basic STIT, referring also to the two stages: ânowâ and ânextâ. This motivates the NEXT-STIT of Broersen (2011), and we will also encounter this setting in the DEL-style logic of Sect. 6. But right now, we continue in a semantic mode with worlds viewed intuitively as transitions. Likewise, in order to compare STIT with PDL, we must also clarify the intuitive interpretation of PDL-style models. In particular, there are two broad views in the literature. One is that of transition models as abstract processes or machines, the other as unraveled temporal executions. On the process view, worlds are states in a process, and the relations indicate possible transitions. On this view, the model is a sort of automaton, perhaps in a very compact form, where many different transition relations can go from one state to the same next state. By contrast, the second view of PDL-models is one of unraveled temporal execution. Intuitively, once a process starts working, it produces a temporal universe of executions, being histories of successive admissible actions (cf. Clarke et al. 2000; Clarke and Emerson 1981 for this view). For the usual modal languages of action, the difference between the two views does not matter, since the execution tree is just a bisimilar unraveling of the process. And vice versa, we can think of a process as a sort of bisimulation-contracted essence of what can happen in the execution tree. But in our present setting, comparing with STIT seems to favor the temporal execution view.6 We therefore continue with the temporal view, where for simplicity, all event labels are taken to be unique.7 Like with the above basic STIT, we will not take the full temporal models here, but just the snapshots of a one-step action. A PDL action scenario is a set of labeled transitions from some initial state s, each leading to a different successor state. This can be viewed as an obvious special âone-shotâ case of the earlier-mentioned transition models."

124,8,0.988,Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action : Volume 2 of Outstanding Contributions to Logic (Volume 2),"2.1 Branching Time (BT) It is a perennial question of philosophy whether the future is open, what that question means, and what a positive or a negative answer to it would signify for us. The question has arisen in many different contextsâin science, metaphysics, theology, philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and in logic. The logical issue is not so much to provide an answer to the question about the openness of the future, nor primarily about its meaning and significance, but about the proper formal modeling of an open future: How can time and possibility be represented in a unified way? Thus clarified, the logical question of the open future is first and foremost one of providing a useful formal framework within which the philosophical issue of multiple future possibilities can be discussed. In the light of twentieth century developments in modal and temporal logic, that logical question is one about a specific kind of possibility arising out of the interaction of time and modality. That kind of possibility may be called historical possibility or, in the terminology that Belnap favors, real possibility. A formal framework for real possibility must combine in a unified way a representation of past and future, as in temporal logic (tense logic), and of possibility and necessity, as in modal logic. That combination is not just interesting from a logical point of viewâit is also of broader philosophical significance. To mention one salient example, the interaction of time and modality reflects the loss of possibilities over time that seems central to our commonsense idea of agency. Working on his project of tense logic, Arthur Prior devoted his first book-length study to the topic of Time and modality (Prior 1957). A leading idea was that temporal possibility should somehow be grounded in truth at some future time, where time is depicted as linearly ordered. In 1958, Saul Kripke suggested a different formal framework, making use of partial orderings of moments. His exchange with Prior is documented in Ploug and ÃhrstrÃ¸m (2012). The leading idea, which Prior took up and developed in his later book, Past, present and future (Prior 1967), was that the openness of the future should be modeled via a tree of histories (or chronicles) branching into the future. In terms of the partial ordering of moments m, a history h is a maximal chain (a maximal linearly ordered subset) in the orderingâgraphically, one complete branch of the tree, representing a complete possible course of events from the beginning till the end of time (see Fig. 1). If the future is not open, all possible moments are linearly ordered, and there is just one history; if the future is open, however, the possible moments form a partial ordering in which there are multiple histories. In that case, we can say that there are incompatible possibilities for the same clock time (or for the same instant, i), which lie on different histories. Tomorrow, as Aristotleâs famous example goes, there could be a sea-battle, or there could be none, and nothing yet decides between these two future possibilities."

147,290,0.988,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"decisions). What are these decision points, and how are these decisions made? Consistent with the notion that individuals can change as a result of acting entrepreneurially, the decision-making process of new venture emergence is likely highly dynamic. Although quite a challenge, researchers can make an important contribution to the field by exploring how progression through the nascent steps toward venture emergence presents choices among alternatives in the context of a changing environment that is internal in terms of the entrepreneursâ self-knowledge and the extent of venture emergence and external in terms of the market and industry. Some individuals, for instance, remain nascent entrepreneurs for long periods of time, engaging in numerous preparations to start their venture but eventually choosing not to. How and why do various motivations related to the venture-creation decision change throughout the nascent phase? As nascent entrepreneurs learn increasingly more about the different tasks and demands that go along with starting and running a venture, their views of their own skills and abilities are likely to change. In turn, these changes may affect their ultimate desire to continue or cease their venture. As individuals decide to start a new venture, does their confidence in their ability to complete some tasks (e.g., find customers) make up for their lack of confidence in their ability to complete other tasks (e.g., find investors)? Since motivation focuses attention on specific elements of available information (Ocasio, 1997; Shepherd, McMullen, & Ocasio, 2016), how do the various motivations (e.g., economic, prosocial, autonomy, and intrinsic) of nascent entrepreneurs influence the attention they pay to and the way they interpret information in venture-creation decisions? Moreover, failure occurs often in entrepreneurial undertakings and has been shown to result in both sensemaking and negative emotions (Shepherd, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2011), both of which affect motivation and decision making. How do previous failures alter entrepreneursâ perceptions of themselves and the environment and their use of decision-making tools when deciding to start a new venture? Deciding to exit an entrepreneurial venture. Recent research has begun to complement the substantial literature on entry by exploring the decision to exit a business (DeTienne, 2010; Shepherd et al., 2009; Wennberg & DeTienne, 2014; Wennberg et al., 2010) and the decision to exit a project (Shepherd & Cardon, 2009; Shepherd et al., 2011, 2014).

381,144,0.988,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"The Importance of Title I Background Title I has a historical importance as the program that led the way in federal efforts to improve educational opportunity. It has generated an ocean of research papers and policy arguments about whether to continue, improve, or abolish the program. Within the research and policy fields there is little consensus on how to interpret test scores such as NAEP in relation to Title I, and little consensus about what would constitute success (eliminating test score gaps across groups, reducing them, or keeping them from getting worse). The program is widely criticized despite increasing scores and slightly declining gaps between race-ethnic groups and decades of solid bipartisan support for the general idea of Title I. Part of the dominance of Title I in such discussions has to do with the attraction to test scores and Title Iâs linkage to NAEP. Journalists follow suit, highlighting these test scores, although whether the emphasis on scores is appropriate is an open question. In contrast, consider the field of special education. Although special educationâs budget exceeds Title I in most districts, and federal support for it now rivals Title I, it does not have a simple annual set of achievement scores to report and receives less notice. Some critics say that Title I has failed to close the achievement gaps. They also say there is no proof Title I is responsible for the modest narrowing of gaps in the test scores by race-ethnicity because NAEP does not actually identify Title I kids. Therefore, some say, Title I should be discontinued. Thus, Title I is an important topic; it would be an enormous decision to discontinue this durable but plagued symbol of the nationâs commitment to improving the education of the children of poverty."

211,135,0.988,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"Work on perception in the psychology literature has shown that when individuals put great emphasis on their knowledge structures when they allocate their attention, they are less likely to detect unanticipated stimuli. This is true even when stimuli are very striking. In numerous experiments, for instance, scholars have shown that individuals assigned a particular task often do not perceive information not relevant to that specific task regardless of how conspicuous the information is (e.g., Neisser 1976). Yet, when individuals are told that the task at hand is only slightly important, they will attend to the prominent stimulus, while individuals who are told the task is highly important are less likely to do so. Apparently, when individuals believe a task is only slightly important, they are more likely to ease up on top-down processing and engage in more bottom-up processing, which frees their transient attention to capture signals of unanticipated environmental change. On the other hand, when individuals believe a task is highly important, they are more likely to direct their attention to where change is anticipated, thereby tying up transient attention such that they do not perceive signals of unanticipated environmental change. Strategy researchers have dedicated a great deal of energy toward investigating how top-down processing decreases managersâ ability to detect discontinuous change. For instance, the top managers of Liz Claiborne effectively used top-down attention-allocation processes to respond to changes that matched their prevalent knowledge structures (i.e., incremental changes). However, these processes also blinded him to discontinuous changes: Environmental changes had decreased the value of a part of Liz Claiborneâs set of choices (in particular, those concerning production and distribution). Small, incremental changesâexploring the local neighborhood of the current positionâno longer sufficed. At the same time, larger, systematic changes lay outside the mental maps of existing management. Different mental maps of the changed performance landscape were required to move Liz Claiborne to a new performance peak. (Siggelkow 2001: 853)"

Examples of this lack of confidence in most institutions of the Russian economy and society abound both in surveys and research literature, on Russian Internet forums and in discussions with Russians. Prior to sending their children to a kindergarten or school, going to the hospital, seeing an unknown doctor or dentist or turning to a travel agency or a car mechanic, Russian citizens are first likely to consult their personal network members. The Russian traffic police are particularly notorious for their bad reputation of arbitrarily fining car drivers and driving schools for refusing driving licenses to the candidates not giving bribes (Lonkila forthcoming). Moreover, because of the hazing and bullying that takes place in the Russian army, educated young Russian men try to avoid obligatory military service either through bribing, using social relations or through other informal means (Lonkila 2008). The lack of trust also has concrete implications for economic activities. One of the IT professionals whom we interviewed, for instance, expressed a fear that an application filed at the patent registration office would be sold to outsiders. 12. The quotation marks around âWestern countriesâ indicate the problematic nature of this expression, often used in constructing the âothernessâ of Russian society. It is clear that âWesternâ countries do not constitute a homogeneous category. Nor are they, if used to refer to modern industrialized countries, located westwards from Russia. On the other hand, as will be evident from the next note, the Russians themselves are keen to use âWestâ in their own identity construction, which has long roots in Russian history. 13. One of the Russian IT directors we interviewed described his experience and difficulties in conducting business in Russia vis-Ã -vis Western countries âas having to walk five meters under waterâ. An example of this âinertia of daily lifeâ is the fact that up to and at the present time, there has been no phone directory published in St. Petersburg, and getting a lost number through a number inquiry service is extremely difficult. Therefore losing oneâs phone book â a database and an embodiment of oneâs personal network â is a smallscale social and economic catastrophe. 14. The functioning of these favors overlaps with the notion of informal economy: as in the informal economy, favors are neither regulated by states nor by market forces, but governed by social and cultural conventions. However, grasping the use of networks in terms of the âinformalâ (Portes and Haller 2005), âshadowâ or âundergroundâ economy or even ânon-market economic practicesâ (Smith and Stenning 2006) is difficult since the term âeconomyâ tends to miss the intertwining sociability aspect of the favors. Rather, we are dealing not only with strictly speaking economic but also economically relevant social practices, which are often impossible to conceptualize in terms of livelihood or income formation. It is also important to note that the sites of the use of networks âengage the full range of social and economic sites of everyday life â homes, workplaces, schools, hospitals, shops, bars, restaurants and local government offices, among othersâ (Smith and Stenning 2006: 202)."
212,71,0.988,Life Cycle Management,"Identify a clear value creation goal: never implement a sustainability action without first identifying the value creation goals the given initiative will contribute to achieve. The answer might be growth, enhanced reputation, improved risk management, or anything else, that is connected to value drivers generating business value within the organization. So, before thinking about implementing any LCM-based tools, first answer the questions âfor what purpose?â, or âwhat do we want to achieve?â and map a pathway that carries these actions all the way through to value creation for the organization. Think how you can best achieve the identified business value by reverse-engineering the path to value creation. This should include links to value drivers, business benefits, implementation strategies, and ultimately to identifying the appropriate life cycle management tools to support a given sustainability initiative. One has also to keep in mind that an organization is not homogeneous and needs are different depending on the department and place in the organizational hierarchy. The right team to reach the objective: sustainability actions are transversal to different departments, which is one of the challenges, and building the right team is important in order to ensure success. The team should include, at least a sponsor or a pilot from the department that is expecting final value creation (HR for employee engagement, marketing for product positioning, etc.) and a representative from each department involved in the value creation path. If necessary, also involve external stakeholders concerned by the value creation goal. Involve them from the beginning, i.e. from the project scoping. In large organizations, where sustainability actions are developed company-wide and are too large to be supported by a single team, they need to be subdivided into smaller actions and subtasks. Though each one of these sub-projects might not have a clear understanding of the final goal of the company, they all support the global goal and are to be monitored by the overall project sponsor, through KPI and follow-up means. Measurable indicators: define appropriate KPIs for all the different steps of the cause-effect chain, up to the value creation. The definition of indicators and target will first align all participants on results that can be expected from the action and will then help to follow the results.

Maybe the strongest assertion made by cyber-enthusiasts was that digital media would enhance democracy; however, Internet did not turn out to be a medium of truth, but could also be used for propaganda and to empower authoritarian regimes. A range of examples, ranging from online surveillance and the emergence of âfake newsâ, to the failure of much hyped âsocial media revolutionsâ in the Middle East, punctured hope that online media would improve democratic conditions. In the previous chapter (Ch. 4), I distinguished between those who believed that television could be improved and those who saw it as irredeemable, and showed how the anti-television movement chose boycotts as one method to get rid of television. Generically, the literature discussed in this chapter shows great similarities to texts discussed previously; writers issue warnings, cite dystopian ï¬ction, use sweeping statements and strong metaphors, point to Internet and digital media as sources of social change to the worse, impose a sense of urgency and use words like ârebellionâ â which should indicate that change was imperative. Although many societal problems are identiï¬ed, few political solutions are advocated. The writers are highly self-reï¬exive, and use much space to refute criticism that they are moralists, laggards or luddites. Some still advocate regulation, but the main approach is a combination of selfregulation and starting a conversation. As politics and technologies change, acts and expressions of media resistance may be found in everyday media management and the sharing of experiences. In this chapter, I have pointed to a proliferation of texts advocating media self-help, detox and fasting. Denial of foodstuffs and self-control is a familiar theme in the modern world; media fasting and detox reï¬ect yet another way for individuals to handle the contradictions of modernity (Giddens 1991; Illouz 2008). With media detox, media resistance has developed its own brand of asceticism, as self-discipline, self-denial and self-restraint are means to achieve media resistance goals (see AdairToteff 2015). In contrast to religious fasting, which is meant to bring the subjects closer to God, media fasting, even when advocated by religious groups, appear to be more about becoming a more authentic person. Yet, it is interesting to observe how churches and religious groups manage to blend centuries-old practices with modern media resistance, moving seamlessly from âfastingâ to âmedia fastingâ, illuminating again the ï¬exibility of the cause.

Increase traceability of (suggestion and feedback related) information flow The answers provided to this set of items reveal that all the involved workers participated in the suggestion making process and found it easy and useful to track the status of their suggestion(s), though some of them preferred to use the instrument in collaboration with their colleagues (both, for making suggestions, and for tracking the feedback). Similarly, all the managers participated in the management of at least one suggestion either alone or together with their colleagues. The managersâ opinions about the traceability and the formalization of the information flow are discordant. While part of the management perceives the importance and the need to trace the information flow, another part of the top management feels it is not necessary due to the minimal context of the use case. Facilitate meaningful information exchange on workplace improvements The results of these items show that categorizing issues and suggestions within predeï¬ned categories is not always easy to achieve, especially in a dynamic environment of a factory. Among the possible impediments for some of the workers, the fear of discussing ideas with the management has been mentioned. Moreover, all the workers would really like to extend the usage of the system to other departments. Application of methods and tools to support collaborative re-design and information exchange The workersâ answers related to this set of items highlight that, although they do not always use the system for voting about colleaguesâ suggestions, the fact of inserting a suggestion into the system stimulates the discussion in person. Although many of the respondents (both workers and managers) prefer to discuss face-to-face, most of them believe that it is of utmost importance to have the possibility to track a suggestion in the system because this encourages the management to provide an answer. Finally, both workers and (most of the) managers believe that the introduction of the suggestion and discussion management has had an impact on the workplace improvement, either in terms of implementing a suggestion, or improving the discussion.

In one of several similar scenes, we are shown how the teenager Benâs mother desperately try to retain real-life conversations at the dinner table; she says to Ben âCan you please not do that at the tableâ to stop his constant texting, but Ben points out that his father is texting too and the dinner disintegrates; the father says âI have to take this,â picks up the phone and talks to a client. The character of Benâs father Rich is almost too familiar; he is a successful lawyer constantly ï¬ddling with his cell phone, clearly not having a clue about what is going on in his disconnected family. It is only when his son Ben hangs himself as a result of online abuse that his father understands what is really important. The characterâs constant chatting signal loneliness and a desperate desire to connect, but also vulnerability and risk, since there is so much deception. Disconnect portrays a society where you cannot really trust anyone you meet online; the couple Cindy and Derek are severely punished for their online life as one day they ï¬nd their bank accounts empty and it turns out that someone online has stolen their identities. As their belongings are repossessed because they can no longer pay their bills, suspicion falls on the mourner that Cindy has been chatting with and trusting with their secrets, although he turns out to be innocent, the message is that deceit, surveillance and cybercrime lurks around every corner. In the third story, it is the runaway Kyle who is deceived by the journalist Nina; while Kyle is trusting and believes that she will help him to a better life, she is really only out to get a story and betrays him by giving up his address to FBI. Clearly, you cannot even trust mainstream media or lawmakers to help you if trouble strikes. Like Videodrome and Truman, Disconnect portrays media corporations to be powerful and outside the realm of policy and law-enforcement. However, in contrast to the ï¬lms about television (above), those who own and control digital networks are depicted as faceless and distant.

But real languages run on finite memory, and allocation fails when programs run out of space. Besides enabling denial-of-service attacks, finite memory has consequences for secrecy. Corollary 1 does not hold in a real programming language as is, because an increase in memory consumption can cause a previously successful allocation to fail. By noticing this difference, a piece of code might learn something about the entire state of the program. How problematic this is in practice will depend on the particular system under consideration. A potential solution is to force programs that run out of memory to terminate immediately. Though this choice might be bad from an availability standpoint, it is probably the most benign in terms of secrecy. We should be able to prove an error-insensitive variant of Corollary 1, where the only significant effect that unreachable memory can have is to turn a successful execution or infinite loop into an error. Similar issues arise for IFC mechanisms that often cannot prevent secrets from influencing program termination, leading to termination-insensitive notions of noninterference. Unfortunately, even an error-insensitive result might be too strong for real systems, which often make it possible for attackers to extract multiple bits of information about the global state of the programâas previously noted in the IFC literature [4]. Java, for example, does not force termination when memory runs out, but triggers an exception that can be caught and handled by user code, which is then free to record the event and probe the allocator with a different test. And most languages do not operate in batch mode like ours does, merely producing a single answer at the end of execution; rather, their programs continuously interact with their environment through inputs and outputs, allowing them to communicate the exact amount of memory that caused an error. This discussion suggests that, if size vulnerabilities are a real concern, they need to be treated with special care. One approach would be to limit the amount of memory an untrusted component can allocate [47], so that exhausting the memory allotted to that component doesnât reveal information about the state"

Perhaps there is a risk at this point that communicative figuration research is encountering a âbandwagon effectâ: the terminological inventory that comes with communicative figurations offers a systematic, heuristic vocabulary that many are tempted to associate their research with, although strictly speaking the theoretical and analytical tools of the figurational approach are not fully compatible with the research question. For instance, in their interesting study of the attempts in the 1950s of Hamburg and Leipzig to brand themselves as urban spaces of identity, in a process of âurban collectivity buildingâ, in Chap. 7, Yvonne Robel and Inge Marszolek recognize that â[â¦] the concept of figuration exhibits a strong bias to the investigation of communicative practices. However, not only individuals are involved in these communicative practices but also collectivities and organizations.â On this basis, they argue that it is justified to ask about the role of the citiesâ media organization for the âcollective processes of identity buildingâ, and their analysis accordingly applies a cross-media critical discourse analysis of the two citiesâ broadcasting and electronic media content, considering significant metaphors which position the cities in different ways as a âbridge to the worldâ (Leipzig) and âgateway to the worldâ (Hamburg). However, my problem is that we are not presented with an actor constellation whose negotiations, contestations and concerted efforts can be said to have resulted in the âcommunicative practicesâ (or simply âcontentsâ) disseminated by the"
385,318,0.988,Advanced R,"Unexpected errors require interactive debugging to ï¬gure out what went wrong. Some errors, however, are expected, and you want to handle them automatically. In R, expected errors crop up most frequently when youâre ï¬tting many models to diï¬erent datasets, such as bootstrap replicates. Sometimes the model might fail to ï¬t and throw an error, but you donât want to stop everything. Instead, you want to ï¬t as many models as possible and then perform diagnostics after the fact. In R, there are three tools for handling conditions (including errors) programmatically: â¢ try() gives you the ability to continue execution even when an error occurs. â¢ tryCatch() lets you specify handler functions that control what happens when a condition is signalled. â¢ withCallingHandlers() is a variant of tryCatch() that runs its handlers in a diï¬erent context.

When a respondent articulates such a strategy, it would not make sense to overrule him or her for their protection. A final reason to anonymize a respondent without being asked to do so can be the long delays in the publishing process, and a change in the situation on the ground during this process. Information that was not sensitive when provided may become sensitive by the time it is published.

378,38,0.988,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"Not everyone within the transformation research community works with a transdisciplinary approach and reflexive paradigm. The community combines a wide array of scientiï¬c disciplines and is still sorting out where exactly paradigmatic agreements lie. So within this book I pulled together the work of leading scholars who do at least reject the positivist epistemology and ontology that one ï¬nds in the mainstream economic paradigm and its methodological individualism. In this paradigm, humans do not reflect on more than the costs and beneï¬ts of the choice set with which they are confronted. So each person in their economic system behaves similarly (representative actors), regardless of where they happen to live. This is very convenient because individual behavior assumptions are aggregated into extrapolations of how the system will work as a whole and what knock-on effects it will haveâe.g., the prediction that markets will balance themselves. However, even within allegedly objective, positivist/standard economics, it has been recognized that such additive approaches risk a fallacy of aggregation, ending in incorrect predictions. For example, American economist Alfred E. Kahn warned of The Tyranny of Small Decisions as early as 1966. He stressed that market equilibrium theory must remain cautious about the reliability of its methodological individualism: small decisions by rationally calculating actors may well lead to misallocation effects on the macro scale that produce outcomes which the same individuals would not choose (Kahn 1966: 23). One prime example of this tyrannical effect in natural sciences is the way that climate change results from the cumulative effect of what seem to be negligibly small entities of additional CO2 emissions made on the individual scale."

While these activities do not bring about systemic change, they do solve a targeted problem and give the employees a sense of pride and shared values with their employer. Li & Fung, based in Hong Kong, provides a good example of such volunteerism, along with other kinds of philanthropy. The Li & Fung team in Pakistan has identified a girlsâ school that receives financial support from both Li & Fung employees and management. The employees have offered workshops there on hygiene and public speaking to help the girls feel more empowered. 3. Shared Value Companies also engage with the community through shared value initiatives. Shared value, a term coined by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer in 2011, refers to a strategy whereby companies bring economic value to themselves while addressing a social need. In their seminal article introducing this concept, they wrote, âNot all profit is equalâ¦. Profits involving a social purpose represent a higher form of capitalism, one that creates a positive cycle of company and community prosperity.â While there has been much talk and excitement about shared value in Asia, there are few examples of Asian companies successfully carrying it out. One of the more notable cases of this work is Manila Water in the Philippines. Manila Water figured out how to decrease siphoning and protect the pipeline so that clean, cheaper water reached those in the poorest districts of Manila. This successful project improved water access for the poor while at the same time increasing Manila Waterâs bottom line. Jaime Zobel de Ayala, chairman and CEO of the Ayala Group, the holding company that includes Manila Water, has said, âMeeting social needs should be embedded in our business models and should be undertaken using the same disciplines as those of business.â Another example of shared value is Kirin Beverage Companyâs Hyoketsu Wanashi pear juice. Kirin developed the product using pears from the Fukushima region as a way to support local farmers after the earthquake and tsunami that devastated that region. In addition to supporting the community, Hyoketsu Wanashi has been a great commercial success. Not surprisingly, shared value is an appealing concept. Shared value does not entail corporate philanthropy but can solve a social problem and generate profit at the same time, aligning incentives and buttressing programmatic sustainability. When the company and the community prosper, the initiatives are more sustainable over time. At this stage, shared value initiatives are new globally and very new in Asia. We can expect to see much more innovation from work of this kind in the years to come."
384,41,0.988,Practical Economics : Economic Transformation and Government Reform in Georgia 2004â2012,"Many developing countries today face similar challenges. Foreign governments and international ï¬nancial institutions press for the introduction of ever more complex rules and regulations, be it to increase their inï¬uence in the developing world, or out of sheer ignorance about potential side effects. Sometimes, the justiï¬cation for new regulation is as trivial as having something to show in return for ï¬nancial aid. But often, the only effect these new rules have is to engender corruption at the expense of struggling businesses and citizens. The lesson Georgia learned the hard way is that you cannot impose advanced regulations on a developing country in one fell swoop. In response, the government after 2004 has followed a simple set of guidelines when it came to regulation: â¢ The country is poor, and the government cannot afford to employ thousands of inspectors to oversee and enforce endless rules and regulations. â¢ In the past, the government itself and its agencies have been the most corrupt institutions, and at least some ofï¬cials will likely succumb to corruption again. â¢ In practice, most rules and regulations are not followed anyway. They do not contribute to the well-being of the population. All they do is cause corruption. â¢ So let us get rid of all non-essential regulations and simplify the remaining ones to minimize the potential for frustration, confusion, and corruption. â¢ As the country develops and the economy grows, let us introduce new regulation as it is needed and to the extent that we are able to enforce it. Following this line of reasoning, Georgiaâs regulatory framework was reduced to the immediate essentials: ï¬ghting corruption, protecting public safety, and collecting taxes. Step by step, we introduced new regulation as it became necessary, and only if we could realistically hope to enforce it. For example, wearing seatbelts in cars became obligatory in Georgia only in 2010. We had considered introducing this rule as early as 2005, but decided against it for two reasons: ï¬rstly, because there was no track record of playing by the rules at the time. We would only have created a new source of bribery for trafï¬c police ofï¬cers. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, because we had no way of enforcing such a rule at the time. In 2004, we had laid off the entire trafï¬c police force. In 2005, we"

Can we carve alternatives out of the structure rather than investing them? Answering this question is the topic of the postscript to the present chapter."

Yes, wherever in the vague morning haze of evolution the horizon of life may be hidden. For suppose, BTA C5 were not true. Then there would be at least one topologically infinite lineage of living beings, which, since every reproductive step takes some finite time and there is some lower bound to the length of such a time,16 would also be metrically infinite. So there would have been living beings before big bang, which is absurd. BTA C5 comes naturally along with BTA C7: There is no infinity of ancestor-less living beings. They neither presuppose nor preclude one single ancestor-less living being, the one and only primordial cell. It is probable that the primordial soup was boiling on more than one stove. Life grew together.17 The least obvious principle is BTA C4: Every living being has either no descendants or is an ancestor of some living being that has no descendants. This makes BTA structures topologically finite towards the reproductive future. One might motivate this by the fateful certainty of the sun running out of fuel some day in the future, or by big crunch or big chill scenarios. Large-scale modeling can be depressing. My reason for BTA C4 is rather pragmatic: let us model life up to now. Or up to any time in the past we choose (as long as it contains life). Remember, by the way, that the overwhelming majority of all living beings that ever existed never reproduced, which already makes for lots of endpoints in a BTA structure. MDSs of BTA structures, on the biological interpretation, are just the set of all ancestors of some descendant-less living being. No temporal sequence is modeled directly. No life-spans are modeled. There is no way to express the fact that individual lives are finite. It is true that remote ancestors will not coexist with their remote descendants. But there isnât even so much simultaneity modeled in a BTA structure to express this."

As a consequence, there seems to be a lack of plans or other instruments regarding drought adaptation, as well as a lack of long-term vision for this issue. This means that the district government is under no pressure due to obligations on the topic of climate change adaptation in general or drought in particular, and nor have the relevant resources been made available. Although they recognise the importance of the issue, they do not see themselves in a position to take it up, and so the district government is currently not driving any process (e.g. establishing its own guidelines, programmes, or implementing adaptation initiatives). It is individual actors that are initiating interesting activitiesâthe DROP project being one of them. The Waterboard Eifel-Rur, a drinking water producer and a hydroelectricity producer interviewed all emphasised the existence of technical projects to enhance the systemâs robustness, improve risk management and develop backup solutions in case of extreme events. We can say that drought prevention is being addressed in the context of general risk management strategies that use as inputsâ precipitation patterns. WVER can thus be described as the driving force of change in the region. As the responsible for most things water in the Eifel, they are also the ï¬rst in line to be affected by drought issues, which explains their taking a proactive approach.

234,33,0.988,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"Chapter 4 marks the shift in conceptualisation emerging from both our own evaluation and learning but coinciding with wider policy agenda. The missing piece of the jigsaw it seems was the failure to understand both conceptually and in terms of operational dynamics, the step from training through learning to individual behaviour change. We have learnt that knowledge mobilisation does not automatically derive from learning; knowledge in itself is not empowering and may, indeed, be disempowering. Knowledge mobilisation is highly contextualised and needs to be understood within the frame of wider human resource management systems. In marked contrast to the approaches favoured in health sciences focusing on âsystematic reviewsâ of published research on similar (identical) interventions, we undertook a much broader horizon-scanning research review process. Our aim here was to identify any knowledge or ideas that could facilitate our understanding of the interventionâfailure or systems stasis we were witnessing. Chapter. 4 reviews some of the work we identiï¬ed and its impact on our learning and volunteer deployment model. Chapter 5 applies the newly combined knowledge discussed in Chapter. 4 to two illustrative case studies. As we have noted, interventions in a project like the SVP take place and are modiï¬ed over time. In many ways they represent a simple âtrial and errorâ approach underpinned by intensive grounded research to facilitate our understanding of change processes or change resistance. Tracking the identiï¬cation of a âneedâ and our experience of designing and monitoring the evaluation of that process, in the light of the new knowledge gained through ongoing research review improves our understanding of the complexity of social processes. Chapter. 5 redeï¬nes the objectives of our action-research project from the starting point where we believed we were setting out to capture the ingredients of positive change to one of pro-actively understanding and learning from failure. It attempts, in the context of this potentially debilitating reality, to take stock and identify the characteristics of least harm interventions to chart the next stage of our journey."
303,19,0.988,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"The chapters in Part I focus on theories and identities of critical multiculturalism, paying specific attention to the contexts of Asia and Japan. While theories of multiculturalism have been increasingly scrutinized and challenged from a wide range of perspectives, they continue to be used as background and support for understanding policies and programs of diversity in societies, not least, for example, in relation to language and language policies (Part II) and migration and citizenship (Part III). The chapters in Part I focus more generally on society in the larger frame, occasionally starting from a national container perspective (while calling attention to the porous boundaries), but where possible drawing on transnational dimensions. This entails that the various chapters come to some critical understanding of processes that transcend the nation-state, as argued above. As the chapters in Part I show, the definitions of what counts as multicultural are quite diverseâso much so that another challenge arises in deciding if multiculturalism is the primary object of analysis, a cause, an outcome, or just one of the many intervening elements. In looking at some of the dominant versions of liberal globalization, it had been noted that multiculturalism has often become nothing more than a marketing technique for multinational corporations to show sensitivity in the face of their consumer diversification, or viewed even more critically as a Disneyfication of difference (Gilroy, 2005). The intermingling relationship between nation-states and the global economy makes the issue even more complicated. Even if we try to transcend the prevailing territorial concepts, we often end up with wider geographical areas such as Europe, Asia-Pacific, or the âWest.â In this case, a version of multiculturalism that is widely accepted is likely to be a multiculturalism of"

AIC drops insignificant independent variables to better estimate the impact of analysis options. The R2 values for the models are good, with the lowest of any model being 0.71. After performing the regression, we examine the results to discover potential trends. Then we draw plots to examine how those trends manifest in the different programs. This lets us study the whole distribution, including outliers and any non-linear behavior, in a way that would be difficult if we just looked at the regression model. At the same time, if we only looked at plots it would be hard to see general trends because there is so much data. Threats to Validity. There are several potential threats to the validity of our study. First, the benchmark programs may not be representative of programs that analysis users are interested in. That said, the programs were drawn from a well-studied benchmark suite, so they should provide useful insights. Second, the insights drawn from the results of the array index out-of-bound analysis may not reflect the trends of other analysis clients. We note that array bounds checking is a standard, widely used analysis. Third, we examined a design space of 162 analysis configurations, but there are other design choices we did not explore. Thus, there may be other independent variables that have important effects. In addition, there may be limitations specific to our implementation, e.g., due to precisely how WALA implements points-to analysis. Even so, we relied on time-tested implementations as much as possible, and arrived at our choices of analysis features by studying the literature and conversing with experts. Thus, we believe our study has value even if further variables are worth studying. Fourth, for our experiments we ran each analysis configuration three times, and thus performance variation may not be fully accounted for. While more trials would add greater statistical assurance, each trial takes about a week to run on our benchmark machines, and we observed no variation in precision across the trials. We did observe variations in performance, but they were small and did not affect the broader trends. In more detail, we computed the variance of the running time among a set of three runs of a configuration as (max-min)/median to calculate the variance. The average variance across all configurations is only 4.2%. The maximum total time difference (max-min) is 32 min, an outlier from eclipse. All the other time differences are within 4 min."

REDD projects can be seen as a means to understand how REDD will unfold on the ground; REDD demonstration activities are seen as means to learn lessons for future REDD implementation. These early implementation projects inï¬uence debates about REDD, the ways in which so-called co-beneï¬ts are being addressed, and who is involved and who beneï¬ts from REDD. In principle, REDD country strategies to be deï¬ned in Phase 1 are the ï¬rst step in the implementation of REDD national policies. National REDD strategies would deï¬ne the current situation in each country and the direction in which the country is going to move in terms of reduced carbon emissions from deforestation, addressing so-called co-beneï¬ts and deï¬ning who would beneï¬t from economic payments. In practice, however, numerous REDD projects are taking place before the design of a countryâs REDD strategy is ï¬nished or in parallel with its development. Early implementation projects are informing the policy-making process in each country and at the global level. Proponents of REDD projects stand in a better position than other actors, who do not have any experience with such projects, to inï¬uence REDD debates because not having knowledge about REDD is a barrier for being included in the ofï¬cial debates. We have identiï¬ed three approaches employed by actors involved in early REDD planning, implementation and readiness projects, and the consequences of such approaches. The ï¬rst one is knowledge production and dissemination. Second is the creation of technologies or standards to legitimize or validate projects. The third approach is enrolment in new, emerging or alternative networks. In what follows we analyse these three approaches by highlighting who is involved, the resources mobilized to employ each approach, and the outcome. It is worth saying that these approaches are not mutually exclusive, and different actors within each country put distinct emphasis on each of these approaches. Creation of knowledge and dissemination of information Our ï¬ndings indicate that, to a great degree, networks involving NGOs and international research institutions with support from development cooperation agencies and private actors are creating and disseminating knowledge about REDD in the region. These networks systematize information about REDD in Latin America and at the global level.

163,82,0.988,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"a society where everybody wants to pay oneâs dues and provide their fair share). This is a somewhat intriguing message as it emphasizes that the Agency is more than a mere collector of taxes but is a governing institution with a moral message for the members of state, the citizens.4 Collecting the âright taxâ by making everybody paying their dues and providing a fair share is a strategy deemed to build legitimacy. The right tax is neither a specific number nor a maximizing amount, but ensures that each pays what s/he ought to. This is the equal treatment of citizens and legal entities. I have discussed this motto elsewhere in terms of the fairness that mirrors values in Swedish society (BjÃ¶rklund Larsen 2017), but elaborating further on this motto broadens our understanding of what is at stake. A person who makes sure to always gÃ¶ra rÃ¤tt fÃ¶r sig (pay oneâs dues) is also a trustworthy one. This person makes sure to provide and do what is expected, and will act according to norms and regulations in a given society. You can rely on work that is carried out by such a person as being solid and reliable; no corners will be cut. This person follows rules and regulations, not forgetting norms. To contribute a âfair shareâ can be seen as relational to all other members of society. It does not necessarily mean that everybody pays the same amount but that taxation practices are perceived as equitable and efficient among Swedes. Living, working and paying among the highest taxes in the world while also respecting the Agency that collects a large share of income is a considerable feat on the part of the Agency. And it is not only high taxes; taxes on income has high marginal rates. Personal income tax by international comparison is very high (cf. KPMG 2015) and constructed as marginal tax (with an increased percentage level on the last krona earned). High-income earners thus have higher tax rates than the average Swede, which means that the former pay considerably more for each 100 krona earned than do low-income earners (see also Chap. 4). Contributing a fair share has very different economic implications for Swedish taxpayers. Finally, to gÃ¶ra rÃ¤tt fÃ¶r sig also means to make sure that one is quits, at least at some point in time. Checking out from a hotel, paying for a restaurant meal, summing up several goods and services received are ways to gÃ¶ra rÃ¤tt fÃ¶r sig. The Agency thus balances its view of taxpayers as caring for society; implicit in the Agencyâs strategies is the message that taxpayers also ought to care for their own standing and be quits. Is there a tension here?"
300,226,0.988,"White-Collar Crime in The Shadow Economy : Lack of Detection, investigation and Conviction Compared To Social Security Fraud","The statement did not go unnoticed. Five identical columns in various Norwegian newspapers the following day underlined how one should âbe cautious to signal that social security fraud is not as serious as the majority may thinkâ. One editor called it ânonsenseâ to argue that the police should adjust their priorities in the direction of the big fish: âThe signal effect is substantial. Social security fraudsters should know that NAV is not asleep.â We think this book has shown that white-collar crime is probably a greater social problem than social security fraud in society. In our view, it is neither thorough nor objectively justified in the interests of society if it is the case that the authorities punch harder and more spectacularly at on welfare fraud than on white-collar crime. We would say that such discrimination expresses and segments the predemocratic approach to crime where the criminals, seen from the social elite standpoint, are always âsomeone elseâ, i.e. âthose down thereââthe poor, the unemployed, the marginalized, the foreign, or those the elite in Britain used to call âthe dangerous classesâ. The combination of care for the poor and imprisonment was invented by the emerging modern state to deal with the growing flood of unemployed, beggars, and other poor people. Punishment was not just about reducing crime insecurity, but about dealing with the hierarchical society of social insecurity. White-collar crime is not committed by the poor, the defeated, or the unemployed, but by people in positions of power, often high up the social ladder. There is a danger that white-collar crime is not perceived as real crime, because it does not include violence and is carried out by better-off citizens. Imprisonment is not only removal of freedom, but also a stigma. The penalty is a state-sanctioned deprivation of individual glory. When a member of the elite breaks the law, it can result in a problematic situation for others within the elite. An âeliteâ humanâs crime can threaten the eliteâs chastity in a manner that offences committed by âsub-humansâ do not."

The fundamentals of the exploitone-niche strategy are clear: The techpreneur is supposed to create a specialized enterprise, and peripheral problems are supposed to be contracted out to other businesses, allowing strategic partnerships to rise. This functional integration creates the notion of a well-connected business landscape whose elements rise and fall together. In sum, the Kenyan worldview promotes the simultaneous creation of multiple enterprises in order to generate substantial income and build up wealth in a complex environment. Expectations built on this worldview regard people who do not seize the many opportunities as careless and suggest to those who propose the contracting out of peripheral problems as a little far removed from reality. In contrast, the international worldview offers a blueprint for a highly specialized enterprise that focuses on developing core competencies in order to realize a comparative advantage and pave the way for an exponential growth trajectory in a highly competitive environment. Viewing the world through this lens causes community members to wonder how a competitive edge or market dominance can ever be realized by spreading yourself thin, because doing everything yourself seems like you are not doing it right!"
253,1148,0.988,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","30.4.2 Conclusions for Autonomous Driving Autonomous driving will be an everyday technology that is as closely connected to peopleâs lives as driving is today. That distinguishes it greatly from nuclear energy, while it shares this everyday-life quality with green biotechnology (through its use in food production) and mobile communication technology. From both risk debates we may extract the insight of how central the dimension of individual beneï¬t is. While any such beneï¬t from eating genetically modiï¬ed food has scarcely even been advanced by its proponents, the individual beneï¬ts of mobile telephones and mobile internet access are readily evident. And as soon as this beneï¬t is demonstrably large, people are prepared to assume possible risks. And this is absolutely rational from an action theory standpoint. What is irrational is to assume risks when the beneï¬ts are not evident or would only accrue to other actors (e.g. Monsanto in the green biotechnology debate). In such cases a risk debate can have dramatic consequences and obliterate any chance of acceptance. Another such knock-out scenario is the possibility of a massive catastrophe such as the âresidual riskâ of the meltdown of a nuclear power facility. This was decided on the political level, albeit with little chance of external influence. The situation was thus widely regarded as a passive risk situation in which people were exposed to potential harm by the decisions of others. Nothing can be gleaned directly from this scenario for autonomous driving as it would presumably be introduced in the familiar market context of conventional transportation and thus de facto depend on the acceptance of users from the outset. While it is possible to imagine other introduction scenarios (Chap. 10), state-mandated use of autonomous driving is all but unthinkable. The only indirect lesson from the history of nuclear energy is that expertocratic arrogance generates mistrust. An open discussion âbetween equalsââa lesson from the nanotechnology debate as wellâis a key precondition for a constructive debate on technology in an open society. These examples also show that talk of a German aversion to technology is a myth born of the experiences with nuclear energy and genetic engineering. All empirical studies"
303,213,0.988,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"Second, compared to those who are based in Singapore and the UAE, many who now work in Australia had passed through several transit destinations, the most popular being the UK and Ireland. One interviewee who left the Philippines in 2000 said that compared to those originating directly from the Philippines, âit was much easier and less expensive to come to Australia with the UK passport, UK experience, and a UK nursing license.â Given these advantages, we can infer that Filipino nurses who possess a passport from the UK or Ireland are more likely to engage in stepwise migration to Australia. 9.3.3 Why do Filipino nurses engage in a stepwise migration strategy? Evidently, the tendency for nurses to take a roundabout pathway and pass through several transit destinations instead of heading directly to the most preferred final destination is a rational strategy. It allows for the accumulation of resources in the transit destinations that are not readily available in the Philippines but are required in the more preferred destinations. Moreover, it is seen as a rational strategy in light of the unpredictable and ambiguous nurse-migration policies of these destinations. The findings imply that transferrable and useful resources in the forms of human resources (skills and license, as mentioned above), economic resources, social networks, and political resources (citizenship) can be accumulated in an previous (initial and transit) destinations, motivating nurses to work there first and engage in this stepwise strategy. In a focused group discussion (FGD) conducted among respondents who engaged in stepwise migration (Darwin, October 25, 2012), the nurses admitted that having several years of experience in one transit destination was much more preferred over the experience obtainable in the Philippines. Moreover, having a license appears to be a valuable asset in some cases because it enables the nurse to work right after arrival in a more/most preferred destination. Employers prefer nurses who have work experience overseas because it is considered proof of better nursing skills and knowledge, familiarity with modern medical instruments, and ability to work in a multicultural setting. Indeed, Filipino nurses target human resources in the destination to make them more marketable in the next destination. The nurses also accumulate the economic resources to cover the expense of moving to the next destination, such as recruitment fees, examination and review fees, settlement costs, and transportation costs. Because of the low salary of nurses in the Philippines, these nurses prefer to work outside the country for much higher pay so they"

And although they are able to reach a joint decision, the dominance ofârather unstableâdyadic constellations even leads to a point where two participants engaged in a dialogue are not sure whether the other participants are still present. Obviously, the above-described practices of relatednessâpractices that exhibit a complex, triadic, synchronous structureâcannot be performed or substituted in a chat environment. And although there are more sophisticated platforms for online deliberation available, difficulties remain (see for example Klein 2011; Spada et al. 2014).16 Furthermore, empirical evidence from various areas of research in political science suggests that David Graeber might be right when he concludes that âdecision making is the one thing that is almost impossible to do on the Internetâ (Graeber 2009: 237)âor while using other forms of technically mediated communication."

Let Âµ be some individual and let Ï be the family of those individuals who are nice: they satisfy the property of being nice. The sentence Âµ Îµp Ï says that Âµ is nice under the condition p, or, in other words, to the degree p. The condition p itself might be expressed using human language terms, for example: pretty face (thus Ï is nice because of pretty face). Labeling conditions with human language terms requires imposing partial ordering on these terms, which is generally rather subjective and not straightforward.

The gains that have been made over the years could be lost as the sector is still prone to wide policy swings with respect to the links between the universities, the research organisations, the grandes eÌcoles and both the national and regional authorities. Stronger institutional leadership is emerging but it remains to be seen if it will be able to motivate staff and students and provide incentives for change in an unfavourable economic context. In addition, leadership is a necessary but not sufficient condition. University leadership is exercised in an arena that includes multiple actors â staff and student and their unions, âgrandes eÌcolesâ, research organisations, national and regional authorities â and these will not be necessarily pushing in the same direction. The historical tendency toward centralisation and fragmentation might once again prevail unless good university leadership is combined with the capacity of the central state to change and adapt and if the regional authorities resist the siren call of increased power.

99,286,0.988,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"The literature also pays much attention to obstacles to diffusion that result from the nature of the innovation itself. In line with Rogersâ work (1962), it suggests that the more complex innovations are (in terms of goals, assumed causalities, effects) the harder it gets to take them from one place to another. The more resilient the destination context (e.g. due to the strength of a dominant discourse or top-heavy regulation), the less likely it is to succeed. Transfer success also depends on capacity and resources available. The empirical results of the WILCO project show that the same applies to social innovations. Even though there is an already burgeoning literature on innovation transfer, questions about what is specific about the diffusion of social innovations remain. Non-technical and non-market-based innovations are generally more diverse in terms of organisational properties or lifestyles compared to technical innovations designed for mass markets. Yet, to be fair, the difference is not always as drastic as the one between a cell phone and a new mode of participation in urban planning. Many new mass products are sold with varieties that allow marketing geared to the different tastes of consumers in different cultures and regions. Still, the differential impact of âlocalâ as compared to âglobalâ features remains an important topic for research to investigate what is specific for social innovations. Spreading Rather Than Being Sent: The Opaque Nature of Diffusion Processes When the process of diffusion is studied across a wider range of cases, the senderreceiver metaphor quickly becomes unsatisfactory as, however bad the connection, however confusing the conference call, one usually knows who is at the other end of the line. Not so for diffusion because the process is so hard to trace. Johnson dealt with the difference between areas such as the business sector, where innovations can be formalised, sold or withheld by license, and the often taken-for-granted fact that most social innovations develop in the public realm where they are basically free for use (2010, p. 240 f.). However, one of our case studies (Ewert and Evers in this chapter) shows that in the social realm there is also a tension between diffusion by innovation as an âopen sourceâ and diffusion channelled by competition. Projects and organisations such as Lok.aMotion, dealing with innovative concepts for community development and community-based business in Berlin-Kreuzberg, must act under conditions of âco-ompetitionâ where cooperation and competition merge. They often feel that their concepts are not simply taken up, but âstolenâ. This dilemma is hard to overcome because cases where a clear origin and âauthorâ of a social innovation can be identified are hard to find. Many of the case studies presented in this book are innovative in the local place where they crystallise but resemble concepts and ideas elsewhere. This holds true for quite a number of innovations presented in this book: the essentials of work integration enterprises and the variant discussed with examples from Nijmegen, the prevention visits for improving local child protection in MÃ¼nster (Walter and Gluns) or the housing revitalisation schemes from the outskirts of Lille (Fraisse). These are varieties within a national or international innovative stream and orientations. The fact that respon-"

This is in agreement with the dialectical insight that experiences of negativity (frustration, contradictions, etc.) are inevitable and progressive.

Keplerâs fiasco became the starting point for a process, an epistemic adventure that culminated in space travel.

360,340,0.988,Compositionality and Concepts in Linguistics and Psychology,"Partial-split situations are quite unacceptable for both sentences (10a) and (10b). Thus, when Dan walks, George writes and Bill and John are doing neither activity, sentence (10a) is quite odd, and similarly for (10b). By contrast, in full-split situations, Poortmanâs experiments show a difference between Dutch sentences similar (10a) and (10b). While 81% of the participants accepted sentences like (10a) in a full-split situation, only 24% accepted (10b) (in Poortmanâs experiment the subjects were definite descriptions, e.g. the boys). Once more, when accounting for this effect we rely on critical typicality points. In (11) below we apply principle (7) to the case of the expression are walking and writing. In this example, we denote WALK& WRITE for the head concept HC, where DIST, the distributivity concept, is the gradable concept GC. (11) Let LM-WW be the set of local typicality maxima for the concept WALK& WRITE . In formula: LM-WW = arg maxx TYPWALK&WRITE (x). The CT point(s) for the complex concept DIST WALK& WRITE is defined by: arg maxxâLM-WW TYPDIST (x). In words: the CT points for the expression are walking and writing are the situations that attain maximal typicality for the gradable concept DIST among the situations that attain maximal typicality for WALK& WRITE. Among the three situations we consider, the full-split and partial-split situations are more typical for WALK& WRITE than the joint situation. Between these two situations, the full-split situation is substantially more typical for the concept DIST, as it contains more people who are engaged in the relevant activities. This means that for sentence (10a), full-split is the CT point among the three situations. By contrast, for sentence (10a), the three situations are equally typical for the head concept WALK& SING. This is because the concepts WALK and SING, unlike WALK and WRITE, are not in any conflict (this kind of contrast is shown in another experiment by Poortman). In this case, for sentence (10b), the critical typicality point is the âjoint situationâ, which is the most typical for the distributivity concept alone. This analysis is summarized in Fig. 6."

Second, for critical infrastructures, more effort must be directed to handling large-scale disasters as opposed to single faults.

In the United States where the Constitution guarantees birthright citizenship to all children born in the countryâs territory, regardless of parentage, we take great care to distinguish these two cohorts of children. In the U.S. we have also replaced the label ânative languageâ with âheritage languageâ when talking about the young people growing up in migrancy and the childrenâs facility in the native language of their parents. Reading Marianne and Guroâs chapter I wondered whether and when the youth, born in Norway or having grown up in the country from an early age, engaged in building ethnic community-based organization, will start contesting the status quo of the public funding streams that force the youth to pay more attention to their cultural heritage then to civic and political participation in the mainstream society. Call me naÃ¯ve but despite the rise of xenophobia I am hopeful that as more and more countries become de facto countries of immigration both the rhetoric and the laws will change to reflect the fact that children of immigrants belong as much to their family as to the society into which they were born. This belonging ought to translate into inclusive language and full complement of rights bestowed on the children when they are born not at some later point in their lives when the government decides that they are worthy of being treated as full-fledged citizens. Meaningful participation of migrant, refugee, and trafï¬cked children is essential in research, policy-making, and practice. Following the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), âlistening to childrenâs voices has become a powerful and pervasive mantra for activists and policy makers worldwide. However, despite such representations of the âvoices of children,â children themselves may nonetheless, continue to ï¬nd their voices silenced, suppressed, or ignored in their everyday livesâ (James 2007, p. 261). In my studies of trafï¬cked children I have seen time and time again how the âbest interest of the childâ principle deployed to guide service provision to trafï¬cked adolescents contradicted their right to participate in determining what was best for them (GoÅºdziak 2016). Indeed, there is consensus in literature that Western policy makers and caretakers tend to prioritize the childrenâs perceived best interests over the childrenâs right to express their wishes and feelings (Bluebond-Langner and Korbin 2007). Service providers often justify their predisposition to decide the childâs best interest rather than advocating for her wishes and respecting her feelings by invoking the age of the youngsters they assist. They habitually treat all minors under the age of 18 as children and do not make distinctions between very young children and older adolescents. This conceptualization of young people under 18 years of age as passive and unknowing dependants without the ability to make independent decisions (see Christensen and James 2000; Jenks 1996), especially decisions regarding labour migration, contradicts the âevolving capacityâ principle enshrined in the Donât get me wrong, there are tremendous examples of immigrant youth asserting their agency and bringing about important political and social change, often against all odds.

For example, craftsmen have services they can exchange with each other, whereas clerks, civil servants, bureaucrats and other so-called white-collar workers have nothing to offer in return. Why should office workers or bureaucrats have to work three to four hours in order to pay for one hour formally (see also BjÃ¶rnâs reasoning on barter in Chap. 3) when the service can instead be bought informally, making the exchange balanced and more equal? One hour for another. In the same vein, the Limningers reason that there are always âothersâ who earn more and should therefore be able to buy everything formally, with invoices. There are many ways to find justification for a distributive side to balance the contributive side. However, voices are heard saying that, having paid the worldâs highest taxes, the welfare provided should be good value for money and distributed evenly. The Pillars of Society in this chapter are those who give more than they receive. In quantitative terms we can say that they have a positive position on both the contributive side and distributive sides. They work, pay their taxes, do not use much welfare and carry a heavier load in society than most other citizens. Balance Artists have a more nuanced relation to the state and fellow citizens. If they perceive that money is wrongly spent, they make sure to get some income on the side."

Another anomaly well known to economists is ambiguity aversion. This characteristic was suggested by Keynes and latter demonstrated by Ellsberg [8] in the form of a paradox. In his treatise on probabilities Keynes [9] posited that greater weight is given to a probability that is certain to one that is imprecise. Ellsberg has shown that just as there is a premium for taking risks, some compensation must be awarded to individuals for them to be indifferent to gain (or lose) with a one-in-two probability or an unknown probability with an expected value of one-in-two. Recent developments in economic theory offer several solutions to tackle this problem, in particular by specifying new types of utility functions, yet again [10]. What is important to keep in mind here is that individuals usually prefer the exposure to a hazard associated with a clearly deï¬ned probabilityâbecause experts are in agreementârather than the exposure to a hazard characterized by uncertain or fuzzy probabilitiesâbecause experts may disagree. Putting it another way, in the second instance people side with the expert predicting the worst-case scenario. More recently, Kahnemanâs work followed on that of Bernouilli, Allais and Ellsberg. He and his fellow author, Tversky, introduced loss-aversion: individual are more affected by loss than gain [11]. Kahneman also diverged from his predecessors in adopting a more positive approach. Observing the distortion of probabilities is a way to understand how our brain works rather than to build a theory where the decision-maker optimizes or maximizes the outcome. Kahnemanâs line of research is comparable to subjecting participants to optical illusions to gain a better understanding how our brain functions. For example, a 0.0001 probability of loss will be perceived as lower than a 1/10,000 probability. Our brain seems to be misled by the presentation of ï¬gures, much as our eyes are confused by an optical effect which distorts an objectâs size or perspective. This bias seems to suggest than our brain takes a short cut and disregards the denominator, focusing only on the numerator."

It is also stated that these rights should be highlighted, protected and made operational through appropriate legislation in each state, taking into account the UN Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded (1971) and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (1975). In more detail, the recommendations for people with autism are: 1. the right to lead an independent life, to be carried out according to their means 2. the right to a diagnosis and an accurate clinical assessment, comprehensible and free from preconceptions 3. the right to receive an appropriate education, freely accessible to all 4. the right for them (or their representatives) to participate in all decisions about their future 5. the right to accessible and adequate housing 6. the right to have all appropriate means, help and the responsibility necessary to lead a fully productive life with dignity and independence 7. the right to receive a pension or a salary sufficient to provide food, clothing, shelter and all other vital necessities 8. the right to participate, as much as possible, in the development and management of services that take care of their welfare 9. the right to benefit from the advice and care appropriate to their mental and physical health and for their spiritual life 10. the right to an education corresponding to their desires and meaningful employment without discrimination and without preconceived ideas 11. the right to benefit from means of transport and freedom of movement 12. the right of access to culture, recreation and leisure activities."

305,116,0.988,Quantum Computing for Everyone,"We do not know the probabilities that should be assigned to the configurations. There are eight possible configurations, so it might seem plausible that they each occur with probability 1/8, but they perhaps are not all equal. Our mathematical analysis will make no assumption about these probabilitiesâ values. We can, however, assign definite probabilities to the measurement directions. Both Bob and Alice are choosing each of their three bases with equal probability, so each of the nine possible pairs of bases occurs with probability 1/9. Notice that each row contains at least five As, telling us that given a pair of qubits with any configuration the probability of getting an A is at least 5/9. Since the probability of getting an A is at least 5/9 for each of the spin configurations, we can deduce that the probability overall must be at least 5/9, no matter what proportion of time we get any one configuration. We have now derived Bellâs result. The quantum theory model tells us that Aliceâs and Bobâs sequences will agree exactly half the time. The classical model tells us that Aliceâs and Bobâs sequences will agree at least 5/9ths of the time. It gives us a test to distinguish between the two theories. Bell published his inequality in 1964. Sadly, this was after the death of both Einstein and Bohr, so neither ever realized that there would be an experimental way of deciding their debate. Actually carrying out the experiment is tricky. John Clauser and Stuart Freedman first performed it in 1972. It showed that the quantum mechanical predictions were correct. The experimenters, however, had to make some assumptions that could not be checked, leaving some chance that the classical view could still be correct. The experiment has since been repeated"

252,22,0.988,The Ethics of Vaccination,"precisely the ethical issues that this book aims to address. According to this type of explanation, the low rate of active vaccine refusal (e.g., in the form of applications for non-medical exemptions from vaccine mandates in the US) would be due not to the low number of anti-vaxxers, but to external pressures, including how difficult it is to obtain non-medical exemptions and state coercion. Whether such external pressures and state coercion are legitimate is precisely the question that raises the ethical issues that I want to address in this book, namely, whether there is an ethical obligation to vaccinate oneself or oneâs children and whether a certain degree of coercion, and what degree of coercion precisely, is ethically acceptable or even ethically required in the implementation of vaccination policies. One important aspect that Vanderslottâs reflection raises is that vaccination attitudes must be distinguished, with respect to their practical implications, from actual vaccination decisions. As already said, someone might be deeply opposed to vaccines for a number of possible reasons, but still decide to vaccinate their children for a number of different reasonsâ including the desire to avoid heavy penalties. Or someone could in principle be in favour of vaccines, or in any case convinced of their overall beneficial effects at the individual and at the collective level, but still decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children, for example because they think that it is safer or more convenient to free-ride on the herd immunity that other members of the community have realized. Now, what matters ethicallyâor at least this is the stance I will assume in this bookâis primarily vaccination decisions and only secondarily vaccination attitudes. Ethics provides people with certain types of reasonsâsuch as moral obligationsâto make certain decisions rather than others. And moral obligations exist regardless of whether peopleâs attitudes align or not with them. As suggested above, it would be ideal if individuals did vaccinate themselves or their children autonomously, because they were convinced of the benefits of vaccines and aware of the fact that vaccination is a moral obligation. However, ultimately, what matters the most is that individuals do vaccinate their children, whether or not they think that it is beneficial or morally required. Because vaccination actions matter more in ethical terms than vaccination attitudes, it is important to develop, alongside an ethics of vaccination decisions, an ethics of vaccination policies. Just as ethics in general is about how we should live and what we ought to do, and therefore about how we ought to make practical decisions, so an ethics of vaccination is ultimately about what individuals, collectives, and institutions ought to do with regard to vaccination decisionsâthat is, about what"

234,23,0.988,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"PROFESSIONAL VOLUNTARISM AS HIGHLY SKILLED MIGRATION We opened this chapter with a discussion about development and AID. Not because this is where we located ourselves as âexpertsâ, but because it is the dominant discourse within which our work is generally situatedâ and has been funded. Neither of us (as authors) came to this work with backgrounds in international development or global health. Ackersâ background as a geographer and social scientist is in highly skilled migration and the role that internationalisation plays in shaping the mobilities of scientists as individuals and scientiï¬c capacity. It is interesting to note that the emphasis in this ï¬eld is more often on the role that the mobility of the highly skilled plays in promoting scientiï¬c competitiveness and innovation. The role of human mobility is increasingly recognised as critical to the formulation of the kinds of knowledge relationships that lie at the heart of economic growth. It is important to point out that the processes of international mobility here are by no means unilateral, as is often inferred, echoing the haves (cosmopolitan northern professionals with extensive mobility capital) and have-nots (internationally isolated and parochial) binary. Our research experience suggests that Ugandan health workers and, especially, but not exclusively, doctors have access to very wide and varied international experience. Indeed, it is possible that the (funded) opportunities available to them exceed those open to their peers in the UK.12 The Ugandan health workforce is surprisingly cosmopolitan and internationally connected especially but not only at senior levels. Viewed through these disciplinary lenses, both the SVP volunteers and the many Ugandans who have spent time in the UK are ï¬rst and foremost highly skilled migrants or, if the language of migration is offputting for some,13 people exercising forms of professional mobility. The label âvolunteerâ (deï¬ned simply by the absence of a formal employment relationship or remuneration) does little to capture the motivations of the diverse groups of people involved and has an unfortunate tendency to characterise them, within the donorârecipient model, as âhelpersâ (Boltonâs Sunday Drivers) or, worse still, in an environment still dominated by religious values, as âmissionariesâ. As noted earlier, our research has embraced the motivations, experiences and learning outcomes of volunteers. The ï¬ndings of this are reported elsewhere (Chatwin et al. 2016). The point here is to consider what added value such volunteers bring to the host society and its public health system."

Any number of students can be in a room at the same time. 2. The Dean of Students can only enter a room if there are no students in the room (to conduct a search) or if there are more than 50 students in the room (to break up the party). 3. While the Dean of Students is in the room, no additional students may enter, but students may leave. 4. The Dean of Students may not leave the room until all students have left. 5. There is only one Dean of Students, so you do not have to enforce exclusion among multiple deans.

Although tweaking your results may be part of certain research cultures, Diederik A. Stapel somehow manages to take this strategy to the limit, by drastically exaggerating this questionable type of behaviour, so that in his case the fraud itself becomes absurd (and indeed, grotesque exaggeration is a well-known technique in absurdist theatre of course). Psychoanalytically speaking this confirms the view that Stapel is basically a craving, tormented subject facing an epistemic crisis, whose misconduct is symptomatic for frustration and despair, as âby-productsâ of university discourse ($).

177,18,0.988,Assessment in Mathematics Education : Large-Scale Assessment and Classroom Assessment,"â¢ Tasks should present a balanced view of the curriculum in terms of all aspects of performance that the curriculum wants to encourage. â¢ Tasks should have âface validityâ and should be worthwhile and of interest to students. â¢ Tasks should be appropriate for the purpose and should integrate processes and practices rather than attempt to assess those separately from content. â¢ Tasks should be accessible (have multiple entry points) to students with a range of ability and performance levels, while still providing opportunities for challenge. â¢ Tasks should provide opportunities to demonstrate chains of reasoning and receive credit for such reasoning, even if the ï¬nal result contains errors. â¢ Tasks should use authentic rather than contrived contexts, at times with incomplete or extraneous data. â¢ Tasks should provide opportunities for students to determine what strategy they want to use in order to pursue a solution. â¢ Tasks should be transparent enough that students know what types of responses will be acceptable (adapted from p. 7). Swan and Burkhardt remark about challenges in designing tasks according to these design principles: such tasks are longer than typical tasks in their statement on the page, take more time to complete, and have a higher cognitive load because they are more complex, unfamiliar, and have greater technical demand. When collaborative work is assessed, one needs to consider procedures for assessing the individual studentsâ contribution to the groupâs workflow and/or products (presentations, posters, etc.) (Webb 1993). Others have raised language issues with these more challenging types of tasks, particularly when the language of assessment may be different from studentsâ mother tongue, thus raising issues of equity within assessment (e.g., Dyrvold et al. 2015; Levin and Shohamy 2008; Ufer et al. 2013). Issues about the layout of a task and the amount of scaffolding that a task might require have encouraged or required task designers to use an engineering design approach, in which they try tasks with students from the target populations, revise and try again, in a continuous cycle of design and reï¬nement.

As Klieme et al. note, before competency models can be used to build assessments, there is a need for empirical study to determine various levels of competence, which are âthe cognitive abilities and skills possessed by or able to be learned by individuals that enable them to solve particular problems, as well as the motivational, volitional and social readiness and capacity to use the solutions successfully and responsibly in variable situationsâ (p. 65). Within this perspective, competence links knowledge with skills along a spectrum of performance through a variety of tasks that get at more than just factual knowledge. âThe basic idea of this model is that a personâs mathematical"

The Norwegian Pentecostal mission grew into a significant agency that has affected religion and living conditions in a great number of countries, and still does. The question of how to organize a foreign mission has proven to be a contested spiritual issue and has not been solved once and for all. The mission as a whole is characterized by decentralization, which distinguishes it from most other mission agencies in Norway.

This approach focuses on vulnerability in terms of something, such as physical vulnerability, social vulnerability, vulnerability in terms of lacking capacity, vulnerability in terms of belonging to a certain identifiable group, or vulnerability because of belonging to a marginalized population, etc. This approach to defining the concept is an excellent way of illustrating the sorts of conditions that we might want to pick out as requiring special consideration in terms of susceptibility to harm. As such, (V3) serves as a useful heuristic device because it gives examples of the sorts of things that are often considered vulnerabilities. However, this check-list approach is to borrow David Lewisâs (1986) phrase, an attempt at explanation by âway of example,â whereby we provide some key paradigmatic examples or illustrations of what constitutes vulnerability and state that vulnerabilities are âthese sorts of things.â This approach does a poor job of defining vulnerability.

The comparison of the âsuccessfulâ and âunsuccessfulâ cases, thus defined (see Table 6.1), at first glance reveals no striking patterns: The two groups of cases do not differ significantly with regard to any fundamental characteristic. A closer look at the beneficiariesâ initial situation, the various aspects of the local context and, above all, the protestersâ interventions, reveals that certain protest strategies tend to be effective in certain contextsâan issue which we will refer to in the following as mechanisms. First and foremost, the initial situation of the beneficiaries, especially with regard to legal aspects and their personal backgrounds, largely determines the kind of protest activities that develop. The concept of deportability (De Genova 2002, 438), signifying the possibility of being deported, can indeed materialize in different ways: Subjects become âdeportableâ for different reasons, such as the material or formal (Dublin) rejection of an asylum claim, the discovery of a situation of irregularity, and so forth. Deportation must be understood as a process which can be halted, disrupted, or blocked at different points in time. The initial situation thus determines the possibilities of intervention or, in other words, the kinds of strategies that have the potential to be successful in preventing deportation.

As a video progresses, there are certain checkpoints that an instructor breaks a topic into and these checkpoints serve as the keynotes for the topic at hand. For example, a video about supervised learning of machine learning would typically discuss about the common examples in which it is used, then explain the algorithm employed, plot the points representing the features and interpret it, differentiate with other machine learning algorithms and finally conclude the scenarios and advantages where the algorithm applies. These checkpoints, although important to the MOOC taker at that instant, seem to fade away when the next video starts. The MOOC taker is reluctant on obligating to memory rather tend only to remember those parts which are needed to pass the quizzes. To address this issue, we propose a novel model whereby the MOOC taker can take notes on the fly when they are taking the course through watching videos. For the MOOC taker, the parts of the course which they intend to take note, it happens to be certain points in the video. It is assumed that the video is accompanied by an interactive transcript that scrolls and highlights what the instructor is saying at that moment of the video. DurFig. 1.

The proposed on the go note taking, while the MOOC taker watches the video is a meta description extraction using a client side scripting on the browser that the learner is currently using to access the materials. The parts of the lecture which catches the attention of the learner are simultaneously displayed in the transcript. A recurrence script extracts transcript with the screen and add the portions to the notebook on events initiated by the user. The learner can save a considerable amount of time which they would otherwise be using for taking the notes conventionally.

147,259,0.988,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"In particular, most medical professionals have developed in-depth knowledge of health problems from treating numerous patients, which could facilitate opportunity identification (Simmons, 2002). For instance, using patent data from the American Medical Association, Chatterji, Fabrizio, Mitchell, and Schulman (2008) demonstrated that doctors filed nearly 20% of all medical-device patents in the USA from 1990 to 1996. However, many medical professionals may be reluctant to act upon the potential opportunities they identify for reasons related to decreased desirability and/or a lack of apparent feasibility. There are likely to be high opportunity costs for doctors who choose to exploit opportunities (i.e., entrepreneurial action is less desirable), or they may believe they lack the personal knowledge needed to fully exploit an opportunity (i.e., entrepreneurial action is seen as infeasible). This type of scenario opens up numerous paths for future research. Combining the identification of a health opportunity identified with its exploitation. When an opportunity to improve health is identified but not exploited, it represents a potentially wasted resource (and, worse, people may continue to suffer who otherwise would have benefited from the exploitation of the opportunity). Therefore, it is vital for researchers to question and empirically investigate our initial premise: do medical professionals detect health opportunities (third-person opportunities) that they do not end up personally acting upon? If so, why not? In the end, what happens to these potentially valuable opportunities that are recognized but not exploited? Perhaps the medical professionals who initially identify these ideas share them with their colleagues, who in turn ultimately agree that they do represent opportunities for someone but not for them due to their lack of knowledge and/or motivation to act upon them. However, some individuals do end up acting upon the opportunities they identify to improve health. Why do only some individuals do this and not others? Entrepreneurship programs could be a useful addition to medical professionalsâ education and training. Future research should investigate the characteristics and benefits (if any) of such entrepreneurship programs for medical professionals. While researchers often view the entrepreneurial process as involving only one actor (e.g., one individual, team, and/or venture), this assumption is an artificial limitation to our conceptualization of the practice of entrepreneurship, especially when othersâ health is the outcome of that practice. When a medical professional identifies an opportunity but does not believe it represents a personally desirable or feasible opportunity, can"

An immediate acknowledgement of responsibility may be what the patient or the relatives are want to hear, but the rationale for giving one may not be present. âPrior to an operation, I try to be open about risk to the patients. Sometimes it is difficult to make a precise diagnosis, and we have to proceed without reliable knowledge about what is actually the matter with the patient. The uncertainty means that things might go wrong. Sometimes we operate people for an illness where it is common that about 30% experience more or less serious complications after the operation, and may have to be re-operated. Patients who end up in that category may respond with anger, and expect me to acknowledge a mistake. It would be wrong of me to do that, since we cannot establish whether the current problem is a result of a professional mistake in diagnosing or operating the patient, or not. Absorbing and acknowledging information about risk is difficult for patients and relatives, particularly in the light of a bad outcomeâ (BjÃ¸rnbeth, 2017). Doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth has focused on the learning potential of sharing experiences about unexpected complications and mistakes. One episode from his early career set him on the path to understanding the importance of transparency about fallibility. He was on duty at a hospital when a young girl entered as a patient, with symptoms indicating a broken arm. When studying the x-ray of the arm, doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth could not see any break. In order to be on the safe side, he knocked on the door of his leader, the chief doctor of his unit, and showed him the x-ray. The senior doctor studied the picture carefully, and came to the same verdict as young doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth. The girl had not broken her arm, and could return home without treatment. Later on the same day, another doctor came to the unit, and looked at the x-ray of the girlâs arm. After careful scrutiny, he spotted a break that was difficult to detect, and had escaped both doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth and the chief doctorâs gaze. The girl was sent for again, and this time got the proper treatment in the form of plaster. The next day, doctor BjÃ¸rnbeth took the x-ray back to the chief doctorâs office, and said that the two of them had missed the break in the girlâs arm yesterday. The chief doctor asked to see the picture again, and once more studied it carefully. Then he exclaimed. âYes, of course there"
113,218,0.988,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"WHAT MAKES A WITCH A WITCH AND A SORCERER A SORCERER? It should be noted that even within Melanesia, as well as in comparative African contexts, the distinction between what I here describe as sorcery and witchcraft are not so distinct. Indeed, in some cases, these terms seem to be used interchangeably, as they do not seem to fit the âclassicâ definitions. However, as mentioned at the outset of this paper, in the Trobriands case there is surprising accordance with Evans-Pritchardsâ descriptions, according to the ways in which my interlocutors described each of these forms of malevolent power. In both the comparative literature I cite here, and in the other contributions to this volume, it is important to distinguish just what is meant by the selection of and use of one or the other of these terms. Stephen (1987) attempts also to distinguish witches from sorcerers, based on a variety of ethnographic examples from various societies in PNG. She shows a great diversity in manifestations of both sorcery and witchcraft, again demonstrating that the insider/outsider binary is insufficient to capture the complexity of ethnographic reality. She rather asserts that the key difference between the two is in the social roles their practitioners hold: sorcerers use destructive mystical power to gain social influence, while witches are outcasts whose actions lead to social ruin (Stephen 1987: 288). However, she acknowledges that the southern Massim, including the Trobriand Islands and Dobu, are exceptions to her argument, thereby leading her to suggest that Trobriand witches are better described as female sorcerers (1987: 286). While this certainly helps to make her distinctions more applicable, there are difficulties with her argument. She suggests that: Melanesian societies usually draw sharp distinctions between male and female roles and spheres of action; it is thus only to be expected that female sorcery will differ from male sorcery. Given the general association in Melanesia of masculinity with order and control, it is appropriate that female sorcery should be less deliberate and less fully controlled than male"

Lin is a 27 year old woman who was born in the Czech Republic, left for Vietnam, and came back again at the age of ten.3 Lin, like most of the other study participants, grew up in a place where there were not many other Vietnamese, or if there were, they did not live in visible ethnic communities. She went to schools with predominantly Czech pupils, made Czech friends and sometimes spent more time with her Czech nanny than with her own parents.4 Searching through her childhood memories, she reconstructs four different stages that marked changes in her perception of how she thought about herself and her ethnicity. As ï¬rst she mentions the stage of early childhood âwhen the child isnât aware of any differences or doesnât care about them, she/he knows that she/he is less strong and (there are reasons) why the children bully him/her, but he/she doesnât realize that it is because of his/her nationality,â she said. This period of âblessed unconsciousnessâ ended in early puberty (between thirteen and ï¬fteen years of age), when she started to realize that there was something âdifferentâ about her and began asking herself questions like âSo who are you going to be? Are you going to be Vietnamese or Czech? Do you want to be different or not?â Lin experienced the pressure to conform to the majority in this stage of life (Min 2002) very strongly. She tried to âbe and act like others,â âto be Czech.â To a certain degree, this effort to ï¬t in was also accompanied by her rejection of the parental culture and ethnicity, which was perceived as different from the mainstream, even inappropriate in some cases (Min 2002). Linâs parents, like the parents of most of the other respondents, were described by her as strict, conservative, hardworking, overprotective, too concerned with her school achievements and future, and sometimes not very empathetic. They expected Lin to honour certain traditional Vietnamese values: respect the elderly, be polite, put family ï¬rst, fulï¬l her family obligations, be industrious, and strive for self-cultivation and improvement. Lin thought of these attitudes and values as culturally bounded, connected with the Vietnamese way of living, and different from the more âindividualisticâ Czech lifestyle which she was exposed to on a daily basis. The result was her contestation of her parentsâ ideas, which she saw as old-fashioned and limiting her freedom. Her growing-up was therefore marked by"

If there is a free performance of Hamlet in our city, why do not use it as a resource for the subject of literature, especially if Shakespeare is in the curriculum? In a similar way, experts on particular topics are the best people to explain certain concepts. A doctoral student who is carrying out their Ph.D. in the area of genetic research might be very inspiring for secondary education students during their biology class. This was the context for the work of the iTEC project which we report here. It contributed to the conception of the classroom of the future, in which technology is complemented with innovative pedagogical approaches, which entail a high degree of dynamism in educational practice.

259,196,0.988,The Little Book of Semaphores,"As each student checks in, he has to consider the following cases: â¢ If the field is empty, the student lays claim for the heathens. â¢ If the heathens currently in charge, but the new arrival has tipped the balance, he locks the prude turnstile and the system switches to transition mode. â¢ If the prudes in charge, but the new arrival doesnât tip the balance, he joins the queue. â¢ If the system is transitioning to heathen control, the new arrival joins the queue. â¢ Otherwise we conclude that either the heathens are in charge, or the system is transitioning to prude control. In either case, this thread can proceed. Similarly, as each student checks out, she has to consider several cases. â¢ If she is the last heathen to check out, she has to consider the following: â If the system is in transition, that means that the prude turnstile is locked, so she has to open it. â If there are prudes waiting, she signals them and updates status so the prudes are in charge. If not, the new status is âneutralâ. â¢ If she is not the last heathen to check out, she still has to check the possibility that her departure will tip the balance. In that case, she closes the heathen turnstile and starts the transition. One potential difficulty of this solution is that any number of threads could be interrupted at Line 3, where they would have passed the turnstile but not yet checked in. Until they check in, they are not counted, so the balance of power may not reflect the number of threads that have passed the turnstile. Also, a transition ends when all the threads that have checked in have also checked out. At that point, there may be threads (of both types) that have passed the turnstile. These behaviors may affect efficiencyâthis solution does not guarantee maximum concurrencyâbut they donât affect correctness, if you accept that âmajority ruleâ only applies to threads that have registered to vote."

Like the eldest generation, and in contrast to the middle generation, the women in the youngest generation place themselves in their mothersâ worldâhowever, since it is a world of both talking and doing, it is a world that is no longer so clearly defined by gender. In this way, the young womenâs identification with their mothers appears to be less gendered than the young menâs identification with their fathers. It is also likely that the mothersâ own borders vis-Ã -vis their daughters have become clearer than in the previous generation, not only because of the mothersâ lives outside the family, but also because the daughters are allowed to test these borders through quarrelling. A huge majority of the women in this generation report a good relationship with their mothers, but we still find more women than men who have difficulties with their parents, especially mothers. In these cases the mother is seen as selfish in the sense that she does not meet the needs of the daughter because she has prioritised her own career or a relationship with a new partner at the expense of her children. The daughters experience this as a betrayal and they often express ambivalent feelings of resentment and longing. One of the middle-class daughters feels abandoned by her parents after their divorce, but her sore feelings come up especially in her relationship with her mother: Maybe she doesnât care about itâlike, doesnât care about my life â¦ I imagine that â¦ she has the ability to understand me and I have the ability to understand her because we are quite similar. But at the same time I feel a lot of the time like we donât understand each other too."
143,664,0.988,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"the USA,â1 crafted by the Kenyan start-up BRCK to highlight both the importance of creation over manufacturing and the similar development trajectories of its product and US President Barack H. Obama. In fact, as change creation and wealth creation continue to fuse in the remarkable narratives of a new generation of entrepreneurs in Kenya, it has become evident that the entrepreneursâ motivation is grounded in a complex nexus of goals and values, in which financial goals are just one among many others and are quite often not the primary ones (Rindova et al. 2009; Baker and Pollock 2007; Ruef 2010). Put differently, âstudies across a number of nations have consistently shown that values such as desires for autonomy, to express creativity for its own sake, to pursue innovation, and to be oneâs own boss typically dominate financial goals in motivating entrepreneurshipâ (cited in Rindova et al. 2009, originally from Baker and Pollock 2007). As a result, entrepreneurship is not a schizophrenic endeavor divided between societal and financial goals. It is much rather in its essence both, about social change and about wealth creation. Note that the label social entrepreneurship, despite its normative push toward recognizing and making the social aspect of entrepreneurship even more prominent, is, given this understanding, ânot only unnecessary but potentially not valid, since many entrepreneurs seek to improve their economic positions through the impact of broader social changeâ (Rindova et al. 2009). As Eleanor Marchant showed in her chapter, key actors in Kenyaâs technology sector creatively combine a socialchange agenda with wealth creation to remove constraints for themselves and the wider ecosystem. It makes them pivotal actors in the scene. Against this background, I will undertake a brief synthesis of the bookâa few key takeawaysâthrough a closer look at four overarching themes that are grounded in (though they also have relevance beyond) Kenyan entrepreneuringânamely, mindset change, creation of newness, critical reflection, and location as a comparative advantage. These are of central importance, because none of the chapters or conversations could have done without at least one of them. In a final step, I will take a leap into the futureâthe road aheadâand briefly outline four additional"
337,35,0.988,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"university research and education, these capabilities are not developed in a balanced, integrated way. For example, both natural and social science research and education focuses almost exclusively on analysis, while the arts and engineering focus on synthesis. But, as mentioned above, analysis and synthesis, reductionism and wholism, are as inseparable as breathing out and breathing in. It is no wonder that our current approach to science is so dysfunctional. We have been holding our breath for a long time! In the future, the need for a healthy balance between analysis and synthesis will be recognized at all levels of science education and research. One can already see the beginnings of this development. For example, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS â http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) was established in response to the recognition in the ecological community that the activity of synthesis was both essential and vastly under-supported. Ecologists recognized that they could only obtain funding and professional recognition for collecting new data. They never had the time, resources, or professional incentives to figure out what their data meant, or how it could be effectively used to build a broader understanding of ecosystems or to manage human interactions with them more effectively. The response to NCEAS so far has been overwhelmingly positive, and I expect that synthesis, as a necessary component of the scientific process, will eventually receive its fair share of resources and rewards. Funding for synthesis activities will become available from the major government science funding agencies on an equal footing with analysis activities. For example, NSF has recently established the National Socio-Environmental SYNthesis Center (SESYNC â http://www.sesync. org/) aimed at broadening synthesis activity to better encompass the social sciences and humanities. In the universities, the curriculum will be restructured to achieve a better balance between synthesis and analysis. More courses will be âproblem-based,â workshops aimed at collaboratively addressing real problems via creative synthesis. Research has conclusively shown that âproblem-basedâ curricula are very effective not only at supporting synthesis, but also at developing better analytical skills, since students are much more motivated to learn analytical tools if they have a specific problem to solve (Grigg 1995; Scott and Oulton 1999; Wheeler and Lewis 1997). There are already a few entire universities structured around the model of problem-based learning, including Maastricht University in the Netherlands and the University of Aalborg in Denmark. In addition, the capabilities of current and developing electronic communication technology will be more effectively employed in university education in the future. The market will soon be flooded with courses delivered over the Internet, but with little coordination among them and little recognition of the importance of integrating synthesis and communication into the educational process. The university of the future will take full advantage of the Internet, but it will also take much better advantage of the local face-to-face interactions on campus. Analysis courses are most amenable to delivery over the web. They could therefore afford to use the best faculty from around the world to produce them and could be continuously updated and improved. Grading would be internalized in the course, but testing would be proctored by the local host universities. This use of the Internet to"

395,203,0.988,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"We will not explore the actual safety beneï¬ts, or their absence, which often seem to rely on a perception or belief rather than on an actual measure, for this would require a whole paper. While existing safety trainings may seem to fail to produce results safety-wise, they nevertheless allow organizations to comply with regulatory requirements that call for safety training. Indeed, most regulatory authorities in hazardous activities are defenders of the âsafety exists as suchâ belief. Or maybe should we say they used to be. Indeed, the evolution from an exclusively compliance-based approach to a more performance-based approach in some hazardous activities such as aviation may be initial evidence that the doubts expressed by FonCSIâs industrial partners are shared, at least to a certain extent, by Authorities as well. Up to now, the tension between the two apparent beliefs on safety, or safety models, has led to an increase in the effort in the direction of mandatory âsafety trainingsâ, often to the detriment of other initiatives focused on training courses that are better suited to enhancing safety. Yet, some initiatives in this latter direction were presented during the workshop with promising results. Thus, the question becomes: is there a way of maximizing the resources dedicated to training (in a broad sense) that actually contribute to enhancing safety while complying with regulatory requirements? The most obvious answer would be through reconciling the two. Yet, regulatory requirements are developed to ensure that the minimum acceptable level of safety is ensured by all organizations of a given domain. Although they may stem from a safety model closer to one extreme than to the other, they are designed in a one-size-ï¬ts-all manner whereas each organization is unique. Eventually, depending on the existing gap between the regulatory/oversight approach and the organizationâs maturity safety-wise, there may be different avenues to explore as ways forward: â¢ If the regulatory requirements and the oversight approach leave some leeway for interpretation, there may be a way to reconcile both aspects, actually enhancing safety and complying with regulatory requirements. By giving preference to the ultimate objective of the safety training rather than to a reductive interpretation of âacceptable means of complianceâ, revisiting the content, formatâ¦ of these so-called âsafety trainingsâ can be an opportunity to improve the actual safety performance. The introduction of mandatory CRM (Crew Resource Management) training in aviation following the most deadly accident in this domain in Tenerife is a very good illustration of how a similar requirement was translated into very different training courses by different airlines around the world. Interestingly enough, although it had a strong safety root, the requirement was not called âsafety trainingâ. Regulatory requirements referred to a number of topics to be addressed during this training such as communication, leadership/followership, individual factorsâ¦ Depending on the airline, CRM training courses ranged from strict basic âteachingâ on the various topics to more sophisticated and interactive sessions"

If you want to use the model for prediction, then you have no choice: you must use the parametric survreg because coxph does not extrapolate beyond the last observation. Traditionally, medical studies use coxph while engineering studies use survreg (so-called accelerated failure-time models), but both disciples could fruitfully use either technique, depending on the nature of the data and the precise question being asked. Here is a typical question addressed with coxph: âHow much does the risk of dying decrease if a new drug treatment is given to a patient?â In contrast, parametric techniques are typically used for questions like this: âWhat proportion of patients will die in 2 years based on data from an experiment that ran for just 4 months?â"
42,266,0.988,S-BPM in the Production Industry : A Stakeholder Approach,"CEE 4: Ensure people-centredness The CEE 4 aims at investigating workersâ perceived change, involvement and empowerment. The items have been presented to both, workers and managers and related to workersâ experience, expectations and point of view. Investigation of worker involvement/participation in workplace re-design All workers declared that a clear improvement has occurred especially with respect to the communication among the different departments. In general, all workers perceived an improvement of the workplace design as a whole: on-line suggestions and discussions have led to face-to-face discussions and vice versa. In addition, sharing ideas before entering a suggestion helped to increase the quality and frequency of communication among people. Moreover, both workers and managers assessed that suggestions and discussions are supported and fostered by the management. Both workers and management noticed an increase in the workersâ involvement. Workers feel involved in participating in workplace re-design, not only by inserting suggestions, but also sharing suggestions on how to improve their environment. For instance, an important issue shared and discussed by everyone was the one related to safety. Overall, workers feel that the value of their suggestions is taken into account by both management and colleagues. The opinions of the managers, instead, are slightly different. Most of them agree with the workers in assessing that workers feel to be taken into account and empowered, while some of them believe that this is not the case for all the workers, only for those that already have a relationship with the management, i.e. the oldest ones. Concerning the possible drawbacks and obstacles in the usage of the system, many workers, especially the youngest ones, pointed out the rigidity of the usage of the personal computers. Hence, they suggested to create a speciï¬c app in order to be able to make suggestions directly from a smartphone, even when they are not at work. Another suggestion consists of embedding the system functionalities in their current ERP system. According to the workers, among the possible obstacles to the usage of the system, there is the impossibility of making anonymous suggestions. This aspect, that had already been taken into consideration during the user-requirements elicitation, and had been excluded based on a shared decision involving workers as well, popped up again. This could mean that some suggestions, eventually about relationship issues, have not been reported in the system. Investigation of worker empowerment All workers declared to feel more involved in the workplace improvement process, as well as to be motivated on keep suggesting new things, since they can clearly see the suggestion path. They also stated that receiving feedback even when the suggestion was refused, was sufï¬cient to keep them motivated to insert new suggestions. At the same time, the opportunity to create a suggestion and receive feedback, or report an error increased the perceived ability of making meaningful actions in order to improve the workplace. Moreover, the fact of being taken into"
229,48,0.988,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"Read added that âwhatsoever it claspeth with the clawes, it holdeth it firmly ... [so] that it seemeth to be nailed to the partâ.32 The grip of the crab was understood not only as painful but as immensely strong and tenacious, matching precisely the intractability and resistance to cure which was one of cancerâs most distinctive features. A renowned French practitioner Pierre Dionis made the connection explicit in 1701 when he explained that ââTis no more possible to extirpate [cancer], than force a Crab to quit what he has grasped betwixt his griping Clawsâ, while in the sixteenth century, ParÃ© deemed the link between the âtenacityâ of cancer and the âtoothed clawsâ of the crab so instructive that he inserted a picture of the creature into his writing on the subject, to drive home the âperspicuousâ nature of the comparison.33 In the figure of the crab, early modern medical practitioners effectively united the diverse visible and invisible symptoms of cancer. Moreover, this practice appears not to have problematized, or been problematized by, understandings of cancer as humoral in origin. This phenomenon is seen amplified in Chapter 3 of this book, where I discuss the casting of cancer as a type of worm or wolf. Although medical practitioners had a good sense of cancerâs symptomatology, however, there remained an element of doubt in any diagnosis. As Witherâs verse suggested, in order to really be sure that a patient was suffering from cancer, one had to see whether the suspect tumour followed the most distinctive cancerous âbehaviourâ, that of expanding and spreading throughout the body. Malignancy was, as I shall discuss, fundamental to the very meaning of this disease, setting âtrueâ cancers apart from the myriad of less dangerous ulcers and neoplasms. Furthermore, it presented a counterpoint to all medical writersâ diagnostic criteria. The way to âknowâ a cancer was to see it growing; however, that hardly required medical expertise, and once a cancer had grown large, it was much more difficult to treat. Diagnosis therefore presented the first of this diseaseâs many challenges to medical wisdom. Encounters with suspect tumours were not only matters of clinical determination, but of defining human relationships to cancer."

But even more than the closeness of the field researchers to the people, the families and the groups which they encounter, it is the type of interpretative dialogue employed between the different actors which seems to be pertinent and particularly rich here. In fact we can identify five types of dialogue as a result of this research process which allow us to construct our methodological approach and our interpretative analysis of the data.

46,100,0.988,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"in other regions it is a more prevalent issue. Besides space, the dimension of time needs to be acknowledged; how long a person is poor and during which phase in the life course, for example, during childhood, and whether poverty is a returning issue is highly relevant information. The dynamics of poverty are crucial and underexplored, which can also be attributed to the lack of data (Addison, Hulme and Kanbur 2009). Time is also relevant in the sense that it is valuable information to know if certain phases of life are particularly prone to poverty, as is the case for childhood. It is puzzling that members of society regularly deemed as in need and worthy of particular protection and support, called by politicians âthe future of a societyâ, are more often living in poverty. Before examining the injustice of child poverty, we need to point out two further aspects in relation to the aims and scope of this chapter. Firstly, we will focus on child poverty and studies that examine it in welfare states such as the countries of the European Union, the USA and, in some cases, Canada and Australia. We will, however, exclude the poorer states of the EU, such as Bulgaria and Romania, from our examination. The main reason is that, although such countries are members of the EU and certainly higher developed than many other countries in this world, they are still not on par with the richer states in the EU or the USA. The data we presented before on the breadth and depth of child poverty in these countries shows that sufficiently. Evidence shows that in highly developed countries severe forms of child poverty also exist but fortunately on a smaller scale (Weinreb et al. 2002). Secondly, despite this focus, we are confident that our conclusions are applicable to many more countries and contexts of child poverty. It holds generally that child poverty negatively affects the functionings children can achieve and the capabilities they can develop during childhood and in later life. This is in no way a problem exclusive to rich countries; in fact, evidence convincingly suggests that the problems are even greater and more severe in poorer countries in Europe and, indeed, everywhere else in the world. Still, child poverty in Romania and Bulgaria is less severe and widespread than it is in many African or Asian countries. It should be kept in mind that, using the monetary measure alone, the poor in richer states would be the middle class in others and among the affluent in many more."
137,36,0.988,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"In recognizing and categorizing these responsibilities, it is also important to consider whether they have shifted across time between women and men, and how and why change has occurred or not. While all three responsibilities are, as Tronto (2013) argues, ânestedâ into one another, I will pull them apart for analytical purposes. With regard to emotional responsibilities, ample studies from diverse groups of fathers in a number of countries have found that men can and do take on this responsibility of attentiveness and responsiveness to children (e.g., Biblarz and Stacey 2010; Chesley 2011; Coltrane 1996; Doucet 2006; Doucet and Merla 2007; Goldberg 2012; Kaufman 2013; Marsiglio and Roy 2012; Rehel 2014; Wall 2014). Stay-at-home fathers and fathers on parental leave demonstrate how time at home alone with children is a critical pathway for shifting emotional responsibilities. As revealed in the chapters in this book, it is the hands-on practices of care that can lead to confident and competent caregivers. North American research has pointed to how fathersâ involvement in community responsibilities have also shifted over time, with men becoming more involved and accepted as primary caregivers in schools, community organizations, parenting programs, and the sites where adults and children cluster, and they have increasingly been accepted as the parent to take on responsibilities for connecting home, school, and community activities (Doucet 2006, 2013; see also Kaufman 2013; Marsiglio and Roy 2012; Ranson 2013). In spite of these changes, I would argue that, even in stay-at-home-father families, women still take on much of the organizing, networking, and managing of childrenâs activities and lives (Doucet 2006, 2015; see also Lareau 2011). Part of this slow movement of change in community responsibilities relates, in turn, to how, in many countries, the community landscapes of parenting, especially with infants and pre-school children, are still female-dominated, by mothers and female caregivers. Across the past decade, my research has pointed to continuing challenges for men, where they can feel like misfits in what one father called âestrogen-filled worldsâ (Doucet 2006, 2013). In fact, with few exceptions, most of the stay-athome fathers I have interviewed have narrated at least one uncomfortable experience in community settings with children, especially in parentâinfant playgroups. One Canadian stay-at-home father, Bruno, told me in 2003, âItâs like a high school dance all over again: girls on one side, boys on the other.â Ten years later, Geoff, a laid-off factory worker and now stay-at-home father and part-time school bus driver, said, âI never felt like I belonged thereâ¦ I totally felt out of place. I felt like I was intruding on their sort of little world, and that I wasnât part of it.â In spite of these narrations of discomfort, it is also important to add that the âdad-in-the-playgroupâ narrative has shifted over the past decade. In some North American communities, more and more fathers in urban settings are joining these groups, either as members of female-dominated groups or as participants in fathering groups (Solomon 2014; Doucet 2013). Fathers in community spaces help to shift assumptions, and this is"

There is now great interest in the application of investment methods from venture capital and private equity to social problems, and many claims that these can deliver better â or, at least, different â social outcomes than traditional grant funding or government action. While these claims are plausible, there is as yet little hard evidence to substantiate them one way or the other.

242,648,0.988,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","see the âotherâ. However, visibility can be a doubleedged sword, which on one side can lead to empowerment30 when it is closely related to recognition by others or to access to restricted resources or services. But on the other, it can also facilitate control, exclusion, and discrimination by others, creating an ambivalent situation for migrants. This is the case for migrant women in irregular situations, and women victim-survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Recognition is a form of social visibility with implications for minorities and for those who are socially excluded. Often perceptions of visibility are distorted due to the entrenched social representations of marginal subjects, and so visibility and recognition are not related in a linear way: there may be different ways of seeing and being seen, and the social impact of this visibility will depend on who is more visible and in which social location they are placed (Brighenti 2007). Total âvisibilityâ may lead to total control, as explained in Foucaultâs discussion of the panopticon â a symbol of total surveillance (Gordon 2002). In addition, visibility can lead to regulation, selectivity, or stratification. So the relationship between seeking recognition or visibility and being controlled is a close one. This tension between achieving recognition and suffering control or discrimination generates complexity in the relationship between in/visibility and power, and therefore between migrants and their context. In these terms, visibility does not necessarily lead to relief nor does it imply better life while invisibility cannot only be seen or considered as a lack of power (Brighenti 2007). Invisibility as a strategy for power is reflected in the cases of silence and secrecy. Secrecy is not only centred within power, but secrecy by others also creates the possibility to escape or oppose power (Brighenti 2007; Amster 2008). Silence and secrecy can be key survival strategies, can offer protection, and in some cases can create spaces to renegotiate harmful gender relations and practices. In this respect, it is important to discuss the role of in/visibility in empowerment processes. If we are to consider the active participation of migrants in processes that will allow them access to better conditions of life, and what that might imply in the current context of border controls heightened by international requirements, we need to first question in what manner in/visibility could con30 Empowerment refers to the process by which those who have been denied the possibility of taking strategic decisions in life acquire such capacity (Kabeer 1999)."

An analysis of the uses of these words in different contexts is required in order to establish the connection with intersubjectivity more clearly than I have in this chapter. Note that know, think, and believe do not quite follow the usual S shape. Their trajectories may partly be explained by the many idiomatic uses of these words, which make their frequencies increase at a rate more constant than that of other words. Although I can present only a limited number of examples in these pages, it should be clear that my hypothesis on establishment periods is rich in empirically testable predictions. I invite corpus linguists and child development researchers to continue testing it. Further evidence of the domain called organization of semantic knowledge is the way that metaphors do not come alone.

232,22,0.988,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"3 Entry into Resilience: A Way to Cope with the Extreme Situation The concept of resilience is only relevant following damage, loss, an accident, trauma, etc. Pre-event is the domain of prevention, prudence, or even precaution. To be able to discuss resilience, you ï¬rst have to survive. Even this is not enough, as, while it can be a sustainable situation, survival is fragile. The concept has positive connotations. Resilience is an asset, it represents progress; being or becoming resilient does not mean returning to the nominal, pre-shock state. This is anyway impossible because the system, whatever form it takes, remembers the event (albeit for a limited period of time). Although the concept is in fashion, there is no universal deï¬nition that can be applied to all domains. That said, the English term âresilienceâ, itself derived from the Latin verb resilire (to bounce), is made up of re (again) and salire (rise), which implies a retroactive effect [27]. While in the 1970s the term was associated with the ability to absorb and overcome the effects of signiï¬cant, unexpected and brutal disruption to ecological systems [28], hybrid deï¬nitions have since emerged in many disciplines including geography [29], psychology [25], sociology [30], organizational sciences [31], ergo-psychology [32], etc. Within this smorgasbord of deï¬nitions, two fundamental ideas prevail: community,2 and the process.3 In the absence of a consensus, resilience can be deï¬ned as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbances and reorganize itself during ongoing changes [33]. It is probably more relevant, especially in the case of an accident as serious as that at Fukushima Daiichi, to place less emphasis on states of equilibrium as âfrontiers as a function of the domain of attractionâ because paradoxically, highly fluctuating instability can also foster entry into resilience [28]. In practice, a system can be very resilient, yet fluctuate signiï¬cantly and therefore be fairly unstable. This approach seems more relevant in the case of Fukushima Daiichi where, given the enormity of the shock, it was more important to preserve relationships in the socio-technical system than to return to the previous equilibrium as quickly as possible, which in fact proved to be an unrealistic expectation [34]. Contemporary views of nuclear safety see the concept of resilience as a post-crisis process, part of a community dynamic that stresses organizational adaptability [35]. It has a predictive dimension that helps the organization to overcome adversity and get back on track [27]. However, this predictive dimension, and a fortiori entry into resilience, must not neglect the role of probability, uncertainty [13] or even a âsurpriseâ dimension in the success (or failure) of its implementation [36]. Here again, there is a reference to a conscious capacity to ânavigateâ and ânegotiateâ [37] in order to cope with an extreme situation."
321,122,0.988,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"For example, even with an air conditioner, its coefficient of performance had been close to 3 and had not improved much before 1990. However, once the goal of energy saving was clearly presented, an innovation occurred, and the coefficient of performance started to increase. If you follow an air conditioner which was awarded the Energy Conservation Grand Prize, you will find that it evolved as expected according to the technological prediction we made. In other words, imposing strict regulations in an area which has a large room for innovation facilitates technological innovation. The third conclusion is that a technological prediction is also important in making a policy in light of the economic impact of environmental regulations. Currently, it is hard to say that technological prediction is fully reflected in developing environmental regulations. Consequently, the process winds up in exchanges of unwarranted assertions among the industry, policy makers, and environmentalists. As far as technological prediction is concerned, no reliable answers can be obtained from companies if you ask them about it. Scholars and engineers have to assemble and logically thrash it out. Such patient and solid discussions have hardly been made. It is thus an important point how to reflect a technological prediction in environmental policymaking and economic forecasting."

The comparison of potential scenarios results in mathematical formulations, developed from an economic perspective. The choice is equivalent to the optimization of a function (the utility). A set of axioms expresses postulates about the properties of preferences (for a discussion of the various theories see [7]). If an objective assessment of the probabilities of the consequences of an act is not possible, the decision maker can use âsubjectiveâ probabilities. The probability distribution is therefore measured according to their knowledge of the possible states of the object they are interested in and upon which they wish to act. Nevertheless, the assessment of subjective probabilities can be arbitrary and, in many practical situations, the behaviour of agents does not reflect preferences that are consistent with these axioms, without being necessarily called an âerrorâ [1]. To account for the assumed ignorance of the decision maker of certain states and their aversion to uncertainty, Gilboa and Schmeidler [8] showed that decisions can sometimes be seen as the maximization of a form of expected utility that takes into account the worst case scenario, which is consistent with the âmaxminâ model. It is also possible to broaden the spectrum of reactions in uncertain situations [9], in order to model less paranoid attitudes [1]. From this perspective, the behaviour of the decision maker is interpreted according to a concept of ambiguity relative to their knowledge of the worldâhe could not be sure of the meaning of the few information he got regarding the state of the facilitiesâ, which is how the questions of the Japanese investigators should be understood (see Sect. 2). Faced with ambiguity about the state of Reactor 1, it could be argued that Yoshida violated expected utility theory by not deciding to immediately cool the core; or, alternatively, he demonstrated an aversion to uncertainty, by deciding to rely on information about the water level, while simultaneously preparing cooling mechanisms.5 The fact that he did not foresee hydrogen leaks can be interpreted in two ways using the âmaxminâ model: either he failed (cognitively) in his assessment based on all of the objective information available; or his attitude or imperfect knowledge led him to limit his choices to a subset of possible states. As for his decision to send staff to gather information on the state of the reactors before considering operations such as venting, this can be interpreted as an example of incomplete preference, where the status quo is maintained until such time as a conclusively better, new alternative appears. Can we conclude that Yoshida acted irrationally, or do the models provide an incomplete description of such decisions? Gilboa [10] argues that we qualify behaviour as âirrationalâ if whoever violates its precepts regrets their actions. The regret expressed by Yoshida about the conï¬dence he placed in Reactor 1âs water level indicators (see Sect. 2) would suggest that the decision was irrational."

By planning today, manufacturers can be prepared for the inevitable suits later. First, planning can enable them to make safer products that are less likely to cause litigation-triggering accidents in the first place. Second, by planning ahead, manufacturers can increase their chances of winning the cases that accidents do trigger. A proactive approach to design safety with a comprehensive risk management program establishes upfront a manufacturerâs commitment to safety. When the inevitable suit happens later, the manufacturerâs counsel has a story to tell the jury as to why its products were safe and how the manufacturer cared about safety. Second, manufacturers should consider the commitment they make to product safety using such a proactive approach. One commentator stated, âThe most effective way for [counsel for] a corporate defendant to reduce anger toward his or her client is to show all the ways that the client went beyond what was required by the law or industry practice.â [24]. Meeting minimum standards is insufficient because of juror skepticism about the rigor of standards set or influenced by industry and because jurors expect corporate clients to know more about product safety than a âreasonable personâ â the standard for judging the conduct of defendants under the law [24]. âA successful defense can also be supported by walking jurors through the relevant manufacturing or decision-making process, showing all of the testing, checking, and follow-up actions that were included. Jurors who have no familiarity with complex business processes are often impressed with all of the thought that went into the process and all of the precautions that were taken.â [24] Even though accidents do occur, and in any trial setting an accident or problem did occur, a defendantâs proactive approach would show the jury that the manufacturer tried hard to do the right thing [24]. Consequently, efforts to go above and beyond the minimum standards would diffuse juror anger and mitigate the manufacturerâs risk. Third, manufacturers should recognize that risk management is a process that begins with a careful risk analysis looking at the types, likelihood, and impact of issues in the design of AVs. Once a risk assessment is complete, they can review the results and analyze changes in design and engineering practices to address these issues, prioritize risks and risk mitigation measures, and implement the prioritized risk mitigation measures [34]. In connection with the risk management process, manufacturers can obtain guidance from a number of standards bearing on risk management and safety:"

Traditionally, public sector workplaces have supported work-family life reconciliation measures, and encouraged menâs take-up of leave at least in the Nordic countries (Brandth and Kvande 2002; Bygren and Duvander 2006; Haas et al. 2002). In Finland, the short paternity leave that is taken when the child is born has become normalized and it seems to be self-evident also at private-sector workplaces. When we interviewed human resources managers about leave take-up, they told us that taking paternity leave is automatic or even desirable. Some collective agreements provide full pay during 2 or 3 weeks of paternity leave, and there are also organizational practices that encourage fathers to take their full 3-week paternity leave. Parental leave, however, is still often seen as an exceptional and private matter. Male employees are not necessarily encouraged to take longer leave periods, but if they apply for a parental or care leave they usually will be supported (Salmi et al. 2009). The interviews with the stay-at-home fathers show that it is still easier to negotiate a longer leave period in public sector workplaces than in private sector companies. Aki used to work in the private sector when his child was born. He then changed to the public sector and finds the take-up of his latter leave period much easier: In the private company it was more difficult. But I was also quite sick and tired of that place so I did not mind telling them that Iâll be off now. My current job is in the public sector so basically I simply notified the employer about my leave. When I was interviewed for the job I asked if I could start later after my leave and they accepted.

This is called the frequentist approach to maximum likelihood (see p. 390): p(X |Î¸ ). Alternatively, because we are usually a lot more certain about our data than we are about the truth of our model, we might ask what is the likelihood of our model, given the data: l(Î¸ |X ). These two quantities are different ways of expressing the same idea, but they embody a fundamentally different approach. You need to think about this last paragraph until the penny drops. The fundamental part of Bayesian statistics is that the posterior distribution p(Î¸ |X ) is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood: p(Î¸ |X ) â p(Î¸ ) Ã l(Î¸ |X ). This tells us how to modify our existing beliefs in the light of the newly available data. Note the proportionality: we can multiply the likelihood by any constant without affecting the posterior, but we need our posterior probability distribution to integrate to 1."
163,35,0.988,a Fair Share of Tax : a Fiscal Anthropology of Contemporary Sweden,"taxpayer to do the same is greater (Rabin 1998; Fehr and Falk 2002). A valid follow-up task would be to make a distinction between copycats and those who comply because there will be more in the treasure chest to share in the society we belong to collectively. Challenging which reciprocity is in play makes for different policies to address non-compliance. If taxation is considered a social action, the behaviour of individual taxpayers will be strongly influenced by that of others (Frey and Torgler 2007). Frey and Torgler maintain that there is a strong correlation between conditional cooperation of the individual and the extent of tax morale or of tax evasion. It is noteworthy that this research is based on attitudinal data from the European Value Survey: thirty countries were sampled and at least 1000 individuals in each country responded. The following statement, for example, was proposed, offering answers on the scale of 1 (never justified) to 4 (always justified): Cheating on tax payments if you get the chance. The responses were correlated with six variables seen to have an impact on societal tax morale: an individualâs voice and accountability, societyâs political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption. Frey and Torgler thus stress the importance of political institutions in each of the societies they study, implying that taxpayersâ money has been spent on institutions that make for a democratic society and good collective governmental services. The quality of those matters on how citizens interact socially; for example, if others pay taxes so will I. By defining tax morale in this way, Frey and Torgler simultaneously address reciprocity on an institutional level and the perceived expectations of other taxpayers to comply with democratic institutions. In social behavioural/psychological models reciprocity in relation to tax compliance is dichotomized in various ways; as either strongâweak, negativeâpositive or horizontalâvertical. Diving into these dichotomies, we can view reciprocity broadly speaking as peopleâs tendency to respond ânicelyâ to actions they are in favour of and ânastilyâ to those actions deemed unfavourable for them. If reciprocal feelings are strong, it means that people favour the relationship with others instead of pursuing their own self-interest, whereas if reciprocity is weak the self-interested notions have the upper hand within the proposed exchange (Guala 2012). Negative reciprocity is the result of getting something for nothing, for example stealing (cf. Sahlins 1972), whereas positive reciprocity enforces a common expectation of a positive contribution in return (for something given) regardless if it is in the form of a gift, a"

Otherwise, the encapsulation of our local stack frame could be broken. In the proof of Lemma 5, this requirement shows up because we invoke the callback in a world that is only a private future world of the one where we received the callback, precisely because we have invalidated the adversaryâs local state (particularly their old stack and return capabilities). The callback is still valid in this private future world, but only because we know that it is global. In Lemma 5 the order of control has been inverted compared to the previous lemmas. In this lemma, the adversary assumes control first with a capability for the closure creator g1. Consequently, we need to check that all arguments are safe to use and that we clean up before returning in the end.

Much of the language used reflected the international and even global outlook of organisations such as these, particularly in their use of terms such as âcrisisâ and ârecoveryâ, and in statements about patient rights. One of the videos showed Daniel, a teacher who for a long time did not want to be open about his mental health problems for fear of what his students might think. He explained, âWhen I was young I used to see mulalu (a mad person) and I was like, what did they do? You know perhaps people have say here donât mind him he robbed someone so they bewitched him.

This project formalised and expanded peer support work by training approximately thirty-six peer support workers over a two-year period. Peer supporters then went out into communities in Kampala and met with people who had recently been released from Butabika.18 While the project reportedly had success in convincing psychiatrists at Butabika, who had initially been resistant, of the benefits of the approach, overall the project faced financial mismanagement and fraud, with some of the money from the international partnership being diverted into other projects.

In this way Kripke made an important contribution to the search for an axiomatic system corresponding to the Diodorean notion of modality. This research engaged several researchers in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. (See Prior 1967, p. 176). Even more important was the following passage from Saul Kripkeâs letter in which he suggested how the semantics of S4 could be visualized.

We have organized the seventeen contributed chapters into four parts: I. Artistic Contributions, II. Peer Histories, III. Hypertext & Ted Nelson-influenced Research, and IV. The Last Word. As befits Nelsonâs wide-ranging and interdisciplinary intellect, the first section includes a cartoon and a sequence of poems; both were created in Nelsonâs honor. In the section of Peer Histories, readers get a sense of the milieu that resulted from Nelsonâs ideas. In addition, several of the authors discuss what it is like to collaborate directly with Nelson. The penultimate section, Hypertext & Ted Nelson-influenced Research, wrestles with Nelsonâs influence and legacy. The fourth and final section of Intertwingled, appropriately enough entitled The Last Word, is comprised of a single contribution from Ted Nelson himself. In it, he tells the readerâjust as he did at the Intertwingled conferenceâthat heâs spent the day listening to his obituaries. He says, âI feel very lucky to have eavesdropped on these thoughtful pre-mortems.â Nothing could be further from the truth. We believe that the worldâparticularly the technology worldâis better off for having Ted alive and kicking at the boundaries of the possible. We can confirm that Nelsonâs mind is as active as everâhe constantly emails us with his observations of the worldâand that his body has barely slowed. Shortly after the Intertwingled conference, Open Xanadu had its first release, a moment 50 years in the making. Who can tell what will be next from Ted Nelson? We look forward to more years of Nelsonâs ground-breaking ideas and tireless work. We wish him much success as he pursues his vision of the docuverse."

Providing the right for reasonable accommodation, the M-decree establishes that students can be referred to special education only if schools can prove that they have tried all âreasonable adjustmentsâ. In particular, it states that every child with disability has the right to be enrolled in regular school if it is possible to follow the regular curriculum with reasonable adaptations, such as extra-time to make tests. As for the children with disabilities who need an individual curriculum, the M-decree points out that they can go to regular school if the student support service and the teaching staff concludes that it is possible with reasonable adaptations. When adaptations are too extreme, the child will be referred to special education. Being the entry into force of the Decree, originally scheduled in September 2014, delayed until September 2015, the effect of the new law once it is in force is unknown. However, the M-decree has raised several criticisms from DPOs. As underlined in the complaint submitted by the MDAC to the European Committee of Social Rights in 2014,52 the Decree appears to be discriminatory since it does not even apply to children who cannot follow the regular curriculum, thereby excluding children with more significant intellectual or learning disabilities. Furthermore, no new funding mechanisms have been introduced in order to increase the number or range of supports that schools or local authorities can provide to students who require accommodations. Therefore, it seems that the M-decree will not change the current practices by which schools refuse admission to students claiming that they cannot provide the needed supports if considered disproportionate and an undue burden. In contrast with clearly separated systems, some EU Member States, such as the UK and Spain, have some provisions on special education while a comprehensive school system has been established. As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, mainstream school system co-exists with special schools. In this regards, it must be recalled that the State made a reservation on Article 24 of the CRPD stating that âthe general education system in the United Kingdom includes mainstream, and special schools, which the UK Government understands is allowed under the Conventionâ. Such reservation is aimed at enabling parents to continue to have access to places for their children at mainstream and special schools.53"

The conceptual regress argument, on the other hand, appears to be a rewording of the no starting point objection. Fumerton calls it âquite differentâ from the epistemic regress argument, and âmore fundamentalâ.10 It states that an infinite justificatory chain is vicious because we can only understand the concept of inferential justification if we accept that of noninferential justification: [I]f we are building the principle of inferential justification into an analysis of the very concept of justification, we have a more fundamental vicious conceptual regress to end. We need the concept of a noninferentially justified belief not only to end the epistemic regress but to provide a conceptual building block upon which we can understand all other sorts of justification. I would argue that the concept of noninferential justification is needed . . . in order to understand other sorts of justification . . . .11"

There are plenty of socialized members who want to change the movement further, although the more traditional older generations have been the most vocal. One option is that the HH might allow two opposing groups to coexist in the same city or town, or even in the same congregation. It is also possible that the HK and other factions opposing the SHK might fail to attract long-term interest among younger Pentecostals, in which case the HK would slowly vanish. Yet another possibility would be to dissolve the HH, but this seems unlikely in the near future, as it is not currently a viable option. In the long run, the movementâs survival depends on the realization that groups with different religious habituses need their own spaces in which to practice Pentecostalism, and Pentecostal lifestyles that accommodate their own cultural tastes and preferences."
117,112,0.988,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"The Care Dilemma Nonetheless, this strategy for dealing with the supposed paternalistic tendencies of a care-based approach to medical ethics leads into a specific variation of the dilemma developed above. If one sees autonomy as prevailing over care, it becomes unclear why autonomy should be restricted to rejecting medical interventions. As long as patient preferences do not harm others, why should theses preferences not be justified? From the point of view of the autonomy principle, there can be no meaningful debate about the patientâs preferences, neither based on supposedly interindividually valid evaluations of health states, nor based on any other supposedly inter-individually valid reasons. If, however, one gives precedence to care, it must appear irrational, for example, to accept a patientâs request not to undergo treatment when successful medical therapy is still possible. If the patient makes recourse to his own well-being, health care team members will be entitled to correct him or her, since defining wellbeing is, qua the hypothesis, part of their expertise. What is needed in order to resolve the dilemma is an understanding of care that allows for reason-based debate about patient needs and preferences, without shifting the expertise on what is good for the patient completely into, in this case, the realm of medical and healthcare expert knowledge. Again, the hermeneutic understanding of autonomy is a viable option for resolving this dilemma. Approaching"

She also had to convince the diversity of research partners to adjust their interaction as a result of the feedback. This became a challenge of self-reflection for all involved. The professionals initially felt criticized and attacked in their professional self-esteem. But this was a temporary initial reaction to the new approach of extended partnership and the ï¬xation of the focus on persuasion rather than just research. Step by step, the group of researchers also started to understand their particular role and developed a new kind of empathy with our AiREAS mission. They understood that they are not only valued for their scientiï¬c expertise, which needed no conï¬rmation anyway. They are also recognized as scientiï¬c influencers of value-driven processes geared towards a desired end result of innovative change, measurable health and air quality development. This combination made AiREAS stand out from any other research done elsewhere in the world and lent an extra dimension to the involvement of our professionals. Apart from their islands of expertise, they are being extra-valued for their empathy with the team as a whole and their contribution to the overall objective."
46,130,0.988,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"for child poverty is put on parents and families; it is often accompanied by sexism, which targets lone mothers as bad mothers, unable to keep a husband that could care for them and their children; the same framing is also prevalent in the discourse about poverty and obese children (Maher, Fraser and Wright 2010). Such an atmosphere is equally present in the experience of children, who are well aware of how they and their families are perceived in the public and by others. While the political discourse claims to view children as innocent victims of poverty who deserve our help, the experience of many children in poverty is a different one. On the other hand, the experience of child poverty is framed in a consumerist society that entangles self-realization and identity with brands: having certain goods, wearing certain clothes, doing certain leisure activities (Elliott and Leonard 2004). A child being bullied for not having something is the collateral damage of such a culture. The role of peers poses several ethical challenges, as they themselves are not fully competent and hence also not fully responsible for their actions, often just reproducing cultural norms and values. We now introduce the concept of âhumiliationâ to capture the subjective experience of poverty by children. We do not want to include all aspects of poverty articulated by children as important, but, in our judgment, a central one. Humiliation is the counterpart to respect and the functioning of being respected. There is also some overlap between being respected and mental health in the sense that being mentally healthy also means achieving positive self-awareness in the form of selftrust, self-esteem and self-respect. Humiliation has two distinct dimensions: on the one hand, it can describe a certain kind of emotion and feeling; one feels humiliated. On the other, it can describe certain kinds of actions perceived as humiliating. In many cases they go hand in hand: a humiliating action leads to the feeling of being humiliated on the side of the victim. This connection is not necessary, though, and some actions judged by many or most as humiliating might not trigger the emotion of being humiliated, and in some cases, people may feel humiliated even if there is no sound reason. Child poverty is humiliating in both senses: it is typically perceived by children as humiliating and it is an act of humiliation itself. Child poverty is a condition with which acts of humiliation by other people are connected, and being poor is in itself humiliating even if there are no such acts of humiliation by other persons. At least two questions must then be clarified: first, how can humiliation be defined, and second, in what sense can a certain living condition be humiliating in itself without another person committing acts of humiliation?"
395,105,0.988,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"Abstract This chapter focuses on the relationship between representations of work (rules, procedures, models, speciï¬cations, plans) and work as a situated practice, performed by real people in always unique contexts. Empirically, it is organized around two main examples, the ï¬rst one being a discussion of the compartmentalization of safety seen in shipping and the railway sector. It shows how safety, as an object of management, has become decoupled from practice, and how current discourses about safety disempower practitioners and subordinate their perspectives to more âtheoreticalâ positions. The second is based on a study of control room operators in a space research operations setting. Here safety in the sense of avoiding harm to people is not the main concern; rather it is the reliability and robustness of an experiment on the International Space Station that is at stake. This example serves as a starting point for discussing how the research and theory on industrial safety should address the different temporalities of different work situations. It also helps to discuss the role of rules and procedures to support safety, reliability and resilience within the ï¬eld of safety science. Finally, some propositions about the relationship between situated practice and the management of safety are provided: how invisible aspects of situated work might be important for safety yet hard to manage, how procedures and rules might be integrated parts of situated work as much as representations of it and how different temporalities of work situations should be included in the theorizing of safety and resilience.

386,148,0.988,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"5.1.2 Empirical Results About Self-perception If anything should have become clear over the course of this book, it is the strong heterogeneity of agriculture in different parts of the world. US entrepreneurs and Zambian pastoralists, for example, have very little in common. Under these circumstances, is it justified to say anything about self-perception of farmers? Perhaps selfperception of farmers differs too much within and between the various agricultural systems. The multifaceted reality of farming systems barely allows finding a single term under which self-perception of todayâs farmers could be summarized. The best term would probably be âproductivistâ. In general, farmers like to consider themselves as producers of food more than anything else. This self-image applies, for example, to Kenya. As Waithaka et al. (2006) showed, Kenyan farmers, when depicting an âidealâ farm, start dreaming about milk yields 10 times the actual level, or about corn yields 20 times as high as they are. Feed needs are underestimated, whereas animal density is rather overestimated. Such farms are ideal because they generate maximum food yield with minimum effort. The provision of anything else besides food, under these circumstances, is not really part of the picture. The self-image of being a productivist also applies to Ireland, where Howley et al. (2015) showed that farmers are willing to sacrifice additional income to avoid participating in agri-environmental or forestation schemes compromising their production potential. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that farmers are as heterogeneous a group as people in most other professions. This heterogeneity is nicely illustrated in a study from the USA where Sulemana and James (2014) involved farmers in discourses about ethics. Farmers were confronted with scenarios such as applying pesticides under windy conditions or disposing pesticide containers without rinsing them. The farmersâ attitudes differed widely, allowing the authors to categorize parts of their sample as conservationists, others as productivists. A recent study from Switzerland (Mann 2018) raised the question of how âgreenâ even conservationists among farmers are. Farmers who subscribed to a public program on no-tillage and stated in a standardized survey conservation as a very important task for farmers would usually be regarded as being conservationists. However, in conversations with this group, this view was strongly challenged. The sequence below, for example, shows that these farmers, at least in some cases, still prioritize intensive production. Farmer 3 (F3): Yes, and then I did it like that, and then I also worked outside the farm. Now I have arable production and pigs. Interviewer (I): Yes, OK. F3: And, er (â¦) right, since 03 Iâm actually doing no-tillage (.) I: OK F3: When it actually was prescribed, due to run-off. I: The district administration has prescribed it, right?"
299,490,0.988,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"preferences intact. It, hence, invites attempts to circumvent the law and tends to generate a sense of alienation (Etzioni 1975). A telling example is the way Prohibition was introduced versus the way public smoking was banned. The enactment of Prohibition was not preceded by the building of a normative consensus and instead relied heavily on law enforcement. It failed to suppress the use of alcohol and greatly increased the corruption of the American legal and political system. Moreover, it is the only constitutional amendment that was ever repealed. In contrast, although it took some 25 years to build wide societal support to ban smoking in public spaces, once these laws were introduced, they served to lock in an already very well established norm, which is almost completely self-enforcing. Similarly, responsive communitarianism would urge, for example, that long before one considers mandatory HIV testing, let alone forcefully isolating people who have contracted HIV, one is obligated to engage in public educational campaigns that encourage such testing and to work with the communities of those most at risk to encourage their members to be tested. And rather than open a market in human organs to incentivize more people to donate organs, which are in short supply (Erin and Harris 2003, pp. 137â138) one should appeal to people to make the gift of life. A colleague has suggested that the debate about how best to increase the supply of organs may be an instance of the debate between those who see the world through the eyes of rational choice and seek to reduce all conduct to self-interest, and those who holdâas I doâthat people are indeed influenced by incentives and disincentives, but also by moral considerations, which change their preferences. It is not possible to deal with this debate here, and I have treated it extensively elsewhere (Etzioni 1988). At the same time, responsive communitarianism does recognize that there are conditions under which the state must be involved, although it is best used as the last, rather than the first, resort. For instance, when people infected with a highly communicable disease that has fatal consequences do not heed calls to remain at home until they cease to be infectious, the state has an obligation to enforce their quarantine. Historically, this issue has arisen with regard to the treatment of people with leprosy, tuberculosis, and, more recently, severe adult respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza. Gostin (2002) provides a powerful case for a communitarian approach to similar issues, such as a bioterrorist attack or a severe medical emergency. He points out that excessive concern for autonomy and neglect of the common good have led to a focus on individualized achievements in health care at the cost of severely underfunding the public health infrastructure and ignoring the needed adaptations of public health laws. As a result, public health agencies do not have the capacity to âconduct essential public health services at a level of performance that matches the constantly evolving threats to the health of the public.â At the same time, public health law has fallen off the radar and is now âhighly antiquated, after many decades of neglect.â Finally, the debate about the role of the government in providing health care, reignited in the United States by the Obama administration, has some strong"

The relation to the generative body is now the least of the problem. Half of the women were informed by their mothers in advance and the rest knew about it from their friends. Puberty is discursively installed as a life phase and questions about âwhen did you feel that you were grown-up?â are most often answered with âmy first periodâ, in contrast with the eldest generation, who mentioned their confirmation and end of school when asked the same question. In this generation it is also less problematic to tell the mother about what had happened and get her to help with sanitary belts and pads. The experience of menstruation is more varied than it was among their mothers, who all felt that it was a âcurseâ. Most of the daughters are clearly ambivalentâmenstruation is a nuisance but also a fact of life. The sexualisation and gendering of the body become most evident in the womenâs intense beauty routines. Compared with their mothersâ innocent joy of getting new dresses and shoes, the practices of the women in this generation are much more elaborate and detailed.

117,429,0.988,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Care, Language, and Ambiguity Communication in healthcare is dominated by medical terminology, which aims to precisely define and refer to diseases, therapies, and physiological facts. This terminology and its aims are an indispensable part of statistical surveys, economic classifications as well as efficient and errorfree expert communication. In contrast, the language that is used to denote practices of care and the language that is used in providing care can appear to lack this kind of precision. Since care practices are part of an institutional setting that involves experts, distribution of labour, and expert exchanges, some would argue that a lack of precision represents a disadvantage. In this context, they would surmise that care language needs to strive for accuracy just as medical terminology does. At the same time, however, the language of care that is used in care practices is necessarily close to everyday language since it has to do with everyday activities that are not confined to the healthcare setting. Moreover, it involves the experiences and perceptions of patients as described in their own words. The way patients express their experiences can vary according to their prior life experiences, their convictions, and their knowledge. The vocabulary they use may be part of a larger narrative, rather than comprising single terms that refer to clearly delineable states of affairs. As the relevant discourses show, the value of narrative self-identity, embodied knowledge, and patient knowledge should not be neglected. While this ultimately may be an unresolvable tension, Kohlen highlights the fact that in todayâs healthcare settings, striving for accuracy prevails over the acceptance of ambiguity. Given the focus on economic measures, core elements of care that are subject to ambiguity are often regarded as irrelevant. The voices of caregivers are thus underrepresented in todaysâ healthcare institutions, as Kohlen demonstrates in the case of hospital ethics committees."
82,131,0.988,Fading Foundations : Probability and The Regress Problem,"ables are different. For instance, A = âI will not win the lotteryâ, B = âI have bought one ticket in a fair lottery with a million ticketsâ, C = âThe person in front of me will not suddenly drop deadâ, D = âThe person in front of me is young and healthyâ. Then, even if P(A|B) > P(C|D), it is still true, according to Smith, that D normically supports C, while B only makes A very likely (Smith 2010, 23). We believe that these cases do not provide much insight into the concept of justification, since they typically involve a comparison between two totally different domains. Here is another example by Smith (from his talk âWhen does evidence suffice for conviction?â on 30 April 2014 in Groningen; cf. Cohen 1977 and Nesson 1979). Imagine a hundred people walking out from an electronics store, each carrying a television. As it turns out, only one television has been paid for, so ninety-nine were stolen. Since Joe was one of the hundred, the probability that he is a thief is 0.99. Are we justified to believe that Joe is a thief? Not so, says Smith. Coos Engelsma proposed that epistemically we are justified, but not morally (private communication). Engelsma might have a point here, although this does not help the judge, who still has to weigh epistemic and moral justification against one another. 71 Smith 2016, 76-79."

To demonstrate the applicability, we present several examples of classical smart contracts in this section. In each example, we present a contract and a âbuggyâ implementation of the same contract that has a different value. In Sect. 6 we show that our automated approach to analyze the contracts can compute contract values with enough precision to differentiate between the correct and the buggy implementation. All of our examples are motivated from well-known bugs that have happened in real life in Ethereum. Rock-Paper-Scissors. Let our contract be the one specified in Fig. 2 and assume that we want to analyze it from the point of view of the issuer p. Also, let the objective function be (p+ â pâ + 10 Â· AliceWon) . Intuitively, this means that winning the rock-paper-scissors game is considered to have an additional value of 10, other than the spending and earnings. The idea behind this is similar to the case with chess tournaments, in which players not only win a prize, but can also use their wins to achieve better âratingsâ, so winning has extra utility. A common bug in writing rock-paper-scissors is allowing the parties to move sequentially, rather than concurrently [29]. If parties can move sequentially and the issuer moves after Bob, then she can ensure a utility of 10, i.e. her worst-case expected reward is 10. However, in the correct implementation as in Fig. 2, the best strategy for both players is to bid 0 and then Alice can win the game with probability 1/3 by choosing each of the three options with equal probability. Hence, her worst-case expected reward is 10/3. Auction. Consider an open auction, in which during a fixed time interval everyone is allowed to bid for the good being sold and everyone can see othersâ bids. When the bidding period ends a winner emerges and every other participant can get their money back. Let the variable HighestBid store the value of the highest bid made at the auction. Then for a party p, one can define the objective as: p+ â pâ + (Winner==p) Ã HighestBid. This is of course assuming that the good being sold is worth precisely as much as the highest bid. A correctly written auction should return a value of 0 to every participant, because those who lose the auction must get their money back and the party that wins pays precisely the highest bid. The contract in Fig. 3 (left) is an implementation of such an auction. However, it has a slight problem. The function bid allows the winner to reduce her bid. This bug is fixed in the contract on the right."
296,165,0.988,Becoming a World-Class University : The Case of King Abdulaziz University,"7 The Importance of Cross-Disciplinary Research While a great deal of research of world-class quality will be confined to individual disciplines, there is an increasing recognition that many of the worldâs greatest problems need to be tackled by teams of researchers pulled together from different disciplines. At UCL we prefer the notion that each individual in a cross-disciplinary team brings their own disciplinary excellence to tackling a major problem and we therefore prefer the term âcross-disciplinaryâ rather than âinter-disciplinaryâ or âtrans-disciplinaryâ. These terms are often used interchangeably, but the latter two are perhaps more indicative of individuals from one discipline beginning to work in another disciplinary area. Such discipline hopping may be productive, but it is not always successful, and in our view it is important to bring disciplinary excellence to the table as research teams are formed. When tackling complex problems a cross-disciplinary approach is highly creative as individuals bring their discipline specific approaches to the table and share ideas and concepts across the team. There are numerous perceived barriers to the creation of effective cross-disciplinary research teams and it is important that they are recognized and dealt with by institutional leaders. The most common problems relate to the discipline specific nature of financial and other organisational structures within our institutions. Moreover most external organisations, for example many research funders, journals and learned societies are organised by discipline and this creates the perception that it is easier to obtain funding, to publish and to achieve personal recognition and promotion by remaining safely within a disciplineâs confines. It is important for institutional leaders to set a clear tone concerning the importance of cross-disciplinary research and to create opportunities for these activities to flourish. The rewards from getting this right are significant in terms of an institutionâs global research profile. How best to achieve this will vary from one institution to another. At UCL we have developed the concept of a âgrand challengeâ approach, and have actively promoted these via a series of âtown meetingsâ with expert panels, informed debate and open discussion. This has been sufficient to initiate collaborative cross-disciplinary discussion that has led on to new research and educational activities. Each grand challenge is guided forward by a senior academic executive team. Small pump-priming grants are available to help new projects get off the ground, but as new activities develop, external grants are sought. Our current grand challenges are in Global Health, Human Well-Being, Intercultural Interaction and Sustainable Cities [3]. This approach is now sufficiently embedded in our research culture that it is also informing our Global Engagement (internationalisation) strategy and our approach to massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) and online distance learning. Other approaches to promoting cross-disciplinary activity in research and education can also be taken. In higher education environments where philanthropy is"

Thus, the last investigation of the use of burka and niqab in Denmark executed in 2009 reveals that as few as 100â200 individuals are actually wearing such garments. About 50% of them have converted to Islam.6 At the same time, Denmark is not showing any interest in the effect of a similar law implemented in France in 2011. According to the findings of sociologist AgnÃ©s de FÃ©o, the French veiling ban has been counterproductive rather than beneficial to integration. The women who nowadays are fully covering their face started doing so after the implementation of the law. And women who fully covered their face prior to the implementation of the veiling ban are no longer leaving home.7 Those kinds of investigations and evaluations of actual impacts are of no concern to the politician who is pressing for legislation of purely symbolic value. Jonathan Laurence, Professor of Political Science at Boston College and expert in Muslim communities in Europe, says it tellingly: I donât think policymakers would pay such studies any mind since these laws are never about integration effects.8"

I think that there are independent metaphysical reasons for preferring first points of divergence: branching is nothing that takes place, but world history develops by zillions of local decisions and thus continuously excludes possible alternative developments it might have had by the course it takes. Decisions do not take place at instants/events but by events occurring and thus not failing to occur. That picture suggests first points of divergence. So I welcome the result BST research has reached for different reasons than the ones I gave in Strobach (2007a). I suspect that if the PCP is abandoned, also the inclusion of the âwingsâ as a necessary feature of BSTs is gone (I would welcome this, too). At least the proof of fact 31 given in Belnap (1992), 411, seems to rely on the PCP."
143,37,0.988,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"International organizations seeking to collaborate with local organizations need more than an enabling policy environment. They also need to understand local dynamics. Chapter 12, âThe Art of Managing Worldviews in Kenyaâs International Technology Sector,â by Tim Weiss (co-editor of the present volume) and Klaus Weber, documents what a prospective investor needs to do to become successful in Kenyaâs tech scene. It investigates if there is such a thing as a Kenyan recipeâa holy grailâfor success. The research brings into focus two different worldviews, a âKenyan worldviewâ and an âinternational worldview,â that stand on different sides of the question of how to do it âright.â This dynamic sheds light on the contested issues that have surfaced during Kenyaâs international tech boom. However, it also shows that tension and contestation, if tackled with the right mindset, can also become opportunities. The chapter thus introduces the art of managing worldviews in order to help equip actors with new tools to work through challenges and infuse technology entrepreneurship with a unique Kenyan character. Chapter 13, âDeveloping Strategies to Harness the Power of Parallel Entrepreneurship in Africa,â by Eskor John, identifies some of the most salient factors related to parallel entrepreneurshipâfactors that, if better understood and supported, have the potential to make a significant contribution to the transformation of Global South economies. It also explores the contextual factors contributing to the growth of entrepreneurship in Africa and the prevalence and implications of parallel entrepreneurship. It concludes with a number of recommendations on how to support and develop parallel entrepreneurship in other contexts and countries. The success of an enterprise depends on the ecosystem in which it operates. Leveraging primary and secondary sources, Chap. 14, âVenture Capital in East Africa: Is There a Right Model?,â by Stephen Gugu and Wilfred Mworia, seeks to establish if there a right model for venture capital in East Africa, concluding that the ideal model does not currently exist.

310,120,0.988,Online Hate Speech in The European Union : a Discourse-Analytic Perspective,"Tatsiana Chulitskaya In recent years, hate speech has become a recognised problem to be addressed at both the national and international level. Regulations of hate speech are âconnected with the use of words which are deliberately abusive and/or insulting and/or threatening and/or demeaning directed at members of vulnerable minorities, calculated to stir up hatred against themâ (Waldron 2012: 8â9). However, such regulations provoke extensive debates as to whether liberal democracy must take afï¬rmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of attacks. If it must, then what are the proper forms, and where are the limits of hate speech regulations? Herz and Molnar (2012) claim that in the West the maximalist idea of an offense-free society is shaped by the long-existing tradition of freedom of expression, which is embedded and practiced in mature democracies. But even there, the scope of hate speech laws should not be taken for granted and needs to remain in the focus of public reflection. For instance, in the past few decades, laws forbidding Holocaust denial have at times been criticised as controversial limitations on freedom of expression (Bleich 2011). In order to avoid such controversies, some authors claim that it is necessary for hate speech regulations to be developed on a case-by-case basis, rather than being entirely content-based (Hertz and Molnar 2012), since the domestic political context of an era needs to also be taken into account (Bleich 2011). This approach, that is, a case-by-case evaluation of hate speech instances while placing them in the current political context, seem extremely important for Lithuania. On the basis of the focus group interviews that we conducted following the common C.O.N.T.A.C.T. methodology,10 I will now briefly discuss how local participants, who are not only Lithuanian nationals, but also representatives of other nationalitiesâin particular, of the Russian-speaking minority, understand hate speech and where they stand in relation to the free speech debate. In our focus group discussions, hate speech was deï¬ned and characterised as the usage of speciï¬c words, expressions and intonation that targets human dignity (example 76), while reference was also made to stereotyping and having biased opinions (example 77). Apart from this, the perpetratorâs intention to cause harm through hate speech was particularly underlined (example 78), (76) When somebody tells you, that you are different and thatâs why you are worse than they are.

Fredric Wertham was an important force in the anti-comicsâ campaign. From 1948, he wrote critical pieces in magazines such as The Ladies Home Journal and Readers Digest (Bastiansen and Dahl 2003, 344). Seduction of the Innocent, his 1954 book, had âenormous inï¬uenceâ both in the US and Europe (Barker 1984a, 56â57). Reibman (2004, xi) characterizes Wertham as âa traditional left-wing European intellectual and product of the Enlightenment traditionâ; as a ï¬rst generation Jewish immigrant from Germany in the 1920s he ï¬nds it ironic that Wertham should be characterized as a âreactionary.â Yet, Werthamâs ferocious critique of comic books is yet another illustration that resistance to media and genres have come both from left and right. In later decades, Wertham has been criticized for both misrepresenting content (Barker 1984a) and fabricating evidence from clinical trials (Johnston 2013). Wertham himself, however, was frustrated that he did not get more support from science and academia. After a description of âJungle comicsâ which âspecialise in torture, bloodshed and lust in an exotic settingâ he sighs: Whenever I see a book like this in the hands of a little seven-year-old boy, his eyes glued to the printed page, I feel like a fool to have to prove that this kind of thing is not good mental nourishment for children! What is wrong with the prevailing ethics of educators and psychologists that they have silently permitted this kind of thing year after year . . . ? (31)"
137,292,0.988,Comparative Perspectives on Work-Life Balance and Gender Equality : Fathers on Leave Alone,"Fathersâ orientation toward employment seems to have changed and it was commonly expressed that work was now less important than actively participating in family life, also reported by Nordberg (2007). Felix (construction site manager, 32) said: âThings have a completely different meaning. The job is now just a necessary evil instead of my lifeâs calling.â In one important respect, menâs participation in paid employment did not change due to long leaves. All fathers who had completed leaves returned to full-time work and those still on leave planned to do so. An earlier study found that men who took at least 2 months of leave worked fewer hours, mainly through reducing earlier overtime (Duvander and Jans 2009). Despite working full-time afterward, several fathers mentioned making structural adjustments to help work become more compatible with family life. Some changes were major. Mats (group leader, 40) gave up a managerial position he was promoted to before his leave, upon realizing how much time the position took. âI remember when I made that decision, I told them no, I intend to concentrate on my children, and it was so heavenly nice when it was said, when they understood that I was seriousâ¦.â Other job changes were less dramatic, but designed to increase menâs flexibility to participate in childcare. Matthias (telecommunications advisor, 33) reported: âI think like this, âIf I travel to that meeting, how will it work out at home?â You have to think like that when you become a parent, you have a responsibilityâ¦.â Nils (researcher, 40) stated: âI work from home one day a week to be able to pick up and drop off [at preschool] that day.â Carlos (technical production manager, 42) leaves work early to pick up his child from preschool, âIt doesnât matter if I am sitting in a meeting with a super-important person, no, sorry.â Fathers also reported that they experienced negative consequences of leavetaking on their careers. While on leave, Carlosâs boss hired another person as technical manager, a position he thought would be his. Robert said he lost clients when on leave and had to build his base back up again. Noel (creative director, 37) said the kind of company he works at changes quickly ââ¦. I canât be half-time and at the same time be the creative directorâ¦such a person must be present. If you want to have a career perhaps you shouldnât follow my exampleâ (laughs). For some, their changed attitudes meant that career damage did not matter. Nils said: ââ¦if I hadnât had children and had I only prioritized my career â¦I perhaps would have gotten somewhere elseâ¦.. Who knows, I feel very good about this, I feel that I grew as a person because I took [leave].â Another theme from the interviews was that fathers felt that there were positive consequences of their leave-taking for their workplaces. Some claimed leave had made them more efficient when back at work. A few mentioned that leave-taking increased company recruitment. Patrik (production manager, 32) stated: âIt became an opportunity to circulate people and recruit new ones.â A few discussed how being on leave affected their management style, enhancing other menâs opportunities to be at home. Filip (district store manager, 32) reported: âI emphasize [to my employees]â¦ âStay home, we will manage, we will survive. We wonât go under just because you are at home, this will be super important for you.ââ"
51,269,0.988,How Generations Remember,"she grew up on the outskirts of Mostar in a village setting, she does not identify herself as an urban Mostarian. It was interesting to hear that for her, not the rural people but the urbanites have spoilt Mostar. Minela finds the way the urban population looks down on rural newcomers unacceptable, especially given the fact that the latter have defended Mostar with their lives and made it possible for the pre-war urban population to return to their hometown. Indeed, she blames those who refer to themselves as pravi Mostarci for the decay of the city as well as of moral values. For her, rural people are much more civilised (kulturniji) than the urbanites. She pointed out that in the villages surrounding Mostar the streets are cleaner, the gardens are better looked after and that generally villagers care to keep their properties tidier. This attitude in Minela is closely connected to a value system that, besides tidiness, includes respect for others, acknowledgement of authority (especially of children towards adults) as well as social responsibility. The decay of this value system she ascribes not only to the urban population but also to a general trend that came with the war or, to be more precise, with the end of the war. In contrast to Aida, who only mourns her lost home and does not attribute any good qualities to the life that came thereafter, Minela does seeâ although on a rather abstract levelâpositive developments that came with the break-up of Yugoslavia, especially in regard to the awakening of Bosniak national identity. When Minela talks about her Bosniak identity she does so with pride. In contrast to Aida, a central part of being Bosniak for Minela is to be a practising Muslim.3 For her and her family, religion became very important during the war and has played a crucial role for them ever since. âThere was only God who could save youâ, Minela told me. God was important in order to survive this time, she said, and praying gave her family some of the comfort they so needed. Today, Minelaâs family fasts during the season of Ramazan and Minela does not show much understanding for those who do not. She does not Minela is member of the Bosniak nationalist party SDA. Her father had taken it into his hands to register his daughter soon after the SDA was founded. Since then Minela always carries her membership card with her in her purse. Although Minela shows respect for the early SDA when Alija IzetbegoviÄ was president, she is critical of the current SDA leadership. In the general elections in 2006 she therefore decided to give her vote to SBiH (Stranka za BiH, more liberal and multinational than SDA, although still clearly dominated by Bosniaks)."
72,346,0.988,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"The direction A consequence of the maximalist understanding of the movement is that its initiatives and experiments should exemplify and foreshadow a direction for society. The movement need not and should not commit itself to a single programme for any of the societies in which the innovators act, much less to a shared worldwide programme. The innovators must nevertheless have a direction. Their direction can result only from the path that they propose for society. Each group of participants in the movement must therefore struggle to see the social experiments that it tries to develop as the foreshadowing of such a direction. And each such direction must be defined, tentatively, by a dialectic between the innovations in practical arrangements"
17,13,0.988,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"and on being able to control or possess it (âgetting itâ). Thus these metaphors presuppose a static âbankingâ model, interpreting understanding as the acquisition, ownership or possession of knowledge (Sfard 1998). But secondly, there is an ideological assumption that understanding a concept or skill is better, deeper and more valuable than simply being able to use or perform it successfully. Skemp (1976) distinguished ârelational understandingâ from âinstrumental understandingâ, and posited the superiority of the former. However his co-originator of the distinction Mellin-Olsen (1981) used it to distinguish the modes of thinking of academic students from that of apprentices, thus bringing in a social context and even a social class dimension to the distinction, and imposing less of an implicit received valuation. If we want to assert the superiority of relational understanding over instrumental understanding it needs to be done on the basis of a reasoned argument, and not taken for granted as obvious. Skempâs own argument was based on the psychology of schemata, based on Piagetian theories, but this have been challenged by a number of alternate theories of learning including socio-cultural theory and social constructivism, drawing on Vygotskyâs theory of learning. According to Vygotsky knowledge is not something that the learner possesses but is a competence inferred from the learnerâs manifested ability to complete a task, either unaided, or, with the help of a more capable other, in what is termed the learnerâs zone of proximal development. Given current challenges to the underlying theories of learning, the assumption that relational understanding is superior stands in need of justiï¬cation. Some scholars have challenged the unquestioned pre-eminence of relational understanding. Hossain et al. (2013) question the accepted good of the related notion of âunderstanding mathematics in-depthâ because, as they show, its role in the identity work of some student-teachers is troubling to them.1 for example, one student teacher with the pseudonym Lola experiences a conflict between the imposed good of relational understanding, when studying England, and her own success within the norms of instrumental understanding that she internalized in her Nigerian upbringing (Ernest in press). Others have challenged the uncritical promotion of understanding within the mathematics education community because of its incoherence. Llewellyn (2010) questions âunderstandingâ partly because of slippage in the use of the term so that it encompasses both its relational and instrumental forms. However, her deeper critique is that in use it carries with a whole host of problematic assumptions about who can own âunderstandingâ in terms of ability, gender, race, class. Understanding is produced as hierarchical, particularly in relation to gender, social class and ability. It belongs to the privileged few, the ânaturallyâ able, which are often boys (another unhelpful and unnecessary classiï¬cation). To suggest that girls have a âquest for understandingâ is over simplistic and gendered and in the ï¬rst instance we should unpack how each version of understanding is constructed. â¦ Finally I suggest that student teachers In later work Skemp (1982) refers to instrumental understanding as âsurfaceâ and relational understanding as âdeepâ understanding, thus preï¬guring the depth metaphor in the more recently coined term âunderstanding mathematics in-depthâ."
356,167,0.988,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Functional and Non-functional Requirements Based on our user story as well as an analysis of the educational context led us to the identification of the following requirements. Although somewhat controversial (Glinz 2007), we distinguish them between functional and non-functional requirements. The identified problem was translated into high-level functional requirements using the user story format (Cohn 2004): âAs a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>â: â¢ As a Learning Designer, I want to create new Learning Designs and publish these so that they can give inspiration to Teachers. â¢ As a Learning Designer or Teacher, I want to find innovative Learning Designs and create a personal copy so that I can edit them to suit my needs. â¢ As a Learning Designer, I want to publish Learning Designs I have adapted or created to a shared space so that I can share my best practices. â¢ As a Teacher, I want to easily find a Learning Activity Design and together with its required Learning Resources at a central place, so that I can make these Learning Resources available to my Learners when conducting the Learning Activity. â¢ As a Teacher, I want to take advantage of other Teacherâs assessment of Learning Designs so that I can easier find highly relevant ones that actually work in practice. Beyond the functional requirements the key non-functional requirement Interoperability was identified. In order to support the exchange of Learning Designs beyond system boundaries the systems involved need to be interoperable. Interoperability indicates the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged (IEEE 1991). Interoperability research distinguishes between interoperability on the object, referring to a proper use of the information providedâand interoperability in the communication, referring to an agreed communication protocol between systems (Van Assche et al.). These two aspects of interoperability translated into the requirement to make learning designsâincluding their resourcesâre-useable in different technical contexts as well as the requirement to agree on communication protocols between the various system components."
386,145,0.988,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"5.1 Producer Perspectives Philosophers, particularly if coming from a Marxist tradition, repeatedly emphasized that our social existence determines our consciousness. Thus, it will be useful to begin with a reflection on the social existence of farmers. What distinguishes traditions in farming from traditions in non-agricultural backgrounds? And how do the actual situations in current farming systems shift? Affected parties usually have a different perception than parties not affected by a system. Thus, Sect. 5.1.2 will deal with empirical studies concerned with the self-understanding of farmers."
48,42,0.988,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"The mean value takes into account how far away extreme observations are, since a value that is 14 hours more than the balance point has the same weight as 14 values that are one hour less than the balance point. In contrast, to find the median value, one just has to count the observations and ensure that as many observations are above as below it. Research suggests that we tend to underestimate the mean value when presented with a right-skewed distribution, such as the distribution in Fig. 3.1 [9], and when establishing the distribution from memory. If the mode and the median are easier to understand and to calculate and are more robust (less affected by outliers) than the mean, why do we want to determine the mean of an outcome distribution? The main reason for using the mean when predicting time is that the mean value minimizes the deviation between the sum of time predictions and the sum of the actual time usages. When we want to know the total time usage of a set of tasks or projects, that is, when we want to add time predictions, this property is crucial. It may be required, for example, when breaking down a project and summarizing time predictions of subtasks or when considering the overall potential for cost overrun of a set of projects. If, for example, we use the prediction of the most likely time usage to predict driving to work from home 10 times, the sum of these predictions is likely be too low to reflect the actual total time. If, on the other hand, we use the mean prediction, we would typically be more correct about the total time of driving 10 times. Similarly, if you are the chief executive officer of a large company and have four large projects running with most likely costs of $500 million each, you should not expect the total costs to be $2 billion but, most likely, substantially higher, given the right-skewness of most project cost distributions. We explain in more detail about why this is so and how to properly add time predictions later in this book. Table 3.3 summarizes the suitability of the most likely, median, and mean time prediction values, given different time prediction goals. You may have started wondering how we can know the time usage distributions, which is a prerequisite for even thinking about using the mode, median, and mean time usage as our time prediction. In some cases, we have highly relevant data about past time usage, perhaps for travel times or production times enabling such"
