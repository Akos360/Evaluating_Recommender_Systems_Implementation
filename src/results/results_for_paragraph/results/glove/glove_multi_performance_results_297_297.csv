MEXT sent it to the IAEA through diplomatic channels. Finally, after several reminders, the IAEA issued the corrigendum of Refs. [27, 29] in March 2013. Now I-eq for 134Cs has been corrected to 17 in Table 2 of [29]. Tables 15 and 16 have yet to be corrected; they should be 17 and 20 (1 digit), respectively."

The SRT was taken as the mean SNR in the pass band across the last eight sentences. In each sub-experiment, the SRT was measured for eight conditions presented in a pseudorandom order, which was rotated for successive listeners to counterbalance the effects of condition order and sentence lists, which were presented in a fixed sequence. Each target sentence was thus presented only once to every listener in the same order and, across a group of eight listeners, a complete rotation of conditions was achieved. In each experiment, listeners began the session with two practice runs, to get used to the task, followed by eight runs with break after four runs."

As Fig. 13a shows, the more VCPUs a VM has, the more it will be constrained by only having 1 GB of VRAM, while 9 GB of VRAM not even constrain a VM with 24 VCPUs. In line with this observation, Fig. 13b shows that the difference between the 7zip scores achieved by VMs with 1 and 9 GB of VRAM grows with the number of VCPUs. However, the score difference is rather moderate compared to the large difference in terms of RAM utilization. In particular, a VM with 24 VCPUs utilizes more than 5 GB of RAM, if available. This is five times as much, as a VM with 1 GB of VRAM utilizes. However, the 7zip scores achieved by these VMs only differ by 15%."

The game was implemented in the Python package pygame and modified as follows: 1. The current score, the options to restart, pause or quit and the preview of the next item were removed 2. If the blocks reached the top of the field, all blocks from the top half of the field were removed, as shown in Fig. 1b 3. The fast-drop function of the classic Tetris was disabled Modification 1 aimed to minimize eye movements caused by distracting objects on the screen. The purpose of modification 2 was to prevent the premature end of the game that normally occurs when the top of the field is reached, and modification 3 was implemented to compensate differences in the players performance and strategies, thus keeping the difficulty within one level constant across participants. The experiment was structured as follows: Each participant played a total of 9 games with 10 min each. Every game consisted of 10 consecutive 60-second blocks, of which each was assigned one of 10 predefined difficulty levels. In games 1, 4 and 7 the levels increased gradually with every block, while in the remaining games the assignment was randomly permuted. The difficulty of a level was defined by the itemsâ falling velocity: In level 1 the velocity was such that it required falling objects 10 s to reach the bottom of the game screen, while in level 10 this time was 2.5 s. The speed increase across levels was linear. A scoring system was implemented where the points for canceling a line are proportional to the level number and getting the field reduced takes points away. The score was presented to the player at the end of each game (Fig. 1c). To motivate an active participation in the game, the player with the highest score was rewarded a small price. Apart from that, participation in the experiment was voluntary and participants received no further compensation."

The first subchain could have VNFs with optional order, so a good planning of such functions in the final VNF-FG would impact the entire network performance. The second scenario (VNFR 2) follows the structure of a service chain used to split service paths where service providers enable content awareness. VNF 1 splits the traffic into two sub-flows through two outgoing links. On the one hand VNF 2 is disposed at the sub-flow of VNF 1 to process 60% of its outgoing traffic; on the other hand, VNF 3 is located at the second sub-flow of VNF 1 to process 40% of its outgoing traffic. VNF 4 has to be processed by both sub-flows and, subsequently, the final function of the VNFR is VNF 5. Finally, VFNR 3 is given for scenarios in the Gi Interface for mobile network environments. We define an scenario with seven VNFs disposed as follows: VNF 1 is the initial function to be performed, this function divides the incoming traffic into three sub-flows through three links with relative bandwidth demands of 20%, 40% and 40% respectively. VNF 2 depends on the first sub-flow while VNFs 3 and 4 depend on the second sub-flow and VNFs 5 and VNF 6 depend on the last sub-flow. Finally, Each sub-flow must to be processed by the terminal function VNF 7."

166,67,0.984,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"On the ground, it was decided that a home visit would be a last resort when unable to contact ego by telephone. Therefore, if there was no phone number and no reply after 2 weeks, the interviewer contacted the relevant commune (municipality) to find out whether ego was still living in the same place, had moved or had died. The communes and post offices (sometimes the priests also, and neighbors) proved to be very helpful throughout the data collection stage. Another source of coverage error appeared during the fieldwork. In Geneva, it happens that people have a postal box in the canton but in reality live in France, the former being their formal address, explaining why they were on the lists of inhabitants and were included in our sample. This comes from a law regarding civil servants that was abrogated some years ago, but the practice survived. In Valais, several persons have their formal residence in a chalet in the mountains while it is in fact a secondary residence. Usually this is for fiscal purposes. At the end, in 14.1 % of the 4105 files opened in Geneva and Valais, it was impossible to make contact with the person. For the five cantons altogether, 10 % of the files were in this situation, which is a bit less than the average proportion observed in European countries in the 2004 round of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement (De Luca and Peracchi 2005, 94). Those cases were costly in terms of management time. From the attribution of the contact sheet to the interviewer to the transfer of the complete interview to the headquarters, it took on average some 40 days for a full participation in the survey;"

Water injection to Unit 3 was resumed at 03:20 under critical conditions, when the water source was partly recovered by using an additional water supply, but water injection to Unit 1 was delayed. Water injection to Unit 1 and Unit 3 was again halted with the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3. Water injection to Unit 1 was eventually interrupted from 01:10 to 20:00. Meanwhile, almost the whole core of Unit 1 dropped down to the lower plenum and most of that part dropped further to the containment pedestal, according to the analysis. There are many unknown matters concerning the location of debris, and the final status of accident progression."

Among 101 cases in England outside London recorded in the sheriffsâ cravings, the mean interval was 10.71 days, although there was considerable variation around this (Fig. 2.4). The Berkshire assizes at which Abraham Tull and William Hawkins were condemned began on 7 March 1787 and they were executed and gibbeted on the 9thâonly two days later, or even one day if their case was not heard on the first day of the assize sitting. Thomas Colley, on the other hand, was tried at the Hertfordshire assizes beginning on 29 July 1751 but not executed and gibbeted until 24 August, nearly a month later. Delays of more than two weeks, however, are uncommon. Given that the start of assizes is likely to be before the date of conviction in many cases (assize sittings could take up to a week in this period), we can assume that the blacksmith would normally have a week or less to make a set of irons. It was necessary therefore to start on the construction of a gibbet and a set of irons as soon as possible after a sentence had been passed. Where possible, the condemned man was measured for his set of irons before execution, a harrowing experience.

As youâll see shortly, this arrangement allows the lights to display readable binary numbers. The input at the far right is an oscillator of some sort with a frequency of 1 Hertz, or one cycle per second. The period of this oscillatorâthe time required for one cycleâis 1 divided by the frequency, or 1 second. Every second that one-second oscillator goes from 0 to 1 and then back to 0. The outputs of each flip-flop are Q and Q, which are opposite values. If Q is 0, then Q is 1. Each of the flip-flops has its Q output connected to its D (or Data) input. When the Clock input transitions from 0 to 1, that D input becomes the Q output. When that Q output transitions from 0 to 1, it also changes the state of the next leftmost flip-flop. For the first flip-flop at the right, the Q output will be 0 for one second and 1 for the next second, turning the light off for a second and then on for a second. The period is two seconds, and the frequency has been divided in"

From a probability point of view, time series is a realisation of a collection of T random variables, {Y1 , Y2 , . . . , YT .} Time series may be needed to answer questions such as: â¢ What is the predicted number of visits in January 2004? â¢ What is the expected number of visits in February 2004 given that in January 2004 it was 4,100? â¢ Are the values of past time series independent of each other? Do the observations carry information about the next observations? The first two questions are about the moment (i.e. the expected value) of the time series at some time point, and the last question is about the correlation of the individual components of the time series at various time points. We use small letters to denote the realisations of Y1 , Y2 , . . . , YT , i.e. we write y1 , y2 , . . . , yT . They are also called observations, measured values or recorded values."

383,309,0.982,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"In this section, we bring more examples, introduce regular Markov chains, discuss the interpretation of the long-run distribution, and introduce irregular and aperiodic Markov chains. We will also discuss one example of a Markov chain that does not live in time, but rather in space (e.g., a land). Example: Cyril going to work. A man either drives his car or catches a train to work each day. Suppose he never goes by train two days in a row; but if he drives to work, then the next day he is just as likely to drive again as he is to travel by train. Before his first day of work he needed to go to his new workplace to bring all his paperwork, for that the man tossed a fair die and drove to the workplace if a 6 appeared. The state space of the system (i.e. the list of all the states) is train, drive or simply t, d. Questions: 1. Now, the probability that the system changes from state t to state d in exactly 2 steps? 2. What is the probability that the system changes from state t to state d in exactly 4 steps? 3. What is the probability that on the fourth working day, the man is driving to work? This is another example of a Markov chain since the outcome on any day depends only on what happened the previous day. This can be summarised in Table 4.4 and visualised on a one-step transition diagram in Figure 4.4. The one-step transition matrix of this Markov chain is: 0 1 P= 1 1"

However, ORCA needs to work under fine-grained concurrency, whereby several actors may be executing concurrently, each of them executing a behaviour, or sending or receiving a message, or collecting garbage. With fine-grained concurrency, and with the preliminary definitions of AMC and OMC, the invariants are no longer preserved. In fact, they need never hold! Example: Consider Fig. 4, and assume that actor Î±1 was executing Receiving. Then, at line 7 and before popping the message off the queue, we have LRC(Ï5 ) = 2, FRC(Ï5 ) = 1, AMCp (Ï5 ) = 1, where AMCp ( ) stands for the preliminary definition of AMC; thus I4 holds. After popping and before updating the RC for Ï5 , i.e. between lines 9 and 11, we have AMCp (Ï5 ) = 0âthus I4 is broken. At first sight, this might not seem a big problem, because the update of RC at line 12 will set LRC(Ï5 ) = 1, and thus restore I4 . However, if there was another message containing Ï5 in Î±2 âs queue, and consider a snapshot where Î±2 had just finished line 8 and Î±1 had just finished line 12, then the update of Î±1 âs RC will not restore I4 . The reason for this problem is, that with the preliminary definition AMCp ( ), upon popping at line 8, the AMC is decremented in one atomic step for all objects accessible from the message, while the RC is updated later on (at line 12 or line 14), and one object at a time. In other words, the updates to AMC and LRC are not in sync. Instead, we give the full definition of AMC so, that AMC is in sync LRC; namely it is not affected by popping the message, and is reduced one object at a time once we reach program counter line 15. Similarly, because updating the RCâs takes place in a separate step from the removal of the ORCA-message from its queue, we refine the definition of OMC: Definition 11 (Auxiliary Counters for AMC, and OMC) AMCrcv C (Î¹) â¡ #{Î± | Î±.stC = RECEIVE â§ 9 â¤ Î±.pcC â§ Î¹ â Î±.ws\CurrAddrRcv C (Î±)} {Î¹10 } if Î±.pcC = 15 CurrAddrRcv C (Î±) â¡ otherwise"

85,25,0.982,Bayesian Methods in the Search for MH370,"The detailed chronological factual statement of known information about flight MH370 is given at [35]. A brief summary is given here sufficient to put the analysis in the rest of the book in context. On 7 March 2014 at 16:42, flight MH370 departed from KL bound for Beijing; this is marked as event 1 in Fig. 2.1. Initially, everything about the flight proceeded as normal. The Mode S transponder system on-board the aircraft was responding as expected to interrogation from the ATC Secondary Surveillance Radar up to the time when it was lost on the ATC radar screen at 17:21:13, marked as event 4. No message was received from the aircraft to report a system failure. Similarly the on-board Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) reported as expected at 17:07:29, this event is marked as 2 in Fig. 2.1. This message contained a collation of six reports generated at five minute intervals by the system from 16:41:43 until 17:06:43. These reports contained information about the aircraft position and motion such as latitude, longitude, altitude, air temperature, air speed, wind direction, wind speed, and true heading. The ACARS position reports are scheduled to be transmitted at thirty minute intervals during cruise. The next scheduled report at 17:37 was not received. The last recorded radio transmission with the crew of MH370 occurred at 17:19:30 as the aircraft was instructed to contact Vietnamese ATC on leaving the Malaysian Flight Information Region. This communication is marked as event 3. At 17:39:06 Vietnamese ATC contacted KL ATC to query the whereabouts of MH370, who initiated the efforts of several countriesâ ATC to establish the location, without success. Malaysian military radars were subsequently able to show primary radar returns associated with MH370 deviating from the flight plan almost immediately after the loss of Secondary Surveillance Radar at 17:21:13 by making a left turn to end up travelling in a South Westerly direction. Radar returns show the aircraft travelling back across Malaysia before turning near Penang Island and travelling in a North Westerly direction up the Straits of Malacca. The final primary radar return was recorded at 18:22:12, which is marked as event 5 in Fig. 2.1."

In both cases, the storage volumes in each season are limited to discrete values 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20. Tables 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18 and 4.19 show the values obtained from solving the recursive equations for 10 successive seasons or stages (2.5 years). Each table represents a stage or season t, beginning with Table 4.10 at t = 4 and the number of remaining seasons n = 1. The data in each table are obtained from Tables 4.7 and 4.9. The last two columns of each table represent the best release and ï¬nal storage volume decision(s) associated with the state (initial storage volume and inflow). Note that the policy deï¬ning the release or ï¬nal storage for each discrete initial storage volume in season t = 3 in Table 4.12 is the same as in Table 4.16, and similarly for season t = 4 in Tables 4.13 and 4.17, and for season t = 1 in Tables 4.14 and 4.18, and ï¬nally for season t = 2 in Tables 4.15 and 4.19. The policy differs over each state, and over each different season, but not from year to year for any speciï¬ed state and season. This indicates we have reached a steady-state policy. If we kept on computing the release and ï¬nal storage policies for preceding seasons, we would get the same policy as that found for the same season in the following year. The policy is dependent on the stateâthe initial storage volume in this caseâand on the season t,"

At some other school where the disease has already spread, it was observed that in the beginning of a day there were 40 susceptibles and 8 infected, while the numbers were 30 and 18, respectively, 24 hours later.

These graphs are just straight lines between the values at times ti D it as computed by the program. We observe that S reduces as I and R grows. After about 30 days everyone has become ill and recovered again. We can experiment with Ë and to see whether we get an outbreak of the disease or not. Imagine that a âwash your handsâ campaign was successful and that the other school in this case experienced a reduction of Ë by a factor of 5.

This recognition caused the two-year interval between Delft (1924) and Zurich (1926). The second deviation was caused by WWII. In 1938, in Cambridge, USA, during the V Congress, it was announced that the city designated for the VI Congress in 1942 was Paris. This was impossible, and the ï¬rst opportunity to hold a congress in Paris was 1946. There was, thus, an eight year hiatus. This again caused a conflict with ICM. So another exception was made, and the VII ICTAM was held in London in 1948. There were thus two, two-year shortenings and one four-year expansion. Since the VII ICTAM Congress in London, all congresses have been on schedule as if the three âdeviationsâ had not occurred. The length of the congresses varied between ï¬ve and eight days. Most of them started on a Sunday or Monday. The longest congress, held in Istanbul, lasted eight days. It started on Wednesday and included the weekend (to the delight of the participants). Quite a few later senior engineering scientists who were in Istanbul in 1952 were graduate students or young faculty members at the time. The majority of the congresses were held in late summer. There were two exceptions: the ï¬rst Delft Congress was held on 17â26 April, and the Cambridge UK Congress was held between 3 and 9 July."

A few weeks later at the 2001 Lepton-Photon conference, Belle announced their result sin 2Ï1 = 0.99Â±0.14(stat)Â±0.06(syst), a 6Ï deviation from the CP conserving solution. These BABAR (Aubert, 2001e) and Belle (Abe, 2001g) results were published as back-to-back articles in the August 27, 2001 issue of Physical Review Letters. The Belle and BABAR central values straddled predictions based on the KM model â and they were consistent with each other. Together the B Factory results clearly established the existence of CP violation in the B meson system. More details of these and subsequent measurements of Ï1 = Î² can be found in Chapter 17.6. 1.5.2 The premature end of BABAR data taking As a result of budgetary decisions within the US, data taking with BABAR was curtailed and the experiment stopped running in 2008. However, the BABAR management, supported by SLAC, was able to work with the funding agency representatives in order to ensure that a series of planned special runs at center-of-mass energies away from the Î¥ (4S) would be allowed to go ahead before the shut-down. As a result BABAR accumulated data at the Î¥ (3S) and Î¥ (2S), and performed an energy scan above the Î¥ (4S). The most signiï¬cant result from these runs was the discovery of the Î·b , the long-sought-after ground state of the bb system (Section 18.4). The measurement of the ratio of hadrons to di-lepton pairs can be used to obtain a precision determination of the b quark mass as discussed in the same section. 1.5.3 The ï¬nal Belle data taking runs The ï¬nal beam abort ceremony of KEKB/Belle took place at KEK on June 30, 2010. The last data taking period was devoted mainly to an energy scan around the Î¥ (5S), collecting more than 21 fbâ1 of data (see Section 3.2 for details on data taking). The end of Belle data taking was triggered by two considerations. First, Belle accumulated data in excess of 1 abâ1 in accordance with the plan put forward before the start of operation. Second, it was time to start work on the upgrade of the facility, both the accelerator (to SuperKEKB) and the detector (to Belle II)."

The large facility in Falkenhagen had a planned budget of ca. 44 million reichsmarks,34 of which 380,000 reichsmarks had been spent by January 1944. The planned start date was âmid-1945.â These anticipated costs for the sarin plant contrast starkly with the cost value of the Falkenhagen N-Stoff factory reported on March 31,1944.35 At that time it was more than 61 million reichsmarks. This recalls the mismanagement in the production of infantry munitions, whose production in 1939â40 was reduced in the middle of the war at one third (Preuss and Eitelberg 2010, 185â89). The involvement of IG Farbenindustrie AG is also evident in the draft agreement of June 13, 1944, between the German Reich (ofï¬ce of the army), the Verwertungs gesellschaft fÃ¼r Montanindustrie GmbH, IG Farbenindustrie AG, and Monturon GmbH concerning the expansion of the N-Stoff plant of the OKH by adding a fabrication facility to produce 500 metric tons monthly of sarin.36 According to that contract, IG Farben was also supposed to determine how the N-Stoff plant with provisional capacity of 10 to 15 metric tons monthly could be put into operation. Precisely a year after the deadline for preparations to transfer the Falkenhagen factory to Monturon, matters took an astonishing turn. On July 23, 1944, the building inspector Glupe (Wa F), who was responsible for the opening of the N-Stoff plant, arrived in the company of SS ofï¬cers and handed Monturonâs management a letter from the brigade leader Dr. Otto Schwab (head of the technical ofï¬ce in the main ofï¬ce of the SS leadership) (SS-FÃ¼hrungs-Hauptamt) that read as follows: With reference to the order, known to you, from the FÃ¼hrer and head of OKH 1731/44 of July 7, 1944, you are hereby informed that the FÃ¼hrer also ordered that the N-Stoff factory be taken over immediately by the Waffen SS. The agreements between the Heeres-Waffenamt and IG Farben are to be annulled effective immediately and measures already undertaken reversed. [â¦] Its seamless transfer [â¦] is the responsibility of the current head of the factory, Dr. Glupe.37"

As for example, in Ireland Section 1 of the 2012 Autism Bill amended the definition of disability in the Employment Equality Act 1998 to include reference to autism; Section 2 introduced similar provision in the Equal Status Act 2000. Similarly, North Ireland the Autism Act 2011 amended Schedule 1 to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (c. 50) with the same objective.

Second, the HI simulator was used to modify the stimuli to simulate the hearing of two 80 year old listeners, one with average hearing for an 80 year old and one with a complete loss of compression. There was also a normal-hearing control condition in which the level was reduced a fixed 30 dB. In the first stage, nonsense words were composed by choosing the second syllable at random from the 50 Japanese syllables presented without parentheses in Table 1. This is the list of syllables (57-S) recommended by the Japanese Audiological Society (2003) for use in clinical studies to facilitate comparison of behavioural data across studies. The first and third syllables in the words were then selected at random from the full set of 62 syllables in Table 1.

165,194,0.981,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"To illustrate selected points from the preceding discussion, I compare four integration-promoting exchanges for a hypothetical city that is populated by only White and Black households and has an overall proportion White of 0.50. For simplicity, I assume all areas are the same size and are populated with 100 households. Under these assumptions, relative impact of an exchange on S is strictly determined by the impact the exchange has on the White-Black difference in segregationrelevant average contact with Whites (p) for the 200 households residing in the two areas involved in the exchange.8 For the purposes of this discussion I will designate this difference with the Greek letter lambda (Î») and express it in percentage form (instead of as proportions) for ease of presentation and discussion. Figure 7.2 presents results for two pairs of hypothetical exchanges. The first panel summarizes results for a pair of integration-promoting exchanges that involve areas on opposite sides of P, one above parity and the other below parity. The second panel summarizes results for a pair of integration-promoting exchanges that involve two areas that are not above parity. I begin by discussing the pair of exchanges in the first panel. The first exchange shown involves two areas that are highly polarized on racial composition. The first area (Area 1) is an all-White area with 100 White and 0 Black households. The second area (Area 2) is all-Black area with 0 White and 100 Black households. The integration-promoting exchange moves a White household from Area 1 (higher p) to Area 2 (lower p) and a Black household from Area 2 (lower p) to Area 1 (higher p). Following the exchange, Area 1 has 99 White households and 1 Black household and Area 2 has 1 White household and 99 Black households. The integration-promoting exchange could be imagined as two âpioneeringâ residential moves. For example, the exchange could involve the moves of a âpioneeringâ Black household and a âgentrifyingâ White household. The pioneering Black household leaves a predominantly Black neighborhood and moves to a pre8"

Finally, if the available amount of money is not sufï¬cient for winning at least 60 electoral votes in places from the set A3, the candidateâs team should determine potential âdonors.â These âdonorsâ can be from the set of states A1, where the funds needed for campaigning in states from the set A3 can be raised. The team should recalculate the schedule of visits of the candidate for the remaining part of the campaign. Once the amount of money needed to campaign in states from the âvictoriousâ combination of states from the sets A1 and A3 has been raised, the team should recalculate the allocation of all the available resources. Proceeding from the data for the 15 states forming the set A3, one can be certain that, for instance, a combination of the following 7 states is âvictoriousâ for the candidate, since these states govern 60 electoral votes combined. Moreover, the available amount of money ($51 million) allows the candidate to campaign and succeed in winning at least 60 electoral votes in states from the set A3.

80,414,0.98,Innovations in Quantitative Risk Management (Volume 99.0),"4 Results 4.1 Assumptions The stochastic valuation model described in the previous section is applied to a portfolio of participating contracts. For simplicity, we assume that all policyholders are 40 years old at inception of the contract and mortality is based on the German standard mortality table (DAV 2008 T). We do not consider surrender. Furthermore, we assume annual charges ct that are typical in the German market consisting of annual administration charges Î²Â· P throughout the contractâs lifetime, and acquisition charges Î± Â· T Â· P, which are equally distributed over the first 5 years of the contract. Hence, ct = Î² Â· P + Î± T 5Â·P Â½tâ{0,...,4} . Furthermore, we assume that expenses coincide with the charges. Product parameters are given in Tables 2 and 3. Stochastic projections are performed for a portfolio that was built up in the past 20 years (i.e., before t = 0) based on 1,000 new policies per year. Hence, we have a 15 Cf. Oechslin et al.

371,85,0.98,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"For example, if we look at the UK (see Chap. 10), according to the AIRE about 16,000 Italians registered through the local consulates in 2013, but if we consider how many Italians obtained a national insurance number (NIN) in the same year, a mandatory document that allows to work in the UK, then the figure rises to about 44,000. In 2013 the numbers of NIN allocated to Italians was 66 % higher than in the previous year, the largest increase since data is available. The annual inflow of registration is four times higher than its pre-crisis levels. Over 80 % of the Italian that were allocated a NIN in 2013 were below 34 years old. Forty-two percent were aged between 18 and 24, The NIN data, though, incorporate also Italians only by passport, that never actually lived in Italy, mostly Latin Americans of Italian descent that use the Italian nationality to enter the EU labour market freely (Tintori 2011). According to the UK census of 2011, in fact, nearly 10 % of the UK residents holding an Italian passport were born in Latin America. Moreover, the NIN registration is mandatory for temporary and seasonal work too and it is valid for life. Therefore the numbers cannot be used to assume the actual stock of Italians living in the UK and do not tell us much about the length of their stay. On the other side, the NIN registrations do not include Italian people that are not working in the country and yet live there. In Germany the stock of Italians increased in 2013 at its fastest rate since the 1970s. Over 80 % of Italians (excluding students) living in Germany in 2012 had a degree in secondary/higher education. According to Swiss national statistics the inflow of Italian immigrants was at its peak in 1983, when it reached 12,000 people, it was below 7000 people per year in the decade to 2006, but then it jumped again and reached a record high in 2013 with over 13,000 Italian immigrants.

0,271,0.98,Library and Information Sciences : Trends and Research,"Issues in Collection Development As already mentioned, many universities introduced teaching and research programs on East Asia in the post-World War II years, and new East Asian collections came to be established at those institutions. The collection development needs of these newly established libraries were somewhat different from those at the older libraries. The newer ones had to start from the ground up while the older ones, having already established core collections of the basic materials, had the advantage of being able to concentrate on current publications. Building a new East Asian collection where there was none presented a daunting challenge, even when there was adequate financial support, as was the case in the 1960s. The problem was that there simply were not that many sources of supply of older publications needed by the new collections, particularly in Chinese, which was what most of the newly established collections were concentrating on. Nor was the procurement of current Chinese publications an easy task. The volume of publications from the Peopleâs Republic of China at that time was limited, and the Chinese government did not allow direct purchases by foreign libraries. Every book had to be acquired in Hong Kong or Japan. The number of new publications in Taiwan was also small, and the publishers did not aggressively engage in export. A number of them were busily engaged in reprinting block-print editions of centuries ago, exactly what was needed Edwin G.

It turns out that Definition 2 is a generalization of Definition 1, and they are equivalent in the system of Siek and Taha [22]. However, more generally, Definition 2 is compatible with polymorphic types. Proposition 1 (Generalization of Consistent Subtyping) â Definition 2 subsumes Definition 1. â Definition 1 is equivalent to Definition 2 in the system of Siek and Taha [22]."
389,245,0.98,Impacts of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident on Fish and Fishing Grounds,"As expected, the Cs concentrations in the fish from the 2009 and 2010 yearclasses varied widely, from 4.8 to 100.2 (0.68â2.00, log transformed) and from 1.3 to 118.8 (0.11â2.07, log transformed) Bq/kg-wet, respectively (Fig. 11.3). There were some sporadic outliers (that is, fish with Cs concentrations outside the values predicted by linear regression Â± 2 SD). Except for these outliers, the Cs concentrations of each 2009 and 2010 year-class showed a decreasing tendency. In contrast, the Cs concentrations in the fish from the 2011 and 2012 year-classes were less than 10 (1.0 log transformed) Bq/kg-wet, and there were no outliers (that is, concentrations more than 2 SD from the mean). The Cs concentrations in fish from these year-classes between 644 and 841 days after the accident decreased in the order 2009 > 2010 > 2011 = 2012 year-class (SteelâDwass test; p < 0.05). Differences in Cs concentrations among the year-classes were likely the result of differing exposures to the highly contaminated environment during the first few months after the accident at the different ages (Fig. 11.4a). Japanese flounder switch from eating mysids during the first year of life to eating bait fish as they age. Therefore, fish from the 2009 year-class experienced the accident when they were 1 year and 9 months old, at which point they were feeding on bait fish. Fish in the 2010 year-class were only 9 months old at the time of the accident, and most of them were inhabiting shallow areas (<20 m deep) and feeding on mysids until summer 2011, at which point they shifted to feeding on bait fish. Fish in the 2011 yearclass were not born until 4 months after the accident. The Cs concentrations in fish caught during the period from December 2012 to June 2013 (644â841 days after the accident) from different year-classes are plotted against TL in Fig. 11.4b; the plot shows clear differences between the 2010 and 2011 year-classes, even in the same size range (344â420 mm TL; U test, p < 0.01).

The initial spike in charging (around 10000 s into the simulation) is due to the initially driving EVs falling below the 20% lower threshold and requiring a charge. You can then see that after around 20000 s, the system reaches a steady state with around 70% driving, 20% charging and 10% idle.

Here, the side ij means the jth side of the polygon i or the side j of the polygon i. We assume that each symbol ij has a lexicographical number. In an example shown in Fig. 6.6, the lexicographical number increases in the order of 11 , . . . , 13 , 21 , . . . , 24 , 31 , . . . , 34 , 41 , . . . , 44 , 51 , . . . , 53 . In general, we deï¬ne that ij < mn when i < m, and ij < ik when j < k. We call the polygon 1 the partial polyhedron 1 (Fig. 6.7a). By glueing the side 21 (the side 1 of the polygon 2) to the side 11 of the partial polyhedron 1, we obtain a structure illustrated in Fig. 6.7b, which we call the partial polyhedron 2. Here, we introduce a term âdangling sideâ. The dangling side is a side that is not glued to another side. In the example of Fig. 6.8, the sides 12 , 13 , 22 , 23 , and 24 are the dangling sides. We call the dangling side with the smallest ID the s-side. In the example of Fig. 6.8, the dangling side 12 is the s-side. By glueing the side 31 (the side 1 of the polygon 3) to the s-side 12 of the partial polyhedron 2, we obtain a structure illustrated in Fig. 6.9. When a vertex contributed by two dangling sides are contributed by three polyhedra, we call that vertex an illegal vertex. In Fig. 6.9, the illegal vertex is indicated by an open circle. Every vertex of a simple polyhedron is contributed by three polygons. If we proceed decoding with leaving the illegal vertex, then the number of polygons that contribute to that vertex can increase to four, ï¬ve, six, . . ., and we cannot construct a simple polyhedron. Therefore, when an illegal vertex is generated, we rectify it by glueing together the dangling sides contributing to it as illustrated in Fig. 6.10. As a result, the illegal vertex is removed. We call the structure thus obtained the partial polyhedron 3."

18,49,0.98,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"After the SBO, RCIC of Unit 2 was functioning. However, until about 10:00 on March 14, more than 3 h earlier than the RCIC stop time, the water level of the RPV was decreasing and the pressure of RPV was increasing. It is believed that this trend shows that RCIC was losing its core-cooling capability. At the central control room, operators tried to rapidly depressurize RPV by opening the safety relief valves, and it was only possible after 5 to 6 h because of the delay for preparing batteries. The reason of this delay was the immediate chaos caused by the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3, resulting in much time needed to prepare the large amount of batteries. When the depressurization was initiated by opening the safety valves, the RPV water level was almost half of the core. The water level then reached to the bottom of the core, resulting in the loss of water in the core region. As shown in Fig. 3.5, the increase of D/W pressure initiated after about 19:00 on March 14, and it showed almost the same value as the RPV pressure, which indicates the occurrence of the RPV failure. After the RPV pressure and D/W pressure increased with values similar to each other, they remained at the high values of 0.6 to 0.7 MPa for more than 7 h, which is much higher than the design pressure (0.427 MPa). Around this time, FPs in the RPV were released into D/W, which is indicated by the rapidly increased dose rate in D/W (Fig. 3.5). Through the flanges, hatches, airlocks, and penetrations with gaskets degraded by the high temperature and high pressure of the containment, hydrogen and volatile fission products, such as iodine, and cesium, were released to the reactor building, a similar phenomenon as the hydrogen explosion process in Units 1 and 3. It is believed that the opening"

Rosneft has invested USD 5 billion in Vankor; production started in 2009 (Gan 2015). Vankor will send 70 per cent of its oil through the ESPO pipeline. There was little discussion of foreign investment in Vankor until September 2014, when Putin suggested during a meeting with Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Zhang Gaoli that the Chinese take part in the project. Two months later, Rosneft and CNPC signed a memorandum of intention on the sale of a 10 per cent share of Vankor. However, the parties were unable to turn the memorandum into an agreement (Motoharu 2016). Instead, in March 2016 Rosneft signed a deal with Indian companies on the sale of 23.9 per cent of Vankor (Rosneft 2016). Through this purchase, the Indian companies gained seats on the Board of Directors, while Rosneft retained a majority stake in the project. During the rest of 2016, Rosneft and the Indian companies negotiated further sale of Vankor shares, potentially bringing the Indian stake up to 49.9 per cent (Sputnik 2016) (Table 6.5). Summing Up the Four Projects The four major projects examined here do not indicate any significant change in Chinese involvement in the Russian energy sector after the Ukraine crisis. In three of them, discussions on Chinese involvement started well before the crisis. The exception is the Vankor project, but it ultimately did not result in Chinese investment. It may be that finalization of the Power of Siberia deal was accelerated due to the Ukraine crisis, but also this was something that had been planned and negotiated intensively"

ZupanÄiÄ and Arbeiter (2016, 1060) write that, in comparison, the First Gulf War (1991) which started around the same time as the beginning of the dissolution of Yugoslavia and lasted for 17 days, has been portrayed as a âshort and flawless operationâ. However, the number of victims in the First Gulf War, which is at least half the total number of war victims killed in the wars in former Yugoslavia, was created in 17 days only. The pace of brutality is thus hardly comparable. Moreover, the media forgot about the fact the Vietnam War resulted in 3 million deaths of Vietnamese people. Nevertheless, the journalist did not stop short of depicting the wars in the 1990s in former Yugoslavia as a consequence of the âancient hateâ and âbrutality of the Balkans peopleâ."

308,126,0.979,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Fundamentals of Islamic Jurisprudence (Usul al Fiqh) All the laws (ahkam = plural of hokom) of Islam are built on the sources of Qurâan, Sunnah. The scholars of Islam if they reach a consensus on a certain point, then it is called ijma and becomes an important source. However, ijma is built on a text of the Qurâan or Sunnah, which may be evident or implied. There are many other sources of different Islamic Schools that we will discuss here after a quick explanation about the Qurâan and Sunnah. 1. The Glorious Qurâan: The literal word of God, revealed to Muhammad (PBUH) by the Archangel Gabriel which continued for 23 years (lunar) intermittently from the month of Ramadhan (July 609 CE) when Muhammad (PBUH) reached the age of 40 when he was meditating in the Cave of Hira in a mountain of Makkah (now called Jabel al Noor) until a few months before his death. The ï¬rst verse (aya) and Surah was Iqra (Recite/Read) âRead! In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from Alaqah (morsel that clings to the womb) and your Lord is the Most Generous, Who has taught (the writing) by the pen [the ï¬rst person to write was Prophet Idrees (Enoch)], Has taught man that which he knew not.â (Q. 96:1â5) When the Qurâan was collected and compounded this Surah AlAlaq is Chapter (Surah) 96 in the Qurâan. It is not put in chronological order; the arrangement of the verses (ayas) and chapters (Surahs) were done according to the orders of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself, which were directed by the Archangel Gabriel. The last verse is Surah Al-Maâida 5:3: âToday I have perfected your religion for you, and I have completed my blessings upon you, and I have approved Islam for your religion.â Some Scholars of Islam quote Surah 2 Al-Baqarah/Aya 281, as the last aya (verse) of the Holy Qurâan, âAnd fear a day wherein you shall be returned to Allah, and every soul shall be paid in full what it has earned, and they shall not be treated unjustly.â More than half of the Qurâan (19/30) was revealed in Makkah during the ï¬rst 13 years. The rest (11/30) was revealed in Medina in the last 10 years of the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The Qurâan revealed in Makkah were usually short Surahs (chapters) that stressed the dogma of monotheism, the life after death, the Day of Judgment, the salient fundamentals of Islam, while the Qurâan revealed in Medina came in long chapters (Surahs), e.g., AlBaqarah, AlImran, AlNisa, AlMaâida, and so forth.

Two cases involving women who had killed their fathersâthe prosecutions of Mary Blandy and Elizabeth Jeffriesâhad exploded into public view late in 1751.149 Both came to trial in March 1752 accompanied by a huge wave of publicity 150 and this included detailed reports highlighting the judgesâ comments at Blandyâs trial, which pointed out that, unlike females who had murdered their master or their husbandâwho could be burned at the stake for petty treasonâthese two women could only be hanged.151 This was followed on the day of Jeffriesâ trial by reports suggesting that âa clause be inserted in the Bill, to prevent the horrid crime of murder, whereby parricide and some other species of murder, will be made Petit Treasonâ.152 Neither this proposal to extend the use of burning at the stake, nor those involving breaking on the wheel or treating murder as high treason were eventually adopted by Parliament. In the Commons between the 5th and 18th of March the Bill ran rapidly through ï¬rst and second readings, through a committee of the whole house where several (unfortunately unrecorded) amendments were made, through its third reading and on to the Lords.153 There it was ordered to be considered by a committee of the whole house, the vital role of the judges at this point being highlighted by the speciï¬c request that âthe Judges in Town do then attendâ.154 While the bill was in the Lords the panic about the prevalence of murder in the metropolis was further fuelled by the reports in many newspapers that a further six murderers had been convicted at the Old Bailey and were to be executed on the Monday the 23rd, and by observations that this was not just a metropolitan phenomenon, since there were âno less than 40 prisoners under conï¬nement in several goals in this Kingdom for the horrid crime of murderâ.155 At this point reports of one ï¬nal âproposalâ appeared in a range of newspapers. The edition of the tri-weekly London Evening Post covering the period 21stâ24th March, for example, reported at length that âfor the better preventing the crime of murder it is proposed that all persons who shall be found guilty of willful murder, be executed on the next day â¦ and also that"

The steel of the magnet ï¬ux return is ï¬nely segmented into 18 plates of increasing thickness: from 2 cm for the nine inner plates to 10 cm for the outermost ones. When data taking started, the BABAR IFR was instrumented with more than 800 RPCs, organized in 19 layers in the barrel region (divided itself into six sextants) and 18 in the end doors. These detectors quickly showed serious aging problems (Anulli, 2002, 2003; Piccolo, 2002, 2003) and the deterioration of their performance lead directly to a reduction of the BABAR muon identiï¬cation capability. Overall, 6-17% of the muons were lost due to problems in the IFR. Although several attempts were made to ï¬x the RPCs and to limit the rate of degradation, it was ï¬nally decided to replace most of these detectors. This was by far the largest BABAR upgrade and it was successfully completed in a 4-year period in various steps. The RPCs in the backward end cap were never replaced. Due to the boost, they had low rates and covered a small solid angle. In 2002, more than 200 new RPCs were installed in the forward end cap (Anulli, 2005a). Their performance was signiï¬cantly improved with respect to the original RPCs (Anulli, 2005b). These detectors nevertheless required constant maintenance and upgrades (Band, 2006; Ferroni, 2009) until the end of the data taking, in order to maintain their eï¬ciency and their reliability while the luminosity was increasing. In particular, the chambers with the highest rates were operated in avalanche mode from 2006. The ï¬rst two barrel sextants were replaced during the summer 2004 shutdown, only one and a half years after the decision to proceed with this upgrade had been taken. An extensive review process lead to the choice of the Limited Streamer Tube (LST) (Andreotti, 2003) technology"
