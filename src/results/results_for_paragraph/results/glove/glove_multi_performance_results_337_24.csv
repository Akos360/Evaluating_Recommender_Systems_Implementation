170,282,0.996,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"1 Introduction Information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects are not implemented in a vacuum. Rather, ICT4D interventions can potentially influence the existing socioculturalâtechnical systems. In turn, the systems themselves can influence the evolution and adoption of the technology. Scholars have emphasised that human agency and technology have a bidirectional relationship and that evolution of technological intervention depends upon the interaction between human agency and technology (Orlikowski 1992). The interaction between human agency and technology is determined by institutional forces. âInstitutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interactionâ (North 1990: p. 3). The institutional perspective is opportune in highlighting the socioculturalâtechnical aspects of the ICT4D interventions. Introduction of an ICT4D initiative juxtaposes two different institutional systems, that of the project designers and implementers and of project users. The outcome of the project is then determined by the evolution of this institutional dualism (Heeks and Santos 2007). Previous research has highlighted the importance of sociocultural factors as critical determinants for realisation of benefits from ICT usage (Chib et al. 2008; Miscione 2007; Walsham et al. 2007). The holistic assessment of impact of ICT4D initiatives, however, needs deliberation on how the ICT4D initiatives shape the existing institutional systems and how the institutional systems shape the technology usage and adaption. Scholars have called for research on the interaction of technology itself with specific aspects of social, economic, and cultural contexts (Walsham et al. 2007: p. 323). While most of the assessment frameworks used to measure the impact of ICT4D projects highlight the economic aspects of âimpactâ (such as in Arul Chibâs introductory chapter and Kathleen Diga and Julianâs May chapter later in this book), the institutional perspective is opportune in assessing the softer aspects of impact of ICT4D initiatives, such as the behavioural, cultural and social dimensions of the impact (Heeks and Molla 2009).

273,185,0.996,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"GEC research is a whole new area; there is neither mature research model or methodology, nor existing research contents for reference. Therefore, such researches need to first summarize the related previous researches and then extend the research with more contents and innovation in methodology. GEC is a cross-discipline research involving multiple areas of environmental economics, biology, economics and sociology, which are intricately interrelated; at the same time, we need to rationally define and objectively evaluate GEC, and make innovations in methodology. In this way, we can thoroughly explore the inherent essence of GEC and reveal the laws of GEC evolution. For such a complicated research subject, it requires clear organization and correct research approach, strictly following the designed technical roadmap (See Fig. 5.1) to ensure satisfaction of research standards and quality. In terms of contents, through substantial literature review and reference to theories about environmentology, economics and management science, the significance and necessity of GEC research is profoundly discussed from different angles; the key contents of this research is to construct the GEC theory system based on the results of previous international researches. Particularly, as a new research area, how to define the term of GEC and how to summarize the characteristics, component factors and motive power of GEC, are the focus and challenge of this study. As to evaluation methodology, competitiveness research canât be done in separation with evaluation, which requires construction of scientific and objective evaluation model. Any evaluation model and method shows certain degree of subjectivity and orientation, and the contents reflected by such subjectivity and orientation might have certain guiding effect on the development and formation of the evaluated target. GEC evaluation model not only borrows and applies the mainstream methodology for international competitiveness study, but also shows unique features related to the"
222,86,0.996,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"The approach adopted in this research to understanding povertyenvironment linkages is novel in four key ways. First, it takes an integrated, systems approach that considers interactions, feedbacks and trade-offs, which is missing in most analyses (Dempsey and Robertson 2012). Second, the research considers many different epistemic approaches including the consideration of poverty-environment linkages from multiple methodological and theoretical standpoints (Nicholls et al. 2016). Some of these are integrated within the modelling framework, while others provide richness and understanding to the findings. Third, the analysis is future oriented. It is not sufficient to understand present ecological determinants of well-being, without understanding the capacity for these systems or services to continue to generate wellbeing into the future under various political, social-economic and environmental scenarios. Finally, the outcome of the analysis is not an answer to a single question, but rather a process which provides key insights concerning associative and causal linkages that have the potential to untangle and answer a wide range of questions on poverty and the environment (Chap. 28). The research also describes a range of plausible future trajectories derived in a participatory manner. Hence, while the individual components of the analysis are interesting, the integration of these components is ground-breakingâfor example, the integration of social differentiation in rural settlements with biophysical outputs to model poverty through time based on changes in the natural environment."
198,489,0.995,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"14.5.3 Strengthening Human Behavior Elements of Participatory Action Research Participatory action research (PAR) is an approach to research in communities that strongly recognizes the importance of participation and action. It seeks to understand the world by trying to change it, collaboratively and following reflection. This approach appears consistent with research focusing on adaptation of agriculture to meet challenges posed by climate change and enhance food security. However, to increase the relevance of this approach specifically in the context of climate change, adjustment of action research aspects is required, including research designs, implementation of actions, data collection and analysis methods, reporting and learning. In the research designs it is essential to include both biophysical and behavioral components, and equal attention should be paid to activities that will influence biophysical and behavior components during implementation of the actions. The data used to evaluate success of adaptation research actions should also include biophysical and behavioral indicators, or parameters. Thus, robust conceptualization of the data collection and analysis procedures is required at the start of the participatory action research to ensure that the collected data are properly analyzed and reported, and that lessons are drawn for learning by the PAR stakeholders and other scientific communities."
169,629,0.995,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"They can be divided into qualitative and quantitative methods, both involving direct and indirect consultative methods (Fig. 21.3). Oteros-Rozas et al. (2014), for instance, describe a sociocultural valuation approach of ES that investigates peopleâs perceptions of the importance of ES in a cultural landscape. There are several other creative ideas from different researchers regarding nonmonetary assessment approaches. For instance, GarcÃ­a-Llorente et al. (2016) suggest that to analyze the social support for biodiversity conservation activities and the related delivery of ES, one calculates the willingness to give up time. Kumar and Kumar (2008) point to the need of considering psychological and sociological aspects in ecosystem service valuation. They argue that there is a need for approaches that combine natural and social science research."
72,52,0.995,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"relevant to contemporary social innovation policy and discussions about the diffusion of social innovations. Another approach to researching social innovation, exemplified in Chapter 2, is the use of comparative historical case studies. McGowan and Westley introduce a theoretical and methodological framework based on three propositions: first, that new social phenomena create the opportunity for changes to social relations and structures by enabling glimpses into the âadjacent possibleâ; second, that agentsâ behaviour and roles within social innovation can be divided into three categories â poets, debaters and designers â whose efforts are complementary; and finally, that to achieve broad, lasting change, the innovation in question must cross multiple scales â from the niche (micro) level to the (macro) landscape level. The authors explore these frameworks through a case study on the emergence of the intelligence test. This illustrates the three elements within the authorsâ theoretical framework and also shows how social innovation is culturally contingent. The ideas that inspired the development of the intelligence test, such as Social Darwinism, are now widely viewed as profoundly perverse. In 2011, the Centre de recherche sur les innovations sociales (Center for Research on Social Innovations â CRISES) started to build a database of social innovations. In Chapter 3, Bouchard et al. examine the uses and the challenges of building such a database. Since research on social innovation is generally conducted through case studies, it is difficult to carry out macro-sociological analysis of the social transformations that accompany these innovations, and results cannot be generalised. The database of social innovations aims to fill this gap and to enable the longitudinal, sectoral and spatial analysis of social innovation in the context of Quebec. The process of building a database represents an innovative approach to the research of social innovation, and the authors point to a number of methodological, theoretical and epistemological challenges associated with such a task. Part II explores some of the ways in which social innovations reconfigure relations between civil society, the state and the market. Indeed, the boundaries between these sectors are becoming increasingly porous and one of the striking features of social innovations is their ability to combine the traditionally disparate logics of the private, public and civil society sectors. In Chapter 4, Jenson examines some of the varied meanings of the âquasi-conceptâ of social innovation, and argues that one of its major contributions is to provide a novel way to reorganise market relations in the post-neoliberal world. The âwelfare diamondâ is a heuristic device"
347,280,0.995,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"practices need to adapt to new ways of giving, using and implementing various sorts of advice. This shift towards EAM is furthermore in line with the EUâs general principles of âgood governanceâ (COM 2001: 10) applied in various marine policies such as the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), aiming for a âbroad involvement of stakeholders at all stages of the policy from conception to implementationâ (EC 2002: 6). Our study analyses the problems and challenges faced when a traditional conceptualisation of science-policy interfaces, such as the âideal causal chainâ model, is applied to different cases of environmental governance in the Baltic Sea and suggests ways in which associated problems and challenges might be countered. Applying the EAM concept, with its aspirations to achieve sustainable use of ecosystems in line with place-based requirements and sensitivities of the socioecological system (cf. BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016), opens new opportunities for a more holistic approach to understand and design science-policy interfaces by taking both the natural system (represented via science) and the social system (sociopolitical aspects) into account (cf. Gilek et al. 2015). The widening perspective of EAM could hence contribute to avoiding some of the traditional pitfalls of narrowly assigned science-based management systems. One of these pitfalls is the strongly sector-based marine environmental governance of the Baltic Sea that is studied here. Furthermore, all our case studies present strongly politicised domains of environmental governance (albeit with case-specific differences), where the boundaries between science and policy are continuously blurred and often debated. This implies that political and cultural values heavily influence scientific processes while science on the other hand strongly influences policy developments. This phenomenon is described as the âco-production of science and policyâ (Jasanoff 2004; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998) and highlights key questions about the roles and responsibilities of different actors such as scientists (and the science system) and other relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the interplay between assessment and management. In this âco-producedâ context, new and developed institutional structures and processes of interaction could act as âboundary organisationsâ between science and policy that make environmental problems governable. As Lidskog (2014:3) states: âBy negotiating and renegotiating the boundaries between science and policy, environmental problems and their possible solutions are co-produced. Both science and policy are mobilised in order to solve a specific environmental problemâ."
77,21,0.995,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Investigation of the life course is a progressive research programme that raises new encompassing questions which require the development of new methods, such as large-scale social surveys that include the collection of biomedical data (Blane et al. 2013). However such projects raise ethical issues and public concerns that can impede their developments, as illustrated by the failure of the Swiss Etiological Study of Adjustment and Mental Health (SESAM) (Kummer 2011). Next to challenges associated with work in interdisciplinary teams that bring together social and biological scientists, statistical expertise is required to analyse longitudinal data, adding another layer of complexity. Important questions arise around the empirical analysis of the theoretical models. In this volume, Bell and Jones underline the perils of modelling age, period and cohort effects and propose a theory driven approach to conceptualise these effects. In a chapter combining a methodological discussion and empirical results, Hoekstra and Twisk compare the contributions of latent class growth models and mixed models to the analysis of health trajectories. Ghisletta et al. also examine the advantages and limitations of different statistical models, namely linear mixed-effects models and structural equation models. While life course epidemiology remains centred on the analysis of quantitative data, we consider that qualitative data are also needed to improve our understanding of health trajectories. Meanings associated with transitions and social hierarchies, expectations of successive cohorts of elderly people ageing in better health conditions are important elements in the complex experience of health. As initiated with work on lay views on health inequalities (Davidson et al. 2006; Popay et al. 1998), data from in-depth individual or collective interviews can inform on mechanisms that relate social and physiological aspects of individual life courses. Qualitative data collected with people suffering from specific conditions are needed to understand their trajectories and their interpretations of biological and social vulnerability."

These are âimplementation of new climate diagnostic products, multiple talks and articles for non-scientific audiences, and various tailor-made instructional efforts (e.g., workshops on the fundamentals of decision-making)â. The participants of the projects agree that the intense interdisciplinary collaboration, especially with the involvement of stakeholders (transdisciplinary approach, to be described below), can be very demanding and energyconsuming, starting with the common formulation of a problem, choosing crossdisciplinary methods to be used in research, formation of a team and others. The obstacles stem from differences in âstyles of thought, research traditions, techniques and languageâ of involved actors. However, despite the difficulties, the interdisciplinary approach facilitates in keeping a systemic view and looking at problems from a range of perspectives. moreâhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j. envsci.2012.07.008. Finally, transdisciplinarity broadens a researchâs scope into another study dimension as beside the orientation towards real-life problems; this approach also seeks to integrate lay or non-academic knowledge with scientific one. This understanding is expressed in the definition of Lang et al. (2012, p. 27) where âtransdisciplinarity is a reflexive, integrative, method-driven scientific principle aiming at the solution or transition of societal problems and concurrently of related scientific problems by differentiating and integrating knowledge from various scientific and societal bodies of knowledgeâ."
170,30,0.994,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"three overlapping areasâthe political context, the scientific evidence and the links between policy and research communitiesâand external context as the factors which will need to be accounted for if research is contribution to the way that policymakers and practitioners work. Echoing the importance of political context, OrdÃ³Ã±ez (2015) in the chapter âA new set of questions: ICT4D research and policyâ suggests that there is an overemphasis on demonstrating the link between ICT and development. She claims that researchers have neglected other important areas such as understanding the relationship between policies, politics and research. She proposes that three distinct streams of academic inquiryâpolicy studies, the interface between research and policy and the conceptualization of ICT4D researchâare required to understand the motivations of policymakers and the complexity of the political context. By doing so, researchers will be in a better position to set new agendas and offer effective solutions in the context of ICT4D. The RAPID framework suggests that the influence of policy on research is dependent upon the quality of empirical evidence offered, and as such, quality research can potentially lead to solutions to policy problems. Harris (2015) in the chapter âThe impact of research on development policy and practice: This much we knowâ. A Literature Review and the Implications for ICT4Dâ makes a counterargument that since most of research content revolves solely around academic impact, quality rarely leads to policy changes. This review of the impact of research on development policy and practice reports that information society impact research in the Global South has almost exclusively focused on the impact of ICTs without taking into account the socio-economic impact of research itself. Harris proposes that in order to reduce the disparity between research and practice, researchers ought to interact with stakeholders at varying levels to ensure that the research addresses real-world problems with the goal of producing tangible outputs, an argument echoed by others (Datta 2012). Datta (2012) disaggregates some of RAPIDâs elements, finding that traditional approaches to communicating research to policymakers are inadequate. For better deliberative engagement, Datta emphasises that clarification is required during selection of stakeholders, in choosing when to engage in either downstream (topdown) or upstream (bottom-up) engagement and during the selection of appropriate methods of engagement. One example of a public engagement processes using ICTs is provided by Steibel and Estevez (2015) in their chapter âDesigning Web 2.0 tools for online public consultationâ. These scholars found that the amalgamation of the different functions of Web 2.0 tools influences certain attributes of the political communication environment. These scholars studied two virtual public consultation spaces in Brazil using three theoretical models of online democratic communication and concluded that the design of the ICT platform would have a great influence on the publicâs political deliberation and discourse. As the policy formation actors have diversified and newer channels a created, thereby making bottom-up approaches more possible, Datta suggests that the tradi-"

The research reported here builds on those principles, striving to make the science as useful and salient as well as practical. Hence, stakeholders help to shape and identify problem definition, scenario development and results assessment and interpretation. This gives a strong sense of ownership of the research in Bangladesh. Integration is also embedded from the start, and the construction of an integrated model is a key aim and outcome of the project. This model aims to couple a range of biophysical processes together with household livelihood information derived from the analysis of census and detailed household survey results. The coupled nature of the integrated model is unusual if not unique as the influence of biophysical changes on livelihoods and human well-being are calculated directly. As this research developed so the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BanDuDeltAS 2014) emerged as a key policy process which informed this research. It defined issues such as timescales of analysis, a main focus to 2050 but broader interest in possible biophysical trends to 2100. It also defined possible development interventions, such as the benefits of the proposed Ganges Barrage which is designed to increase dry season flows into the study area."
347,278,0.994,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The five cases of environmental governance studied in this project have been identified as key large-scale environmental problems and risks in the Baltic Sea (see Gilek et al. 2016; HELCOM 2010): fisheries, eutrophication, invasive alien species, chemical pollution and oil discharges linked to marine transportation. However, as revealed throughout the previous chapters, they differ substantially in terms of the complexity of risk sources, the available knowledge and the uncertainties connected to assessing environmental effects for advising decision-making, as well as with respect to the degrees of ambiguity and sociopolitical controversy involved in policy and management (Gilek et al. 2011). In this chapter, we investigate the interactions between risk assessment (science) and risk management (policy) in the five different cases. We analyse and compare these interactions using a theoretical framework on science-policy interfaces described in Sect. 8.2. Specifically, we study how organisational structures and processes of science-policy interactions adapt to key challenges of science and management in environmental governance by focusing on different forms of uncertainty, as well as on stakeholder conflicts and disagreements involved in science and/versus policy in the five cases. We also trace the respective management reactions to these challenges in each of the cases using a typology of different kinds of incomplete knowledge and their consequences for management responses as described below (Sect. 8.2.2). Through this comparative study of science-policy interfaces across the five cases, we point out institutional and procedural hindrances, challenges and prospects for improving science-policy interactions for a more effective and sustainable environmental governance of the Baltic Sea. Following the discussion on our theoretical framework, we present the results of our analysis of the five science-policy interfaces (Sect. 8.3). The two sections thereafter discuss the outcomes of the study (Sect. 8.4) and provide conclusions and recommendations (Sect. 8.5), respectively."
347,28,0.994,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Over the last few decades, the term âgovernanceâ and the specific topic of this book â âenvironmental governanceâ â have become prevalent in the social and environmental science literature (e.g. SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). The concept of governance, first established in public administration and taken up in political science, is used to depict a shift in responsibility from state to non-state actors (e.g. private or voluntary sectors) that affects structures and processes for collective action and decision-making (Stoker 1998). It emphasises social and political steering and acting in polycentric networks on different levels â local, regional, national, European and global (e.g. Delmas and Young 2009; Rosenau 2003; Wagner 2005). However, there is a great variation in how governance is defined and used. In other words, it refers more to a perspective than a coherent theory (e.g. Pierre and Peters 2000; Rhodes 1996). Our definition in this volume includes both structures â such as policy contexts, existing power relations among key actors, regulatory frameworks and organisational forms of decision-making, reflexivity and participation â and processes. Processes comprise aspects such as the evolution of organisations and interactions between, for instance, science and policy, as well as communication and interaction among policy-makers, scientists and other stakeholders. Processes also include the development of strategies, framings, communication and learning. In many respects, EAM shares with environmental governance an interest in similar core topics, e.g. multilevel and multi-sector institutional interactions, knowledge integration and stakeholder arrangements and partnerships (SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). In addition, it offers several additional focal areas and assumptions of value to the comprehensive analysis of environmental governance aimed for in this book. To begin with, there is a fundamental ecosystem-based focus in EAM that assumes that sustainable management of human activities and pressures can only be achieved if it is based on the sensitivity and complexity of the ecosystem in focus. In line with"

The perception of models differs between disciplines and between science and practice. Models range from semantic descriptions of assumed interrelations to computer based mathematical models; the term âmodelâ is often used for computer based models only. During recent decades, model-based prediction of biological responses to climate change has become a very active field of research. In the field of climate change modelling, models primarily enable understanding of global climate cycles. The development of models could demonstrate the impact of human activities on the earth climate system. Models serve to structure knowledge, to formulate hypotheses and to illustrate future developments. In the field of nature conservation management, the development of alternative scenarios is of special interest. Different management options may lead to different futures. Ex-ante assessment of the outcome of specific management measures in conjunction with different climate change impact scenarios may support management â but may also lead to deep frustration because of the high degree of uncertainty about future developments. Especially the necessary combination of different model types, such as climate models, vegetation models, and hydrological models, including all their underlying assumptions and uncertainties, renders it difficult for managers to identify useful options for decision making. Even though there have been extensive studies to model the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, the results are still sobering. In 2002 the IPCC found that âmost models of ecosystem changes are not well suited to projecting changes in regional biodiversityâ (IPCC 2002: 15). More and more authors have picked up this critical attitude towards the modelling of climate effects (e.g. Biesbroek et al. 2009; Opdam et al. 2009; Pyke et al. 2007). After a far-reaching survey of literature on conservation issues, Heller and Zavaleta (2009) concluded that âmany articles based on concrete modeling work or empirical studies of species responses to climate change tended either to not elaborate their results to management directives, or to present recommendations in vague terms such as, ârestoration should be consideredââ (Heller and Zavaleta 2009: 17). Therefore, Heller and Zavaleta highlighted the need to pay more attention of transferring modelling results into the decision context of management issues (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). This problem is not only limited to conservation management but to adaptation to climate change in general (Millner 2012). In this chapter we are describing concrete model approaches used to support decision-making within the HABIT-CHANGE project context. Facing climate change, climate impact models are currently seen as a big support for the development of alternative management scenarios. Handling uncertainties and understanding the âmodel cascadeâ will help in judging where models will supply useful information. A short overview of model approaches and their assumptions is presented as a basis for adaptive management and their benefits as well as limitations are discussed."

The micro model explicitly includes householdâs fixed effects to include unobserved heterogeneity among households into the structural labor market model. The approach is used to empirically analyze poverty and the distributional implications of Doha round scenarios in Brazil and poverty and the distributional implications of the Bolivian gas shock. Part II focuses on innovative quantitative models to evaluate evidence-based and participatory policy processes under CAADP. In particular, an eCGPE approach is theoretically derived and empirically applied to the CAADP reform process in Malawi. It is demonstrated how political performance and incentive gaps can be identified and quantitatively calculated using an eCGPE. This part opens with the presentation of the complete eCGPE framework by C. Henning (Chapter âModeling and Evaluation of Political Processes: A New Quantitative Approachâ). In particular, the theories used to develop an eCGPE, which includes an economic, a legislative decisionmaking, an interest mediation, and a political belief formation module, are explained. The other contributions of the section present findings from the empirical application of the framework to Malawiâs policy process. Chapters âA Network Based Approach to Evaluate Participatory Policy Processes: An Application to CAADP in Malawiâ and âThe Formation of Elite Communication Networks in Malawi: A Bayesian Econometric Approachâ focus on the findings from the political belief formation module. Applying social network theory and methods, they analyze collective political belief formation of governmental and non-governmental actors through communication learning in networks. C. Henning and E. Krampe (Chapter âA Network Based Approach to Evaluate Participatory Policy Processes: An Application to CAADP in Malawiâ) also develop an evaluation framework for participatory policy processes based on the political belief formation module. C. AÃmann, E. Krampe and C. Henning (Chapter âThe Formation of Elite Communication Networks in Malawi: A Bayesian Econometric Approachâ) test some theoretical hypotheses on the determinants of communication ties among key national stakeholder organizations, donors and central political actors. They apply an adaptation of the Bayesian estimation scheme for binary probit models, which can deal with missing values inevitably occurring within survey data. L. Seide, C. Henning, and S. Petri (Chapter âVoter Behavior and Government Performance in Malawi: An Application of a Probabilistic Voting Modelâ) present an analysis of voter behavior and its impact on governmental accountability and capture. They derive the implications of voter behavior on governmental accountability and capture using probabilistic voting theory. The final chapter of Part II is by C. Henning, J. Hedtrich, L.

347,33,0.993,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The interactions between the primarily science-based assessment sphere (i.e. generation of knowledge on environmental status, pressures, risks and problems) and the management sphere (i.e. decisions on and implementation of actions) have been described as key processes in environmental governance (Renn et al. 2011; Rice 2005). Science has since long been seen as the primary provider of knowledge and advice to guide environmental policy-making, especially in the case of managing environmental risks stemming from industrial technologies and pollutants (Karlsson et al. 2011). This has also been the case in the Baltic Sea region, both nationally and in relation to the activities of international organisations such as HELCOM and ICES (Udovyk and Gilek 2013). However, interactions over science-policy interfaces (e.g. connected with the evaluation of what constitutes good environmental status and unacceptable levels of risk) are usually complicated by severe challenges connected with complexity, ignorance, uncertainty and ambiguity (Renn 2008; Stirling 2007), which frequently result in controversy in both society and science on appropriate risk assessment and management. It has been argued that scientific uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements and conflicts are particularly problematic for marine environmental governance when implementing holistic management approaches such as EAM and MSP (Linke et al. 2014; Rice 2005; Wilson 2009). Observations of impaired public trust in science and recognition of other legitimate knowledge providers, such as practitioners, stakeholders and experts based elsewhere than in traditional research organisations, have also been linked to cases of severe scientific uncertainty (Irwin and Michael 2003), in combination with a common politicisation of science (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2010; Weingart 1999). In response, Stirling (2007)2 has argued that different types of environmental issues characterised by uncertainty and ambiguity require an expansion of traditional strategies in science and policy, to include precautionary and participative approaches. As a consequence, the relationship between science and policy is changing on both a theoretical and practical level, particularly with regard to complex environmental issues such as marine governance. It is, however, despite a long and Stirling (2007) differentiates between four types of scientific incertitude: risk (quantitative data and knowledge exist), uncertainty (qualitative understanding of outcome, but not probabilities), ambiguity (poor knowledge about potential outcome) and ignorance; see Linke et al.

264,849,0.993,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"Session 2 In this session, the scope of mathematical cognition was broadened to a situated process distributed over individuals and objects. Dor Abrahamson (University of Berkeley, USA), the invited keynote speaker, focused on the conceptualization of the mind as embodied, extended, and enactive activity in natural and sociocultural ecologies. He showed how studentsâ immersive hands-on dynamical experiences become formulated within semiotic registers typical of mathematical discourse. He presented analyses of integrated videography, action logging, and eye-tracking data from tutorâstudent clinical interviews using a technologically enabled embodied-interaction learning environment, the Mathematical Imagery Trainer for Proportion, to describe the emergence of mathematical concepts from the guided discovery of sensorimotor schemes. A central notion was the theoretical construct of attentional anchor. Abrahamson reconciled constructivist and sociocultural models by underscoring the role of artifacts and facilitation in the micro-events of mathematical ontogenesis. Anke Lindmeierâs (University of Kiel, Germany) presentation focused on structured representations for whole numbers. Such representations which have a long tradition in mathematics education are used to foster the formation of mental models and according speciï¬c strategies, so that fast, accurate, and flexible solutions for whole numbers tasks can be retrieved. However, evidence of how children actually use these strategies is rare. An eye-tracking experiment explored possibilities to assess strategies when working with structured representations. By comparing the strategies of ï¬rst-graders and mathematics proï¬cient adults in a basic whole number problem, and the strategies in different representations, she showed characteristic affordances of structurally equivalent representations. The study informs the further use of structured whole number representations and the potential of eye-tracking to infer studentsâ cognitive processes when working with these representations. Tine Degrandeâs (University of Leuven, Belgium) studied the extent to which children spontaneously focus on quantitative relations (SFOR), and the nature of this quantitative focus (types of quantitative relations that make up SFOR). Three different variants of a SFOR-task (multiplicative, additive or open task) were offered to second, fourth and sixth graders. Although most children focused on quantitative relations in the task, they focused not only on multiplicative relations but also on additive relations. SFOR. Multiplicative SFOR was found to increase with age whereas the evolution of additive SFOR depended on the task variant. The open SFOR-task was found to be best suited to capture SFOR. These results suggest further research on SFOR requires a broader conceptualization of quantitative relations than only multiplicative conceptualization."
72,72,0.993,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"certain observations were available; but it is not an inherent part of the theory (Ogburn, 1969, p. 139).5 Yet, these aspects of Ogburnâs theory â that could have formed the basis for a comprehensive theory of innovation â remained largely ignored in a wider theoretical context in which there was a one-sided focus on the relevance of technology for social change (Freeman, 1974; OECD, 1997). Only in recent years has a new understanding of the innovation process become more important, in which openness towards society is central (FORA, 2010, p. 15 ff.). Individual aspects of this development are reflected in terms and concepts such as âopen innovationâ, âcustomer and user integrationâ, â(innovation) networksâ, âmulti-stakeholder dialoguesâ and âthe new power of the citizenryâ (Marg et al., 2013). The development of ârobust design conceptsâ (Gross et al., 2005) and institutions that combine research and innovation with âpost-conventional forms of participationâ (Marg et al., 2013, p. 8) are explicitly the subject matter of, for example, transition management, transdisciplinary sustainability research, governance research and, particularly, network research (for example, Powell and Grodal, 2005). Thus, at the same time, social innovation has started to be seen as a type of innovation that is distinguishable from technological innovation with its own subject area, sphere of influence and field of application (Howaldt and Schwarz, 2010). However, it is not possible to define social innovations solely by referring to a distinct social sphere or to socially desirable outcomes as their key purpose (Rammert, 2010, p. 40). Rather, what is at issue is the substantive core of the innovation. With social innovations, the new does not manifest itself in the medium of technological artefacts, but at the level of social practices. If it is accepted that the invention and diffusion of the steam engine, the computer or the smartphone should be regarded differently from the invention and social spread of a national system of healthcare provision, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or a system of micro lending, then it stands to reason that there is an intrinsic difference between technological and social innovations. While it is true that all innovations, regardless of their object, can be viewed as a social phenomenon, this does not obviate the need empirically to research the commonalities and differences between these two types of innovation. Even if, in reality, both types closely connect with each other in socio-technological systems, the need for analytical distinction does not disappear. This is all the more urgent given that existing sociological innovation research, that has emanated"
72,129,0.993,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"by partnership governance, civil societyâs participation in the design and implementation of public policies, and the establishment of a plural, mixed, economy (Klein et al., 2013). This analysis would lead to a more in-depth understanding of the characteristics of this model, including its evolution over time, as well as the effects of social innovations on social transformation. Social innovation could even be examined with regard to its possible capacity to influence or transform the development model itself (Lipietz, 1989), and conversely, the effects of such a modified model on social innovation. It would also be possible to study regional innovation systems in the context of smaller territories or sector-based innovation systems (LÃ©vesque, 2011). There are many other possible lines of research that could be addressed by the CRISES Database on Social Innovation, including: â¢ To what extent does the state-institutional framework (public policy, governance schemes, etc.) influence the means â collective action and social innovations â used by organisations to respond to civil societyâs needs and aspirations? An answer to this question might be found in the analysis, for a given territorial context, of the relationships between the legal and regulatory framework in which organisations operate; the public policies and government programmes that apply to organisations; and the factors of emergence of social innovations, in particular the needs and aspirations leading to collective action. â¢ How does geographic proximity influence the development of social innovation clusters and which sectors of activity are the most conducive to the development of such clusters? â¢ To what extent do the different types of interactions between organisations have an influence on the development of certain types of social innovation? This pertains to the question of networking between organisations, and a network analysis calls for a spatiotemporal analysis of data. More concretely, the composition and structure of networks, as manifested in interactions, can be studied by means of visualisations and associated analytical methods. In fact, graphs are the most widely used theoretical tool for modelling and identification of properties of structured sets (Beauquier et al., 1992). They are essential to anyone wishing to study and represent a set of links between elements of a finite set of objects (Xuong, 1992). In the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, a detailed analysis of networks of organisations will be realised on the basis of spatiotemporal measurements of the density, eccentricity and centrality of"
245,676,0.993,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"courses are often called âhybridâ or âblended learningâ courses (Charlier et al. 2006a). Faced with these changes, actors can rarely call upon research that goes beyond feedback from experience, case studies or satisfaction surveys to guide their action (Deschryver 2008). However, existing research in educational technology, cognitive psychology, adult education and university education, if they are considered together, provide a potentially relevant theoretical and methodological framework to answer the two fundamental research questions: â¢ How do student characteristics and those of digital learning environments interact? â¢ What are the conï¬gurations emerging from these interactions that can lead to quality learning? These research questions reflect a systemic perspective in which human learning is part of a circular causality system between three sets of characteristics (Fig. 1): (1) relating to individual students, (2) relating to the digital learning environment, and (3) resulting from the interaction between the two. These so-called âprocessâ features generate learning outcomes (4) that in turn influence individual and environmental characteristics. This perspective reflects a circular (i.e. non-linear) systemic model of learning developed by social-cognitive learning theory (Bandura 1986); (Zimmerman 2002). This theory sets the act of learning in a system of reciprocal causality between personal characteristics (cognitive, emotional, and biological, i.e. unique to each learner) and environmental factors (organizational, human, cultural, material, etc.). Such circular causality models, now widely recognized in Adult Education (Cross 1981) and in higher education studies (Tinto 1975), (Biggs 2003), should necessarily guide research methods aimed at understanding the effects of digital learning environments (characterized and differentiated) on the learning of individuals. In what follows, we briefly summarize recent research results that could lay the foundations for this research."

A common analytical framework guided all five case studies ensuring the comparability of the cases, which were performed using similar research designs (cf. Gilek et al. 2011). All case studies employed an explorativeinterpretative approach of qualitative social research, and their results have been derived from three main sources: document analysis, semi-structured qualitative interviews and a series of round-table events. This allows us to draw conclusions about communicative aspects of environmental governance of BSR, whereas we will also when possible use the case of BSR to discuss regional and marine environmental governance more generally. In the next section, we will introduce our main theoretical perspectives that focus on risk communication in environmental governance, risk communication with and to the public and the role of the news media. We will then turn to our analysis of the empirical material and start with a discussion about existing institutional arrangements and procedures of risk communication and the forms of communication that can be identified. Thereafter we address the topic of risk communication with the public and how this communication can be understood and characterised with a special focus on arenas for communication and the role of the media. Finally, we conclude the chapter with a discussion on the role of public risk communication in (regional) environmental risk governance and possible ways forward."
223,40,0.993,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Conclusion The chapters in this volume illustrate the enormous breadth of the implications that the spatial dimension has for action, the production and dissemination of knowledge, the application and understanding of knowledge, and the generation of sociocultural and economic realities. They also reveal the large number of open or contested research questions to be answered by future research. For obvious reasons, action theory figures prominently in our introduction, but the work presented in the following pages indicates how many more theoretical concepts of various disciplines could contribute to improve the understanding of the relations between knowledge and space on various scales of analysis. From a geographical point of view, certain key questions are not discussed in this volume: How are epistemic authority and competencies construed and evaluated in nonwestern or acephalous societies in which individuality and rationality are secondary to collective values? In which way will new digital technologies change the organization and coordination of decision-making in complex organizations? To what extent will new digital technologies change communication, interaction, supervision, knowledge storage, and social-spatial relations? Will these changes"
245,691,0.993,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,6 Conclusion The state of the art and the co-authors of this chapter justify and demonstrate the feasibility of an ambitious research project to answer the following two questions: 1. How do student characteristics and those of digital learning environments interact? 2. What are the conï¬gurations emerging from these interactions that can lead to quality learning? The conceptual framework that will support the investigation is presented in the Fig. 2. Mixed methods longitudinal research realised with several HE Education programs will be necessary to answer to the research questions. We wonât develop here in details the methodological design.

222,72,0.993,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This book builds on insights from a multidisciplinary perspective on ecosystem services and their importance to human well-being and applies these ideas in deltas in an integrated manner to inform decision-making for poverty alleviation. There is, of course, a wide variety of approaches and unresolved questions and relationships between elements of wellbeing and the underlying ecosystem processes (Norgaard 2010; Pascual et al. 2017; Suich et al. 2015). But at their core, the key scientific issues relate to how ecosystems bring multiple benefits to society, both in material terms and through other pathways. The benefits from ecosystem services include those associated with direct economic use, with protecting health and mitigation of hazards. The book explores the issues outlined in this chapter in detail for delta environments in order to give context to the broad assessment of the sustainability of a range of possible future trajectories within deltas, focusing on both the biophysical processes of their productivity and the prospects for securing ecosystem services for poverty alleviation objectives. The following chapters also, for the first time, explore in a systematic manner how social processes such as migration, access and property rights, and social relations interact with ecosystem services to result in the distribution of well-being in deltas. The book highlights the leverage points for action on these mechanisms that have been uncovered through integrated modelling and an increased understanding of delta socialecological systems. Integration across diverse knowledge domains and model simulation is a key and novel aspect of the research, and as such the findings in this book, linking biophysical changes to human wellbeing within a coupled model framework. This allows the exploration of possible futures in a participatory and policy-relevant manner that can engage with national stakeholders."
282,20,0.993,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"2.1.2.2 Networks Networks are the subject of an impressive body of literature in anthropology, sociology, political science and economics. Naturally, these studies contain a broad variety of approaches, themes and focal points. When trying to establish how networks relate to partnerships, it is useful to distinguish three modes of network research: network analysis, network theories or models and networks as empirical phenomena. As an analytical approach, network analysis had an early precursor in the sociological work of Georg Simmel16 around the turn of the last century. It developed into a more widespread and coherent approach in sociology and anthropology17 in the 1970s and has further developed since. In essence, network analysis is an approach to social enquiry that focuses on the interactions between individuals or organisations. To understand certain dynamics or outcomes, it typically maps the links and exchanges between different actors, often using complex mathematical and statistical tools. Based on patterns of interaction or the position of different actors in the network, situations can be classified.18 In political science, policy network analysis is closely associated with the notion of âgovernanceâ.19 Governance theories and approaches often take the diminished capability of central government to govern using traditional methods as their point of departure20 and focus on ways of steering by political authorities.21 Over recent years, a vast body of literature discussing the concept of governance and applying network approaches to policy analysis has developed. Yet the cumulative insights derived from the governance debate seem limited and network analysis as an analytical approach has serious shortcomings.22 Moreover, a network approach is ill suited for achieving the purposes of the present enquiry, namely, to develop accountability standards for partnerships. Therefore, this study does not adopt a network approach to social analysis. Network theory, by contrast, is mainly concerned with explaining why networks emerge, how they operate and what impact they have on social interactions. An important source of network theory is transaction cost analysis. It posits that firms choose that organisational form which allows them to minimise their transaction costs in the production and marketing process. Thus they can either rely on the market, on hierarchies (i.e. the vertical integration of suppliers) or networks of known and trusted firms to secure needed inputs and sell their products.23 Unfortunately, ânetwork theoryâ does not constitute a coherent body of work24 generating a consistent set of assumptions and hypotheses. While some specific network theories may offer interesting insights relating to the emergence and operations of partnerships, they are unlikely to contribute much to the question of how accountable partnerships should be. Finally, the term ânetworkâ is used as an empirical category. Since the applications of network analysis and theories are extremely broad, so are the"
198,31,0.993,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Chapter 4 by Tonya Schuetz, Wiebke Fâ¬ orch, Philip Thornton and Ioannis Vasileiou from the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) describes the design of an impact pathway-based Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) system that combines classic indicators of process in research with innovative indicators of change. The chapter highlights the importance of engaging users of research in the development of impact pathways and continuously throughout the life of the program. Results show that partnerships with diverse actors such as the private sector and policy makers are key to achieving change. The chapter concludes that research alone is insufficient to bring about change. However, research does generate knowledge that stakeholders can put to use to generate development outcomes. Chapter 5 by Monika Egger Kissling and Roman Windisch, âLessons from taking stock on 12 years of Swiss international cooperation on climate changeâ highlights the challenges encountered and lessons learned from this assessment where a bilateral donor puts climate change lens on a longstanding development cooperation portfolio. The chapter discusses the need (1) for evaluators to put more effort in identifying best methodological practices amidst a large volume of information, diverse portfolio and absence of reliable data; (2) for practitioners to invest more in strategic project design and monitoring to provide accurate data; and (3) for policy makers to be cognizant of the value that evaluation brings, as it is an important tool that contributes to accountability. Chapter 6 by Michael Carbon discusses the approach, process and lessons from the evaluation of UNEPâs Climate Change Sub-programme. It shows the importance of developing an appropriate analytical framework that is well-suited for the scope and complexity of the object of evaluation, and how the Theory of Change approach helped make a credible assessment of UNEPâs contribution towards impact, sustainability and upscaling. Chapter 7 written by Aryanie Amellina focuses on an assessment of the initial phases of the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) in Indonesia. It highlights JCM governance and ease of use of methodologies related to measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). The author concludes with recommendations to strengthen methods to determine reference emissions and for clarifying ways to allocate credit among countries to define a pathway to a tradeable credit mechanism. Chapter 8 by Jyotsna Puri, âUsing mixed methods to assessing trade-offs between agricultural decisions and deforestationâ, demonstrates the importance of using qualitative and quantitative methods to assess and measure win-win development policies that also help mitigate climate change. The authorâs study explores the poverty and environment nexus using historical data on land rights and panel data on land use in Thailand. The chapter concludes that it is important to measure the differential effects of policies on different crops, agricultural intensity and agricultural frontier. In the case examined by the author, she advises that policies that encourage cultivation may not be detrimental to forest cover after all. Chapter 9 written by Aaron Zazueta and Neeraj Negi presents the methodological approach adopted in the evaluation of climate change mitigation projects supported by the Global Environment Facility in four emerging markets, namely"
273,78,0.993,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"GEC inherits and continues competitiveness theory; at the same time, it deepens the contents of competitiveness theory. First, ecological environment system is a complex dynamically changing system. It is influenced by not only the variables within the system, but also by external factors such as human social system and economic development level; and, these influences show nonlinear relation, which makes the evaluation of the absolute status of ecological environment very difficult, or even impossible. Competitiveness evaluation methodology puts emphasis on the evaluation of the relative and comparative ability of certain property of different matters by layer analysis, which means breaking down the various complex factors that influence such property, followed by analysis of each of them, and after adding weight, the comparative ability of this property of different matters will be obtained. Such feature of the evaluation suits well with the complexity and dynamic state of the system and therefore can appropriately evaluate the dynamic development of ecological environment in different regions. Secondly, GEC enriches and develops competitiveness theory. A review of the available literature shows that so far there has been not complete analysis on the connotation, mechanism formation, evaluation indicator system and projection methodology of GEC as a concept and neither there is complete analysis on the environmental competitiveness of different regions of the world. This study, therefore, will greatly enrich and develop the related competitiveness theory and analysis methodology."
170,119,0.993,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"Although some specific topics in these four categories might be of interest for specific policy processes, the categorisation and examples provided suggest that researchers do not include policy as a significant concern in their inquiry process. As the authors conclude, âtopics and issues in developing countries are normally deeply intertwined with issues of power, politics, donor dependencies, institutional arrangements, and inequities of all sorts. These are precisely the type of issues where critical work can open up the âblackboxâ as an aid to deepen understanding, and a stimulus to appropriate actionâ (Walsham and Sahay 2006: p. 13). Brown and Grant (2010) simplify Walsham and Sahayâs (2006) model by summarising it in two broad categories: ICT for development and ICT in developing countries. This categorisation and the survey of 184 articles in peer-reviewed journals conclude that there is an over-representation of research on the âICT in developing countriesâ rather than the âICT for developmentâ category. The authors identify that there is a mismatch between the goals of research questions and the expected goal of impacting development. Is it correct to assess research that is focused on understating technology within developing countries contexts by whether they create or promote more development even if that is not the way it is framed, the authors ask (Brown and Grant 2010). They expose the mismatch between the research questions and the public perception of what ICT4D should achieve. Brown and Grant (2010) thus support Heeksâ (2002, 2007) perspective of a disconnection between ICT4D and development studies from a more theoretical perspective. These classifications, however, do not include a perspective of policy as a vehicle or development or a clear category of work linked to political research questions. Another categorisation is Avgerouâs (2008) proposal that focuses on information systemsâ innovation in developing countries. She analyses the discourses behind ICT innovations in developing countries. She identifies three discourses. The first one assumes that the issue is âcatching upâ, which acknowledges a country divide must be bridged by the adoption of existing technologies from the developed world. A second discourse assumes that the issue is constructing new technologies for the different contexts. This suggests a view that technologies must be embedded in societies. The third discourse is concerned with creating the possibilities for technologies to become significant catalysts for change in the lives of people. One could argue that the first two discourses are related to what Brown and Grant (2010) called âICT in developing countriesâ and the third one is related to what they called âICT for development researchâ. One conclusion that Avgerou (2008) arrives at is that, in this field of research, there is rarely any engagement with macro-political analysis, a required aspect of inquiry especially when discussing the transformative power of ICTs. From the perspective of assessing ICT in development, Heeks (2009) constructs a model that links technologies with development through a chronological categorisation of issues: readiness, availability, uptake, and impact. He calls the first two fociâreadiness and availabilityâICT4D 1.0, the early agenda of infrastructure, digital divide, and supply of services. ICT4D 2.0 includes the other two categories: uptake and impact. He argues that this progression is necessary to reframe the"
222,265,0.993,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"systems-based approach of this scale is challenging but essential to the effective management of coastal Bangladesh and can be used to support the development of existing and future government plans including the Five-Year Plans, Vision 2021 and the Delta Plan 2100. Involving stakeholders is critical to the success of the scenario process, as well as improving the acceptance and validity of the model and creating ownership of the process. As such, the scenario workshops are a key component of the stakeholder engagement within the research. It is intended that the scenarios are adaptive and continue to be iterated as new data and knowledge becomes available. The scenario development processes highlighted a number of future challenges. Identifying trends in socio-economic processes with multiple interactions and dependencies is severely limited by the current capacity to understand and represent these processes, particularly in a quantitative way (Berkhout et al. 2002; Swart et al. 2004). This is further compounded by the range of scales considered, from international cooperation and macroeconomic issues through to individual and household behaviour. Despite an increasing number of studies adopting interdisciplinary scenario development down to the regional scale, the majority of these remain focused on a sub-set of future changes (e.g. flood riskâHall et al. 2005), water resources (Soboll et al. 2011) and land use change (Baker et al. 2004; Rounsevell et al. 2005; Audsley et al. 2006), with few addressing the extent of biophysical and socio-economic changes considered in this research. In particular, there is limited evaluation of socio-economic scenarios focusing on human wellbeing and poverty (LÃ¡zÃ¡r et al. 2015). This complexity creates a challenge for effective stakeholder engagement, requiring participants from multiple sectors with sufficient time to engage in the scenario process. The workshops identified that there was generally inadequate time in a single workshop to both sufficiently explain the overall context, as well as to allow stakeholders to discuss and respond to questions and invited feedback. Hence, multiple workshops and repeated engagement are critical to better engagement. Despite these challenges, continued engagement with stakeholders throughout the scenario process is successful in developing both qualitative and quantitative plausible futures. The process has assisted in promoting dialogue about the complex dynamics influencing changes in the natural and human environment and breaking down silos between those with different expertise."
49,252,0.993,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"The theoretical and practical framework that will be introduced here represents one of many possible approaches for identification of successful factors for DSS implementation. Its intention is to motivate the reader for further study and research. Theoretical foundations of DSS design consist of: â¢ Decision theory â includes descriptive and normative approaches. Understanding the nature of human-decision making (cognitive approach) in clinical setting makes the solid base to understand the challenges posed to DSS. Understanding the sources of errors in human judgment can prevent the possible design flaws in DSS. Large research tradition is also in rational reasoning and decision making based on developments in applied mathematics, statistics and computer science. Approach taken in [21] is based on cognitive view of rational decision making and logical inference resulting in derivation of conclusions from data and inference based on defensible norms. â¢ Process theory â includes formal representation and understanding of clinical processes and care plans. Majority of DSS are targeted towards individual points of care in a single point in time where alerts, reminders and decision are provided. It means that DSS developers concentrate on individual tasks rather than on the whole clinical processes which spread over time and are more complex. Research in BPM has concentrated on development of formal notations for modeling and automating the workflows but not on the integration of decision-making into the business processes. Clinical guidelines community had developed computational models that combine decision-making with clinical process modeling based on Task Network Models (TNMs) [24]. Intersection of BPM approach and DSS can be perceived in combining the TNM concept with Petri net formalisms [25] resulting in solid background for clinical workflows analyses. â¢ Knowledge theory â introduces formal representations of knowledge and provides overview of existing formalisms. We have already introduced some of the knowledge representation approaches in Section 2.2. Based on ongoing development in this domain it is not feasible to insist on any particular framework for knowledge representation. One of the promising approaches for medical data and knowledge representation will be semantically rich models â formal ontologies based on firstorder representation techniques (description logics). â¢ Organization theory â introduces agents (persons, information systems and other entities involved in clinical process), shared care and understanding of distributed organizations. From the historical point of view management of the patient was held locally either with single"
278,94,0.993,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Prospective IE models combine central features of the established IE methods into a new framework. They allow researchers to conduct comprehensive and dynamic scenario analyses of societyâs future metabolism and to study the potential systemwide effect of sustainable development strategies. The development of these models is motivated by the desire to study the coming socio-metabolic transition and to assess the different transformation strategies at full scale and with long-term scope, while maintaining the high level of detail and biophysical consistency that is a distinctive feature of industrial ecology methods. The intellectual framing that comes along with the prospective IE models provides a ânew slangâ for the field: It broadens the perspective of industrial ecology research because it gives impulses for the development of new and important research questions for further refinement and integration of assessment methods and for the development of a common, modelindependent database of socioeconomic metabolism. The recent development in industrial ecology methods necessitates a discussion about the relation between prospective IE models and IAMs since the latter are the major tool for prospective assessment of transformation strategies. We contributed to this debate by proposing how industrial ecology principles could become an integral part of integrated assessment models and how this integration could strengthen both fields and increase the relevance, robustness, and credibility of scientific assessment of transformation strategies.

167,488,0.993,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"Understanding the ways in which Arctic science has been conducted is crucial to understanding how and to what degree intersectional analyses have been integrated into this body of scholarship. Intersectional research is generally part of the broader domain of social sciences, which itself has experienced âscience warsâ, a contestation of methodologies, methods, and approaches (Keating and Della Porta 2010). Social sciences operate at high levels of abstraction, where social inquiry includes exploring ontologies, epistemologies, approaches, methodologies, and methods without predetermining the process of inquiry (ibid). As such, different processes of inquiry result in different constructions and productions of knowledge. Feminists have long demonstrated a gendered and masculinist bias within concepts and approaches to scholarship, not least exemplified by the emphasis on rationality, objectivity, and public domains, often embodied by research in the natural sciences and visibly expressed in un-reflexive, silent authorship reinforcing âan unreflective orientation toward objectivist traditions and normsâ (Gray 2017: 180). A core feature of feminist and intersectional methodological approaches therefore includes the practice of âreflexivityâ whereby the researcher is ââresponsibleâ and âresponsiveâ to her work and her âsubjectsâ of study because it makes explicit the deliberative movement of her scholarshipâ (Ackerly et al. 2006: 258, cited in Agathangelou and Turcotte 2008). Reflexivity allows for insight into phenomena while also illuminating how such insights were derived: âthe closer an academic discipline is aligned with the natural science model the greater the pressure can be to engage in un-reflexive silent authorshipâ (Gray: 182).

The variety of existing literature reviews point to the diversity of research that has emerged in the field but also acknowledge a lack of focus on the power struggles and the decision-making processes surrounding policies related to ICTs. An overemphasis on proving a link between ICT and development has overshadowed other research that focuses on finding policy options and understanding the factors that may affect them and successfully implement them. The proposed framework seeks to challenge the external vision of development currently mainstreamed in ICT4D and proposes to embed research not only broadly in the local context but most importantly in the political context. This implies taking a critical view of both the politics and policy aspects of ICT not only in the ICT policy realm but also in other sectoral policiesâ debates. Furthermore, it argues for framing projects not only in the context of expanding the fieldâs knowledge but from the perspective of policy choices and political constraints. Widening the space of research on ICT4D and policy questions also implies the inclusion of other actors whose research is not always published in international journals or, for that matter, on the specific ICT4D-related journals. An exercise of a wider sample of sources is suggested to better understand all research involved in the process of informing policymaking."
68,45,0.992,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","and (c) intervention research aimed at overcoming studentsâ or teachersâ negative attitudes towards mathematics. Longitudinal studies appear to be crucial to evaluate the effects of âremedial intervention on attitudeâ over time. In Sect. 2.2 Pantziara discusses in detail research findings concerning self-efficacy beliefs. Researchers in the field of student mathematics self-efficacy beliefs suggest several topics that need future investigation. Particularly, there is a need for a clearer understanding of how efficacy beliefs develop so that appropriate interventions can be developed to improve student self-efficacy and collective efficacy beliefs. Moreover, the directionality of the relationship between collective efficacy and group performance remains largely unexplored. Cross-cultural research is needed, as it may reveal how mathematics self-efficacy operates in diverse contexts and how students in contrasting settings function. We need more research on self-regulation and how to improve learnersâ self-regulatory skills. Moreover, we need research on studentsâ beliefs in their capabilities to exercise control over their learning environment in order to optimize their efforts. Last, there is a need for more longitudinal studies and studies with experimental designs (Davis-Kean et al. 2008; Klassen and Krawchuk 2009; Klassen and Usher 2010; Skaalvik and Skaalvik 2011). In Sect. 2.3 Zhang and Morselli sketched a holistic and historical review of research on teacher beliefs in mathematics education, showing that the research focus has moved from the definition and characterization of beliefs to two crucial issues: the relationship between beliefs and practice and belief change. Around these two issues many other factors including internal and external contexts are also discussed widely. The first issue may be rephrased, seeing teachers as sensible systems that act in a coherent way. This suggests the need for further research aimed at a deeper comprehension of the context within which the teaching and learning takes place and of all the factors that affect teaching. The context can include curriculum reform, social-cultural influence, and also many internal interrelated dimensions (Hannula 2012). More generally, further exploration is needed to uncover possible factors that affect practice. On the one hand, research should go on investigating the roots of observed practice, as advocated by Cross (2015). On the other hand, research could address the teaching of different mathematical topics and investigate which beliefs affect such practice. Moreover, the investigation of factors affecting practice may also serve as a basis for efficient teacher development programs. Teacher education programs should move from changing beliefs per se to making teachers aware of beliefs and other factors affecting practice. New generations grow up within e-learning environments and diverse and interactive learning material and their learning environment may be very different from the school their teachers studied in. Teacher beliefs about the integration of ICT and mathematics teaching and how teachers face the changing classroom environment are also issues that need further investigation. In Sect. 2.4, Heyd-Metzuyanim, Lutovac, and Kaasila discuss the issue of mathematical identity. In general, they note that the theoretical frameworks drawn on in the research on student and teacher identities are quite similar. Both draw heavily on socio-cultural theories that view learning as becoming a participant in a"

As Scholten (2011: 42) notes âthe social construction of problems is considered inherently related to the institutional setting within which framing takes placeâ. Of particular relevance is that the EU is not responsible for migrant integration and does not possess or promote a particular migrant integration framework or paradigm. What it does promote, as this chapter shows, are two things. First, knowledge exchange on migrant integration and, second, the stimulation of applied scientific research on issues associated with integration. It is important to"

The literature on ICT for development, especially the dominant discourse on ICT for health initiatives, examines the economic dimension of interventions which highlights the efficiency-related aspects of the intervention (Blaya et al. 2010). There is a need to understand the adoption and evolution of ICT4D interventions from the sociocultural perspective and to explore how the system as an institution undergoes change, if any, from the intervention. The sociocultural and the institutional aspects of ICT interventions are more relevant for the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention (Heeks and Molla 2009). In this paper, we attempt to address this gap by examining the evolution of ICT for health initiatives from the institutional logics perspective. ICT for health initiatives can be regarded as innovations that provide citizens with an alternative to their usual health-seeking avenues and that which can potentially alter the balance between conflicting logics prevalent in healthcare institutions where the interventions are attempted. The dominant rational view that ICT can act as a conduit for information transfer and hence knowledge transfer, making it possible for extending the access of medical knowledge for marginalised population and geographies, should be critically examined by investigating its effect on the basic assumptions and values that characterise the system (Arora 2010; Miscione 2007). In other words, innovations in healthcare can be understood in the backdrop of the logics that govern the healthcare system. Hence, we situate our discussion in the broad domain of logics in healthcare service institutions, specifically highlighting the trade-off between the logic of choice and logic of care (Mol 2008; van Schie and Seedhouse 1997). The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. In the next section, we dwell on the concepts of logic of choice and logic of care in healthcare. Next, based on the extant literature, we highlight the emerging themes that arise from the interplay of the two logics in the healthcare domain. In the discussion and conclusion section, we arrive at a theoretical model explicating important dilemmas and tensions occurring due to institutional dynamics when an ICT initiative is introduced in the healthcare system. The chapter concludes by outlining the agendas for future research."

In light of the increasing importance of social innovation, this chapter focuses on a conception of social innovation that is grounded in social theory, as a precondition for the development of an integrated theory of socio-technological innovation in which social innovation is more than a mere appendage, side-effect and result of technical innovation. Against this background, social innovation is defined here as a new combination1 or configuration of practices in areas of social action, prompted by certain actors or constellations of actors with the ultimate goal of coping better with needs and problems than is possible by using existing practices (Howaldt and Schwarz, 2010, p. 54). An innovation is, therefore, âsocialâ to the extent that it varies social action and is socially accepted and diffused in society (be it throughout society, through large parts of it or only in certain societal sub-areas). Depending on the circumstances of social change, interests, policies and power, social ideas and successfully implemented social innovations may be transformed and, ultimately, institutionalised as regular social practice, that is, made routine. From this perspective, social innovations can be seen as actions that spread through society as a result of imitation, bringing about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). Only by taking into account the unique properties and specifications of social innovation will it be possible to understand the systemic connection and interdependence of social and technological innovation processes to analyse the relationship between social innovation and social change. This chapter aims to outline how Gabriel Tardeâs social theory can be of benefit in developing a theoretically grounded concept of social innovation and how it can be reinterpreted in terms of practice theory.2 In comparison with action, system and structural theories, this perspective on social innovation is based upon a modified understanding of the âsocialâ as social practices and their reconfiguration as a core element of social innovation (Shove et al., 2012). Practice theories overcome the dichotomies between structure and action, subject and object, rule and application, society and the individual, that arbitrarily define micro and macro levels or sociological âreality rulesâ (Latour and LÃ©pinay, 2010, p. 114). Tarde focuses on social practices as the central theoretical and analytical category and last unit of sociality. The social world is, therefore, composed of specific, although interdependent practices: practices of"
170,22,0.992,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"3.2 Extensions Senâs capability approach has subsequently been modified and expanded. Hatakka and De (2011) presented an ICTD evaluation framework by adopting a participatory evaluation approach (House 1980). These scholars argue that Senâs work does not directly address the issue of ICT usage and development. Instead, technology needs to be understood as a means to development goals (or as an intervention) that, together with supportive aspects, enable or restrict conversion factors that translate into outcomes. Whatâs important here is that itâs not the technology that is enabling but whether its use contributes to enabling choices for various stakeholders. This conceptualisation departs from techno-deterministic models of impact. Technology introduction in itself is meaningless unless non-technological factors are taken into consideration, for example, the role of teachers in an educational technology project. Conversion factors influence both the enablement of teaching and learning as well as the ability of teachers and students to make choices. Olivera et al. (2015), in their chapter â(Un)Balanced conversations: Participatory action research in technology development in peruvian primary schoolsâ, examine the value of utilising participatory action research, involving teachers in the technological design process for educational applications developed for Peruvian primary schools. The authors acknowledge that there is a constant challenge to design successful technical solutions that fully deliver intended capabilities (Rodriguez et al. 2012) as these programmes are operating in resource-constrained environments that are further complicated by social, psychological, geographic and cultural differences (Chib and Zhao 2009). To bridge this disparity, they recommend a participatory action research approach that supports iterative data gathering and ongoing technology development that would, ultimately, positively improve teaching and learning in schools in developing counties. Hence, this shifts the project focus to building capacities of key users to bolster the educational infrastructure in which the new technologies are deployed. There are increasing calls for focusing on noneconomic measures of development, with Gomez and Pather (2012) stating that the ICTD evaluation field has often neglected the intangible aspects of technology projects. May and Diga (2015) review the debate surrounding the connection of ICTs to poverty in chapter âProgress towards resolving the measurement link between ICT and poverty reductionâ. They argue that the measures of poverty in the current literature are not sophisticated enough to capture the complexity of development problems. These scholars propose incorporating participatory approaches and subjective well-being measures to enhance our understanding of the link between ICTs and poverty reduction."

Indeed, âgood governance is crucial for researchâ¦ Absence of regulation is not beneficial for researchâ¦ Regulatory oversight adds another layer to the web of quality control in researchâ (Gottweis and Triendl 2006). In other words, in this third round of comments, the ethical infrastructure was suddenly regarded as an integral part of excellence in science: âHave your ethics in place!â In dialectical terms: on a more advanced level of comprehension, science and ethics became reconciled again. Both were acknowledged as complementary dimensions of good scientific practice (academic Sittlichkeit). Hwang still functioned as a foil, but now for highlighting the (self-perceived) ethical robustness of Western research practices. From a macro-perspective, the Hwang case must be regarded as symptomatic for a broader, even global development. Frank Miedema (2012) professor of immunology and Dean of the Medical Faculty of Utrecht University, distinguishes three stages in the recent history of science. Science 1.0 (M1, dialectically speaking) was a type of research that was autonomous and curiosity driven. Increasingly however, a different type of research seems called for (Science 2.0: M2), producing knowledge that is relevant for societal stakeholders and entailing economic value (Miedema 2012, p. 24). This implies new (post-classical) quality criteria, but also growing tensions and contradictions between the inherent dynamics of academic work and the societal and economic expectations involved. But eventually, according to the author, a situation of co-creation is evolving (â M3), in which the questions and interests of science and society become more adequately aligned and knowledge production becomes coproduction: Science 3.0 (M3) (cf. Gibbons et al. 1994; Nowotny et al. 2001; Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 2001)."
376,18,0.992,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","This book summarizes the current state of scientific and management knowledge regarding global rangelands and the major challenges that confront them. Current knowledge is assessed relative to changes that have occurred within rangeland ecology, management applications, and, more broadly, global events that have influenced rangelands. A widely accepted philosophical interpretation of scientific advancement notes that progress is often gradual and incremental as prevailing theories are explored and refined (Kuhn 1996). These periods of incremental progress, however, are periodically interrupted by major changes in underpinning theories that are termed scientific revolutions. This proved to be the case for range ecology and the discipline of ecology in the 1970s and 1980s when the prevailing theory of ecological equilibrium was challenged by a more dynamic nonequilibrium interpretation (Briske et al. 2003). Whether or not this represented a scientific revolution remains in dispute, but there is no question that it introduced a period of rapid conceptual change for the rangeland profession. Perhaps more pertinent to the goal of this book is that the development of this new knowledge broadly paralleled the progression of natural resource management models based on humanânatural resource interactions. These models are envisioned to sequentially progress with time following human settlement and societal development from humans as natural resource users to humans as natural resource stewards (Chapin et al. 2009). Consequently, changes in the perception of how humans interact with nature contribute to different knowledge needs and management strategies to maintain the supply of desired natural resources. Natural resource exploitation is an anticipated outcome following a long period of low-impact preindustrial human use (Fig. 1.1). Exploitation of US rangelands, prompted by the perception of limitless open-access resources, did occur in response to excessive livestock grazing in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This period of exploitation and subsequent natural resource degradation was termed the ârange problemâ in the southwest USA, and it directly contributed to development of the rangeland profession (Sayre et al. 2012; Sayre 2017). Exploitation was followed by development of steady-state management that attempts to maximize sustainable yield of specific goods that are most highly valued. This model is implemented through the control of ecosystem variationâfire suppression, predator control, and fencingâto optimize production of desired goods, on the basis of broad ecological principles that are administered through command and control management by various state or national agencies (Table 1.1). Recognition that effective management needed to consider entire ecosystems, including their inherent variation, and a societal demand for more diverse ecosystem services promoted development of the ecosystem management model. The ecosystem management modelâfocused on planning for integrated ecosystems as well as solicitation of more diverse stakeholder feedbackâoriginated in the 1970s and was"

Developmental evaluation has applicability where there is uncertainty, and where the program might need to change and adapt according to emerging and changing contexts. This is particularly applicable in the case of climate change adaptation, and in the case of the CC-CBA project, significant path changes were required in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan in December 2013. A key characteristic of developmental evaluation is that it supports continuous learning and innovation through embedding evaluators as part of the team engaged in project delivery, in a long-term partnering relationship.25 The CC-CBA design integrated the research component within the project and indeed it was the role of researchers to facilitate evidence-based, systematic reflection on project progress. Strong individual and organisational partnerships were successfully built.26 The practical realities of program budgets meant that evaluative researchers could not be embedded full-time within the project implemented, but were directly involved in research design and inception and through the course of the evaluative process interacted with project implementers periodically throughout the 3-year project."

Much of this analysis has focused on availability of hardware, financial resources, physical infrastructure, training sessions, etc. However, the debate has largely moved on from that of access and adoption of technological inputs to their effective appropriation and translation into educational objectives. In this chapter, we focus on teachers as key stakeholders, whose interests and needs need to be understood in order to achieve viable, sustainable and coherent impact (Ale and Chib 2011; European Commission 2001). It is important to understand the specific characteristics unique to this important stakeholder community, such as perceptions and practices concerning technological resources (Hollow and Masperi 2009; Misuraca et al. 2011) as second-order barriers to successful integration of technology into the educational milieu."
287,56,0.992,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"The networking of theories allows for explicitly working with different theories in order to beneï¬t from their theoretical strengths with a speciï¬c focus on informing practice as well as being inspired by empirical situations of practice. To network theories means to build relations among theories. This approach is not a new idea. There are forerunners: for example, in 1992, Bauersfeld presented an integrated analysis of a teaching and learning situation using various theoretical approaches (1992b). He has also used strategies to compare and contrast radical constructivism and activity theory in order to clarify their (in-) compatibility (1992a). In 1998, Maier and Steinbring published a comparison of two theoretical approaches on processes of understanding based on the same empirical episode. These examples show that German researchers used the strategies of comparing theoretical approaches and integrating theoretical aspects to comprehend practice. Such strategies, called networking strategies, have been systematized, resulting in a landscape of four pairs of complementary strategies (Fig. 5.1). This landscape orders these strategies according to their potential for integration between two poles, non-relation of ignoring other theories, and uniï¬cation of theories globally. The ï¬rst two pairs (understanding and making understandable, comparing and contrasting), acknowledge the theoriesâ identities and the diversity of the theories as a resource in the ï¬eld. They point to the basic necessity of understanding theories. This ï¬rst pair may take place in a deepened way while comparing and contrasting theories. The second pair, comparing and contrasting, leads to awareness of differences and commonalities, thus learning from other perspectives. The third pair, combining and coordinating, is a step towards bridging theories. Its strategies allow working with different theories to build a conceptual framework or include complementary views into researching a problem. The fourth pair, locally integrating and synthesizing, leads to more comprehensive theoretical frameworks. Local integration may occur when a concept can be interpreted from different theoretical views, thus integrating the concept into other theories. Synthesizing is meant when two or more theories can be imbedded into a more holistic theoretical framework. While there are some cases of local integration, a case of synthesizing has not yet been achieved (see Bikner-Ahsbahs and Prediger 2010). During the last decade, research methods using networking of theories have been developed in a number of projects. These methods encompass repeated exchanges"
197,39,0.992,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"energy transItIons Processes of structural change in the energy sectorâoften called âenergy transitionsââhave also been known to increase inequality and deprivation; they are hence of key relevance to understandings of energy poverty (Bouzarovski et al., 2017; Bridge et al., 2013). Even though the term âenergy transitionsâ implies a shift towards a socially desirable end state, there is no consensus among practitioners or academics as to the exact shape of this future as far as the ongoing process of decarbonization is concerned. While such debates have often taken place under the conceptual umbrella of âsustainability transitionsâ (Frantzeskaki, Loorbach, & Meadowcroft, 2012; Lawhon & Murphy, 2012), the multilayered social and technical nature of energy provision means that low-carbon policies inherently involve a complex interplay of political interests, institutional forces and governance practices. The suggestion that the long-term transformation of energy systems will prove âto be a messy, conflictual, and highly disjointed processâ (Meadowcroft, 2009, p. 323) destabilizes the notion that what is at stake is a linear movement towards a predefined environmentally sustainable condition. Moreover, even if a certain set of technical requirements is achieved, there may be no underlying change to the regulatory practices that surround energy use: the same type of infrastructural outcome can be achieved via different policy means, and without altering the basic principles of system organization (Bridge et al., 2013). The new âenergy paradigmâ (Helm, 2005), therefore, opens fundamental questions about the manner in which different political interests and social formations interact with technological change. Some of these dilemmas have included the role of the state in exercising different governing capacities in steering socio-technical transitions (Baker, Newell, & Phillips, 2014), the ability of âcommunity-based initiativesâ to generate innovation (Seyfang & Haxeltine, 2012), the manner in which intermediary organizations assist the implementation of low-carbon strategies (Marvin, 2012) as well as the historical forces involved in shaping deep-seated structural shifts in systems of provision (Smil, 2003). Historically, energy transitions have been associated with far-reaching shifts in the underpinnings of resource production and distribution, as well as their associated economic and human development patterns. It is claimed that the adoption of low-carbon technology solutions and mitigation strategies brings about multiple benefits in the form of enhanced"

It is perhaps interesting to note that the emphasis at this point is not on understanding behaviour but changing it. Subsequent reference to âbehaviour change techniquesâ reinforce this assumption: dysfunctional individuals lie at the heart of the problem. Michie et al. outline the methods used to develop their model grounded in âsystematic reviewâ. The concept of systematic review is very much linked to the evidence-based medicine movement and derives from methods developed through the Cochrane Collaboration.4 The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) deï¬nes a systematic review as, âa review of the evidence on a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant primary research, and to extract and analyse data from the studies that are included in the reviewâ (CRD 2001: 3) There is no scope here to discuss and critique the relative merits of systematic reviews and their claims to objectivity. Certainly their value and approach in understanding clinical drugs trials is undisputed. For us, as social scientists more accustomed to the concept of âliteratureâ or âresearch reviewâ, they present a certain narrowness in focus that may risk excluding highly relevant and innovative multi-disciplinary knowledge and/or grey literature (Benzies et al. 2006). The emphasis in systematic review processes on the âclearly formulated questionâ tends to lead to a funnelling approach, progressively narrowing inquiry to an ever-smaller group of highly similar studies. Whilst this approach may form a key component of the comparability criteria necessary in clinically oriented systematic reviews (to compare like with like and reduce extraneous ânoiseâ), it lies in some tension with more expansive and exploratory âsearchlightâ or horizon-scanning approaches to literature review explicitly seeking new knowledge and innovative insights (as represented in this chapter). Furthermore, the âquality appraisalâ component of systematic reviews is based on the premise that research can be ranked according to its quality, reliability and replicability. In practice, this involves a weighting process based on metrics to assess âthe rigor of the research methodologyâ (Jones et al. 2013: 3) effectively privileging quasi-experimental techniques. At the apex of this epistemological hierarchy (Levels 1 and 2) lies the randomised controlled trial (developed from clinical research) and, at the base, opinion pieces. Qualitative research receives no speciï¬c mention in this schema but presumably falls within the generic category (Level 3) of ânon-randomised,"

These research works did not attempt to represent speciï¬c conï¬gurations formed by the articulation of these characteristics, or to formalize the interactions between these environmental characteristics and those of the students, or the effects of these interactions on learning. However, the most signiï¬cant work has been done in the ETL3 project (Enhancing Teaching-Learning environments led by the University of Edinburgh). This project has highlighted many âgood practicesâ in relation to teaching speciï¬c disciplines or those that are common to several disciplines (Hounsell et al. 2005). It does not, however, propose a validated framework for describing speciï¬c conï¬gurations formed by the articulation of these dimensions and their effects on learning. In addition, it does not focus speciï¬cally on digital learning environments. HY-SUP4 Project (describing hybrid learning environments and understanding their effects5,6) ï¬lls this gap by speciï¬cally studying digital learning environments (hybrid, blended or at a distance). As already mentioned, the vast majority of the scientiï¬c literature devoted to hybrid learning environments is made up of satisfaction surveys of learners. Prior to HY-SUP, some speciï¬c research: e.g. (Peraya and Campion 2007; Charlier et al. 2006b; Docq et al. 2008) led to the identiï¬cation of several potential effects on learning experienced by participants, on their identity dynamics and social interactions, and on the emergence of communities of practice. However, no large-scale research had answered the central question as to the effect of such digital learning environments on the quality of student learning, in particular. To validly answer this question, it was ï¬rst necessary to characterize these environments based on dimensions such as: the forms of mediation and mediatisation; the articulation of the educational phases both in face-to-face and distance activities; the nature of human support; or contextual aspects such as the type of training, the number of students or educational practices (Peraya et al. 2014).

347,370,0.992,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"This means that despite some successful exceptions as exemplified above, science-based advice is far from always used effectively in Baltic Sea environmental governance. This is apparent in the cases of eutrophication (Karlsson et al. 2016) and chemicals (Karlsson and Gilek 2016), where HELCOM has established detailed regional assessments based on scientific input, but management measures are nonetheless seldom fully implemented nationally. Furthermore, risk assessments are usually established based on a conventional view of what constitutes appropriate scientific methodologies and knowledge, often overlooking non-standardised data sources, uncertainty and interactions between various risks, as well as the need for interdisciplinary perspectives and stakeholder input (Linke et al. 2016). The latter â lack of stakeholder input â might cause worsened sociopolitical controversies, especially in the presence of uncertainty. In particular, it opens up for strong politicisation where scientists without normative transparency engage in political discussions and politicians selectively interpret scientific results (Karlsson et al. 2011; Linke et al. 2016). Several chapters in the book analyse and discuss communication and stakeholder participation. Both the EU and HELCOM have invested increasingly in this area of environmental governance in recent years, as, for example, seen in HELCOMâs BSAP stakeholder conferences and in RACs under the Common Fisheries Policy (BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016; JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016; Sellke et al. 2016). To a large extent though, the case studies reveal that participation in Baltic Sea environmental governance is generally regarded as having an instrumental role to serve the requirements of public policy (BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016). It is of course positive if participation, as assumed in this instrumental framing, leads to more efficient and effective environmental governance and higher acceptance of decision-making processes. Still, this instrumental focus on participation may result in the broader democratic values of participation being overlooked (JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016). In addition, our findings indicate that regional structures and processes for stakeholder input and critique are often undeveloped or missing, as seen in the chemicals and IAS cases (Linke et al. 2016; Smolarz et al. 2016). Hence, despite ambitions to develop participation in environmental governance and recent developments of, for example, the RAC system in fisheries management, it can be concluded that regional structures and processes for stakeholder inclusion and deliberation generally remain rather undeveloped in BSR. Finally, there is an obvious lack of widely available supranational communication arenas in the Baltic Sea region, such as a common Baltic news media, which undermines effective environmental communication. Media coverage at the national level, on the other hand, is much more prominent, often making international coverage invisible (JÃ¶nsson et al. 2016). This is likely to obstruct opportunities for environmental governance of the Baltic Sea, since the possibility of stakeholders participating in regional societal debates is limited, as is the potential to develop a common regional understanding of environmental challenges and opportunities. In Table 10.3, we summarise the problems we have found to be important in the crosscase analysis, identify specific problem areas and give concrete examples that illuminate our findings better."

Thus, this collection explores the implications of social innovation in cross-sector collaborations and hybrid forms, across several contexts and in multiple country settings to highlight a range of issues across social innovation models. The research presented here deliberately ranges across different socio-structural levels and units of analysis â from micro to macro â in order to offer multiple insights into the various contexts in which social innovation can operate effectively. Much of the work here also has strong policy implications: by codifying and analysing practice, its objective is to inform future policy making in social innovation across countries. This book also aims to contribute to the critical field-building project of social innovation that is already underway across a range of researchers and institutions by augmenting the existing body of knowledge on this subject with work on new trends and case examples. In the process, the hope is that the work published here will also support the building of a community of researchers looking at social innovation by adding its own, modest legitimacy to working on this subject. The contents and structure of this volume are considered in more detail below."
341,36,0.992,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter the authors have presented a narrative that supports their normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance. Jennifer McKay presents a portfolio-based approach to planning and management and argues that rapid urbanisation, growing urban populations, environmental issues and climate change all present significant challenges for water resource management, the delivery of essential water and sanitation services and environmental protection. As a result, traditional approaches that have relied heavily on large-scale infrastructure development are making way for new approaches such as the portfolio-based approach to planning and management. In an urban context this includes integration of all components of the urban water cycle, and most state governments in Australia have embarked on implementing this integrated approach by having a mix of water supply sources including demand management and conservation measures. However, effective implementation of this approach depends on policies and regulations and encounters various impediments. Accordingly, this chapter focuses on the City of Adelaide in South Australia and explores the legal and policy challenges for implementing an integrated urban water management plan in Metropolitan Adelaide. Drawing on the results of governance studies carried out in Australia that included a literature review and stakeholder and community surveys, this chapter attempts to better understand the barriers to transitioning Adelaide to a water-sensitive city. With regard to implementing an integrated urban water management strategy in Australia, there is no âone size fits allâ structural arrangement. Although there is growing support for implementing a portfolio of water supply sources, it is also true that there are impediments to implementing this approach. The authors caution that achieving (cultural) transformations to encourage institutional change for implementation of an integrated urban water management approach may take several years, and therefore planners and policy-makers must have a long-term framework for addressing these issues. Looking ahead, there is scope for further research to explore the intergovernmental issues and provide models to enable this transition and hence be a model for the world in portfolio approaches. Marguerite de Chaisemartin provides an overview and thus contributes to a better understanding of the worldâs groundwater resource, its distinctiveness and its governance â describing the principal elements of and key instruments employed in groundwater governance. To this end, the authors introduce several case studies from across the globe and offer some corresponding lessons learnt. In particular, this chapter presents an analysis of the role of monitoring and assessment in groundwater governance, showcasing the example of the Netherlands. A global diagnostic of the current state of groundwater governance is provided, based on information from a set of commissioned thematic papers and the outcomes of five subsequent regional consultations carried out within the framework of a GEF-supported project on Global Groundwater Governance.

Structure contributes to the shaping of the individual resource portfolio and can either enhance or limit oneâs exercise of agency. The two-pronged approach of âagencyâ and âstructureâ sounds fine in an abstract conceptual sphere, but how does the approach pan out in practice? Kleine suggests that the choice framework can help development priorities be more participatory, engaging the recipientsâ interest and considering local and cultural elements into programme formation and implementation. It operationalises Senâs capability approach, linking ICTs as the means which are imbedded in agency and structure which eventually lead to individual choices. The choice framework requires greater work in terms of measurability, as the author admits that it is more easily applicable to individual level than at aggregate meso- or macro-levels. Bhatnagar and Singhâs (2010) assessment of Indian e-Government initiatives examines national-level data, accompanied with fuzzy measurability and myriad complex relationships. The framework identifies key stakeholders and client value by measuring cost to the client of assessing services and their perception of the quality of service and governance. The research question investigates values that can both be monetised and those that are intangible, across multiple stakeholders (beneficiaries, implementation agencies and society), thus requiring a range of methodologies to capture the overall rating for a projectâs impact. In the chapter âAn analytical framework to incorporate ICT as an independent variableâ, Dodel presents an analytical framework based on Selwynâs (2010) âImpact Assessment Frameworkâ that includes hierarchical stages of ICT involvementâaccess, usage, appreciation and outcomesâon development. These scholars argue that ICT research would gain greater relevance to non-ICT researchers by including these variables in addition to measures of individual wellbeing. The model was tested on a sample of young Uruguayans, finding that digital skills were a significant influence on their occupational achievements. Supporting such an analysis, Chew et al. (2011) claim that quantitative analysis is more likely to provide rigorous tests of causality. In their study on ICT use in women-run microenterprises, these scholars find a statistically significant, but limited, causal relationship between access to ICTs and business growth. The authors claim that at the macro level, ICTs have had an overall positive impact in terms of economic growth; however, at the micro-level, it is difficult to find such evidence and, in this case, for micro-entrepreneurs, mostly, due to the cost issues in adopting computers. These examples underscore the challenges of validating higher-level abstractions with measurable empirical evidenceâconceptual frames that can bridge local and national-level projects."

(p. 71). (5) Perception of the environment. Relationships between studentâs individual characteristics, such as their conceptions of learning and their perceptions of the learning environment, are represented in earlier studies (Meyer 1991) by the term âstudy orchestrationâ. Such âorchestrationâ could be either harmonious (i.e. combinations of deep approaches and positive perceptions of learning and teaching environment) or dissonant (Meyer and Vermunt 2000). For the same environment, the HY-SUP project (See. Supra) also showed the diversity of student perceptions, as well as a positive correlation between these perceptions, learning approaches and perceived effects on learning. The same goes for the work of JÃ©zÃ©gou on student perception of openness and presence characterised by these environments. As a result, the perception of the digital learning environment will be considered. In conclusion, the interactions between the variables described above have rarely been studied systematically. This is not surprising since they correspond to different research paradigms. Thus, research on self-regulated learning emphasises that the learning processes cannot be understood if they are reduced to the cognitive dimension. They have therefore sought to document the motivational aspects of learning and volitional behaviour. Despite the fact that cognitive and metacognitive strategies are constantly cited as essential for successful self-regulation, research on approaches and conceptions of learning are rarely evoked in work on self-regulation strategies (Entwistle and McCune 2013). Thereâs a need to bridge the gap between the two research traditions. The relationship between achievement goals and learning approaches has been extensively studied, however little work has been done on the impact of performance goals on volitional strategies. With the notable exception of (Pintrich 2000), the theory of achievement goals is not a major theoretical reference model for self-regulated learning (i.e. Corno, Boekaerts, Winne, Pintrich, Zimmerman). We suggest to systematically examining the interactions of these sets of variables in the context of a digital learning environment in the broad sense deï¬ned above. Finally, the evaluation methods affect the choice of learning approaches and the impact of these approaches on performance (deep strategies not necessarily leading to better performance). Taking this variable into consideration is particularly important, as forms of learning assessments often have different characteristics in distance learning and hybrid courses. For policy makers and quality management, learning assessment methods are good indicators of teaching quality."
140,141,0.992,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Neither Rummelâs work in general, nor UCW in particular, is generally perceived to be particularly relevant to theoretical nor research concerns focused on the international systemic level of analysis. Nevertheless, there are systemic level implications of the theoretical approach to conflict developed in UCW that are among its unexploited aspects. Among the 33 basic âtheoretical propositions on the causes and conditions of international conflict behaviorâ, there are two that focus on the relationship between polarity and international conflict. The ï¬rst is âpolarity stimulates intense violenceâ, (Rummel, 1979: 284), and the other is âpolarity inhibits nonviolent conflict and low level violenceâ, (Rummel, 1979: 288). Though these appear contradictory, in fact they jointly posit a curvilinear relationship. Another related proposition relevant to analyses of the international system asserts that âcross-pressures inhibit intense violenceâ (Rummel, 1979: 290). Perhaps the most intriguing derivation from Rummelâs theoretical approach in UCW regarding the international system is that âinternational relations are an exchange society with a libertarian political systemâ (Rummel, 1979: 431), and that, accordingly, âinternational relations could be better characterized as a state of peaceâ (Rummel, 1979: 46).

223,51,0.992,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"The Relevance of the Spatial Dimension and the Spatial Turn From the perspective of geography-making, which begins with the premises that all socially and culturally relevant geographies are constructed realities, the spatial conditions and spatial relations of individual actions are fundamental to the formation and structuration of social realities. A prime example is the current globalization affecting various aspects of everyday life. Systematic social theories have largely ignored the spatial dimension of social life. The reasons for this omission are profound and require thorough reconstruction of the underlying modes of thought. Without such analysis, one runs the risk of importing the traditional spatial perspective into the social sciences and cultural studies. The fact that such uncritical adoption of the conventional spatial perspective is neither productive nor insightful is exemplified by the âspatial,â or âgeographical,â turn in the social sciences, cultural studies, and the humanities (see DÃ¶ring & Thielmann, 2008; Foucault, 1999; Levy, 1999; GÃ¼nzel, 2009; SchlÃ¶gel, 2002; Soja, 1989; Warf & Arias, 2008). The absence of the spatial dimension in social and cultural theorizing contrasts with the spatial obsession characteristic of early studies in human geography, a field that emerged in the late nineteenth century as a space-centered science applying to the study of human individuals and societies. This orientation and the way of thinking underlying it have significant ramifications for geography as an academic discipline and entail problematic political implications. Traditional human geographyâs rather simplistic focus on space and distance as determining dimensions of behavior results in an emphasis on the individual as part of the human species and neglects his or her capacity to perform social actions, which is fundamental for the meaningful construction of social and cultural realities. Arrival at this perspective needed a theoretical and not always successful debate lasting more than a century. The insights it has contributed greatly help the current debate about the spatial turn in the social and cultural sciences, identify its implications (some of which are problematic), and detect its shortcomings on the background of the history of geographical research. Observed from the current theoretical debates, the first turn from human geography to social geography as of the early twentieth century was theoretically uninformed about social science and showed that merely integrating the social dimension"

So-called dynamic capabilities should enable building and reconï¬guring internal and external resources including competencies (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000). The goal is resilient behaviour based on organizational agility (cf. Worley and Lawler 2010; Kirchmer 2011). In change management projects IT-afï¬nity tend to dominate (cf. Sambamurthy et al. 2003; Overby et al. 2006; Ngai et al. 2011; Kim and Suh 2012) although stakeholders1 and their communities play a crucial role for succeeding in those projects. Korpelainen and Kira (2013) revealed âthat most of the problems were identiï¬ed in the social context and only one ï¬fth of the problems were related to the employeesâ experiences of a lack of skills and competencies in using the IT-systemsâ. Apparently, it still holds what Hammer (1996, 1999) found out already in the context of Business Process Re-Engineering when revisiting the original, model-centric concept of Hammer and Champy (1993). Moving from adopting IT systems to organizational design involving human-centred work models and semantic process analysis (cf. Prilla et al. 2012) can be facilitated by business process modelling notations. Such a stakeholder-centred procedure needs to include the opportunity to transfer human experience and ideas into a process model for effective work support (Aschoff et al. 2003). Capturing work knowledge requires a context-sensitive BPM approach (cf. Ates and Bititci 2011; Silva and Rosemann 2012). Following the human-centred approach for organizational development has a cognitive, a content-oriented and social perspective. From the cognitive perspective, a semantically valid representation of work knowledge is required when stakeholders create models and when eliciting/documenting work processes. From the content perspective, models represent the baseline of organizational development. From the social perspective, an intelligible and executable version of models is required. They allow sharing, reflecting and experiencing processes through different roles and stakeholders (Fig. 3.11)."
245,687,0.992,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"motivation, which prepares decisions and promotes the intention to learn (goal setting); volition, which protects the implementation of these decisions (goal attainment) (Corno 2001). Motivation and volition are two components of a larger entity which, following (Reuchlin 1999), one might call conation, a term designating factors that govern the orientation of both behaviour and its control. Knowledge concerning the nature and use of volitional strategies and their conditions of validity remains incomplete. Some researchers have sought to account for self-regulation strategies used by learners, including (Corno 2001; Pintrich 2000; Wolters 2003; Zimmerman 1989, 2000; Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons 1986). Based on these partial syntheses, (Cosnefroy 2010, 2011, 2013), set up a new taxonomy of self-regulation strategies including volitional strategies. In this taxonomy volitional strategies are categorized by two sub-components: control of the inner states and control of the learning environment. The former refer to the control of motivation (by sustaining the learning-task value and learnerâs self-efï¬cacy) and emotions, more speciï¬cally negative emotions such as shame, anger, helplessness and anxiety. Strategies devoted to the control of the learning context are threefold: (1) Environment structuring (e.g. arranging a quiet study area); (2) resources enhancement (e.g. seeking help); (3) time management (e.g. allocation of time and setting of priorities). Among the latter strategies, time management skills are probably paramount, insofar as research has shown they are lacking for most higher education students (Meer et al. 2010). This new taxonomy could be used to analyse the impact of these strategies on learning outcomes. (4) Approaches to learning. Student approaches to learning are strongly related to studentsâ conceptions of learning. However, they donât describe personal characteristics, but rather ways of learning that depend on interactions with the learning environment (Cano 2005; Entwistle 2009). Research on approaches to learning carried out in learning and teaching in Higher Education over the last 40 years have highlighted the relationships between student characteristics (age, gender, personal story, training, previous experience) and their conceptions of learning, approaches to learning and learning orientations, as well as the influence of contextual factors (influence of peers, teachers, learning environments and institutional strategy) and of student perceptions of this context (Biggs 2003; Entwistle 2003a, b; Pintrich 2003; Ramsden 2003; Richardson 2005; SaljÃ¶ 1979a, b). Among the contextual factors, assessment deserves special consideration. Entwistle has introduced the strategic approach (i.e. using surface or deep strategies according to task requirements) because assessment strongly affects studying (Entwistle and McCune 2004). More recently, (Ellis and Goodyear 2010) have examined student experiences of learning through discussion and through inquiry in face-to-face and online situations. The authors have found correlations between elements of the experience of learning (conceptions, approaches, and perceptions of the environment) and performance outcomes. Their results conï¬rm the relevance of our research programme: âStudentsâ experiences of e-learning, need to be understood in relation to the whole experience of learning, whether at course or whole degree level. Clearly e-learning is part of a broader experience of learning. Its association with other parts of the"

Perceived behavioral control describes whether or not people feel they have the resources, opportunities, or abilities to perform the relevant behavior (Azjen 1991) and can directly influence behavioral intention or the behavior itself (Fig. 18.1). Although the TPB has been a mainstay of attitudebehavior theory and research since its introduction and has received substantial empirical support (Armitage and Conner 2001), the application of the TPB to conservation is more recent (St John et al. 2010, 2013). A related conceptual framework with a more specific history in environmental conservation and attitudes toward wildlife, particularly in the USA, is the value attitude behavior (VAB) model (Homer and Kahle 1988; Manfredo 2008). The VAB model places values at the base of a cognitive hierarchy of behavior, influencing attitudes and norms through a âvalue orientation.â Values are defined as the set of beliefs held by an individual about what is right and wrong. The power of these theories for practitioners aiming to induce behavioral change is that the target behavior is broken down into components which may differ in influence (St John et al. 2013) (Fig. 18.1). From a conservation perspective, analysis of the differential influences can help identify the most important barrier to change that can then be the focus of an intervention. So although attitudes are strong predictors of behavioral intention, they are commonly shaped by values, and the significance of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in the success or otherwise of conservation interventions is becoming increasingly"

The causes and constraints to change are often incompletely understood, but they can be tested by monitoring the effects of management and restoration actions. These steps allow managers to link information about plant community composition collected during inventory with concepts of ecosystem dynamics to develop management plans aimed at long-term stewardship. For instance, management actions may seek to maintain a desired plant community with high forage quality, to restore native plants and animals that formerly occupied the site, or to create a mosaic of different plant communities favoring wildlife. In this way, STMs can help specify management objectives for a site, and serve as guides to maintain and restore ecosystem services. The diagrammatic and narrative portions of STMs synthesize various sources of knowledge about ecosystem change, including scientific results, historical anecdotes, and local knowledge. The synthesis is used to develop predictions for how ecosystems respond to natural events and management actions (Bestelmeyer et al. 2009b). Conceptual STMs can be expanded into quantitative models by including estimates of the likelihood of change. Well-developed STMs can serve as a basis for collaborative adaptive management (i.e., management by iterative hypothesis testing, involving multiple stakeholders; Susskind et al. 2012) (Chap. 1, this volume). These guidelines can be updated based on monitoring and new knowledge. In this way, STMs can facilitate a shift from rigid prescriptions based on a one-way relationship between science and management toward a constantly evolving set of recommendations based on collaborative learning and adaptation. Collaborative adaptive management is likely to be more effective than rigid rules of thumb as a basis for environmental stewardship, especially as global climate continues to change. Because of the potential for STMs to link science to management, they are being developed with increasing frequency in rangelands and other ecosystems on several continents (Hobbs and Suding 2009). While some STMs were never intended to be used for management, others were developed as a basis for outreach and decision support. The linkage of STMs to on-the-ground decision-making, however, remains limited for a number of reasons, including a lack of adequate detail and specificity in STMs and the inability of institutions to develop and use STMs. Moreover, it is inherently difficult to determine the likelihood of transitions, especially given time lags and long timeframes needed to observe some transitions. Nonetheless, there is continued optimism that STMs can provide useful tools for bridging the sciencemanagement divide (Knapp et al. 2011b). Our approach in this chapter is to (1) review the ecological basis for STMs, (2) outline the fundamental components of STMs, (3) review the experiences in several countries with the development and use of STMs (Australia, Argentina, the United States, and Mongolia), (4) identify and address challenges to the use of STMs for management, and (5) describe recent technical advances that may improve STMs, including participatory approaches in model construction, the use of STMs within a structured decision-"

They have been developed in order âto clarify the structure of an SES so we understand the niche involved and how a particular solution may help to improve outcomes or make them worse.

Figure 4.6 summarises the influencing factors at a very high level of aggregation into an analytical framework that seeks to define common characteristics of SES and to draw on both social sciences as well as natural sciences. Similar to the farming systems research framework, the generic SES framework (1) relies on systems thinking appropriate to address complex governance problems and (2) makes use of a range of disciplinary expertise that is interdisciplinary combined.

275,606,0.992,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"21.2 Fundamental Uncertainty in Economics 21.2.1 Economic Agency and Autonomy The tight connection between notions of economic agency and autonomy is well established in the economic literature: indeed, the history of artificial intelligence research and economics are intertwined because economics is, in essence, about human decision-making under different resource allocation mechanisms and conditions [36]. Economics has constantly looked to artificial intelligence for models, especially in response to the realisation in the 1970s [43] that economics had been weak on both the nature of human information processing capabilities and on how we achieve these capabilities, despite the central place that these problems must have in economic theory. The boundaries have become increasingly blurred, on the economics side at least, because while economics requires descriptive models of human decision-making, the available tools are primarily the prescriptive models offered by traditional artificial intelligence and applied mathematics. Furthermore, economics has itself developed prescriptive models in the course of trying to describe and predict economic system behaviours (see for instance, [15]). While autonomous systems research has yielded many prescriptive agents that work well enough in tightly constrained environments, the economic requirement for descriptive models arguably first highlighted the yawning gap between machine reasoning algorithms and the robustness and flexibility of human decision-making. Smith recently argued [44] that in both economics and in artificial intelligence, the underlying assumptions driving research about agent learning and decision-making have typically neither sufficiently nor even explicitly emphasised the significance of fundamental uncertainty; current models remain structurally very similar to those of the past. We remain largely tied to probabilistic and statistical methods of learning and reasoning and thus to their inherent limits. He argues that the advances in machine intelligence of recent years overwhelmingly do not even attempt to address this failing and consequently do not represent a base advance in overcoming the difficulties of modelling and reproducing human decision-making, increasing success in tightly defined domains notwithstanding. Implicated in maintaining these base assumptions unchallenged is the documented anthropomorphic tendency to label constructions in artificial intelligence with human decision-making features or human functions, in the absence of any convincing argument establishing a similarity [34]. These wishful mnemonics have arguably helped to foster the hype cycles experienced repeatedly during the course of the history of artificial intelligence research and application, while masking the limitations of the available methods to cope with non-stochastic uncertainty. The implications of this for the development of autonomous systems capable of operating in high uncertainty environments such as those of military operations are straightforward. The failure of machine learning in comparison with human performance is poor generalisation ability; the failure of machine reasoning is brittleness, meaning a poor ability to handle environments in which future states are the"

Developments of this technology such as the use of gene drives, where speciï¬c genes are spread within populations, or the use of viral vector systems, are enabling additional applications in environmental engineering and disease treatment. There are substantial individual and societal beneï¬ts from applying genome editing; nonetheless the technology also poses signiï¬cant risks to individuals, society as a whole and the environment. The central focus of this case study is on the unresolved ethical issues related to safety and security that pose both short-term and long-term challenges to international research partnerships. As such, the case study focuses not on a single incident but on the risks in the proliferation of a new and very powerful technology at a time when accepted and tailored ethical and legal frameworks at the international, national and local level are missing. In the case study two areas of safety risks are mapped and existing governance approaches described: ï¬rst, risks to humans, for example in relation to therapeutic applications of genome editing; second, risks to the environment in relation to the use of genome editing on animals, plants and microbes.

This book aspires to evaluate the purpose and future role of the new partnership and its relationship to the rest of the cooperation landscape. To be clear, while basic research is not specifically excluded from our conception of R&I in this book, our interest lies in the exploitation of new knowledge and the generation of technological innovations that emerge from applied science for social well-being and broad economic development. Equally, we are interested in the nature and underlying process of AfricaâEurope cooperation and in the essence of its bi-regional, multilateral partnerships. More specifically, we include considerations such as the conditions under which cooperation takes placeâthe framework conditions, the barriers that may hinder improved cooperation and the policy and programming responses that could enhance cooperation. Cognisant of the already large and growing global scholarly community that conducts large-scale STI surveys, such as research and development (R&D) surveys or business innovation surveys, a disclaimer is in order: we have not used repositories of STI statistics to develop the analysis, though we recognise that these data could provide an interesting archive for future research about the inputs into and outputs of the relationship. Instead, we have chosen to work with cooperation practitioners at the front line of cooperation efforts, drawing them in as chapter authors to reflect on their practice and to share their learning from the field. To the extent, then, that this book has been conceptualised as a practical resource, informed by a diversity of thinkers and âpractitionersâ, rather than an advanced theoretical or empirical discussion, we hope that its analysis and content will be of interest to a diversity of readers and will inspire further research, critique and engagement. Within this multi-layered set of concerns and constraints, many issues and questions are raised and, as much as possible, addressed throughout this book: Given the historical and political background of AfricaâEurope cooperation, how does research cooperation support diplomacy in general, and scientific diplomacy in particular? Where do scientific relations fit into the bigger picture of AfricaâEurope political relations? Furthermore, in what ways might the impact of technological innovation on scientific cooperation be more critically assessed? In an age of mass data flows, when international research is rapidly changing and researchers become increasingly mobile and have multiple affiliations, one is bound to ask whether concepts of nationality and regionalism retain their relevance and how these changes affect AfricaâEurope cooperation: do they exist, in any"
164,53,0.992,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","factors underlying poverty (Meinzen-Dick et al. 2004; von Braun et al. 2009, 44). These shortcomings led us to the development of a more inclusive and interdisciplinary research framework, that of marginality. Kant (1819) noted that a concept is a general representation that is common to several specific objects. Accordingly, the concept of marginality is an abstraction of the idea that the causal complexities underlying peopleâs living conditions interact in ways that are at systemic margins. These conditions are far from what would be considered optimal, in balance, just, equal, sufficient, good, or fairâattributes that describe conditions and positions in human life that are enabling and supportive, and that are used to define poverty. Despite the critiques of marginality in social science (Cullen and Pretes 2000; Del Pilar and Udasco 2004), the persistence of marginality as a concept (Dickie-Clark 1966) should be regarded as an indication of the demand to express observations of a similar kind across different epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina 1999), and to find solutions, here, to the phenomena of poverty. The problem of measuring the degree of marginalization is that the reference is not fixed or unknown, and therefore when used as a theory marginality has been criticized for the lack of construct validity (Del Pilar and Udasco 2004, 11). In their critique, however, those authors reviewed the use of marginality as a theory and came to the conclusion that âmarginality cannot work [as a theory] if it has multiple levels of meaning.â This critique of the marginality concept as a theory also rests on the belief that a concept must be a âuniform kind of mental representationâ (Weiskopf 2009, 145). Weiskopf rejects this assumption in psychology and outlines a pluralist theory of concepts in which they are constituted by multiple representational kinds. In the following we present a framework for the investigation of marginalityânot a theory of marginality. Although poverty can be observed in many different forms and is caused by many different factors, all forms of poverty can be described through the concept of marginality. Someone who is poor will always be marginalized in one or more dimensions, whereas the socio-cultural context and individual perception will define in which and in how many dimensions someone needs to be marginalized in order to be considered poor. The aim of establishing a concept of marginality is therefore to better understand the various causal complexities of poverty by deepening and broadening the scope of scientific investigation through: 1. identifying common causalities of poverty across scientific disciplines, and 2. including phenomena that are not typically considered as poverty or contributing to poverty alone (e.g., living in harsh or resource scarce environments). Deepening and broadening the scope of investigation thereby also includes incorporating theories and models from other (non-social science) epistemic cultures and scientific disciplines. In that sense marginality is not only a concept, but also a conceptual framework. It is a framework for different theories of poverty within which various models can be tested. Frameworks. Theories and models are understood as ânested set[s] of theoretical concepts, which range from the most general to the most detailed types of"

A coherent set of models is typically used for the quantitative analyses aimed at identifying and evaluating alternative beneï¬cial measures and strategies.

Drawing on these foundations, this chapter explores the use of such data in decision-making processes. It reflects on what data might be used for, how it is packaged, what the challenges are and what to consider in getting it right. It is intended to be a thought-provoking look at insights gained in communicating biodiversity science for policy purposes over the last several years. With a particular focus on indicators, one of the most common forms in which observations are used by decision-makers, the chapter considers the context in which indicators are used and how they are developed. It explores the realities of indicator development and use, including some of the key challenges and ways around them. It also touches on assessments and assessment processes as another important tool linking science to policy. Keywords Indicator development"

The SETAC Europe Working Group on LCM defined it as âan integrated framework of concepts, techniques and procedures to address environmental, economic, technological and social aspects of products and organizations to achieve continuous environmental improvement from a life cycle perspectiveâ (Hunkeler et al. 2004). UNEP brings the collaboration and stakeholder perspective, they see LCM âas a product management system aiming to minimize environmental and socioeconomic burdensâ¦ during the entire life-cycleâ¦relying on collaboration and communication with all the stakeholders in the value-chainâ (Balkau and Sonnemann 2010)."
216,276,0.992,Advances in Production Technology,"systems has to be expanded by adaptive target systems and by reactive systems behaviour (Brecher 2014, p. 3). This requires each element of the production system, i.e. human, technology and organization, to have adaptive capabilities. According to Frank (2004), this means that each element repetitively performs these steps: 1. Analysis of the present situation, 2. Determination of systems objectives and 3. Adaptation of systems behaviour. Humans are standing in the main focus of this approach. Consequently, the interaction of humans, production technology and organization elements is a topic under comprehensive study. However, these studies focus mainly on cognitive processes (Brecher 2014, p. 65; Mayer 2012; Mayer et al. 2013). Among other things, in the interaction of humans and technology the conformity of technology behaviour with the human operatorâs expectations is in the focus of these studies (Mayer 2012; Mayer et al. 2013). On top of this, holistic inclusion of humans for the purposes of ergonomic and industrial engineering research also requires direct consideration of the physiological processes involved. This is necessary in order to reach the optimum degree of integration of humans into a production system as demanded by Brecher (2011, p. 796) and, in this way, achieve the required increases in productivity. One possible approach to the inclusion of physiological processes in production systems in real time is presented and its results are discussed below."
269,130,0.992,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG), and other technologies are of course also possible.) The cognitive neuroscientist should be on hand to conduct the experiment and process the data; the psychologist should take charge of fine-tuning the protocol (sometimes the neuroscientist and the cognitive psychologist are subsumed within one person); the bioethicist should be there to soothe our consciences about any ethical implications of the study; the social scientist should be there to help assess the suitability of the sample and to comment on the generalizability of the findings; the philosopher should be there to ensure rigorous parsing and application of constructs (and to make the tea). The most important data to emerge are those produced through the coming together of the human experimental subject(s) and the scanner; these should be published in a neuroscientific journal (though ancillary publications that address other disciplinesâ concerns are of course welcomed). In short: what emerges here is a spatial imaginary centred on the model of a multi- (rather than inter-) disciplinary mix, a mix that will establish, it is hoped, a methodological and conceptual âlayer cakeâ. (We are employing here the usual distinction between the multi-disciplinary, in which disciplines line up alongside one another, from the interdisciplinary, which usually carries some commitment towards creating emergent, and novel forms of knowledge different from those contained within any one discipline.) Within this layer cake, each disciplinary layer has dominion over a particular kind of expertise, particular methods, and particular objects of knowledge. You can see this play out in numerous published interdisciplinary books and studies that address the mind and brain (see e.g. Goldman 2006; Slaby and Gallagher 2015). Joseph Dumit, we should note, has provided a powerful analysis of how cognitive psychology was brought into contact with PET to produce the interdisciplinary layer cake that became the foundation of the interdisciplinary field of cognitive neuroscience (Dumit 2004). We should not be unduly surprised, therefore, that the layer cake functions as the buttressing logic for other interdisciplinary endeavours involving the brain and mind. There are a few examples that depart from the layer cake genre. Roepstorff and Frith, for example, in elaborating a model of experimental anthropology âas a method, as an object of study and as a research aestheticâ, argue that joint engagement (doing things together) in research projects across the disciplines leads to the need for researchers of all stripes then to âbe sensitive both to the type of facts and the types of contexts produced by going experimentalâ (Roepstorff and Frith 2012,"

From this perspective, and aiming to deepen our understanding of such a construct, the aim of this working group was to discuss (and reflect upon) different theoretical perspectives, methodological approaches, and analytic methods used when focusing on such specialized advanced mathematical knowledge for teaching. In particular, we consider the activities of analyzing and conceptualizing situations where access and development of such teachersâ knowledge is of primary importance. Following work previously developed (in a DG at PME 34; Wasserman, Mamolo, Ribeiro, & Jakobsen, 2014), this workshop aimed at continuing and deepening the discussions. We had three slots. In the ï¬rst, a brief overview of the different perspectives of conceptualizing the specialized advanced knowledge for teaching was given by the proposed organizers, representing four different approaches and understandings of this construct. Afterwards, the participants were engaged in commenting, solving, reflecting on, and discussing two situations (one vignette and one episode) designed to access and develop teachersâ advanced mathematical knowledge linked with the tasks of teaching. This discussion aimed at discussing the participantsâ interpretations of the different aspects of advanced mathematical knowledge involved that can (potentially) be explored having the provided situations as a starting pointâand, in case of a need for changes in such situations, what would be the focus of such changes.

364,464,0.992,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract The current rate of human development poses a major threat to the ecological balance of the environment, and this is exacerbated by climate change effects. It is therefore important for people to understand the ecology of different locations so they can make informed decisions that will not have an adverse effect on the environment. In this regard, students form a significant group for whom sound ecological thinking is necessary as they will be the future leaders and decision makers who can ensure the worldâs continued sustainability. This chapter presents the results of an ecological education project that successfully expanded studentsâ ecological thinking. Evidence of this change is taken from interview responses before and after the ecological education project. The interview was based on a set of six photographs of different situations found in the environment. Responses were analyzed based on an ecological thinking framework developed by the researchers. This framework consisted of two components: understanding of ecology concepts and understanding of the impacts of human activity on ecosystems. The ecological education project succeeded in increasing studentsâ ecological thinking, thereby increasing their awareness of environmental risks.

169,638,0.992,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"21.6.1 Integration of the ES Approach into the WFD Although the ES concept is not yet explicitly mentioned in the EU Water Framework Directive, the aspect of ensuring the provision of ES is implicitly linked with the WFD objective of âreaching a good ecological statusâ (Wallis et al. 2011). The following WFD articles speciï¬cally refer to the valuation of ES (based on Wallis et al. 2011): â Article 5: assessment of the economic signiï¬cance of water use, current level of cost recovery â Article 4: decisions on derogations â Article 9: assessment of the level of cost recovery and incentive pricing â Article 11: selection of the most cost-effective sets of measures for achieving good ecological status/potential for the programs of measures The clear linkage between the WFD and its principles and the ecosystem approach is also shown by Vlachopoulou et al. (2014). They argue that it has the potential to act in a complementary way. It could, for instance, be applied for the evaluation of different management scenarios and thereby support decision-making processes. In particular, the more holistic management approaches that are supported by the ES approach, such as the spatial mapping of ES or the comprehensive evaluation of multiple beneï¬ts, can potentially assist in achieving the goals of the WFD (Vlachopoulou et al. 2014). In this context, Koundouri et al. (2015) propose an integrated methodology that regards the ES approach as the core aspect to achieve a more sustainable and efï¬cient water management. It combines the ES framework with traditional economic frameworks and consists of a socioeconomic characterization of the river basin area, an assessment of water use costs that are recovered, and a suggestion for appropriate measures for sustainable water management. In order to enhance the WFD implementation, Reyjol et al. (2014) established a list of research needs that also includes the reinforcement of the knowledge on relationships between good ecological status, biodiversity, and ES. They recommend enhancing understanding of ecological processes through developing further research on the links between good ecological status, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. As the ES concept is still not very well known among water policymakers and managers, they point to the need for easily comprehensible guidelines for these actor groups."
210,28,0.992,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"7 Final Remarks Research continues to show that the PSMT knowledge of mathematical content and processes is plagued with difï¬culties and low conceptual understanding of many concepts. However, the studies do not stem from a common framework regarding what must be required from prospective secondary teachers, and requirements established by researchers seems to vary in nature and depth. In this area, an important step forward would be the establishment of such frameworks (as suggested by Speer et al. 2015) and a common understanding of important steps in the development in PSMT mathematical knowledge (learning frameworks). Concerning knowledge of mathematics teaching, didactical knowledge or PCK, we seem to have an even more precarious situation, given the scarce number of studies in the ï¬eld and the fuzziness that still accompanies this notion. As the work of Kaarstein (2015) showed, PCK is an elusive notion, and its distinction of mathematics knowledge is often problematic. The large-scale national and international studies on teacher knowledge also point towards a very complex relation between PCK and CK. The studies on the impact of teacher education practices and the processes of how PSMT knowledge develops in teacher education programs suggest that the active engagement of participants in doing mathematics and discussing strategies and results has a positive influence in their mathematics learning. In addition, PSMT active engagement in preparing tasks, analyzing studentsâ work, giving feedback to students, and discussing with colleagues and teacher educators are also positive influences on their knowledge about mathematics teaching. Looking closely at studentsâ thinking is a major trend in the research carried out in the last ten years and may have an important impact on PSMT learning. When they are in ï¬eldwork placements, ICT may be a useful means for communication and interaction. For dealing with speciï¬c topics, we will probably need local theories that indicate what kinds of tasks, materials and environments promote a stronger development. Moreover, taking into account the complexity of mathematics teaching, we need to extend our teacher education practices into directions so that this complexity becomes transparent to PSMT. Addressing complexity in teacher education challenges researchers and educators to consider PSMT knowledge and its development under new more participatory theoretical perspectives."
72,132,0.992,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"To conclude, three epistemological issues raised by the development of the CRISES Database on Social Innovations should be mentioned. These relate to the nature, validity and interpretation of data. The case studies included in the database so far are mainly based on qualitative research methods that take into account the (inter)subjective interpretation of the phenomena under study (AnadÃ³n and Guillemette, 2007). This is reflected in the dominance of interviews as a way of learning about the point of view of key actors. To deal with this issue, the proposed database is designed to allow for a transition to a quantitative analysis of data, namely by reducing and formalising the information. Yet, how can it be ensured that their intended meaning does not get lost in the process? On the other hand, the creation of a database of case studies raises the question of the triple interpretation of data: that of the interviewees who provided the information to the researchers conducting the case studies; that of the researchers who collected, organised, analysed and published the data; and the interpretation of the team of researchers who re-conceptualised and organised the information from the case studies for the creation of the database. Given these multiple interpretations, what reading can be given of the results of the comparative analyses generated by the database? Finally, faced with these multiple levels of interpretation, how can the codification of normative evaluations be prevented, in other words, those comprising value judgments rather than facts? Nonetheless, the case studies all have a common focus: social innovation. Moreover, the three to four data collection templates used in the various research programmes at CRISES through time share many common concepts and dimensions of analysis. The case studies concerned observations that were relatively limited in time (thirty years) and space (QuÃ©bec). A number of contextual (institutional, demographic, sociopolitical, etc.) variables are, therefore, common to many of them. In short, the many case studies produced by CRISES constitute a source of knowledge and information that has been underutilised to date. Aside from representing a unique opportunity for research of its kind, the project to create a relational database requires formalising a conceptual framework of social innovation to advance the theoretical analysis underlying its work. To create a quantitative approach and a relational database is a novel way to research social innovation. It is a new way of gathering data in order to develop theories about the generation, emergence and life cycle of social innovations. Should other researchers in the world opt for a similar conceptual framework and relational database model,"

[21] point to another issue with the use of agile maturity models. They note that agile practices are customized for speciï¬c contexts where teams adopted different practices based on different circumstances. These circumstances do not lend themselves to the prescriptive practices & processes of maturity models and their associated requirements. Instead they proposed a generic checklist (âAgile Compassâ) that could be used to assess maturity without specifying practices and where âteams achieve maturity via an evolutionary pursuit of speciï¬c outcomesâ [22]. Consequently there is a growing appreciation of the factors involved in agile maturity that go beyond sets of practices to consider some form of cultural assessment that might also be included as part of the assessment process [28]. The literature varies from academic articles with large lists of personnel and human resource success factors for adopting agile [9, 14] to industry surveys of the State of Agile [65]. These articles do identify a wide range of cultural, organisational and people factors as key elements of the transition process. In particular Nerur et al. [50] examined the challenges of migrating to agile methods and emphasized that culture exerts considerable influence on decision-making processes, problem-solving strategies, innovative practices and social negotiations. Of interest is their indication that neither culture nor mind-sets can easily be changed pointing out that facilitating this shift will require the âright blend of autonomy and cooperationâ. In addition to the shift in emphasis to cultural and human factors is another recent consideration of transitioning to agile and the development of agile practices in a more incremental and responsive manner. Heidenberg et al. [31] developed a method based on multiple case studies in a large organisation that helps to pilot agile. They indicate that systematic piloting can be used to build experience and assist in the deployment of agile approaches. Ganesh and Thangasamy [25] indicate that a general guiding principle for implementation should be to maintain the facility to respond to changing requirements rather than following a speciï¬c set of practices. Gandomani and Nafchi [24] pick up this principle and propose a framework for Agile transformation and adoption loosely based on the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) or later PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) approach also known as the Deming wheel [11] which is itself a form of the scientiï¬c method âHypothesis â experiment â evaluateâ. This approach closely aligns with the agile philosophy of incremental and iterative development and involves continuous learning on the part of all stakeholders. The authors indicate that âthe outcome of the iterations are adopted practices and not deliverable product elementsâ [24]. This is contrasted with other adoption and transition frameworks which the authors claim are too complex and inflexible and require signiï¬cant organisational overhead."
166,36,0.992,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"of vulnerable people. As the preceding discussion testifies, conducting surveys of vulnerable sub-populations raises important questions about the extent to which conventional tools and procedures should be retained or adapted depending on the research context. This concerns all aspects of a research design from the methods used to ensure adequate representation of a particular target population, the tools developed for measuring pertinent theoretical constructs, to the procedures used to analyze the data. Alongside the various challenges involved in data collection described earlier, vulnerability research presents numerous measurement and analytical challenges to which methodologists must be able to respond. Vulnerability is multidimensional, which means that we have to care about measurement quality and not rely on single indicators. Statistical methodology also has to take into account this multidimensionality, by using adequate analytical strategies. Equally, as we have seen, vulnerability can be seen as the result of tensions between stressors and resources. The evaluation of social resources can refer to different types of capitals: economic and cultural, but is also linked to a web of social relations. In this sense, research needs to take into account âlives in contextâ, that is how individuals fit within their social networks and the characteristics of the social and institutional contexts within which these are embedded. All these features of the research domain present unique challenges for future collaborations between substantive and methodological experts. The rise in popularity of quantitative research into vulnerability has occurred at a time when survey methodologists are having to adapt the methods traditionally used to carry out surveys of the general population. This has been due to the deterioration of traditional sampling frames (particularly for telephone surveys), declining rates of participation, and rapid growth in information and communication technologies (Groves 2011). Survey research is changing. Paradoxically this revolution in how surveys are carried out comes at a time when survey methodology as a science has never been more knowledgeable or better equipped to both pre-empt and correct threats to data quality. Yet much of what has been learned so far has been derived from methodological research conducted alongside surveys of the general population. The empirical base is much more sparse for guidance about how best to survey those at the periphery of society, or how best to capture the dynamics of how individuals respond to major life transitions (whether they be normative or nonnormative). In the context of turmoil surrounding mainstream survey methodology, building up specialized areas of expertise around specific substantive research objectives, topics and populations of interest will be of paramount importance. Longitudinal surveys, such as the household panel surveys, are playing a key role in the vulnerability domain â particularly where funding is explicitly made available for methodological research (e.g. in the case of the Dutch LISS Panel, the UK Household Longitudinal Survey). Via this book, the LIVES projects, along with the Swiss Household Panel Survey, are similarly making essential contributions to the methodology of vulnerability research. A second argument for the essentialness of methodology concerns the use of the data themselves. The results of a survey are not simply âdataâ in the etymological"

169,792,0.991,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"reasons why ï¬sheries became unproductive and might remain so may originate from a range of sources both natural and social. To identify and explore the barriers and bridges to that integration, a range of social and systems sciences were applied to examine the effectiveness of ârepublican,â e.g., national, based on the French system, and traditional forms of governance and the potential to harmonize them. In addition, exercises in scenario development allowed managers and planners to explore potential paths of policy development. Finally, conceptual modeling afforded a systems analysis of the ecological, economic, and social factors that can individually or by interaction create opportunities or barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries management. The results were used to make recommendations for ï¬sh and water policies, in education (universities and governmental agricultural professional schools), and will have practical relevance for food security and health care (Melcher et al. 2013; Ouedraogo et al. 2014; Sendzimir et al. 2015). This chapter pursues the central question of the SUSFISH project, e.g., what is the long-term potential to establish sustainable ï¬sheries and aquatic ecosystems on which they depend in BF? SUSFISH embraced this question as a challenge wider than simply transferring the technical means to monitor ï¬sheries but in instilling and awakening a culture of healthy ï¬sheries that is broadly supported across Burkinabe society as well as in government policy. We begin by describing the scientiï¬c advances that the project used in application to establish bioindicators and monitoring methods as the technical base of ï¬sheries management.

Especially, it is the researcher who makes conceptual and definition choices and determines by these possible outcomes. Ison (2012, p. 145) stresses that (1) reflection about such steps in the making of research and (2) reflexivity about âwhy we do what we doâ are essential to link the researcherâs perspective with the âsituation outside of our selvesâ (Ison 2012, p. 147).

347,279,0.991,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Science-based advice is universally regarded and used as a primary trustworthy basis for environmental management and decision-making. However, at the same time, in many areas, there is an ambiguity and increasing concern about the sole dependence on expertise from the (natural) sciences, which often acts to the detriment of sufficient consideration of other knowledge claims, stakeholder perspectives and values held by actors such as NGOs, citizens or business people. Bijker et al. (2009: 1) have called this phenomenon the paradox of scientific authority and asked the question of âhow can scientific advice be effective and influential in an age in which the status of science and/or scientists seems to be as low as it has ever been?â One reason for this paradox lies in the fact that science becomes politicised whenever it is called into a political context (Weingart 1999) and is hence subject to constraints, i.e. rules, norms and evaluation criteria, other than those set by the scientific community. A basic challenge is that the demarcation that exists between the spheres of science and politics falls apart in such contexts, which consequently leads to concerns and potential conflicts about the legitimate role of science and its relation to policy. Both the role of science-based advice and the political decisions based on it may therefore become contested with respect to credibility, legitimacy and accountability (cf. Cash et al. 2003). In management practice, a distinction is often made between a science system (representing factual knowledge claims) and a social system (representing political, business and other concerns of public life) â a division that is inscribed in the institutional design of most policy systems in modern societies. Science is responsible for providing the best available knowledge in terms of a presumed value-free and objective input to political decision-making, which is accordingly seen as most rational and democratically legitimated (Funtowicz and Strand 2007; Wilson 2009). This idealised model of interaction between science and policy relies on what has been called the âideal causal chainâ of implementing scientific knowledge in policy processes (Fig. 8.1; Gezelius 2008). The ecosystem approach to management (EAM) is seen as a necessary and idealistic approach for managing marine resources and other environmental issues with regard to all five areas of environment and risks analysed here (Backer et al. 2010; Garcia et al. 2003; Hammer 2015).

170,85,0.991,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"1.2 Contradictions In the past, ICT4D programmes have tried to address the lack of evidence-based impact studies by strengthening capacities for research. However, increased capacity in the conduct of disciplined inquiry responds to methodological challenges only, not to the substantive. The substantive challenge involves addressing the innate contradictions encountered when embarking on information society impact research. The first of these contradictions deals with the dual nature of information society. By 2005, the international development assistance community had seen it fit to classify development programmes under two major categories: sectors and themes. Sectors include agriculture, health, education, environment, natural resources, etc. Themes involve crosscutting concerns such as governance, gender, poverty, sustainability, and climate change. When situated within the development arena, the information society is both a sector and a theme. Its sectoral dimension covers hardware design, software development, infrastructure expansion, universal access, information and communication policy, and knowledge products and services. Its thematic nature, on the other hand, is manifested in its crosscutting applications. ICT4D may be applied in any development sector. When used in agriculture, it becomes eAgriculture; in health, it may take the form of telemedicine; in education, it is referred to as ICT4E; and in the environment, its major application is geospatial information systems (GIS). Generally, when assessing development performance, programme evaluators would consider ICTs as belonging to a different sector altogether (information technology or telecommunications) and, hence, beyond their purview and concern. Although ICT impacts significantly on these programmes, sectoral evaluations tend to class it along with other control (i.e. ceteris paribus) variables and, thus, not sufficiently looked into. A second contradiction deals with the fact that information society impact cannot be disaggregated from outcomes generated by purely sectoral interventions. To be fair, information society impact research has been conducted early on (e.g. Batchelor 2003, 2006, Batchelor and Norrish 2005) and widely enough (see Heeks and Molla 2009). Proponents submit that the difficulty in establishing a direct link between information society and the MDGs is not due to the lack of impact evidence but to difficulties in disaggregating and attributing such impacts to ICTs alone. For instance, it is difficult to sift through macro-level economic data and directly link ICT interventions to significant change in income, equity, or environmental quality indicators. Information society impact may be somewhat likened to a coefficient whose exact value cannot be factored separately from a given product. A postmodernist would refer to this contradiction as the invisibility of information society within the development arena."

Thus, values, beliefs and symbols must be considered in the analysis of social action situations. Referring to our former discussion, one could say that the cultural system is the basis for information flows and communication process in social systems. Like the social system, the cultural system provides comparatively abstract structures that from the perspective of the individual may appear as given. While social structures provide institutions, Parsons calls cultural structures of symbolic signification generalised media of interaction. The prototype and most highly developed example of generalised media of social interaction is language. Parsons argues that social action situations can be seen as (action) systems, in which the personal, the social and the cultural systems are tied together and interpenetrate each other. At a later stage, he added the biological organism as a fourth system. All systems shape action situations by providing orientations (motivations, normative expectations, values, instincts) as well as structures (abilities/resources, rules, media, physical conditions). Social Systems as Communication Situations While Parsons developed his systems theory starting from the analysis of social action situations, the German sociologist and systems thinker Niklas Luhmann (1927â1998) has shifted the perspective to the analysis of the reproduction of social systems (Luhmann 2013). One could say, while Parsons is focussing on the single acts and social organisations at a given point in time, Luhmann is interested in the perpetuation and continuation of social processes in the flow of time. Central to his analysis is the connectivity of events. Rather than to ask how systems shape actions, he asks how systems emerge out of individual acts. Thus, his concern is less about the person that acts but more about the other actors that observe, interpret the act and may react or do not react. Accordingly, the central element of systems is not action but communication."
306,70,0.991,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Results of research related to secondary school pupilsâ conceptions of geometrical objects and relationships show that this knowledge is not well established. One of the reasons is the very poor recognition of the way geometric knowledge develops in the early educational stages. Fortunately, research related to early geometry has started to become increasingly important. This has happened in parallel with the conscious return of the teaching of early geometry in schools. Without denying the relevance of understanding numbers and operations for young students, it is essential to highlight the increasing role of geometric reasoning and examine its speciï¬city. Traditionally, the ï¬rst geometric phenomena presented have concerned the recognition and study of shapes, but there is also a need to pay attention to the relationship between shapes and their functioning in space. This opens up new ï¬elds of research, which also include educational aspects of geometry at the lowest educational levels. In addition, this draws attention to the need to create new theoretical foundations. These, in turn, call for consideration in geometric reasoning and affect both the research related to geometric phenomena other than what has been analysed before and the design of teaching. Geometry in a patterns environment can lead a child to the philosophy of mathematical thinking: â¢ from perception to deï¬nition and mathematical formulation and â¢ in ï¬nding the general in the particular. Research into childrenâs reasoning has shown that they are able to perceive a general rule and feel the universality of certain mathematical relationships and that these ï¬ndings are accompanied by deep emotions. We emphasize here that these tasks lead to conjecture and hypotheses and sensitize the relationships between concepts and teaching how to use these compounds. They provide an opportunity for achieving higher goals in mathematical education: reasoning, communicating mathematically, and using mathematical thinking, both in facts and skills or"

It has become in fact clear that some sustainable innovations (e.g. sustainable Product-Service Systems or sustainable social innovations) involve fundamental changes in culture, practice, institutional structures and economic structures, and thus they may cope with the current and dominant socio-technical systems [95]. For these reasons, a handful of design researchers have started to build upon system innovation and transition theories, e.g. see [41]; Kemp et al. [57, 94], to explore how design can address this issue. This resulted in an initial body of work exploring [20]: the development of a theory of design for system innovations and transitions [40]; how to design socio-technical experiments and transition paths [16, 18]; the connections between S.PSS design and system innovation theories [17, 19, 54, 55]; the importance of designing a multiplicity of interconnected and diverse experiments to generate changes in large and complex systems [52, 72, 79, 97]; the development of a curriculum on transition design for the ï¬rst time Irwin et al.

Target knowledge is defined as an understanding of actors, their interests, concerns and capacities, and it is developed on the basis of values and norms that guide decision-making. Social research may be used to describe the social sphere, but, again, the actors themselves share a detailed knowledge about its nature. So, the question whether and to what share fossil energy or renewable material-based resources shall be used in construction is one that is solved based on target knowledge. Finally, transformative knowledge provides answers about changing practices and institutions. While the first two types of knowledge are describing the status quo, and may help to define a desired future state, the transformative knowledge is crucial in order to describe a path, the operational steps from the current to a desired state (cf. Fig. 4.1). While the systems and target knowledge form a necessary prerequisite andâat least in principalâcan be undertaken in purely disciplinary scientific research manner, transformative knowledge can be understood as the essence of transdisciplinary research, in which multiple forms of scientific/ practical and multidisciplinary perspectives are combined and transformed."
344,2,0.991,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"The challenge of economic development is to simultaneously understand both which policy is the best to resolve a specific development problem and why and how these policies can be effectively implemented given the political, behavioral, and economic framework conditions in a specific country. Thus, to do good economic policies we need to go beyond economics. It draws on the research on the interface between politics, behavior (i.e., the incorporation of insights from psychology into policy design), and economics. Within IFPRI this research has been initiated by Peter Hazell and others in the early 2000s and led to the development and application of quantitative economic modeling tools for growth-poverty analysis in an economy-wide framework. The political process, however, has not been integrated in these economic modeling approaches. But, in political reality, identifying and pursuing technically sound policies is further constrained for political reasons, e.g., elected government has bias incentives to serve particular economic interest at the expense of the general public, or specific needs of the poor or marginalized groups are not sufficiently represented in the political process. Rather than lowering expectations when politics is a problem, technical experts and policymakers can use a better understanding of political incentives, knowledge, and behavior to improve outcomes. Similarly, behavioral economics brings new insights into how to craft better policies by offering new policy tools, improving predictions about the effects of existing policies, and generating new welfare implications. This is what this book tries to do closing this research gap via developing and applying quantitative approaches integrating political decision-making and behavior economics into existing economic modeling tools. In particular, it contains a selection of tools and methodologies that can help to tackle the complexities in the analysis of policy processes and outcomes under the implementation of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) agenda. However, the various contributions are not targeted only to experts and interdisciplinary scholars working on empirical or theoretical research using quantitative policy"
106,174,0.991,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Introduction Visual Analytics tools in the recent years have made an impact in the criminal intelligence and analysis communities. Histories of user interactions known as Analytic Provenance have been used to advance our understanding of tool usage and user goals in a variety of areas. User interaction histories contain information about the sequence of choices that analysts make when exploring data or performing a task. To understand how the analyses are being made it requires support of correlating lower-level events during analysis process with upper level sub-tasks, tasks and goals of decision making process as proposed by Gotz and Zhou (2008). Until recently, most of the research has focused on the techniques and methods for refining visual analytic tools, with the emphasis on empowering analysts to make discoveries faster and more accurately. Although this emphasis is relevant and necessary, we argue that the process through which an analyst arrives at the conclusion is just as important as the discoveries themselves. Understanding how an analyst performs a successful criminal investigation will finally let us start bridging the gap between the art of analysis and the science of analytics. We found out from the detection approach of behavioural marker from analytical data that they can bridge such gap alongside of performance measurement.

Utlimately, decisions to fund or initiate research may be informed by a consideration of the communicability of that research or by end user needs. Such considerations may, for example, inform the research strategy of a museum or an independent research organisation. They may also inform requests for research by funding agencies, either through the prioritisation of a particular theme or by requesting solutions to a particular problem. To capture the full extent of such knowledge flows we use the concept of translational research practice as a broad term for the flow of research insights from a researcher or a group of researchers to a broader community of other researchers and end users, and the feedback processes that come with the interaction. The concept of translational research is broader than the more commonly used term transactional research, which we define as the commitment of researchers to bring knowledge into social action, and is therefore a specific form of what we would identify as the role of the public intellectual. Transactional practice is well known from certain types of sociological work, which involves direct interaction with a community to empower a decision process. While transactional practice is certainly part of translational practice, the translational concept is broader since it includes the infrastructural, institutional and funding parameters of research. The translational concept also includes research practices, which are not dedicated to any type of direct intervention. Translational research practice is therefore a concept that is relevant to all of the humanities as regards the flow between the production of research and its appropriation. All research translation needs to happen through specific channels, and those channels may select what is good and relevant research and therefore ultimately decide what gets funded. Translation channels in the humanities typically involve:"

Our empirical ï¬ndings indicated especially change coordination as a main challenge in the case organisation. As suggested by related earlier studies [36], successful large-scale transformation necessitates coordination as well as unanimous buy-in from leaders in top- and middle levels of the organisation. As part of data collection, we participated in discovery sprint sessions that aimed to enable experimental, bottom-up aspects of transformation. Paasivaara et al.âs [3] case study indicated that the experimental transformation approach was applied also in Ericssonâs agile transformation. Based on our ï¬ndings, we believe that consistent use of agile discovery sprints practice can help the case organisation signiï¬cantly to change staff mindsets and organisational culture. Moreover, an âagile way of implementing agileâ, as suggested by earlier studies [2, 3], can increase the likelihood of a successful and sustainable transformation. However, in parallel, organisations must also sustain a certain level of control and coordination, so that bottom-up innovation and creativity are not only tacit but commonly shared knowledge that can beneï¬t other units in the organisation.

347,72,0.991,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"However, studies of guideline, assessment and advice documents linked to MSFD (Udovyk and Gilek 2014) and the HELCOM BSAP (Udovyk and Gilek 2013) reveal a rather limited acknowledgement and management of uncertainty. In fact, irreducible uncertainties associated with ecosystem dynamics and interdependencies are rarely mentioned in assessments and science-based advice (Udovyk and Gilek 2013). Similarly, there are hardly any references to strategies or methods for coping with such uncertainty. Instead, in line with the notion of achieving âbest available knowledgeâ, assessment and advice documents mainly acknowledge uncertainty caused by low precision and accuracy in methods and a general lack of scientific data for certain geographical areas and ecological endpoints. The general strategy applied for managing epistemic uncertainty is to obtain more data through an expanded monitoring network, with larger geographic and temporal coverage (HELCOM 2009a). Such a traditional empirical approach in science has in many ways been successful in and instrumental to reaching a consensual understanding of the sources and impacts of eutrophication and of the importance of various nutrients (e.g. Conley et al. 2009a; Elmgren 2001). However, for generating science-based advice on nutrient reduction requirements to reach environmental objectives, alternative modelling approaches would be needed to better control uncertainty associated with ecosystem dynamics (e.g. Udovyk and Gilek 2013). Interestingly, however, our interviews revealed a not so uncommon âdownplayingâ of model and scenario uncertainties in science-policy interactions linked to development of BSAP. Presumably, this can to some extent be explained by a common ambition among scientists (Baltic Nest) and decision-makers (HELCOM) involved to facilitate a regional agreement on nutrient reduction targets (cf. Linke et al 2014). A strong acknowledgement of uncertainty could in this respect have been a reason for disagreement rather than agreement. An overview of scientific studies on Baltic Sea eutrophication exposes several scientific disagreements on the sources and impacts of eutrophication that in various ways have had significant repercussions on stakeholder conflicts and management decisions at national and regional levels (e.g. Elmgren 2001). At an early stage of Baltic-wide eutrophication assessment and management, there was in the 1960s a lively debate on whether or not anthropogenic eutrophication of the open Baltic Sea was possible at all.

Enriching these empirical insights with relevant theory on how ecosystems emerge and develop, I have proposed a model that explains how ICT ecosystems can emerge in resource-scarce contexts despite the absence of important preconditions. The model shows how enabling processes can be drawn on to substitute and establish the condition factors. The recommendations developed below are addressed to governments, development stakeholders, and practitioners in resource-scarce countries that seek to move their young ICT ecosystem toward maturity. 1. Get the foundations rightâICT infrastructure, mobile payment, telecommunications market, and entrepreneurial support infrastructure The fact that technology ecosystems need, at the very minimum, ICT infrastructure, a way of handling payments, and a functioning telecommunications market is not surprising. What is surprising is the central role that the research presented here found entrepreneurial support institutions to play in catalyzing early industry emergence processes and establishing the conditions for entrepreneurship, particularly for developing human capital and creating interest in technology entrepreneurship.

The authors demonstrate the use of the Theory of Change approach to carry out a comparative analysis across projects seeking to bring about changes across diverse markets or market segments in different countries. Zazueta and Negi highlight how the evaluation focused on understanding the extent and forms by which GEF projects are contributing to long-term market changes, leading to reduction in GHG emissions, and on assessing the added value of GEF support in the context of multiple factors affecting market change. Chapter 10 written by Yann FrancÌ§ois and Marina Gavald~ao explore how climate change mitigation projects can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, potentially have adaptation benefits, and achieve sustainable development objectives. âIntegrating avoided emissions in climate change evaluation policies for LDCsâ provides an example of socio-economic benefits gained if accounting for avoided emissions are incorporated in projects, in this case, passive solar housing technology. Chapter 11 by Debora Ley, âSustainable development, climate change, and renewable energy in rural Central Americaâ, demonstrates the potential and multiple benefits of decentralized renewable energy. The author also demonstrates how specific drivers can facilitate or hinder projects in achieving multiple objectives using on the ground, qualitative methods. Chapter 12 by Jasmine Hyman, âUnpacking the black box of technology distribution, development potential and carbon markets benefitsâ explores whether and how carbon markets can support a pro-poor development agenda. The author introduces a âLivelihood Indexâ to understand the employment impact of a carbon intervention. Their study finds that variations in the distribution framework means that development outcomes may compete rather than complement one another. Methods used include value chain analysis and a qualitative analysis to understand how carbon finance recipients access the mechanism, perceive the project and conceptualise its benefits. Chapter 13 by Takaaki Miyaguchi and Juha Uitto presents the methodology of a meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations of climate change adaptation (CCA) programmes in nine countries using a realist approach.

191,332,0.991,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Conclusion The first aim of this chapter was to introduce a method for the analysis of interdisciplinary child rights justice systems. Most countries in the world have committed to the challenge of creating and adapting justice systems to successfully handle cases concerning child sexual abuse. Most countries also respect international instruments that require the implementation of the rights of children. The method of analysing interdisciplinary child rights justice systems offers a systematic approach to qualifying, understanding and critically discussing the interwoven processes and procedures at play within justice systems dealing with child sexual abuse. The outlines of the process diagram offer an important tool to illustrate the role and responsibilities of different agencies and should as such be relatively easily adaptable to other jurisdictions. The four main principles embodying the themes most important for childfriendly justice offer a constructive way to critically analyse and hopefully improve each step in the procedures. The second aim was to look more closely at Barnahus in Iceland and use the method to identify positive developments and remaining tensions and challenges. Our research confirmed, as other domestic research has also shown, that the establishment of Barnahus in Iceland was a radical improvement, strengthening the child perspective and in many aspects furthering safety, efficiency and collaboration (Newton et al. 2011). Research into the experience of establishing Barnahus in other Nordic Countries revealed the same results (see Bakketeig et al. 2012; Kaldal et al. 2010; Landberg and Svedin 2013; Walsh et al. 2008; ÃstrÃ¶m and Rejmer 2008).

243,42,0.991,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"(Hughes 1987), have drawn attention to the contests among the actors and their strategies for promoting their own solutions or interests. From such studies comes a set of concepts that help us understand the role of network effects, which are the mechanisms at play in interconnected setting with a large number of actors with different agendas and interests (Arthur 1989, 1990; David 1985). For instance, recognising that value is generated by the network, not the parts in isolation, and that initial moves in a particular direction encourage further moves along the same path, is crucial. While in early stages in the evolution of systems the path is relatively open, at later stages it becomes more bounded or may create lock-in situations. Earlier research has illuminated what we may call on the one hand socio-technical complexity (caused by technologies being deeply embedded into organizations, and organizations being deeply embedded into technologies, see e.g. Leonardi 2011) and on the other hand network-related complexity (caused by the unpredictable dynamics between a large number of connected actors without central control, see e.g. Williams 2016). Based on these insights, IS researchers have attempted to formulate different ways to think about and deal with large-scale, complex and interconnected information infrastructures â approaches that are sensitive to the presence of complexity. Based on a number of in-depth case studies in global organizations, Ciborra et al. (2000) challenge traditional management approaches based on a control paradigm and advocates more humble, iterative and incremental managerial strategies. âCultivationâ is a metaphor that serves to characterize this alternative approach, in contrast to the prevalent âconstructionâ mode based on detailed preplanning and tight control. A cultivation approach would prefer monitoring and intervention activities over strict control and ongoing adjustments over rigid preplanning. The evolution of the Internet is a paradigmatic example of technology development that has not followed the traditional managerial top-down approach. Hanseth and Lyytinen (2010) uses this case to derive design principles that are sensitive to (and exploit) the network effects that are a core defining feature of information infrastructures. To build (or grow) infrastructures is a challenging endeavour for several reasons: information infrastructures expand through integrating previously separate systems, however, integration is not only a technical concern of achieving interoperability, rather a process embedding political and institutional interests. For instance, in the context of national or regional e-health infrastructures, a large number of heterogeneous actors, including developers and usersâ organizations, are involved with diverging interests, which requires ongoing political negotiations (Sahay et al. 2009). In addition, large-scale infrastructural projects require adequate coordination mechanisms. Infrastructure development is characterized by uncertainty. It is basically an open process due to the many interdependencies that need to be dealt with. Furthermore, unintended side effects and the participating actorsâ reflexivity can add to the complexity (Hanseth and Ciborra 2007; Hanseth et al. 2006). Moreover, infrastructure development is a visionary and political process with a moving target. It deals with an extended time span, as infrastructures are designed today to address future and unknown needs of users."
287,57,0.991,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"of experiments or analyses from various views, using networking strategies to connect theories, establishing a common ground, doing complementary analyses, implementing inclusive methodologies, and producing common methodological and theoretical reflections (Bikner-Ahsbahs 2009; see Bikner-Ahsbahs and Kidron 2015; Artigue and Mariotti 2014). In contrast to TME, the foundation of a scientiï¬c discipline is not directly addressed in the networking of theories approach. Contribution to such a foundation is done by research connecting theories to solve problems and by additional meta-research of ï¬nal reflections on methodologies and research results. For example, in Kidron et al. (2014), the notions of context were compared and contrasted in the theories âAbstraction in Contextâ (AiC), âTheory of Didactic Situationsâ (TDS), and âAnthropological Theory of the Didacticâ (ATD). Since all three theories share an epistemological sensitivity, the comparison of the three relevant concepts, context in AiC, milieu in TDS and dialectic media-milieu in ATD, was related to the epistemological nature of the theories and made it possible to sharpen the notions of the three contextual concepts by comparing and contrasting their role in the theories. More generally, this case study showed three ways in which such a broad concept as âcontextâ can be theoretically speciï¬ed: as a core concept in TDS, as a developmental concept to answer the question of how media and milieu are interrelated in ATD, and as a variable counterpart of the theoretical core of abstraction processes in AiC. Empirical research within the networking approach has also led to new kinds of theoretical concepts lying at the boundary of theories. These boundary concepts (see Akkermann and Bakker 2011) make sense from different theoretical views, mainly in complementary ways. For example, the âepistemological gapâ (Sabena et al. 2014)2 is a phenomenon that may appear when the epistemic view of the teacher and that of the students differ in that the students do not have access to the same epistemological resources as the teacher. In their example, a student explored the graph of the exponential function and how it develops for big x towards inï¬nity. Using an asymptotic gesture, he described the way the slope of the graph increases towards inï¬nity. His resource consisted of observing the graph on the computer screen; the teacher, however, asked for a proof of contradiction for the statement that the graph of the function could not have an asymptote. The studentâs epistemological view was based on perception and the teacherâs epistemological view was based on logical arguments. They shaped an epistemological gap that the student could not bridge by himself. Two theoretical concepts were used in the analysis, the semiotic bundle concept and the concept of interest-dense situation. Both concepts integrated into a common methodology allowed for characterising and identifying this epistemological gap (Sabena et al. 2014)."

Thereunto, robotic toys that can express emotions and in this way they improve mood of lonely elder people. Humanoids are of a similar morphology like humans â they are constructed to communicate in a manner that supports the natural communication modalities of humans by â for example facial expressions, gestures, body postures, motion patterns, gaze direction or voice. The design of computational model of emotions is not based only on computing technology, but is closely linked to the research findings of many areas and disciplines that study human emotional processes. 1.2 Interest of computer science in emotional technology During the last decade, new findings of research in emotions from the areas of psychology and neuroscience have attracted the attention of scientists from the circles of computer science and artificial intelligence ([8], [33], [18]). The group supporting the belief that emotions play a key role in human cognitive processes is being extended, emphasizing its importance in problem solving and decision making processes. In particular, artificial intelligence, an area dedicated to modeling and simulation of cognitive processes, denotes a growing interest in emotions. According to [15], emotions present decisive element in modeling perception, learning, decision making, memory and resulting behaviors. The area of computer science has essentially two, sometimes overlapping, sub-areas which study and develop emotion technology â HumanComputer Interaction (HCI) and a newer area of Computational Models of Emotions (CME). HCI is a broad scientific discipline focusing on the interaction between man and machine, exploring ways to improve their relationship and cooperation. One of many current aims of the HCI is the development of engineering tools with the ability to measure, model and respond to emotions by developing algorithms, sensors or other software and hardware. For the most part, CME deals with the construction of biologically inspired mechanisms that simulate aspects of human emotional functions, such as the evaluation of emotional stimuli, the activation of certain types of emotions or the creation of emotional responses. Picard [35] proposes four main motivations for giving machines certain emotional abilities: 1. to build robots and synthetic characters that can emulate living humans and animals â for example, to build a humanoid robot,"
241,1275,0.991,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"services, such as ï¬re protection, public transport and disaster response (Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala 2006). Many Baltic Sea regions have developed adaptation strategies, but the processes involved can be hindered by uncertainties in the timing of climate change impacts as well as by a lack of knowledge and expertise (Ribeiro et al. 2009; Dannevig et al. 2012; Hedensted Lund et al. 2012; Jonsson et al. 2012; Juhola et al. 2012a; Nilsson et al. 2012). Further barriers include social and cultural inertia on individual and collective action and low priority of adaptation in relation to other policy agendas (Carter 2011) such as ï¬nancial, economic and social aspects, as well as climate change mitigation (Deppisch and Albers 2012). In addition, weak links across policy and administrative levels and lack of a coherent policy agenda can also slow the adaptation process, as in Finland (Juhola and Westerhoff 2011) and Sweden (StorbjÃ¶rk and HedrÃ©n 2011), see also Annex 2. Adaptive capacity plays an important role and is a prerequisite for a regionâs ability to adapt to climate change (Brooks et al. 2005). Adaptive capacityâthe ability or potential of a system to respond successfully to climate variability and changeâincludes adjustments in behaviour, resources and technologies (IPCC 2007). This varies greatly at the regional level within the Nordic countries (Juhola et al. 2012b). Knowledge facilitated by links with universities and research projects funded by the EU plays an important part in enabling adaptation at the sub-national level, for example in Germany (Frommer 2001), Finland (Westerhoff and Juhola 2010) and Sweden (Deppisch et al. 2011). Although this has enabled some regions to pursue adaptation strategies, the uncertainty of climate change impacts has slowed overall action on adaptation (StorbjÃ¶rk 2007; Carter 2011). Tools such as participatory vulnerability assessments and scenario workshops have been useful in communicating adaptation challenges to local stakeholders (Baard et al. 2012; Jonsson et al. 2012). Examples of city level strategies in the Baltic Sea area are summarised in Table 22.1. A review of adaptation strategies at the city level found that climate change is likely to exacerbate existing urban problems as well as to create new ones (Committee of the Regions 2011). The report made several recommendations: (1) urban adaptation strategies must be developed and build on existing sectoral and crosssectoral agendas; (2) urban adaptation requires new governance structures and innovative new solutions with the help of a wide range of stakeholders; and (3) no single type of measure is able to eliminate vulnerability to climate change, but a portfolio approach is likely to be most effective (Committee of the Regions 2011). Finally, the report emphasised that that approach should be staggered and iterative to achieve progress in the short term. There are many gaps in research concerning adaptation in urban complexes.

The ï¬rst, and perhaps the most important of these questions, concerns the nature of the role of phylogenetic systematics in conservation efforts. How do we value the Tree of Life? Why to use aspects of phylogeny in preference to other biodiversity variables? These questions are explored by Lean and Maclaurin in chapter âThe Value of Phylogenetic Diversityâ. They develop the idea that phylogenetic diversity plays a unique role in underpinning conservation endeavor and represents the foundation of a general measure of biodiversity. In a synthesis about the reasons and the types of values that should guide biodiversity conservation and qualify a general biodiversity measure, they propose that phylogeny is the only basis for large-scale conservation prioritization. They justify this argument by showing that phylogeny is the only guide for maximizing feature diversity (sensu Faith 1992) across many different taxa, and also is the best way to hedge our bets against uncertainties related to environmental changes and to humanâs future needs and values."
277,14,0.991,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"1.2.2 Knowledge Utilisation The second aspect of research-policy dialogues focuses specifically on the question of how knowledge is utilised in policymaking. Christina Boswell (2009; see also Chap. 2 in this volume) distinguishes different modes of knowledge utilisation. The most basic type involves the instrumental utilisation of knowledge and expertise, where research outcomes are directly taken as input for policymaking. It is this type of knowledge utilisation that is assumed in the notion of âevidence based policymakingâ. In addition to instrumental use of knowledge, Boswell distinguishes two symbolic types of knowledge utilisation. Rather than being used as input for decision-making, knowledge can also have a substantiating function for policymakers, whereby favourable knowledge and expertise merely provide support for already-decided policies. Besides substantiating policy decisions, research can also have a plainly legitimising function for policy actors and institutions. This legitimising function of research and expertise does not refer to substantive research findings themselves, but to the mere symbolic act of mobilising knowledge and expertise in order to claim authority over a particular policy domain or issue (see also Caponio et al. 2014 and Scholten and Timmermans 2010). Boswellâs landmark work on knowledge utilisation in migration policymaking in the United Kingdom, Germany and the EU (Boswell 2009) alludes to various important contextual factors that may help explain why, where and when a specific type of knowledge utilisation emerges. For instance, her examination of the European Migration Network revealed that this organisation primarily served to substantiate EU migration policies in the context of the fierce politicisation of this issue at the European level. In addition, her British and German case studies point to the relevance of the organisational structure of the policy domain. She claims, for instance, that the fragmented and contested nature of the migration policy domain in Germany helps explain why the role of the BAMF (Federal Office for Migration"

376,807,0.991,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","vided a definition of adaptation that specifically included humans: âthe adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunitiesâ (IPCC 2001). In this report, adapting to climate change was seen not only as reducing vulnerability to climate change but also as promoting sustainable development, development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Adaptation was characterized in terms of purposefulness (autonomous versus planned), timing (anticipatory, proactive, reactive), temporal scope (short versus long term), spatial scope, form (e.g., structural, legal, institutional), and criteria to evaluate its performance. Although the Third Assessment report did not discuss adaptive capacity with respect to rangelands, adaptive capacity was defined and that definition has been retained by subsequent reports (Table 15.1). In the Fourth Assessment report, adaptive capacity was recognized as being influenced by social variables, in addition to biophysical and economic resources (Adger et al. 2007). By the Fourth Assessment Report, the scientific and management communities had contributed an extensive literature that could be reviewed in chapters focused on the assessment of adaptation practices, options, constraints and capacity, and interrelationships between adaptation and mitigation. Adaptation rarely was implemented in response to climate change alone and high adaptive capacity did not, in general, lead to actions to reduce vulnerability to climate change. The report identified significant barriers to implementing adaptation that spanned the inability of natural systems to adapt to the rate and magnitude of climate change, but also constraints in technology, financing, cognitive and behavioral components, and social and cultural settings. With respect to ecosystems, adaptation options focused only on altering the context in which ecosystems developed and little attention was given to the human systems component. It was acknowledged that identifying adaptation responses and options for ecosystems was a rapidly developing field (Fischlin et al. 2007). However, it would take a reframing of adaptation in the context of risk to bring the ecological, economic, and social components into a more integrated framework. In the Fifth Assessment, the definition of adaptation became âthe process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects.â The definition expands on the human role. âIn human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effectsâ (Table 15.1). Though subtle, this definition is different from previous IPCC definitions in that there is intentionality to the adaptation action. It is not just the restoration of a rangeland ecosystem; the adaptation action includes specific consideration of climate change objectives in management. The definition of adaptation was further nuanced. Moving beyond adaptation categories of anticipatory and reactive, private and public, and autonomous and planned, only two types of adaptation were defined in the Fifth Assessment: incremental and transformational (Table 15.1). The report notes that adaptation options to date have been mainly incremental and stresses that adaptation may require transformational changes,"

Some ideas have proven valuable in the long term. This led several international actors to ensure their institutional development regarding peacebuilding also incorporated these ideas by encompassing âtraditional knowledgeâ, built on the experiences of international organisations in the ï¬eld, statesâ interests, bureaucratic tendencies, and resource limitations (Call 2015, 3). These âgood practicesâ are multi-faceted and include a commitment to establishing military, legal, political, economic, social, cultural and psychosocial conditions in a post-conflict society able to promote a culture of peace. They seem to be transformative in terms of changing the relations into sustainable partnerships. Thus, some authors (Lederach 2000; Pugh 2000; Stover and Weinstein 2004; Barnes 2006) contend that such actions should be contextual, meaning they take particular cultural and conflict contexts into account and that local civil societyâs participation and representation in the peacebuilding processes is vital. Hence, in theory the current prevailing view is there is a need for âa transdisciplinary mind-setâ that encompasses lessons and insights from many perspectives (multidimensionality and inter-disciplinarity) and creates a more contextual, inclusive and holistic peacebuilding theory, with practical applicability (Lambourne and Herro 2008). However, as Barnett et al. (2007, 53) point out, the problem of the conceptâs multidimensionality is that while all peacebuilding actors might support the idea of building peace, âthey will operate with considerable differences of interpretation regarding the meaning and practice of peacebuildingâ, since they will all adopt a meaning, activities and policies of peacebuilding that is consistent with their interests, worldviews and mandates. This may suggest that all international peacebuilding cooperation is inherently political and that different peacebuilding actors will act according to various strategies for achieving durable peace in a given post-conflict society that are not necessarily solely based on âbest practicesâ arising from experience. This indicates peacebuilding could ultimately be a political accomplishment that âmight be settled by bureaucratic and political powerâ (Barnett et al. 2007, 54). Moreover, the lack of a clear deï¬nition of the concept or accompanying strategy could produce an outcome which âcan be challenged by efï¬ciency, coordination and sustainability issuesâ (Duke and Courtier 2009, 4)."

This is an area where the HRM research coupled with our own contextual knowledge can add ï¬esh to the conceptual bones (framework). The fact that the economics model was not speciï¬cally designed to âï¬tâ the context to which we are now seeking to apply it perhaps explains this lack of speciï¬city which, in the case of the Ugandan health system, will have profound effects on its application.19 This is captured poignantly by MuÃ±oz et al. as a âdialectical dance between feasibility and desirabilityâ (MuÃ±oz et al. 2011: 198). Health workers, as agents, evaluate and formulate their plans in the context of their own experience of what works. CaÃ±ibano et al. (citing Teece et al. 2000) deï¬ne âdynamic capabilitiesâ as âthe ability to reconï¬gure, redirect, transform, and appropriately shape and integrate existing core competences with external resources and strategic and complementary assets to achieve new and innovative forms of competitive advantageâ (2006: 313). Furthermore, the process of acquiring or developing dynamic capabilities is a âcollective learning process from which an organisation improves its ability to achieve its goalsâ (p. 313). The reference here to learning as a collective process is interesting from the perspective of professional voluntarism and health partnership activity where learning, whether in the classroom or in one-to-one mentoring, is almost always seen and planned as an individual process (taking person X from point A to B along a continuum of measurable (quantiï¬able) learning outcomes. It would be interesting to assess whether developing more active forms of learning focused on collectives20 (multi-disciplinary teams within facilities) and working with their imagined realities may activate learning and improve outcomes. It is the interaction of intentions and action goals that drive the evolution of âdynamic capabilitiesâ. Capabilities in this model are certainly not reducible to genetic (inherited) capacities (such as intelligence). Rather they are informed by existing knowledge and constantly reshaped. Intentionality linked to goals is what âactivates the development of capabilities, the testing of new connections within a system, and, therefore, the generation of new knowledgeâ (MuÃ±oz and Encinar 2014a: 75). The âaction planâ model presents learning as a (hyper-)active process involving the âre-combinationâ21 of new knowledge with existing explicit and tacit knowledge. MuÃ±oz and Encinar describe intentions as âtriggering [ . . . ] driven learning processesâ conï¬guring connections which give"
253,181,0.991,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Mental models are cognitive-emotional representations of objects, object relationships and processesâin short, internal representations of the external world. The concept of mental models was ï¬rst used by the psychologist Craik [45], who postulated that people develop simpliï¬ed models of the functioning and processes of their environment in their minds. The models are used for orientation, understanding, reasoning and the prediction of events. Craikâs approach to mental models was later further developed by Johnson-Lairds [46] to describe and study deductive reasoning and language comprehension. In the cognitive psychology literature, there is widespread consensus [see also 47] that mental models are dynamic in nature and can be described in terms of three central characteristics. First, mental models are created in the working memory and enable individuals to simulate possible actions and their consequences [1]. Thinking is thus the manipulation of mental models. Second, mental models can represent the cause and causal relationships. They generate a causal understanding of how systems function [48]. Third, mental models can change over time due to experienceâi.e. they are capable of learning. The quality of the models and the conclusions based on them continue to develop through speciï¬c learning experiences [49]. With increasing expertise, the understanding of technical matters moves from concrete to abstract representationsâa relevant factor for the human-machine interaction. The applied ï¬elds of study such as technology design in some cases follow different interpretations of the deï¬nition of mental models [see also 1] which can be explained by the different activity contexts. Yet even earlier work underscored the signiï¬cance of the concept of prediction and the understanding of human behavior in interactions with technical systems [e.g. 50]. Mental models are thus based on context-speciï¬c expectations and prior experience as well as the current perception of system characteristics. They form the foundation of the userâs understanding of the system and decision-making. This means that both the error-free use and trust in technical systems is largely determined by the degree to which the functioning of the machine is compatible with the userâs expectations [33]. Compatibility in the context of mental models is deï¬ned in terms not only of operability, but also the userâs experience and general acceptance of technology. Zhang and Xu [51] postulate in this regard a modiï¬cation or restructuring of existing mental models with the introduction and use of new technologies. A lack of compatibility can lead to frustration and negatively impacts acceptance and diffusion rates [52]. However, if new systems correspond with expectations (i.e. the existing mental models), this results in heightened system trust and a positive user experience [53]."
347,310,0.991,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"(policymaking), as a result of a historic path dependency, that in turn causes various forms of institutional inertia (Hegland and RaakjÃ¦r 2008; Wilson 2009), even though recent developments with the RACs such as the Baltic RAC may gradually change the picture. This path dependency and the resulting inertia of science and policymaking can also be seen in the chemicals case, where the traditional primacy of risk-based approaches (e.g. the âTDG machineâ) is strong. This phenomenon cannot be observed to an equal degree either in the case of eutrophication, where the NEST-HELCOM model offered a comparatively new approach of science-policy interaction, or in the emerging domain of IAS, where an institutionalised form of assessment-management interaction is not yet in place. Furthermore, well-developed institutional structures as they presently exist for EU fisheries management also seem to allow for the establishment of improved deliberative processes, which at least potentially could result in improved analysis of the socio-economic dimensions of the respective domain of marine governance (cf. Linke and Jentoft 2014; Urquhart et al. 2014). However, apart from an incremental âopening upâ of the linear science-policy structures in fisheries, we cannot find such tendencies developed to a similar extent for eutrophication, IAS, chemicals or oil transportation. In the cases of eutrophication, IAS and chemicals, it may also be substantially harder to identify clear groups of actors definable as âlegitimate stakeholdersâ to be included in the policy system than when one particular group of actors, for example, âresource usersâ (fishermen) or oil transporters (shipowners), can be defined as such and often accused of causing problems e.g. by the media. A rather clear identification of legitimate stakeholders, as we see in fisheries management, is not apparent in the cases of eutrophication (where farming only represents one of several important nutrient sources), chemicals (with a complex web of chemical producing and using actors), IAS or oil transportation. Regarding uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements, the observed assessmentmanagement interactions do not seem to adequately address the key challenges posed by the different states of knowledge as described in Fig. 8.2 and the sociopolitical ambiguities involved. With regard to management responses dealing with different forms of uncertainty and stakeholder conflicts, thorough analyses of the specific risk characteristics are not apparent, i.e. of the social and natural knowledge requirements or of the suitability of different management strategies such as a traditional science-based assessment, a precautionary approach, deliberative methods for stakeholder participation or extended peer review, etc. (see Sect. 8.2 and Fig. 8.2). Instead, all the studied assessment-management interactions can be classified as building primarily on traditional science-based assessments, which are then applied to policy- and decision-making (Table 8.1). We see, however, a number of ongoing changes and developments in each of the cases that illustrate adaptive responses to the key management challenges studied here. For example, we detect advancing processes of deliberation and stakeholder inclusion in both the science and management sector in the fisheries case, as an attempt to deal with the principal challenges posed by uncertainty in assessments and management, as well as to address conflicts of interests among the key actors. Concerning eutrophication, we can see similar challenges emerging (i.e. stakeholder"

What exactly is the role and importance of spatial representations for the construction of sociocultural realities in the past, present and future? How does the digital revolution change the historically established societyâspace relations? What are the spatial implications for the formation of knowledge? Is the term environment an abstract category, a social macrophenomenon, a local cluster of individual factors of influence, or a localized culture? How can one measure an environmentâs impact on action and knowledge production (Meusburger, 2015a)? These and other questions indicate that relations between knowledge, action, and space are not as simple as some people might assume or as some decision and risk models or traditional rational choice theories suggest. The questions simultaneously underscore the urgent need to explore the interdependencies of knowledge, action, and space from different disciplinary angles, scales of analysis,3 time dimensions,4 and ontologies. The main ambition of this book is to contribute to the clarification of the linkages between knowledge, action and space beyond the well-established models. To redeem this claim it is first necessary to overcome the problematic legacy of homo oeconomicus and traditional rational choice theories and discuss some of the reasons why the spatial dimension was neglected or played only a marginal role in action-centered social theories. If we want to deepen the insights into the relations between action, knowledge and space, then the spatial dimension needs as much theoretical inquiry as the relations between knowledge and action (see the chapters by Werlen (Chap. 2), Ernste (Chap. 3), Olsson (Chap. 4), GardenfÃ¶rs (Chap. 12), and Berthoin Antal and Friedman (Chap. 13) in this volume)."

In particular, the subjects of consciousness and perception present unique challenges in the attempt to build a unifying understanding bridging between the micro-, meso-, and macro-scales of the brain and psychology. This chapter outlines an integrated view of the neurophysiological systems, psychophysical signals, and theoretical considerations related to consciousness. First, we review the signals that correlate to consciousness during psychophysics experiments. We then review the underlying neural mechanisms giving rise to these signals. Finally, we discuss the computational and theoretical functions of such neural mechanisms, and begin to outline means in which these are related to ongoing theoretical research."
90,25,0.991,"Informatics in the Future : Proceedings of the 11th European Computer Science Summit (ECSS 2015), Vienna, October 2015","Just as the old controversies were settling a new challenge to computingâs identity began to appear. There were a growing number of references to ânatural computingâ, meaning computational processes in nature. One of the influential pioneers was Nobel laureate David Baltimore, who claimed that biology had become an information science (Baltimore 2002). Others argued similar things for economics, physics, chemistry, cognitive science, and other fields in the physical, life, and social sciences (Kari and Rozenberg 2008). The rapid emergence and development of natural computing is an amazing turnaround from the 1960s, when Simon argued that computing is a science even if it studies artificial phenomena, and when many others believed that the field of computing is fully reducible to mathematics. Today scientists in other fields are saying that their fields include information processes that occur naturally. They are telling computer scientists, âWe have information processes too!â This shift has led to a new definition of computing as a discipline as the study of information processes, both artificial and natural. This definition is important because it shifts the focus from the computer to information processes and their transformations. It is also a much more inclusive definition that allows for the computational branches of other fields, including the natural sciences. This definition also accommodates the three intellectual traditions embedded in computing, which we mentioned earlierâtheory, design, and abstraction. The theoretical tradition focuses on mathematical relationships and proofs. The design tradition focuses on the design and construction of computational circuits, machines, systems, and software. The abstraction tradition focuses on experimental work to test algorithms, validate software, find workable system configurations, and support design choices; it was advocated early (Feldman and Sutherland 1979; McCracken et al. 1979) but took many years to develop and earn a stature comparable to the theory and design methods. A combination of these three traditions gained wider currency in computing when other fields acknowledged computing as a third way of doing science and developed computational branches (Denning and Martell 2015). The 1980s experimental computer science debates, which brought methodology to limelight, were supported in the mid-1990s by methodological meta-analyses, fashionable in many other fields. Many people and research groups analyzed journal articles and conference papers in computing and other fields in order to describe methodology in computing and compare computing research with research in other fields (Tedre 2014). Those meta-analyses found great methodological differences between computingâs branches, but also revealed widespread disregard"
197,61,0.991,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"research or commentary on EU-level approaches to combat energy poverty or the impact of EU energy policy frameworks upon social inequality. The few exceptions are Darbyâs (2012) study on the impact of EU metering policy upon fuel-poor households, Bouzarovski, Petrova and Sarlamanovâs (2012) critique of EU energy poverty policies, Bouzarovski and Petrovaâs (2015b) exploration of EU energy poverty work in the context of EU agenda-setting, Hitevaâs (2013) examination of renewables policy and its implications for energy vulnerability as well as Thomson, Snell and Liddellâs (2016) discussion of definitional issues surrounding energy poverty in the EU. Also of relevance is Dubois and Meierâs (2016) work on how energy poverty patterns in Europe are of relevance for policymaking processes. International-level institutions and organizations active in energy policy have offered a number of assessments and analyses of the energy vulnerability challenge, taking a global perspective and tending to focus upon access to energy in developing countries and the global dimension of security of supply. Such policy recommendations are not generally specific to any given country or system, and do not comment on the construction of EU policy in this area. Similarly, national-level organizations have tended to analyse national-level policy and prevalence, making reference to the EU only where specific laws and regulations are derived from Brussels, such as the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED). For a long time, EU-led policy research in the energy poverty domain was relatively absentâas reflected in the lack of attention devoted to the problem in work by the European Parliamentary Research Service, its internal think tank and the Commissionâs Joint Research Centre. As is argued in the text that follows, however, this situation has started to change in recent years. The chapter is chronologically structured, mapping the evolution of energy poverty policy over time, but drawing out key thematic issues and exploring these in more depth when relevant to the key aims of the book. After walking through the foundations of the modern policy framework, the organization of the argument reflects the three main âsourcesâ of current energy poverty policy, identified as the Third Energy Package (TEP), the EED and various social policy provisions (European Commission, 2013c). A final section provides an analysis of the governance structure that now characterizes energy poverty policy, before short conclusions are offered. Firstly, however, I examine the broader context of EU energy policy and law, which frames energy poverty policy."
315,16,0.991,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"comparative approach allows researchers to distinguish the effects that given sociocultural opportunities and constraints have on the trajectories of migrantsâ children from the effects of either individual characteristics and actions or the close social environment. The life course of migrantsâ children in modern societies is molded by the host countryâs institutions and structures (e.g., educational systems, patterns of employment, and national welfare-state regimes), and by the familiesâ migration histories, cultures, and values. Comparison means explicitly modeling the way in which different kinds of institutions affect behavior. Comparison is crucial in identifying both the influence that specific institutional contexts have on the processes under examination and the extent to which lifecourse mechanisms can be generalized across contexts. It is also important for researchers to step away from their usual sociocultural settings to gain perspective through confrontations with other empirical settings. Comparison is therefore a potentially key methodological tool in studying the trajectories and situations of the children of immigrants. The first requirement for comparing is a clear definition of the object of comparison. In the following, we discuss the multiple definitions of âchildren of immigrantsâ to determine which kinds of populations and which geographical settings are relevant to a meaningful comparison."

This proposition enlarges the range of applications of the PD framework, making it a very useful tool for monitoring changes in biodiversity and warning about important changes in abundance before species become actually extinct. This framework is based on Hill numbers, describing the âeffective number of speciesâ found in a sample or region. Here Chao et al. provide a rich overview of abundance-based diversity measures and their phylogenetic generalizations, the framework of Hill numbers, phylogenetic Hill numbers and related phylogenetic diversity measures. They also review the diversity decomposition based on phylogenetic diversity measures and present the associated phylogenetic similarity and differentiation. With a real example, they illustrate how to use phylogenetic similarity (or differentiation) proï¬les to assess phylogenetic resemblance or difference among multiple assemblages either in space or time. Phylogenetic reconstructions often result in different near-optimal alternative trees, particularly due to conï¬icting information among different characters. What do we do as conservation biologists when the phylogenetic reconstruction leads to multiple trees with conï¬icting signals? This problem is here addressed by a contribution by Olga Chernomor et al. (chapter âSplit Diversity: Measuring and Optimizing Biodiversity Using Phylogenetic Split Networksâ) with a proposition of combining the concepts of phylogenetic diversity and split networks in a single concept of phylogenetic split diversity. They show how split diversity works and design its application and the computation solution in biodiversity optimization for some well-known problems of taxon selection and reserve selection, exploring how to include taxon viability and budget in this kind of analysis. The extent to which sampling effort might inï¬uence the rank of conservation priorities is long recognized as a central issue in selecting areas for conservation (Mace and Lande 1991; Mckinney 1999; RÃ©gnier et al. 2009), but has so far remained practically untouched in the study of conservation of phylogenetic diversity. Here we have the opportunity to present three different approaches to this problem. The convergence of these independent studies shows the importance of this subject and the recognition of the urgency of searching for solutions. In chapter âThe Rarefaction of Phylogenetic Diversity: Formulation, Extension and Applicationâ, David Nipperess deals with this question in the PD framework by further developing the rarefaction of PD ï¬rst proposed by Nipperess and Matsen (2013). Here he provides a detailed formulation for the exact analytical solution for expected (mean) Phylogenetic Diversity for a given amount of sampling effort in which whole branch segments are selected under rarefaction. In addition, he extends this framework to show how the initial slope of the rarefaction curve (âPD) can be used as a ï¬exible measure of phylogenetic evenness, phylogenetic beta-diversity or phylogenetic dispersion, depending on the unit of accumulation. In chapters âSupport in Area Prioritization Using Phylogenetic Informationâ and âAssessing Hotspots of Evolutionary History with Data from Multiple Phylogenies: An Analysis of Endemic Clades from New Caledoniaâ, the question of resampling and support of the dataset for deï¬ning priority areas is studied in the framework of evolutionary distinctiveness (ED).

106,153,0.991,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Discussion and Conclusion Our aim was to construct an initial, descriptive, practical, hybrid argumentation model which should assist end-users (as criminal intelligence analysts) with the formulation of assessments in uncertain sense-making environments. We wanted to create an argumentation model that describes the different activities spanning both cognitive and physical, thus making this a hybrid model. The main reason for deviating from the established literature on argumentation formulation, such as described by Bex et al. (2006), is that the established research supports a very rigorous approach to evidential reasoning and may not support our end-users sufficiently with the creation of defensible assessments, in environments that are influenced by high uncertainty, constant change and lack of supporting information. We have therefore conducted numerous studies, as outlined in the previous sections, to understand how end-users in these uncertain sense-making environments make inferences, create mental models of observations and how they externalise these unconscious processes. By combining the results of our various studies, we were able to construct an initial, descriptive, practical, hybrid, argumentation model that outlines the first order concepts and their sub-components that we deemed as significant (See Fig. 8.3)."

More consideration needs to be given to understanding and predicting embankment breaching as this will become more likely over time if no planning is undertaken. Upgrading the embankments, as already proposed in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, is one approach, combined with other actions such as improved warning systems (Dasgupta et al. 2014). More fundamentally there is a need to develop more sustainable long-term delta-scale management techniques that utilise sediments and sedimentation in new ways. This is large-scale controlled (or engineered) sedimentation within polders as well as working with morphodynamic processes to build land elevation and sustain natural ecological functions such as fisheries spawning (Amir et al. 2013; Auerbach et al. 2015). âTidal river managementâ has only been employed locally to date, and to be successful would require both fundamental scientific investigation of morphodynamic processes and the development of innovative large-scale engineering application. In addition to the technical dimensions of these policies, the social dimensions will also need to be considered such as education and training, infrastructure development and targeted financial support to the poorest of the poor. Ignoring these social dimensions is likely to impede or stop their application. In addition to the insights obtained, the method itself is worthy of consideration. The hybrid integrated framework and method has allowed a move away from an ad hoc external expert or purely indicator-based approach. It provides an opportunity not only to explore the interactions between domains of knowledge as diverse as oceanographic modelling and perception-based assessments of well-being but also to incorporate the views of stakeholders throughout in ways which maintain the relevance and credibility of the findings, despite their complexity. The assumptions are explicit and have been debated and challenged as part of this co-production process, and changed as knowledge has grown and the detailed questions being posed have evolved with this understanding. Hence, it provides an explicit framework to analyse the problem and provide spatially explicit output. In particular, it forces the users to identify, consider and explore the limits to knowledge of the relevant system. Such reflection is critical in problems where gaps and limits in current knowledge need to be acknowledged and addressed. It should be noted"

Interestingly, Boswellâs case studies suggest that we should study knowledge utilisation and policy-research structures at two different levels. On the one hand, there is the more generic level of national cultures of knowledge utilisation, with different traditions in the UK and Germany for example, that may explain the frequent incidence of certain forms of policy-research dialogues. On the other hand, the particular culture and practices in a specific domain and a specific institution may in reality turn out to be quite different from what one may expect on the basis of national cultures and traditions. For instance, whereas the specific British case revealed a great interest in policymaking based on knowledge and evidence, in reality research mostly served substantiating purposes rather than having a legitimising or instrumental role. Boswellâs exploration of these contextual factors further underlines the necessity of more conceptual and empirical work that connects knowledge utilisation to the issue of how research-policy relations are structured in the first place. What could the possible effects of politicisation be on utilisation of knowledge and on research-policy dialogues? Following Boswellâs typology of knowledge uses and our observation that technocratic modes of dialogues are often associated with direct instrumental forms of knowledge utilisation, we formulate as the second hypothesis for our empirical analyses that, when issues like migrant integration become politicised, such technocratic structures and instrumental forms of knowledge utilisation are less likely to emerge and to survive. Instead we would then expect rather symbolic forms of knowledge utilisation, substantiating as well as legitimising ones."

Context: Free and Open Source Software usually results from intricate socio-technical dynamics operating in a diverse and geographically dispersed community. Understanding the fundamental underpinnings of healthy and thriving communities is of paramount importance to evaluate existing efforts and identify improvement opportunities. Objective: This paper presents a novel reference model for evaluating the maturity of FLOSS communities by mixing quantitative and qualitative methods. Method: We build upon established guidelines for Design Science research in order to devise a well-informed and expressive maturity model, describing how those methods and procedures were used in the design and development of such a model. Results: We present the model structure and functions, as well as instructions on how to instantiate it as evaluations of FLOSS communities. The use of the proposed maturity model is demonstrated in four FLOSS communities. Conclusion: Whilst instantiating the model may be burdensome if aiming at sketchy evaluations, results indicate our model effectively captures the maturity regardless aspects such as community size and lifetime.

RVA concerns almost always specialised advisory, administrative and pedagogic (or mediating) processes, as well as differing types of valid evidence and assessment. The discussion on methods is closely linked to the challenge of interpreting standards, in particular how the concepts of learning outcomes and competences underpinning reference frameworks are understood and applied. The important issue in quality and transparency of assessment and recognition processes relates to developing methodologies for making visible kinds of knowledge that have long been excluded from mainstream curriculum or standards development processes and that have meaning and relevance for individuals, societies and economies. Quality also implies a shift to education and programmes that are more demand-driven rather than supply-driven; where individuals are not mere receivers of education and where motivated individuals have an interest in continuing to learn. Building upon the UN framework of indicators regarding the international right to health, it will be useful to include âprocessâ indicators in order to study features of best practice and quality of RVA mechanisms. According to Stecher (2005), process indicators provide a better picture of the quality of services and better"
298,11,0.991,The Globalization of Science Curricula,"for labor force, the mobility of people, and the influence of intergovernmental agencies, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or the European Union, are promoting increasing similarities among countriesâ education systems and curricula. Supranational organizations, such as the World Bank, may also exert their influence on educational systems, particularly in developing countries. But is education around the world really becoming increasingly similar? Does evidence exist to support the notion that the curricula developed by ministries of education and educational practice in schools are increasingly conforming to a set of âinternational standardsâ and, if so, is it possible to identify these benchmarks? Where research studies on the globalization of curricula do exist, they have tended to focus on mathematics curricula as opposed to science curricula (Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2009; Zanini and Benton 2015). Science education is an important subject to investigate from a global curriculum perspective because science has always been an international discipline, with important discoveries and advances being made all over the world, but with the need for a central body of understanding for these to be interpreted and presented as a school curriculum. Therefore, internationalized thinking has long been an influence on the development of science curricula, arguably more so than in subjects such as literature or history, which are more likely influenced by national cultural and historical perspectives. Many of the topics taught as science in schools are directly influenced by global factors, such as human health and disease, environmental impacts including climate change, and the future of food and energy supplies. It can also be argued that scientiï¬c development is the predominant driver of economic growth and quality of life. Consequently, understanding how science is intended to be taught provides insight into how future citizens are taught about the nature and role of scientiï¬c advances. The IEAâs Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has collected extensive data on intended mathematics and science curricula of participating countries since the 1990s (Mullis et al. 2016). While the intended curriculum is not necessarily what was implemented or achieved, it nonetheless has a strong influence on the implemented and achieved curricula of an education system. Twenty years of collected data provides a valuable opportunity to directly explore the effects of globalization on countriesâ science curricula over time. Given the global nature of science and science curricula, this study aimed to address three central research questions: Have there been changes in intended science curricula over the last 20 years? To answer this question, we conducted a coding exercise in which changes in the intended science curriculum of countries participating in TIMSS were tracked using responses to the TIMSS curriculum questionnaire. This not only enabled the identiï¬cation of changes in the curriculum but also enabled the nature of changes to"

Despite the apparent novelty of social innovation as a construct or set of discourses, humans have experimented and achieved disruptive and durable social change repeatedly over time.

264,259,0.991,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"Issues of Generalization Establishing productive relationships between fundamental research and action obliges one to address the difï¬cult issue of generalization. I have already evoked one case in which generalization was out of range under the current institutional conditions and constraints with the research on differential equations. However, understanding difï¬culties of generalization in the ï¬eld both requires âverticalâ analyses of conditions and constraints as the one I have sketched above, and âhorizontalâ analyses, according to the distinction we introduced with Winslow in our meta-analysis of comparative studies in mathematics education (Artigue & Winslow, 2010). The main reason is that mathematics education is a ï¬eld geographically and culturally situated. As stressed in (Artigue, 2016), we all know today, even when we belong to dominant culturesâmine is certainly one of them in the ï¬eld of mathematics educationâhow our insufï¬cient sensitivity to the diversity of social and cultural contexts has been the source of hegemonic visions and abusive generalizations and exportations (see, for instance, Nebresâs, 2008 contribution at the Symposium organized for celebrating the centennial of ICMI). This does not mean that didactic research does not identify regularities, such as didactic phenomena that transcend cultural speciï¬cities, for instance, the necessary existence of a didactic contract in any didactical situation, which others might call socio-mathematical norms; the speciï¬c economy and ecology of taught knowledge that regulates the processes of didactic transposition that cannot be reduced to a"
170,243,0.991,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4 Synthesis and Implications This chapter proposed an analytical framework in order to guide the assessment of ICTâs impact on wellbeing. We argued that the amount of polysemy and lack of common basic guidelines in ICT fields constitute one of the main barriers for the incorporation of ICT into a broader research problem spectrum (outside the ICT researchersâ communities) and, consequently, to widen ICTâs impact research. After a synthesis of the historical development of the digital divide concept, we discussed and developed two plausible analytical models to assess ICTâs impact on wellbeing, finally opting for a framework based on Selwynâs approach. We supported the idea that the testing of any ICT-related hypothesis should analyse, at least and when possible, three stages of hierarchical digital achievements (access, usage and appropriation) plus one last divide stage: ICTâs outcomes (measured by the effect of previous stages on the dependent wellbeing variable). Finally, we propose five guidelines for the applications of this framework and present an actual case of use, showing how this framework guided the research design in a study of the effect of e-skill on education-to-work transitions: use an up-to-down strategy from higher to lower stages of the divide, start from a theoretical relevant perspective, assess the possibilities the data or research instruments enable for each stage and repeat this strategy for the lower levels of digital inequalities. To conclude, we would like to emphasize that this document does not aim to become a final analytical framework to research ICTâs impact on wellbeing as it is only a first and basic guide for orientation purposes. We conceive this document as a first step in the task of expanding ICTâs impact research and discourse outside the information society and ICTD community. It is our belief that there is a need to construct quality and cost-efficient research instruments that will enable a wider spectrum of social researchers, those not focused on information society, to introduce ICT assets (access, usage, appropriation) as independent variables to their studies. This would also enhance our opportunity to study ICTâs impact in a much wider and more diverse array of subjects.

In particular, the structure of a communication network has a significant impact on its capacity to aggregate decentralized information within a political elite. Moreover, network structure also determines the influence of individual organizations on the policy beliefs of relevant politicians and hence the direction of the bias of political decisionmaking. Few studies have explicitly mapped out the above processes in explaining the poor past performance of policy reforms and investment strategies, particularly in the agricultural sector. Most have offered narratives based on historical accounts, pointing to the strong role of powerful personalities, vested interests, corruption, and external pressures, in influencing policy outcomes (Clay and Schaffer 1984; Juma and Clark 1995; Keeley and Scoones 2003; Young 2005). The challenge of analyzing participatory and evidence-based policy processes empirically is to develop an applicable model framework that allows for quantitative modeling of political decisionmaking and policy-learning processes, including the endogenous formation of a legislatorâs political preferences and policy beliefs. In this context, four components of a political process framework can be distinguished (see Fig. 2): (i) the derivation of politiciansâ incentives from electoral competition and lobbying, i.e., modeling voter behavior and interest group activities; (ii) modeling legislative bargaining, i.e., the derivation of a collective policy decision by a set of heterogeneous legislators based on constitutional rules; (iii) economic modeling of policy impacts, i.e., the transformation of policies into outcomes; and (iv) modeling of policy learning, i.e., the formation and updating of policy beliefs via observational and communication learning. The existing evaluation literature focuses only on the third component, although the other three components represent aspects of the policy process that play a key role in explaining why some nations succeed while others fail in adopting efficient and effective policies."
271,45,0.991,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Beyond detailed research results, existing studies on mediatization agree that any process of mediatization is very specific in relation to the social domain under consideration. This term social domain is used by various representatives of mediatization research (amongst others Hjarvard 2013; EkstrÃ¶m et al. 2016; Lunt and Livingstone 2016), while coming close to the everyday understanding of âspheresâ of society. In its widest sense, the term âsocial domainâ refers to those âspheresâ as being meaningful in everyday practice. The scaling of the different âmeaningful domainsâ can be very different, reaching from certain social groups or organizations to whole social fields or systems. We can understand this scaling to be a problem of terminological blurriness. However, the main argument being pushed forward in mediatization research is different. By hinting at the domain specificity of mediatization, scholars want to emphasize the variety of mediatization across different spheres of society. Mediatization is not a homogeneous process but very much differs from one area to another. It is a âdomain-specificâ phenomenon. We can understand this as taking up a long tradition in social sciences relating to the idea of âsocialâ as well as âculturalâ differentiation (Winter and Eckert 1990: 142â151; Hahn 2000: 14â24; Schimank 2013: 37â50; 131â149). Max Weber, for example, used the term WertsphÃ¤ren (Weber 1988 [1919]: 611) to reflect this. Pierre Bourdieu (1993) described processes of differentiation by analyzing differences within and across âsocial fieldsâ. Roger Friedland and Robert Alford (1991) preferred the idea of âinstitutional fieldsâ. In system theory, we find the concept of âsubsystemâ (Luhmann 2012, Vol. 2: 4â27), a term which was also used by JÃ¼rgen Habermas (1992) to describe social differentiation. In a similar vein, phenomenology puts emphasis on different (small) âlife-worldsâ (SchÃ¼tz 1967: 139â144; Luckmann 1970: 587), with a certain relationship to the âsocial worldsâ of symbolic interactionism (Shibutani 1955: 566; Strauss 1978; Clarke 2011: 384â385). More recently, Luc Boltanski and Laurent ThÃ©venot (2006) proposed the idea of different âorders of justificationâ."
275,28,0.991,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"UAI also provides a high-level blueprint for the design of practical autonomous agents, along with an appreciation of fundamental challenges (e.g. the induction problem and the explorationâexploitation dilemma). Much can be gained by addressing such challenges at an appropriately general, abstract level, rather than separately for each practical agent or setup. Finally, UAI is the basis of a general, nonanthropomorphic definition of intelligence. While interesting in itself to many fields outside of AI, the definition of intelligence can be useful to gauge progress of AI research.1 The outline of this chapter is as follows: First we provide general background on the scientific study of intelligence in general, and AI in particular (Sect. 2.2). Next we give an accessible description of the UAI theory (Sect. 2.3). Subsequent sections are devoted to applications of the theory: Approximations and practical agents (Sect. 2.4), high-level formulations and approaches to fundamental challenges (Sect. 2.5), and the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous agents (Sect. 2.6)."

The recent societal interaction barometer of the University of JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ has often been referred to and contains several items: education services to stakeholders, publications to stakeholders, expert services, stakeholder events, applied research and development activity, student theses for stakeholders, industrial property rights, spin-offs, employment ratio, internships, and infrastructure cooperation. Often such third mission indicators tend to measure the interaction between research or academic expertise and society. Many of them therefore relate to the innovation issue analyzed more closely in Chapter âExcellence in Innovation and Knowledge Economyâ. Indicators on the interaction between education and society are less frequent, but do exist, as the previous examples show. When focusing in particular on the social responsibility of universities to promote certain values and to ensure students internalize such values, a comprehensive measuring of the complete picture is probably impossible, but the development of the attitudes of students can certainly be measured, as is mentioned above. Even though a large variety of indicators of the above type are used, and have their natural place among the instruments available to university leadership, such measuring and measurements only provide a partial picture. It is basically most useful for monitoring the development over time of particular activities within particular departments. A comprehensive and trustworthy understanding of the role of universities and their components, and a reliable and credible comparison of the performance of these components at a particular point of time, cannot be achieved through the use of indicators alone. A strategic vision of how universities should fulfill their third mission and efficient measures to support the development toward the vision requires, in addition to the indicator-based purely quantitative assessment of the social interaction of universities, more qualitative means of assessment. Only such qualitative assessment, preferably to be performed at regular intervals, can adequately take into account the varying opportunities, traditions, and applied usefulness of different disciplines. Understanding of the states of affairs under consideration can be reached by means of regular qualitative assessments without overburdening organizations with continuous collection of large amounts of data. From the point of view of international excellence, such broad assessment is of particular importance. The indicators used to measure third mission activities, as described above, are often not very effective for pinpointing activities reflecting universitiesâ global responsibilities."
211,45,0.991,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"Differences in the Nature of Opportunities and the StructuralAlignment Process The discussion above concentrated on the factors that enable some individuals or organizations to identify and act upon promising activities (cf. Gruber et al. 2010; Plambeck and Weber 2009; Short et al. 2010). Although there has been sustained interest in and theorizing about the nature and sources of opportunities (e.g., Alvarez and Barney 2010; Jackson and Dutton 1988; McMullen et al. 2007), scholars have paid less theoretical and empirical attention to the impact of differences across opportunities, particularly in regard to initial opportunity identification. However, my (Dean) colleague and I (GrÃ©goire and Shepherd 2012) created and tested an opportunity-identification model focusing on the effects of differences across potential opportunities. Expanding the assumptions outlined above, opportunity beliefs form as a result of cognitive efforts to understand possible âmatchesâ between new ways of supply (e.g., new services, products, technologies, or business models) and the markets in which these new means of supply can be introduced. Thus, in the context of technology transfer, the formation of opportunity beliefs hinges on the consideration entrepreneurs give to the structural alignment between new technologies and markets (as described above and specified in GrÃ©goire et al. [2010]). The Effects of Convergent and Divergent Variations in Alignment When thinking about structural alignment, we need to take into consideration that superficial and structural similarities can differ independently of one another. From a modeling perspective, the question thus arises as to whether the effects of superficial and structural similarity are merely additive or whether these two forms of similarity interact with one another. To answer this question, my (Dean) colleague and I (GrÃ©goire and Shepherd 2012) tested for a possible interaction between the two dimensions (as detailed below). However, when trying to understand the challenges associated with recognizing potential opportunities, it becomes especially important to explore the meaning and influence that differences across forms of alignment may have on the development of opportunity beliefs. This issue is particularly relevant when the superficial and structural similarities of a technology-market combination are at odds with each other."

Without adding new bureaucracies or reassigning decision making authority, the shared vision model and the act of developing it create a connectedness among problems solvers that resembles the natural integration of the conditions they study."
227,42,0.991,Problem Solving in Mathematics Education,"There are traces of mathematical problems and solutions throughout the history of civilization that explain the humankind interest for identifying and exploring mathematical relations (Kline 1972). PÃ³lya (1945) reflects on his own practice as a mathematician to characterize the process of solving mathematical problems through four main phases: Understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. Likewise, PÃ³lya (1945) presents and discusses the role played by heuristic methods throughout all problem solving phases. Schoenfeld (1985) presents a problem solving research program based on PÃ³lyaâs (1945) ideas to investigate the extent to which problem solving heuristics help university students to solve mathematical problems and to develop a way of thinking that shows consistently features of mathematical practices. As a result, he explains the learnersâ success or failure in problem solving activities can be characterized in terms their mathematical resources and ways to access them, cognitive and metacognitive strategies used to represent and explore mathematical tasks, and systems of beliefs about mathematics and solving problems. In addition, Schoenfeld (1992) documented that heuristics methods as illustrated in PÃ³lyaâs (1945) book are ample and general and do not include clear information and directions about how learners could assimilate, learn, and use them in their problem solving experiences. He suggested that students need to discuss what it means, for example, to think of and examining special cases (one important heuristic) in ï¬nding a closed formula for series or sequences, analysing relationships of roots of polynomials, or focusing on regular polygons or equilateral/right triangles to ï¬nd general relations about these ï¬gures. That is, learners need to work on examples that lead them to recognize that the use of a particular heuristic often involves thinking of different type of cases depending on the domain or content involved. Lester and Kehle (2003) summarize themes and methodological shifts in problem solving research up to 1995. Themes include what makes a problem difï¬cult for students and what it means to be successful problem solvers; studying and contrasting experts and novicesâ problem solving approaches; learnersâ metacognitive, beliefs systems and the influence of affective behaviours; and the role of context; and social interactions in problem solving environments. Research methods in problem solving studies have gone from emphasizing quantitative or statistical design to the use of cases studies and ethnographic methods (Krutestkii (1976). Teaching strategies also evolved from being centred on teachers to the active studentsâ engagement and collaboration approaches (NCTM 2000). Lesh and Zawojewski (2007) propose to extend problem solving approaches beyond class setting and they introduce the construct âmodel eliciting activitiesâ to delve into the learnersâ ideas and thinking as a way to engage them in the development of problem solving experiences.

97,528,0.991,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Climate change and urbanisation are amongst the greatest global challenges society is facing today. The concept of nature-based solutions (NBS) has recently been highlighted as key concept in policy and management in achieving alignment of environmental and societal goals (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016; Kabisch et al. 2016a). The chapters of this volume assess the evidence, debate different concepts, identify policy avenues and display practical management applications that highlight the potential of NBS in tackling global challenges related to climate change and urbanisation. The authors critically review and present recent findings how urban ecosystem management can be employed to adapt to climate change effects, while at the same time contributing to social and health benefits. The examples discussed for ecosystem services and co-benefits in this volume comprise case studies concerning climate change mitigation via reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as climate change adaptation by enhancing the regulation of air quality and temperature, contributing to water cycle regulation, provision of recreation potential as well as improvements for human well-being and mental health. In this conclusion chapter, we summarise the main outcomes of the chapters in this book. Considering current European policy as well as recommendations drawn by the ENCA interest group on climate change from the outcomes of the European conference on âNaturebased solutions to climate change in urban areas and their rural surroundingsâ (Kabisch et al. 2016b), we develop recommendations for putting NBS into practice and policy and outline outstanding challenges for science and society."

Concerning the ï¬rst issue, the major empirical results are, on the one hand, the identiï¬cation of fourteen components, derived from statistical analysis (Burton et al. 2014) to differentiate hybrid learning environments and, on the other hand, a typology of six types of environments described and illustrated by (Lebrun et al. 2014). Note that the descriptions produced, exploiting both quantitative and qualitative data from different studies, are an excellent illustration of the relevance of a mixed methodological approach. It should however be noted that the components describing the openness of learning environments, that proved particularly relevant, deserve to be explored in more depth using recent work by JÃ©zÃ©gou. The main contribution of her work is to propose a theory of the openness of teaching as well as modelling presence, especially in e-learning. Research carried out on openness led to a theoretical basis for the concept and to its deï¬nition in terms of the learnerâs freedom of choice to organize his or her own learning situations (JÃ©zÃ©gou 2005). It also led to the development of GEODE (JÃ©zÃ©gou 2010), an instrument used to assess the degree of openness of a digital learning environment (including the degree of openness of the spatiotemporal, pedagogical and mediated communication components). This instrument has been validated empirically. As for presence, research shows it is the result of some form of collaborative social interaction between learners and between the teacher and learners within a digital communication space. Such a presence at a distance promotes the emergence and development of a learning community with the resulting individual and collective construction of knowledge. Work on the dynamic modelling of that presence helped characterize collaborative interactional processes at work in each of the three dimensions of presence at a distance (JÃ©zÃ©gou 2012a): (1) socio-cognitive (2) socio-affective and (3) pedagogical. An instrument to assess the degree of presence in e-learning (GEPE) was recently developed and its internal validity veriï¬ed. Empirical research conducted by JÃ©zÃ©gou has identiï¬ed the influence (independently or together) of two environmental dimensionsâthe degree of openness (as theorized) and the degree of presence (as modelled)âon the self-directed learning of adults in the context of e-learning, blended learning and MOOC. It has demonstrated the role of several personal characteristics of a motivational nature in the interplay of influence observed. These are the need for self-determination, structure, competence and social afï¬liation. These empirical studies have also shown that the learnersâ perception of openness or, in other words, their perception of the degree of freedom of choice offered by the established educational environment, has an influence on the self-regulation strategies implemented. They have also helped describe and understand the self-regulation"

These lenses may include but are not limited to agile budgeting, agile manufacturing, agile production, agile strategic management, agile business models, agile culture and organisational theories related to agility. While many principles of enterprise agility can be found in the literature (e.g. Beyond Budgeting [9], Lean Enterprise [10] etc.), empirical studies [1â3, 11, 12] have indicated that it is still rather challenging for most organisations to perform such a holistic and sustainable transformation. Why is transformation so hard? Given that enterprise agility involves not just software development, but the whole organisation, investigations of enterprise agility must address several aspects related to business, development and operations [4]. Leadership and cultural aspects have especially been identiï¬ed as key challenges in earlier studies of large-scale agile transformations, e.g. [2, 3]. This paper explores enterprise agility by investigating transformation activities in a large organisation in the higher education domain. For this investigation, we focus particularly on transformation, leadership and cultural aspects related to enterprise agility. We apply the Competing Values Framework (CVF) [13] to analyse characteristics of organisational culture and its implications to enterprise agility transformation. As the investigated case organisation operates in the higher education domain, this work contributes to understanding how agile methods and principles are interpreted and adapted in non-IT domains. One of the key contributions of this paper therefore is that it provides empirical evidence of challenges in non-IT agile transformation. Another key contribution is to introduce ideas and concepts from strategic management into the debate around non-IT agile transformation."

Recently, physicists and network researchers have explored the structure on the basis of diverse factors, such as time series robustness, community structures, and inter-layer dependency [9â12]. Some researchers have attempted to extend ITN research to that on economic growth [13â16]. These studies contribute some interesting findings from the viewpoint of complex networks. For instance, Garlaschelli et al. found that GDP is a hidden factor that influences networks [17]. Although this fact is common knowledge in international economics, their model remains an impressive contribution to network study. Several other studies have been conducted on gravity relations [18â20]."

Then, by identifying those patterns, simulations help to understand the causes of current issues and can support decision makers in tackling them. Moreover, applying computational modelling supports the validation of strategic initiatives and their effect on existing business modelsâjust as engineers test new technologies or products extensively in a laboratory before their market launch. In particular, the ability to experiment with different scenarios and strategic initiatives in a computational environment has the potential to reduce erroneous management decisions and reveal overlooked factors and patterns that could become relevant in the future (Groesser 2015a, b, c). And ï¬nally, by amalgamating computational methods with existing business modelling approaches SD provides an insightful, valid, relatively rapid, and inexpensive approach to business model analysis and design (Eden et al. 2000). Moreover, from a perspective of consistency, it is known that humans cannot deduce the behavioural consequences of a system with many interdependent elements (Miller 1956; Forrester 1961; Sterman et al. 2015). Computational modelling is one of the means, amongst others, of reducing the issue that qualitative models seem to be insufï¬cient when systems are highly complex (Sterman 2000). Hence, it enables a deep and integrated understanding of a system through the quantitative exploration of systemic interdependencies. Computational modelling of complex systems is a relatively innovative approach for top management decision makers. Some disadvantages of this method relate to the relative ease of linking variables together to quickly create large, highly complex models. Some users may, however, be overwhelmed by this complexity if they do not exercise a cautious approach to modelling (Groesser and Schwaninger 2012). The existence of user-friendly visual representations has, in some cases, been a disservice by offering the false impression that modelling is always simple and done quickly. In addition, inclusion of uncertain or only hypothesized feedback loops may create complex model behaviour that may be difï¬cult to track, falsify, or validate. Moreover, the empirical evidence about the learning outcomes of computational modelling and its effectiveness is still inconclusive (Karakul and Qudrat-Ullah 2008; Sterman 2010; Qudrat-Ullah 2014). Consequently, it is not yet possible to state that businesses applying computational modelling systematically produce better results than those that do not use it and thus, the requirements of the strong market test are not yet met (Labro and Tuomela 2003). At the same time, this is a call for action to conduct more empirical research to prove (or disprove) the case for computational simulation methods."

Johannesson&Perjonsâ (JP) framework aims at creating an artifact and producing knowledge about how such an artifact helps sorting out a problem that recurrently appears in a given intended practice. Their framework defines five main activities (with associated input and output) and provides guidelines for carrying out such activities, selecting suitable research strategies, and relating the research to an existing knowledge base. The five activities are: explicate problem (described, for this work, in Sect. 3), define requirements (also in Sect. 3), design and develop artifact (Sect. 5), demonstrate artifact (Sect. 6), and evaluate artifact (not addressed in this paper and subject of future work). The structure of the maturity model we propose herein entails a set of quantitative and qualitative metrics which evaluate different aspects of a given community. Therefore, using our model to create a new evaluation of a particular community can be seen as conducting a mixed methods research, where both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques are simultaneously applied. We build on the guidelines provided by Creswell in [8] in order to define how the proposed model should be used to evaluate a community."
72,43,0.991,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Research themes To date, the research literature that focuses on social innovation specifically is limited, albeit growing. A review of this body of work reveals three clusters of research themes. Each is now considered in turn. Innovation in social relations The largest and most well-developed body of work on social innovation specifically focuses on innovation that addresses various dimensions of changes in social relations. This literature can be subdivided into five categories of scholarship: 1. Research Design Challenges: Early work on social innovation developed from within behavioural science with a particular interest in devising âsocial changeâ approaches to tackle key, contemporary social problems, often at a community level (Fairweather, 1967).3 2. Changes in Social Structures: HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen and Heiskala (2007) argued that it is social innovation processes that ultimately determine the economic and social performance of nations, regions, and industrial sectors and organisations: âSocial innovations are changes in the cultural, normative or regulative structures of society which enhance its collective power resources and improve its economic and social performanceâ (2007, p. 59)."
315,233,0.991,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"The use of the life course perspective to study migration is of increasing interest in the field. A majority of the research on first- and second-generation residents is based on quantitative methodological designs that mainly focus on different aspects of their insertion into the host society. This type of research takes objective indicators as inspiration such as educational attainment, position in the labor market, social networks, citizenship and, level of proficiency in the host countryâs language. On the other hand, some studies use qualitative approaches to study the lives of descendants of immigrants. The aim of those studies is to understand peopleâs subjective evaluations of life events and trajectories. We think that both approaches study two sides of the same coin. The biographical approach and the life course perspective share many features. Both study the lives of individuals, groups or cohorts using retrospective or longitudinal methodological designs. Researchers using those two approaches study lives in context (social, historical, structural contexts, etc.). They also consider individualsâ A.

183,126,0.991,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"6.11 Humanising Pedagogy For decades, educators and others considered various strategies to close the gap for at-risk youth. They have sought solutions involving new uses of technology. In some instances, the results of technology initiatives have been mixed. Often the introduction of technology has failed to meet the expectations leaving specifically the educational landscape replete with stories of how at-risk youth were unable to benefit from particular innovations. In this particular initiative, an approach of humanising pedagogy was taken. Rather than using technology to drill and kill the enthusiasm of the youth, technology was used as an interactive instrument. Through the use of interactive engagement using technology, the notion of vulnerability is explored and employed as a developmental and human security context that explores the interdependence between human beings and technology. Ultimately, the aim is to develop an embedded pedagogy that can enhance educational engagement in a non-threatening manner using technology."
35,238,0.991,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"GIS tools were used to evaluate geographical data and identify suitable areas, ï¬sh carrying capacity was calculated, mussel settling in the selected areas was estimated, and a public consultation process was carried out in both regions. Hence, such a spatial planning process will be crucial for aquaculture development as it lowers the threshold for new entrepreneurs, minimizes the risk of appeals, makes the business more environmentally safe, and lowers the risk of social conflicts. But, increasingly, aquaculture siting will be conducted in a broader, multiple-use context where tradeoffs will be more complex. As stated by Lovatelli et al. (2014), âmeeting the future demand for food from aquaculture will largely depend on the availability of space [and] âMSPâ is needed to ensure [that] allocation of space.â Although a variety of GIS-based tools and DSS are currently available to assist in the planning process, the allocation of space in the ocean remains a complex, contentious process unlikely to be fully resolved by even the most sophisticated mathematical calculations. Successful MSP, including the co-location of compatible activities, relies as much on the willingness of relevant stakeholders to become involved as it does on tools and techniques for identifying optimum areas (Gopnik 2015). The integration of relevant actors is a âcomplex and controversial issueâ (Buck et al. 2008) which depends on a multitude of factors, including inclusiveness, transparency of the process and of decision-making, timing, credibility of the data and science, and impartial mediation. Despite these caveats, GIS-based DSS will continue to play an important role in planning and spatial decision-making because of their ability to evaluate the results of many different spatial scenarios. Ideally, this should include assessments of the economic and socio-cultural impacts of different siting decisions, which can be the main sources of conflict and are too often overlooked (ICES 2013). Socio-economic data integrate publicly-held values into the decision-making processes. Primary data on socio-cultural valuesâsuch as the importance people give to cultural identity and the degree to which that is related to the ecosystem (de Groot et al. 2010)âare usually not available. Surveys on secondary data as well as their spatial analysis still remain complex tasks. In general, the spatial aggregation of socio-economic data in a GIS framework is difï¬cult, involving close collaboration with the respective sectors (Ban et al. 2013). Most progress can be found with regard to the mapping of fleet-speciï¬c ï¬sheries activities due to technical advances in combining Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook information (Bastardie et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2010; Hintzen et al. 2012). Finally, GIS-based DSS should be flexible enough to respond to shifting circumstances, such as changes in environmental conditions, environmental targets, growth expectations in the aquaculture sector, or policy environments. Like all analytical tools, GIS-based DSS are only as good as the quality and thoroughness of the data they are based on, and their strengths and limitations should be clearly explained to stakeholders during the planning process.

264,506,0.991,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"The Teaching and Learning of Geometric Deï¬nitions The importance of deï¬nitions in geometry education (c.f. de Villiers, Govender, & Patterson, 2009; Mariotti & Fischbein, 1997; Smith, 2010) is reflected in the research literature, with a number of studies on this theme appearing over the past decade. Such research has focused both on understanding the process of deï¬ning and on the need for deï¬nitions. Overall, the majority of studies have concentrated on descriptive (a posteriori) deï¬ning; for example, deï¬ning circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, and polyhedra after exploring their properties with the use of DGEs, paper-folding, and/or pencil-and-paper construction (c.f. Choi and Oh 2008; Fujita & Jones, 2007; Salinas, Lynch-Davis, Mawhinney, & Crocker, 2014; Usiskin, Grifï¬n, Witonsky, & Willmore, 2008; Zandieh & Rasmussen, 2010). It appears that the fundamental issue of understanding the need for axioms and for accepting some statements as deï¬nitions to avoid circularity has been largely under-researched in the mathematics education community (though see Fujita, Jones, & Miyazaki, 2011; Miyazaki, Fujita, & Jones, 2017). Another under-researched area seems to be exploring the existence of a mathematical choice between deï¬ning (and classifying) the quadrilaterals hierarchically or in partitions (compare de Villiers 1994; Usiskin et al. 2008). A speciï¬c research question in this regard might be the extent to which students and teachers understand (or how to develop such understanding) that choosing a hierarchical deï¬nition over a partition leads to a more economical (shorter) deï¬nitions more concise formulation of some theorems, simpliï¬ed deductive structure (by decreasing the number of proofs required), assists in problem solving, etc. The potential of DGEs, and some use of analogy also, in developing understanding for deï¬nitions have been explored in several studies with triangles and quadrilaterals (c.f. Kaur, 2015). Such approaches appear to have assisted students in developing more robust, dynamic concept images than the traditional prototypical, static images that tend to prevent inclusive deï¬nitions. Nevertheless, everyday language and prototypical conceptions remain an issue especially in regard to class-inclusion as well as studentsâ understanding the constraints of a DGE ï¬gure. A paucity of research on the use of symmetry concepts in choice of deï¬nitions, and on engaging students in the process of the constructive (a priori) deï¬ning of new concepts, means that these are ripe areas for future research."
395,12,0.991,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"accidents, but also by insisting on the poor attention given to lessons learned from successful recoveries, the author highlights important issues in terms of safety competence development, particularly in the management of uncertainty. In Chap 10, based on his extensive expertise in the mining industry, Jonathan Molyneux raises the issue of the importance of operational experience, besides acquiring formal safety qualiï¬cations, to improve safety performance in at-risk industries. He highlights the paradox by which the influencing aspect of the work of âsafety professionalsâ as valued advisors is somehow challenged by the fact that they have to meet the compliance agenda and are therefore sometimes perceived by shop floor staff more as a âprocedure-policeâ than as coaches. Integration versus differentiation with safety improvement strategies tailored for local speciï¬c contexts is also discussed. In Chap. 11, Benoit JournÃ© highlights some inherent contradictions in professional development in risk industries. Neglecting such contradictions would doom training programs to failure. The chapter suggests that bringing safety practices into discussions appears to be a possible way to enhance professional development as well as safety performances. In Chap. 12, Corinne Bieder addresses the implicit assumptions conveyed by so-called safety training sessions. She unravels them and the underlying understanding of how safety is ensured, thus allowing for better appreciation of what safety training can achieve and, more importantly, what it cannot. She goes beyond these apparent contradictions to offer ways forward for re-thinking âsafety trainingâ and make it an actual lever for enhancing safety performance. Chapter 13 by Vincent Boccara presents a training design approach oriented by a holistic real-world works analysis based on several works of research. It is about making people able to deal with real-world work situations, rather than them only knowing and applying exogenous standards. Two main axes of progress are identiï¬ed and could be developed into guidelines for training people to deal with work situations: participatory methods and transformation of both the trainer and the traineeâs activity. In view of the wide and varied offer of theories and methodologies examining human factors in industrial risk, Paul Chadwick, in Chap. 14, proposes a uniï¬ed approach with a coherent interdisciplinary conceptual framework for both research and intervention. Unlike âbehavioural safetyâ programs, rather than limiting analysis to behaviour as the root cause of accidents (identiï¬cation of âunsafe behavioursâ), this approach seeks to influence the contextual elements that explain these behaviours, the âbehavioural determinantsâ. The approach consists of depicting the situation by identifying why things go wrong and why they go well, and modifying the physical, technical, social and / or organizational context to reduce the occurrence of âriskyâ behaviours. In Chap. 15, Nicolas Herchin focuses on the issues of professional identity and the power of specialists in support functions. His premise is that giving more power and consideration to people in the ï¬eld i.e. shop floor teams and middle managers is a ï¬rst step towards an enhanced (safety) performance. This involves a âliberationâ process by which the classical vision of hierarchal structures is reversed, and the"
112,184,0.99,Designing Sustainable Energy For All : Sustainable Product-Service System Design Applied To Distributed Renewable Energy,"Finally, design research has opened discussion on the possible role of design for social equity and cohesion [28, 76, 92], Mance [70], [13, 43, 73, 93, 121]; Carniatto and Chiara [14]; [33, 63]; Maase and Dorst [67]; [89]; Tischner and Verkuijl [111]; [27, 124]; dos Santos (2008); [122]. This potential role for design directly addresses various aspects of a âjust society with respect for fundamental rights and cultural diversity that creates equal opportunities and combats discrimination in all its formsâ [35, 36]. Moreover, several writers and researchers urge a movement (and a key role for design) towards harmonising society such that it is not only just and fair but also that people are encouraged to be empathic, kind and compassionate for the beneï¬t of others [38]; Rifkin (2010). We can indeed observe new, although sporadic, interest on the part of design research to move into this territory, to trace its boundaries and understand the possible implications. Some researchers have adopted a bottom-up approach and investigated how people and communities innovate to address their own daily problems. âCreative communitiesâ [80] is an often used term to highlight the inventiveness of these ordinary people and communities (sometimes in collaboration with other local institutions, organisations and entrepreneurs) in designing, implementing and managing social innovations [53]. Typical examples include new forms of exchange and mutual help, community car-pooling systems, food networks linking consumers directly with producers, etc. Researchers in the ï¬eld of design for social innovation have been exploring the characteristics of these innovations and the role of professional designers can play in supporting, promoting and scaling-up these community-based innovations, e.g. see [71]. Some authors have also focused on understanding how design can address social and environmental issues faced by people in low-income context, i.e. design for the Base of the Pyramid (BoP). The initial emphasis has been on product design for BoP, e.g. UNEP [26, 115]; dos Santos et al. (2009). More recently, the design research focus on BoP has moved to S.PSS, e.g. see [84]; Schafer et al. [102]; Jagtap and Larsson [51]; dos Santos [101], and social entrepreneurship and innovation, e.g. see [81]; Cipolla et al. [24]. Other authors [103, 122] have argued that a promising approach would be that of Sustainable Product-Service Systems (S.PSS) design for social equity and cohesion, or more shortly, System Design for Sustainability. This issue of Sustainable Product-Service System design for social equity and cohesion is described in the following chapter as in relation to the design of sustainable energy system accessible to all. Nowadays, design for SE4A necessarily includes the issue of access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, which UN has described in the"
72,127,0.99,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"implement innovations. According to Tardif (2005, p. 25), the approach is based on the notion of the emergence of social innovation: As a localized process initiated by different actors who seek to change the interactions taking place between themselves as well as with their organizational and institutional environment â the whole with the aim to counteract the impact of crises while attempting to reconcile the different levels of individual interest, public interest and common good. The statistical analysis of data will make it possible to move from a micro to a meso and macro approach to studying social innovation. The assumption is that there are objects of study of relevance for social innovation that are not observable at the micro scale. At the meso level of analysis, such a database will allow for a new reading of social innovations in terms of the mechanisms, configurations, evolution and modes of dissemination in time and across locations and sectors of activity. The approach will, moreover, make it possible to focus on phenomena hitherto little studied in the QuÃ©bec context, such as the emergence and dissemination of innovation clusters, including their patterns and paths of institutionalisation or even their configuration into an innovation system, and to examine their impacts on social transformation, in particular with regard to the QuÃ©bec development model. This framework, once applied to QuÃ©bec, may be extended to other areas in order to conduct international comparisons. There are, indeed, times and territories where social innovations tend to multiply, taking the form of innovation clusters, especially at the onset of crises or in economies with plural tendencies (Klein et al., 2013). Innovations are, then, oriented along emerging socio-technical paradigms, such as new representations of problems and possible solutions or experiments that were successfully carried out in organisations and local communities. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s in QuÃ©bec, when the crisis of Fordism and the welfare state became apparent, social innovations arose in the areas of labour, people services, collective enterprises, public policies and local development (the areas that CRISES focuses on). Using the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, it will be possible to trace the dynamics of the emergence of these innovations as well as their spread into clusters and their wider impacts on society. For example, a researcher might study the proximity effect, which is a phenomenon that promotes collective dynamics with the potential to modulate or reject the dominant forms of social control or"
161,219,0.99,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"in scaling pilot projects, usually program interventions conducted on small samples, to general populations. It is worthwhile to refrain on commenting on whether this volume addresses this research gap till we have reflected on the broader objectives strived for. This manuscript provides a timely perspective within which to situate future developments for the use of mobile phones by healthcare service providers in resource-constrained contexts. The contributors to this volume present a range of studies based on empirical evidence from a range of Asian contexts. It is debatable whether any individual study provides substantive and irrefutable scientiï¬c evidence for mHealth impact, or an individual policy recommendation for mobile phone use (or a ban) within the formal healthcare system. However, taken as a whole, the volume can inform the complexity of policy development and enforcement, particularly illustrating the wide variety of sociocultural contexts encountered across communities in Asia. To provide an over-arching frame, this concluding chapter examines and interrogates the studies in the context of what appears to be the organic growth of mobile phone praxis in Asia. It is within this context that this concluding chapter will amplify the learnings from these current chapters versus a decade-long established trajectory of research, focusing on the sociocultural implications for the introduction, adoption, appropriation, and impact of mHealth for vulnerable communities in Asia. Before we focus on the organic adoption and usage of mobile, we need to acknowledge the techno-deterministic framing of mobile phone use in planned interventions. Dutta, Kaur-Gill, Tan, and Lam present a critique of market- and state-driven logics of top-down mHealth interventions in Chap. 6. The culture-centered approach emphasized in this chapter promotes a critical perspective toward the implementation of mHealth projects in Asia, particularly hard to reach communities. The authors argue that the effects of mHealth are heavily dependent on the community in which the technology is deployed, with different environments and contexts leading to different outcomes. They identify a number of factors, similar to those stated by Evans, Bhatt, and Sharma in Chap. 3, including the problems faced by hard to reach communities where literacy and income levels are low, and traditional cultural barriers such as static gender roles are prevalent, thus impeding the adoption and growth of mHealth technologies. These authors propose a checklist for future mHealth programs run in low- and middle-income countries to overcome challenges and maximize effectiveness. Evans et al. (see Chap. 3) develop a framework based on nine key components. At the technical level, tools have to be sustainable and feasible within the available infrastructure; hardware has to be context-appropriate, familiar and easily available to locals; and tool design has to be user-centered. At the organizational level, partnerships between the government and various enterprises will help establish a stable ecosystem for mHealth; the cooperation of the government through policies will support the integration of mHealth tools into the larger healthcare system. mHealth programs need to be ï¬nancially sustainable through government support or other means, and use equipment that are cost-effective. In doing so, these authors reiterate prior categorizations of success factors in the ï¬eld, such as the"
233,622,0.99,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Phylogenetic diversity is now a core part of conservation biology, reï¬ecting its link to option values and to evolutionary potential. Further, there is good overlap with related issues in broader ecology. These include community ecologyâs interest in productivity (e.g. Cadotte et al. 2012), resilience (e.g. Pugliesi and Rapini 2015) and the functioning of evosystems (e.g. Srivastava et al. 2012) and microbial ecologyâs use of PD as a cornerstone for exploring diversity patterns at multiple scales (Lozupone and Knight 2005, 2008; Faith et al. 2009). As the chapters in this book demonstrate, the development of new methods and their applications are very much tuned into human impacts and sustainability issues. Thus, red listings, drivers of extinction, and changes in spatial and temporal distribution of phylogenetic diversity are common elements of these studies. All this promotes the incorporation of phylogenetic diversity in the international conservation agenda. These prospects are magniï¬ed by the remarkable facilities for obtaining entire or large parts of genomes or other molecular sequences of any kind of organisms, and by the sheer magnitude of biological (gene sequences, trait databases, species occurrences, red lists) and environmental data (climate layers for past, present and future interpolated to very ï¬ne spatial scales; land-use layers, spatial data indicating particular important risks such as ï¬res, ï¬oods, and so on) now available in the public domain. All these allow for rapid estimation of the phylogenetic relationships for a large number of organisms in association with potential distribution and threats for species and lineages. In addition, under the stimulus of modern phylogenetic and molecular methods, systematics is going through a signiï¬cant transformation that will certainly inï¬uence biodiversity conservation (Mace et al. 2003; Pons et al. 2006; Vogler and Monaghan 2006; Faith et al. 2010; Yahara et al. 2010). For closing this book, we will brieï¬y describe this transformation of systematics and then discuss some impacts of these changes in biological conservation. We ï¬nish by exploring the possibility of deï¬ning âplanetary boundariesâ for biodiversity on the basis of phylogenetic diversity, and its important role in linking biodiversity into broader societal perspectives and needs."
264,552,0.99,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"The spirit of TME has been renewed today by the more bottom-up meta-theoretical approach of the networking of theories exploring how research with multiple theories can be conducted (speciï¬cally when they have emerged within speciï¬c educational systems), where the limits are, and how far new insights can be gained. Addressing networking strategies, this approach takes up the principle of complementarity, which Steiner (1987) worked out in the TME program (ibid., p. 48), being open for the theoretical diversity of the ï¬eld.

317,9,0.99,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"The history of mathematics is also a story of changes, of long-term genesis of concepts with moments of continuity and sudden ruptures. How history can inform research in mathematics education is a complex matter (Schubring 2011); here we consider how research in mathematics education has used the history of mathematics in studying transitions issues. For example, Dorier (2000) studies the genesis of linear algebra and shows that this theory has emerged in particular from a need of uniï¬cation of different problems concerning functions, sequences, and so forth. Thus linear algebra is what Robert (1998) calls a formalizing, unifying, and generalizing theory: it cannot be taught as a ânaturalâ extension of previous contents or a solution to a given problem. Studying the history of mathematics draws a landscape with gaps and long paths that do not admit shortcuts. An âepistemological obstacleâ is a form of unavoidable discontinuity which has been studied by many researchers (e.g., SierpiÅska 1987), most often by identifying ï¬rst such obstacles with a historical perspective then studying the associated cognitive transitions. Cognitive transitions are also observed outside of speciï¬c mathematical contents. Concerning the learning of proof in particular, several kinds of transitions have been investigated. In the transition from phases of conjectures to phases of proof continuities and discontinuities appear, and this leads to the introduction of the concept of cognitive unity of theorems (continuity existing between the production of a conjecture and the possible construction of its proof; see Garuti et al. 1996). Other researchers have identiï¬ed structural discontinuities in the transition between argumentation and proof (Arzarello and Sabena 2011). General models of transitions taking place in mathematical thinking also exist; in particular, different theories propose models for the âtransition from process to objectâ (Tall et al. 1999). This transition is sometimes called âencapsulationâ and sometimes âreiï¬cationâ; several authors claim that it is composed of a sequence of steps. Sfard (1991) considers the transition from computational operations to abstract objects to be accomplished in three steps: interiorization, condensation, and reiï¬cation. Dubinsky (1991) in the APOS theory also considers conceptualization processes as transitions composed of three successive steps: from action to process, from process to object (encapsulation), and from object to schema. Each of the steps, or sub-processes, is seen as continuous, while the change from one step to the next can be interpreted as a discontinuity. Nevertheless, the process-object transition is not discussed by these authors in terms of continuity/discontinuity. In contrast, Tall (2002), referring to Skemp (1962) for a study of âlong-term learning schemasâ discusses the process-object transition in terms of discontinuity. The author claims that long-term cognitive development in mathematics always faces discontinuities. He gives various examples concerning negative numbers, algebra, limits, and so forth. These discontinuities, according to him, cannot be avoided in the curriculum, and they require cognitive reconstruction on the part of the student. It is thus important for teachers to be aware of these discontinuities. Should we then maintain that cognitive development is generally a discontinuous process or merely a concatenation of continuous sub-processes? This issue is discussed in Sect. 2."
211,38,0.99,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"Structural Alignment Connecting the Novel to the Known We believe that the solution to this puzzle lies partly in examining the cognitive processes people use to make sense of new information. It is well documented that individuals mentally compare new information to their prior knowledge in order to understand it. With this perspective, being able to identify opportunity-relevant patterns requires individuals to put forth cognitive effort to see âresemblancesâ between what happens in the world (such indications of possible environmental changes) and their mental models of circumstances that are pertinent to understanding the new information as well as to (in the case of opportunity identification) recognizing a plan to potentially benefit from these changes. However, how does this comparison and sensemaking occur in the real world? What cognitive processes do individuals use to evaluate resemblances between new information and their prior knowledge? This issue of resemblance is the focus of cognitive research on perceptions of similarity and the utilization and outcomes of similarity considerations across a large variety of reasoning tasks (cf. Holyoak and Thagard 1996). Research in this area emphasizes that similarity perceptions regarding two or more items of interest depend on individualsâ alignment of mental representations of these items (Day and Gentner 2007; Keane et al. 1994). Following on this research stream, the cognitive process of structural alignment (Gentner 1983, 1989) can serve as a valuable foundation to explore opportunity recognition. Structural alignment represents a cognitive âtoolâ individuals use to compare objects. Based on this comparison, the individual then derives implications or generates new insights. When individuals come across a new object, for example, they tend to instinctively question if anything in the new object is similar to anything they have encountered previously. Based on identified similarities, individuals then make efforts to more fully make sense of the new object. As cognitive scientists have illustrated, these considerations and the associated structural-alignment mechanism take a vital role in how individuals understand new information, learn novel ideas, and create new categories (see Holland et al. 1986). These processes include scientific innovation, the development of new product ideas, strategy development (Gavetti and Rivkin 2005, 2007), and other tasks that require creativity (Dahl and Moreau 2002; Ward 1995). A main finding of this literature is that alignment occurs at two levels. One level centers on superficial features, while the other level centers on"

243,245,0.99,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"The large scale of the NIHR-funded research programme allowed us, rather exceptionally, to study the implementation of a range of supplier offerings in multiple sites and over an extended period. We identified sharp echoes between these, still emerging, experiences and findings from our own personal research conducted over three decades into the evolution of ES solutions. These highlighted the need to go beyond single site snapshot studies of information infrastructure implementation and also examine the development of the component technologies (in this case discrete and integrated packaged HEPMA solutions) amongst closely coupled communities of developers and adopters of particular products and within evolving technological fields (Pollock and Williams 2008, 2016). The need to understand longer-term evolution of products across a community requires us to go beyond (or radically re-specify) the concept of Installed Base. Here we have drawn upon a long-established tradition of work from organisational studies and related perspectives: notably the institutionalist concept of technology field and related work on product life-cycles. These have provided a helpful framework to guide the extension of our detailed ethnographic study beyond single sites and moments to encompass longer-term developments across vendor/adopter communities. Our work here has focused upon the âcommunityâ of vendors, adopters and consultants linked to a particular technology. This does not however imply a âflatâ approach to community which risks portraying the co-evolution of technologies and their adopters as a simple process of joint learning and consensus building. Instead our studies of both ES and HEPMA highlight the overlapping webs of relationship through which these âcommunitiesâ are structured and segmented into a complex topology (Pollock and Williams 2016; Mozaffar 2016). Here we find a contradictory process in which diverse players grapple to accommodate goals in tension â for example supplier efforts to standardize technologies and adopter desires to differentiate systems around their particular (local or disciplinary) methods of working. These play out and need to be analysed over multiple cycles of design and implementation.

This chapter brings together a series of manuscripts focused on different international initiatives directed towards the reduction of disaster risk associated with landslides. The nine papers in this issue reveal different technical and practical perspectives to assess different aspects of landslide disaster risk under varies spatio-temporal scenarios. Mapping approaches and results reflect a series of problems related to data availability at various scales, including local, national, regional and global levels, while social analysis are highly complex as landslide disaster risk perception is shaped through experience and is strongly influenced by context. Combining instrumentation, monitoring and awareness has been also depicted as a major strategy for the preservation of World Heritage Sites, although this approach can be with no doubt, applied to Geoparks, Geomorphosites and other relevant sites that require protection."
341,301,0.99,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"IWRM is considered to be a central concept in contemporary water governance (White 1998; Lubell and Edelenbos 2013). The key feature of IWRM is âintegrationâ, which is a normative goal that can refer to the integration of fragmented responsibilities for water governance (functions), institutional fragmentation (e.g. Wallis and Ison 2011b) and societal fragmentation (Lubell and Edelenbos 2013). The latter, societal fragmentation, is characterised by a disconnect between those making decisions and those affected by them. IWRM promotes stakeholder participation through some platform or institutional arrangement that promotes inclusion. However, as Warner (2006) found in an assessment of multi-stakeholder platforms in managing catchments, a realistic assessment of their purpose and capacity to achieve this ought to be considered before initiation. A finding from SLIM research (Ison et al. 2007), in which 14 empirical case studies of water governance platforms were undertaken, was that the existence of a multi-stakeholder platform, i.e. of multi-stakeholder institutions, did not guarantee effective performances that could be said to constitute social learning. How is IWRM suited to governing the relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments? One enduring challenge that Molle (2009) highlighted is managing interconnected and nested biophysical landscapes with disconnected administrative and social systems. Inclusiveness in IWRM could help âconnectâ social systems, achieving a greater variety of participants particularly through inclusion of people with local-scale interests. Institutional barriers, such as the centralisation of policy and lack of support for local capacity to implement IWRM (Medema et al. 2008), are both impediments to and arguments for greater inclusiveness. Despite the duration of IWRM as a governance framing choice (White 1998), what has not become clear is a praxis (or praxeology) of IWRM including the institutional forms needed to support this praxis. In this framing, the perennial issue is how to address the question: what do actors need to experience to claim that integration has occurred? In our experience, this question is rarely addressed well, in situations where integration is sought or claimed."

277,29,0.99,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"2.1 Introduction Despite the extensive literature on patterns of knowledge utilisation in policymaking, there is very little scholarship comparing different âculturesâ of knowledge use across polities. By âcultureâ, I am referring to the historically specific and cumulatively learned patterns of values and beliefs that orient social action (Eckstein 1997: 226). The literature on national policy styles suggests that such values and beliefs can shape patterns of policymaking in different systems of public administration.1 But it is likely that such differences in administrative cultures also produce distinct ways of thinking about and drawing on expert knowledge. This chapter aims to explore how such differences might influence patterns of research use in immigration policy in Germany and the UK.2"
197,41,0.99,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"energy vulnerability itself remains poorly theorized. Recent energy vulnerability scholarshipâwhose detailed consideration would extend beyond the confines of this chapterâhas emphasized the importance of considering the problem through a spatial and temporal framework, while discussing its social construction and the need to consider why and how a given entity may become or be considered vulnerable (Christmann, Ibert, Kilper, & Moss, 2012; Philo, 2012; Waite, Valentine, & Lewis, 2014). Energy vulnerability has been used in a very wide range of contexts, as it can refer to the infrastructural determinants of resource supply and import dependence at a variety of scales, as well as the systemic conditions that allow some entities to become more socially and technically precarious than others (Christie, 2009; Hall et al., 2013; Hiteva, 2013). There is a distinctive literature on household energy vulnerability, understood as a set of circumstances that underpin the risk of falling into fuel and energy poverty. Having applied Spiersâ (2000) understanding of âemicâ vulnerability to utility services such as heating and cooling, Middlemiss and Gillard (2015) suggest that energy vulnerability can also be articulated via a bottom-up perspective that characterizes experiences of deprivation. The material embeddedness of energy vulnerability points to the need for considering the condition though a geographical lens. In the remainder of this book, I consider energy vulnerability as a âsocio-spatial formationâ situated at the nexus of political decisions, economic inequalities, organizational practices, on the one hand, and the physical features of place and space, on the other. It should be noted that socio-spatial formations have been theorized extensively in the geography literature, although this body of work has rarely been considered the agency of infrastructural systems. Initial use of the term was motivated by the need for exploring how the political and economic shifts associated with globalization gave rise to specific development patterns and practices of contestation at the urban scale (Amin, 1994). More recent work on the topic has drawn upon regulation theory approaches to emphasize the institutional and political reconfigurations that have underpinned the emergence of entrepreneurial urbanism and the move from âgovernment to governanceâ (Mcguirk, 2012). At the same time, assemblage thinking has allowed for socio-spatial formations to be considered as heterogeneous and emergent networks involving the interaction of human and non-human entities via a range of distributed agencies (Anderson & McFarlane, 2011; Dittmer, 2013)."
264,927,0.99,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"Final Considerations From the presentations and discussions conducted during the regular and oral communication sessions of TSG35, it is possible to identify three unique characteristics that are interrelated. 1. It is necessary to continue to support and encourage further investigations in regards to innovative approaches in ethnomathematics programs especially in relation to social justice, civil rights, indigenous education, professional contexts, the playing of games, urban and rural contexts, and ethnomodelling. 2. An important change in mathematical instruction needs to accommodate continuous and ongoing changes in the demographics of students in mathematics classrooms around the world. Since it proposes that educators contextualize their mathematics teaching/learning by relating mathematical content to the sociocultural experiences of their students, it has become necessary to integrate culturally relevant pedagogies and diverse ethnomathematics perspectives into existing teacher education programs. Ethnomathematics intends to make school mathematics relevant to students through a more culturally relevant view of mathematics. 3. It is important to look at the diverse circumstances leading to the formulation of social, historical, cultural, political, and educational imperatives, and to realize that these are linked to one of the main goals of ethnomathematics, which is to broaden our conception of the diverse nature of mathematics. This includes speciï¬c examples of mathematical applications and models from an increasing number of diverse cultural groups. From the discussions provided in this topic study group it is possible to conclude that mathematical knowledge is constructed by developing ideas, procedures, and practices that are common to the members of distinct cultural groups. This mathematical knowledge enables these members to elaborate and use their abilities that include the universal processes of counting, locating, measuring, drawing, representing, playing, understanding, comprehending, explaining, and modeling to solve problems they face daily. Ethnomathematics provides mathematics educators an important framework to enable the transformation of mathematics so that it can better contribute in realizing the dream of a just and humane society. In this regard, mathematics is considered a"

We also hope to stimulate further research on Barnahus and to have demonstrated the many advantages of bringing together research from different disciplines and national contexts. Our aim throughout the book has also been to highlight how Barnahus research can take its outlook from within the Barnahus practice (e.g. from the perspectives of Barnahus staff) but also from outside the Barnahus practice (e.g. from surrounding actors, services, governance structures or relating processes). The variations in implementation and institutionalisation processes, as well as the potential and challenges, identified in this volume, call for the initiation of more interdisciplinary and comparative Barnahus research. While in one sense being a specialised research field, Barnahus research is simultaneously inter-related with many broader research areas concerning child abuse, domestic violence, child welfare policy and practice, childrenâs rights and child-friendly justice, integrated services and multi-professional collaboration, and governance, to mention the most central. From this perspective, the Barnahus research presented in this volume and the identified set of agendas for further research are also important for broader scientific discussions. In conclusion, we wish to stress the importance of dialogue among related research fields in order to further the development of interdisciplinary knowledge that may inform policy implementation and professional practice, with the overall aim of collaborating against child abuse."
75,379,0.99,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","Research Dissemination: The Narrative A typical empirical scientific workflow goes something like this: a research experiment is designed to answer a question; data are collected, filtered, and readied for analysis; models are fit, hypotheses tested, and results interpreted; findings are written up in a manuscript which is submitted for publication. Although highly simplified, this vignette illustrates the integral nature of narrative, data, and code in modern scientific research. What it does not show is the limited nature of the research paper in communicating the many details of a computational experiment and the need for data and code disclosure. This is the subject of the sections ââResearch Dissemination: Data and Raw Factsââ and ââResearch Dissemination: Methods/Code/Tools.ââ This section motivates the sharing of the research paper, and discusses the conflict that has arisen between the need for scientific diss00emination and modern intellectual property law in the United States.

77,84,0.99,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"A Life Course Framework for Oral Health The reviewed research has clearly shown that life course epidemiological models are very much applicable to oral diseases. Accumulation of risk including chains of risk, critical and sensitive period as well as social trajectories models are supported in the literature. Studying oral health from a life course perspective has provided insights into the importance of early life experiences, as well as lifelong trajectories of oral conditions. As is the case for general health, the underlying wider determinants of oral health are social. We therefore propose a theoretical framework for oral health that combines a life course perspective with the well-established models of the social determinants of oral diseases and their influence on the common risk factors that are shared between general and oral health (Fig. 3.8)."
192,44,0.99,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Before addressing Lacanâs views on scientific integrity and research misconduct, I will first outline his views on science as such. For Lacan, science basically entails a process of symbolisation which proceeds via instruments and gadgets (1972â 1973/1975, p. 104), producing discursive âemissionsâ on a massive scale. Modern science eliminates (âdecomposesâ) the world as we know it from naÃ¯ve lifeworld experience, replacing it with a completely different kind of universe, composed of symbols (signifiers) referring to concepts (molecules, electrons, quarks, etc.) that represent enigmatic entities whose ontological status (whose materiality or realness) poses a challenge to human imagination (1972â1973/1975, p. 49). The progress of science is the progress of the symbolic order, consuming, incorporating, transforming and obliterating nature as described by Aristotle (1980), namely as ÏÏÏÎ¹Ï: that which emerges, comes forward on its own accord, having its own inherent principles of change, that which is simply there, without our doing. Nature becomes obliterated and dissolved in the course of the ongoing symbolisation or hominisation of the planet (Lacan 1953â1954/1975, p. 291). Science notably entails a symbolisation of the phenomena of life (1954â 1955/1978, p. 43). Rather than understanding life as such, the aim of science is to understand specific bio-molecular processes with the help of instruments and contrivances, such as clocks, microscopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), etc. (1954â 1955/1978, p. 96, p. 344) resulting in symbols (letters, figures, formula, graphics, etc.) of various kinds: a form of understanding which does not allow us to see living nature as it is, but rather aims to control and manipulate biological processes. Scientific explanation depends on the use of signifiers (discursive elements which are easily modifiable, notably when sitting in front of a computer screen) which structure scientific experience (1955â1956/1981, p. 216). Thus, symbolisation is the language of precision technology and relies on technologies of knowledge Â© The Author(s) 2017 H.

242,279,0.99,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Informed by, but critical of, the Marxist intellectual tradition which limits the concept of social reproduction to the renewal of social relations and material bases of the society and economy, feminist theorizations try to bridge the conceptual and theoretical separation between the production of things and the creation and maintenance of human lives (Katz 2011). Social reproduction in feminist terms encapsulates many layers of power relations that are historically shaped: sexuality and biological reproduction; reproduction of labour power inclusive of an intergenerational process of care provision; reproduction of social relations and institutions, of which the family and its relationship with the state is one of the most significant (Whitehead 2002). Social reproduction simultaneously is a material and a discursive system through which a society recreates itself biologically, emotionally, culturally, institutionally, and economically. As Kabeer (2004: 10) points out, this process involves an array of institutional structures and activities that embody gendered values and knowledge, therefore regimes of social reproduction are essentially gendered regimes, particularly as regards the significance attached to reproductive activities and the recognition given to those who carry them out. It is here that the concept of âreproductive bargainâ introduced by Pearson (1997) is particularly valuable. The concept originally referred to the division of responsibility for different aspects of daily, generational, and social reproduction between the state, the household, and individuals in terms of resources that are collectively provided, and those that are accessed through wages and other money incomes. By studying the changing institutional arrangements in Cuba, which underwent a rapid transition in the 1990s, Pearson demonstrates how households adapt and devise new strategies to sustain and reproduce themselves, strategies that are patterned by an existing gender division of labour, and in some aspects, reinforced traditional gender roles. Building on this insight, Gottfried (2009: 77) proposes a more general model to analyse an ensemble"

It reflects the strong commitment to integration and a transdisciplinary approach, embracing disciplines as diverse as physical oceanography, sediment dynamics, agriculture, demographics and poverty. Input of policy experts and a substantial array of stakeholders are also fundamental. This study provided opportunities for substantial learning across standard discipline boundaries, providing co-produced policy relevant outputs and insights. It also fostered a family of researchers who developed a shared understanding that could be applied to this difficult and challenging problem. This included effective sharing of knowledge and learning to question and contribute effectively outside an individualâs specialist field. Integration is core to what has been accomplished here bringing together natural and social sciences in ways that are distinct and groundbreaking. Such integration needs to start as the research is initiated and is an ongoing process. Integration needs to be core to the project with key questions and themes that are properly resourced. To be policy relevant, the research must be guided by the perspectives, needs and expertise encapsulated by local stakeholders, especially the decision-making processes and governance context of the deltas in question. Stakeholders from civil society, the non-government sector and of course agencies of government are all involved in policy formulation. Indeed, one of the outstanding successes of the ESPA Deltas collaboration, which is reflected in this book, has been the engagement with and the impact on the policy context of Bangladesh. The research has raised, for the first time, consideration of ecosystem services, their links to poverty and livelihoods and their influence in the national policy and planning process across a range of government agencies including the Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission and other government partners such as the Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO). Indeed the Government of Bangladesh has requested continued engagement and further development of some of the modelling tools in the context of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, which is a new national planning approach. Engaging with policy was always a main aspiration of the research and is perhaps the aspect of which we are most proud. The research provides both the foundation and analyses which has led to some of its most innovative approaches and significant insights.

333,3,0.99,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"1 Introduction The use of technology in upper secondary mathematics education is a multifaceted topic. This topical survey addresses several dimensions of the topic and attempts at referring to international research studies as it is written by a team of several authors from ï¬ve countries of three different continents. The survey is structured into four subchapters, each of them addressing a theme of the TSG 43 at ICME 13. â¢ Technology in secondary mathematics education: theory Technology is often arousing enthusiasm as well as reluctance among teachers and mathematics educators. Therefore it was necessary to start the survey with a theoretical analysis of features of digital technologies from an epistemological and a cognitive perspective. A unique epistemological feature of mathematics is their symbolic dimension. It is impossible to gain direct access to mathematical objects as to physical objects. The only way is to access them is through representations. Digital technologies mediate mathematics and some of them offer new kinds of representations, like dynamic and socially distributed representations. Based on a Vygostkian perspective and an instrumentation approach, the use of digital technologies is analyzed as a coaction or a creative interplay between tool and human and as social coaction with socially distributed technology. This theoretical analysis is presented in the ï¬rst subchapter and the second subchapter also refers to it. â¢ The role of new technologies: changing interactions Part of the role of new technologies is to change the process toward an outcome for learning. This process includes developing a mathematical discourse, providing opportunities to conjecture and test, and active not passive learning. New technologies can add to these processes by connecting learners in different ways with each other and the phenomena under study, mediating learning in different ways, and can offer the opportunity for students to build on the work of one Â© The Author(s) 2017 S.

198,433,0.99,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"This meta-analysis was conducted using a philosophical lens called critical realism. In evaluation, the realist approach emphasizes underlying assumptions about the way certain interventions are expected to yield certain outcomes in a certain context (Pawson and Tilley 2004). It thus defies the deterministic worldview which is symbolized as âif X happens, it automatically produces outcome Y.â Such a linear, sequential worldview is considered deterministic or positivistic, in that hypothesized theories of change are thought to work regardless of the context within which theories of change are situated. In other words, deterministic theory of change does not give us the explanations as to âfor whom such interventions may work, in what circumstances, and howâ (Pawson and Tilley 1997). Moreover, although the deterministic findings can tell us what interventions may have worked in certain countries under certain conditions (âthereâ), they may not tell us for whom these successful interventions are expected to work, under what circumstances, and how (âhereâ). The realist approach thus resonates with evidence-based policy making in that it is thought to be useful in answering the important evaluation question, i.e. âit worked there, but will it work here?â (Cartwright and Hardie 2012). The following sections, however, first present the results of the meta-analysis that are considered deterministic in nature, immediately followed by non-deterministic ones and how the realist approach is applied. The intention behind this structure is to emphasize the characteristics of critical realism philosophy. Deterministic findings appear to help evaluators to know whether certain interventions work or not for achieving key outcomes, but such a deterministic approach is what a realist approach attempts to defy. The realist approach belongs to the school of theory-based evaluation (Stern et al. 2012). The realist approach is based on a school of thought in a philosophy of science, called critical realism. The concept of critical realism has been most significantly developed by Roy Bhaskar.4 Critical realism can provide a useful lens especially in social sciences for the world that is âstructured, differentiated, stratified and changing,â and recognizes the shift of emphasis âto what produces the events â not just to the events themselves.â (Danermark et al. 2002). An evaluation approach based on critical realism is thus an âintuitively appealing approach to those trying to expose and unpack the complexities of contexts and interrelated mechanisms underlying implementation activityâ (Rycroft-Malone et al. 2012). The use of this evaluation approach is thus considered appropriate in the complex experience of CCA projects. Adoption of critical realism in evaluation field (principally in public health and criminology) has significantly progressed thanks to the work of Pawson (2013), Pawson et al. (2004), Pawson and Tilley (1997, 2004), and Wong et al. (2013) and other scholars. His most notable works include The Possibility of Naturalism (1979) and A Realist Theory of Science (2008)."
245,1446,0.99,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"study presented here, are expected to facilitate policy learning between countries; these studies endeavour to make a virtue out of the fact that similar policies are implemented in different ways in different contexts, providing a rich ground for learning about how they work. The very virtue of being able to observe âliving social experimentsâ also presents a huge challenge for research. This is of making the object of investigation comparableâof creating ârelationally equivalent phenomenaâ (Phillips 2006)âto enable a comparative analysis. Additionally, policy and practice will ultimately never be the same in each country or over time, since it is shaped by the policy environment and the cultural-historic setting. This means that such a study has the second challenge of retaining the information within the analysis that is provided by the variety of contexts and the methods of implementation. The speciï¬c task set for the researchers of the study presented here was formulated as follows: ââ¦to provide a consolidated, accessible and up-to-date overview of the effects of different models of cost-sharing in higher education on participation patterns, the diversity, quality and relevance of educational provision and system efï¬ciency.â With regard to the speciï¬c task of this study then, the third problem of such work is the comprehensiveness of the scope set by the commissioning agency. In this case the object of the study is cost-sharing (i.e. differing the contribution to funding higher education made by the state and private organisations, households or individual persons) and an evaluation of its impacts on higher education institutionsâ diversity, quality and relevance of educational provision, and on studentsâ participation patterns. The authors of the study chose the Realist Evaluation approach (Pawson and Tilley 1997, 2004; Pawson 2006) in order to satisfy these challenges and produce a policy-relevant analysis. This approach is designed to improve the understanding of how and why interventions work or do not work in a particular context and has been used frequently in the ï¬eld of the evaluation of social programmes. As described in a recent paper by the Australian government (Westhorp 2014): âRather than comparing changes for participants who have undertaken a programme with a group of people who have not, as is done in random control or quasi-experimental designs, a realist evaluation compares whether a programme works differently in different localities (and if so, how and why) or for different population groups (for example, men and women, or groups with differing socio-economic status). Realist evaluations can be undertaken with small or large groups and with qualitative and/or quantitative data.â The realist evaluation starts out from the programme theory, i.e. the theory about how to bring about a particular change which underpins the speciï¬c intervention. This is a common approach in political analysis, since all policy must have an explicit intension at the outset. Following the realist philosophy (Sayer 1992), the approach assumes that social systems are open systems and their boundaries are permeable and flexible. This has important ramiï¬cations for any analysis, because it means that the way a particular intervention works (i.e. its outcomes) will vary depending on the context in which it is set. The approach looks to outcomes, but"

170,68,0.99,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"3.9 Demand According to Mulgan and Puttick (2013), one of the most striking factors impeding the effective use of evidence is the absence of organisations tasked with linking the supply and demand of evidence. International development researchers are therefore encouraged to understand the demand for research among policymakers and practitioners, by, for example, mapping the existing information-demand and information-use environment. It has been said that if global public goods research is to be made applicable as well as accessible to national environments from the international system, it must be responsive to demand. This is one approach to engaging with users of research, by taking user realities and preferences into account in development research and communication and by gauging the extent of demand for new ideas by policymakers and society more generally. Some argue that to be effective, research must be located more securely within the context of wider knowledge or innovation systems, implying that the effectiveness and impact of research will be driven by continuous interactions between supply drivers and demand drivers (Hovland 2003). Research on knowledge transfer, particularly in the field of policy development, has led to several models of the process. The science-push or knowledge-driven model conceptualises it as a unidirectional and logical flow of information from researchers to policymakers resulting in specific policy decisions, whereas the demand-pull or problem-solving model views the process as occurring through the commissioning of information from researchers by policymakers with the intent of addressing a well-defined policy problem. The interactive model construes knowledge transfer as a reciprocal and mutual activity, one that involves researchers and users in the development, conduct, interpretation and application of research and research-based knowledge (Jacobson et al. 2004). DFID acknowledges a preference to move from a linear, supply driven, transfer-of-technology model to a more interactive, demand-driven or collaborative model (Adolph et al. 2010). Apart from understanding the demand for research, researchers are advised to participate in activities that would stimulate demand for their outputs, such as raising awareness and building capacity within policy circles. In this regard, Shaxson (2010) observes that we know more about how to improve the supply of evidence than we do about how to improve the demand for it, particularly in the policy sphere. Strategies that focus on improving awareness and absorption of research inside government and on expanding research management expertise and developing a culture of policy learning can ameliorate problems on the demand side (Stone 2009). Newman et al. (2012) address capacity to demand research evidence at three levels: individual, organisational and environmental. Capacity-strengthening interventions that stimulate research demand include diagnostic processes, training, mentoring, linking schemes, organisational policies and societal interventions. However, a better understanding is required of what type of mechanisms are most suitable to strengthen user demand for research and to encourage the development of new user participation models in research design and implementation (Adolph et al. 2010)."
170,123,0.99,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"The second underlying characteristic is that development is usually aligned with a view of modernity and is the link to the global world (DÃ­az Andrade and Urquhart 2012). This means that, for the most part, ICT4D researchers and practitioners bring a view of development as the one of the western societies. In an analysis of the development discourse adopted by Internet scholars in India and China, Zhang and Chib (2014) identify that in India, the modernisation discourse is dominant and in China, it is steadily growing. In the case of India, the authors also note the relevance of a technocratic perspective and the focus on achieving goals such as economic growth, industry development, and governance. This external view of development does not acknowledge that development is a process both at the social and political spheres where interests, positions, and view must be confronted, discussed, and agreed upon (or not). In other words, development is understood as a goal or, in research jargon, as a dependent variable and not as a destination involving process, negotiation, and trade-offs. Nonetheless, this bias has led to the emergence of different approaches. As Flor (2012) has identified, a more critical theory tradition is also present in ICT4D studies, probably as a response to this existing modernity bias. Accordingly, participatory and action research methods have gained relevance. Lastly, development is seen as apolitical, and in this context, ICTs are tools that bypass politics reaching the community or individual directly through project interventions. Others have arguably conceived ICTs impact for development mainly through a market system (Avgerou 2003). At the end of the day, this view, aligned with the applications of Senâs capability approach, yields an understanding of development primarily as a personal or grass-roots process that can be achieved in spite of the broader political context. Circumventing the discussion of politics, however, hides the power struggles and the unequal distribution of benefits of the introduction of ICTs in developing countries. Furthermore, a lack of understanding on the politics of ICTs gives the ICT4D community little knowledge of the incentives behind the success, failures, and scalability of projects being implemented. Politics is also a high component of what the context is. Although various authors suggest that context should be taken into consideration both in the implementation and the research of ICT4D projects, these are seen superficially at the most. The underlying notions of development in the ICT4D research domain might be a reason why there is an apparent disconnection between the work carried out in the research domain and policy processes."

93,436,0.99,Nordic Mediation Research,"2 Mediation as a System Mediation is one of the basic conï¬ict resolution systems.3 There are several deï¬nitions of mediation. There is also a wide range of views on mediation.4 Discussion has spoken of ideologies, policies, processes, institutions, models, practices and applications of mediation. Often are made a distinction between theoretical models of mediation and mediation in practice. That distinction has used in the names of many books and articles (e.g. Folberg and Milne 1988; Alï¬ni et al. 2001; McCorkle and Reese 2005; Adrian 2012). Sometimes this categorisation refers to the distinction between theoretical questions of mediation and more practical issuesâsuch as mediation techniques. Sometimes it has used as an analytical tool in empirical studies to make a distinction between theoretical models of mediation and mediation in reality. It is useful to make a distinction between theoretical models of mediation, practical systems of mediation in context, and mediation in action.5 Using three categories makes it possible to get more analytical power to view mediation as a system. Sometimes it is difï¬cult to follow the discussion of mediation because writers are not always telling the context of their approach. Discussion is more rational if the theoretical and practical as well as action level context are clear. All these dimensions of mediation are in interaction with each other. Theoretical models of mediation have an inï¬uence to practical mediation systems and to mediation in action. Also practical mediation systems effects to theoretical models and mediation in action. Mediation in action has own inï¬uence also to theoretical models and practical systems. This model is heuristic. It is useful for comparing how different elements (theoretical models, practical systems, mediation in action) are interacting each other, e.g. how theoretical models are inï¬uencingâor notâto the practical mediation systems and mediation in action. It can be also useful in comparing different mediation systems and mediation in different countries and cultures. It can be used as a tool in critical research by disclosing what kind of gaps and lacks there is between theoretical models, practical systems and mediation in action (Fig. 1). There is many kind of theoretical models of mediation. In this time there is many kind of theoretical discussion concerning mediation in Nordic countries like theoretical models of mediation and taxonomy of them (Ervasti and Nylund 2014), VindelÃ¸vs âreï¬exive mediationâ (VindelÃ¸v 2012), creativity of mediation agreements (Adrian and Mykland 2014), mediation in the light of understanding of identity (Asmussen 2018) and meaning of restorative approach in mediation (Rasmussen 2018)."
97,539,0.99,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","In conclusion, the chapters in this volume provide a compelling account of the increasing evidence of the multiple benefits provided by NBS in combatting climate change, in particular for adapting to a changing climate coupled with increasing urbanisation. Case studies across Europe demonstrate successful implementation of the NBS concept and provide important pointers for urban planning and management. In order to further operationalise the NBS approach as effective instrument in sustainable urban development at a larger scale, we identify key remaining research challenges that can help to foster broad application in practice and policy: â¢ Assess effectiveness of NBS at different scales: The NBS impacts of ecosystem service provisions are highly scale dependent concerning space and time and linked to geographical location in the city as well as other factors such as species selection or management practices. Research should therefore identify at what scale and under which circumstances different NBS are most effective in order to evaluate their potential but also possible limitations. It is important that research is not tailored towards single ecosystem services only but takes into account the multiple benefits possibly generated by a NBS project. â¢ Consider NBS effects of urban soil management: The impact of urban soil management in urban environments, especially the contribution of unsealed soils and high organic soils both to climate mitigation through avoided carbon losses and to adaptation through increased water infiltration and evaporation capacities, needs further scientific attention. â¢ Evaluate hybrid approaches of NBS and grey infrastructure combinations: As several chapters point out, the dichotomy of employing either engineered or NBS solutions may not be useful or effective. Research should also focus on the question how NBS can complement technological solutions. This includes research that combines effects of the building sector (grey infrastructure) with ecosystem management strategies (blue and green infrastructure) in an integrative manner. â¢ Analyse cost-benefits of NBS implementation: In order to evaluate the costeffectiveness of NBS, cost-benefit analyses are needed to assess the whole range of possible multiple NBS benefits in terms of single project evaluations as well as in terms of a comparison between purely âgreyâ and âgreen and blueâ and âhybridâ options. This includes economic analyses of the costs of inaction as well as the possibility of catastrophic failure of purely technical solutions. The full range of social and economic impacts should be comprehensively taken into account by studying the monetary and non-monetary values of NBS projects. â¢ Identify causalities and mechanisms: In order to assess causalities and mechanisms of NBS effectiveness, research set-ups should include an evaluation of all relevant parameters before and after NBS implementation (pre- and post-assessment). Indicators of efficiency should be selected at the beginning of the project and respective measurements undertaken. In addition, the specific contribution"
284,14,0.99,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Environmental governance as a ï¬eld of inquiry Environmental governance offers an analytical perspective that combines socioenvironmental research with development-oriented governance research (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006). Socioenvironmental research addresses the interplay between environmental and social change. In this context, as in this introductory chapter, the social dimension is broadly deï¬ned, also encompassing cultural, economic, political and institutional relations. Governance research addresses the way in which society organizes itself in order to solve its dilemmas and create new opportunities. Until the 1980s, social scientists working in Latin American countries focused on concepts of governability as the region faced unstable political conditions and structural challenges such as inequality, violence, corruption and limited citizenship. However, the growing emphasis on formal institutions and market-driven mechanisms of neoliberal governance quickly attracted the attention of social scientists to a perspective of governance as a social process that inï¬uences the level of governability (Kooiman, 2003). This perspective criticized the normative perspective of âgood governanceâ introduced by the World Bank in the seminal report Governance and Development (1992). According to this document, the solution to overcome underdevelopment should be self-governance. The World Bank proposed a roadmap to achieve so-called good governance based on three pillars: a âsmall stateâ through deregulation; âmarket incentivesâ though privatization and liberalization; and âparticipationâ through decentralization and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Subsequent World Bank reports further elaborated this international agenda, stressing in a rather technocratic approach, the need for effective state institutions to achieve development in a global context of liberalized markets (Demmers, FernÃ¡ndez Jilberto and Hogenboom, 2004). Alternatively, social science scholars use (environmental) governance to emphasize social relations and, in particular, the tension between conservation and development goals in order to understand the interplay among social, institutional and environmental change. The environmental governance research builds on a range of theoretical schools, including new institutionalism (Ostrom, 1990; Young, 1999; Biermann and Pattberg, 2008), sociopolitical studies (Kooiman et al., 2005; Lemos and Agrawal, 2006) and sociocultural approaches (Cleaver, 2002; Alimonda and GandÃ¡segui, 2006; Castro, 2008; Gudynas, 2011). Despite their different theoretical and methodological stands (see Castro, 2013), they all address social behaviour towards natural"

216,18,0.99,Advances in Production Technology,"Anja Ruth Weber and Denis Ãzdemir Production systems will never be fully predictable and boundary conditions become increasingly volatile and complex. This affects especially the outcome of decisions within a production system and requires dynamic system behaviour. Theories help to develop production systems. With regard to engineering and manufacturing sciences there exists specialized knowledge in different areas of production, but the broad technical approach and understanding is not sufï¬cient. Therefore, the longterm goal of the Cluster of Excellence âIntegrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countriesâ is a higher level of integrativity in production technology by developing a common theory of value creation in times of Industrie 4.0 and of highly dynamic system behaviour in production. Thereby, the term âIndustrie 4.0â describes the development of information and communication technology ï¬nding its way into production whose potentials the German Government strives to realise by a homonym project. Industrie 4.0 presents an enormous challenge such as big data, data processing, data security and humanâmachine collaboration. A holistic theory of production shall help to design and operate production systems in such an environment, and that in consideration of economic, ecologic and social aspects. For better modelling real-world correlations the theory should on the one hand describe deterministic processes such as physical and mathematical model chains. By focusing such predictable relationships a reduction of complexity can be achieved. On the other hand the theory needs to adopt a cybernetic perspective, in order to include non-predictable processes. In a real-world situation and within a complex system ambient conditions are changing continuously and decisions often need to be taken, despite the lack of information. This approach enables controlling the complexity, although the situation is not fully understood. Linking the deterministic and cybernetic approach aims at permanently ï¬nding the optimised operating point not only regarding economic but also technical aspects."
376,443,0.99,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","SESs are typically too large and complex to analyze all their structural and functional components at once. Creating a conceptual framework is one way of thinking through the complexity of SESs. The primary purpose of SES frameworks is the identification of specific components, processes, or feedbacks for analysis, and a metric for assessing their roles and interactions in the system. For example, who are the resource uses, and do they share information about the resource with each other? How far is a population from where policy and management decisions are made, and how valued is their input about resource use? Policy makers or resource managers can create their own frameworks in order to analyze their resource systems of interest. The key is identifying the important variables, the scales on which they operate, figuring out how they interact, and then measuring them over time. When problems arise, trying to solve the âwhyâ will often entail finding unexpected connections between multiple components within the SES. Understanding how the SES has reacted to perturbations in the past can be of great help in this effort. At best, the use of SES frameworks will spotlight where interventions are needed or possible to achieve management goals, and will detect system changes over time in a way that allows for some level of prediction. One SES framework originating from political and economic science is meant to allow identification of SES components and interactions within systems of resource use such as fish, groundwater, or pastures. This framework divides an SES into seven categories for analysis: resource systems, resource units, governance, users, interactions, outcomes, and related (or adjacent) ecosystems (Ostrom 2007, 2009). Each of the seven categories is then subdivided into a set of components in order to identify causal relationships and drivers, so that different systems can be compared. A different framework focuses on the exposure of an SES to a particular hazard, and then tracks sensitivity and resilience of both social and ecological components with the aim of analyzing vulnerability (Turner et al. 2003). A third, called the Drylands Development Paradigm, aims to synthesize lessons from research on desertification and economic development, and to act as a template whereby each of the five key principles of SESs can be examined and tested in case studies (Reynolds et al. 2007). The Resilience Alliance has created its own framework specifically for assessing the resilience of an SES (Resilience Alliance). Each of these frameworks is intended for a specific set of contexts and types of resource use, but the underlying assumptions about the interdependency of SESs are the same (for a review of ten SES frameworks, see Binder et al. 2013). Researchers and managers tend to focus on the components of an SES most likely to be influenced by a given change or intervention, or perhaps those most amenable to analysis or management based on their own discipline, as the methods and theories of their own discipline are most familiar to them. Team approaches that include social as well as ecological scientists can help to assure a more comprehensive approach. Three key characteristics critical for analyzing an SESâscale, feedback, and resilienceâmay be difficult to recognize and measure, and thus may be overlooked. A rangeland SES is profoundly affected by attributes such as the"
136,76,0.99,Principles and Practice of Case-Based Clinical Reasoning Education : a Method For Preclinical Students,"Neuroscience and Visual Expertise in Clinical Reasoning While neuroscience is quickly uncovering many cognitive processes, clinical reasoning has hardly been subject of such studies. More recently however a new line of research has evolved which seeks to explore the biologic underpinnings of clinical reasoning. Indeed, an Achilles heel of clinical reasoning is that it is less subject to introspection or visualization, and thus these new methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) are emerging and show particular promise for enhancing our understanding of System 1 thinking. One of the first publications in this domain is from Durning et al. who studied brain process with functional MRI techniques in novices and experts solving clinical problems through vignette-based multiple choice questions. Many parts of the brain were activated. The researchers observed activity in various regions of the prefrontal cortex (Durning et al. 2015). While preliminary, fMRI may be a promising route of future investigation. A new and related avenue of investigation is that of visual expertise (Bezemer 2017; van der Gijp et al. 2016). Medicine is a highly visual profession, not only for specific disciplines such as radiology, pathology, dermatology, surgery, and cardiology but also in primary care (Kok and Jarodzka 2017). Visually observing a patient, human tissue, or a representation of it, and recognizing abnormality, may not easily be expressed in words but can instantly lead to a System 1 recognition."

271,589,0.99,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"The 12 empirical chapters demonstrate through their extremely varied choice of social domains and communicative figurations how the concept of communicative figurations can be applied as a heuristic framework for producing insights about the ways in which âour social domains are moulded by mediaâ (Hepp and Hasebrink, Chap. 2), or ratherâif we adhere to a strict practice theoretical perspectiveâhow these social domains are moulded by the practices in which social actors are using media to achieve their mundane, professional and political ends: âThe concept of figurations links a micro-analysis of individual practices with a meso-analysis of certain social domains and thus offers us various possibilities to contextualize this with macro questions about societyâ (Hepp and Hasebrink, Chap. 2). The study in Chap. 13 by Andreas Breiter and Arne Hendrik Ruhe is a case in point: Applying the core concepts of figurational theory, their chapter shows how the figurational framework can be used to rigorously map the mediated managerial governance structures of German and English schools. The analysis focuses on the meso (organizational) level, its media ensemble and the role of management information systems, but in order to do so analyzes the media repertoires of individual teachers and administrators,1 and also anchors the communicative practices discovered in the macro national educational governance systems in the two countries: âThe schoolâs media ensemble is a moulding force for changes in communicative practices within the actor constellation of schools, among staff, students and administrators as well as in contact with parentsâ (Breiter and Ruhe, Chap. 13)."
223,358,0.99,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Connecting aesthetic approaches to the analysis of the construction of social space therefore enriches the understanding of the relational processes of generating shared meaning and agreeing on how to behave in the current situation. Furthermore, the aesthetic dimension of experience plays a role in defining the scope for future social space because it has the âcapacity to animate actorsâ imaginations and actionsâ (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 46). In this chapter we use this integrated relational conceptualization of social and physical space to analyze data from a series of action experiments we organized in 2009 in Israel. We invited people in small mixed groups to explore together how to envisage a future social space in the same setting. We consciously intensified attention to the aesthetic dimension of the process from the outset by choosing a fine-arts studio as the setting and by providing art materials for the participants to use there, sharing the assumption that âcreative activity with portable, discrete objects allows an extension of potential spaceâ (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 50). For this chapter we have decided to apply an aesthetic approach to the data analysis by focusing only on the visual documentation in order âto avoid committing the cognitive and rational error of ignoring the bodies of the people involved in the decision process and only considering their mindsâ (Strati, 2000, p. 20). Our objective is, therefore, to explore how much one can learn about processes of constructing current and future social space, in which physical relations are integrated, by including aesthetic dimensions of the experience in the analysis. The next section of the chapter describes the context in which we conducted the action experiments. It is followed by an explanation of the methodology that was used to collect and analyze the data. We then present an analysis of the sessions, in which we identify different configurations that evolved during the interactions of the participants with one another and with the physical aspects of a studio. In the final section of the chapter, we present our conclusions about how to conceptualize and analyze social and physical space in an integrated manner and suggest next steps."

35,277,0.99,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"The omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has, more often than not, contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Krause et al. 2015). Therefore, the analysis and documentation of who the relevant stakeholder groups are is important for achieving a good planning process. This may include assessment of their legitimacy and power (Buanes et al. 2004). The design and execution of the planning process for aquaculture, or for the broader MSP process, is important both for the efï¬ciency of the process and for the social sustainability of the outcomes. Qualities like transparency, representativeness and fairness matter for i.e. the legitimacy and support for the outcome (Buanes et al. 2004), for the wider trust in authorities, for development/maintenance of democracy, and for sustainable development (Krause et al. 2015). Who to include in the planning process, and how, can be difï¬cult to decide upon, balancing the ideals above with the ambition for an effective planning process, which typically also is embedded in a larger governance system. Whilst addressing the interactions and feedbacks between issues (e.g. economic, social and environmental consequences) in a MSP context, it becomes evident that many of these play out over time (i.e. in past, present and future contexts) and space (i.e. at local, regional and ecosystem/global scale)âthese are referred to as âcross-scaleâ or âmulti-scaleâ processes (Krause et al. 2015). What time-scale to consider in the planning process, and thus also what geographical scale, is also something that must be decided. Discussions of the availability, usefulness and ease of use of knowledge is also important, e.g. on aquacultureâs value creation and its distribution (Isaksen and Mikkelsen 2012). For example, with the development of feed-aquaculture turning to more land-based production of feeds, agriculture can also be seen as a new emerging stakeholder in aquaculture production (Costa-Pierce 2010). Indeed, when new groups of stakeholders are included in planning processes they may often bring"
170,134,0.99,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"6.3 Knowledge for Policy The two previous subsections have been focused on setting some guidelines of how to approach the broad questions of politics and policy within the ICT4D and other development studies that face similar concerns. These questions can guide researchers on how to approach the policy process, but it is not research alone that will change policy. This is why this last section examines the types of research that could be carried out. As stated in the first section of this chapter, this document is based on the conception that not all research can or should influence policy. If such is the case, what are the types of research that become useful in the policy process and how? Vialle (1981) produces a typology of educational research based on its primary objective. As the author summarises, the problem with typologies is that they are not clear-cut categories, but they can help researchers determine their objective and approach their work with more clarity. Based on Vialleâs (1981) work, I present five types of research according to their objectives in the policy process: conceptual, planning, implementing, action research, and monitoring. Researches in ICT4D that aim at reaching policymakers could benefit from reflecting on how their work can be used in the policy process before it is launched. Conceptual research refers to the academic knowledge that explains phenomena, uncaps relationships between different variables, and creates categories and concepts to simplify complex trends. This type of research, often referred to as âblue skyâ or âpureâ research, is valued in the academic community, but it might be the most distant to policymakers that face day-to-day decisions. Despite this tendency, conceptual research can be extremely important for the development of"
323,139,0.99,Satellite Earth Observations and Their Impact on Society and Policy,"Within the scientiï¬c community, the identiï¬cation of the human role in and impacts on the Earth system have grown signiï¬cantly. There are clear human dimensions to physical and biological parameters, such as air quality conditions and land use patterns. With this recognition have come numerous efforts supporting greater integration of natural and social sciences. A U.S. National Academy of Sciences report suggested efforts âto facilitate crosscutting research focused on understanding the interaction among the climate, human, and environmental systems â¦â (NRC 2009). The Future Earth initiative stemmed from the proposal for âa new contract between science and society in recognition that science must inform policy to make more wise and timely decisions â¦â (ICSU 2012). In the U.S., the Obama Administration directed U.S. Federal agencies in 2015 to factor the value of ecosystem services into Federal planning and decision-making (OMB 2015). The U.S. Global Change Research Programâs (USGCRP) 2012 Strategic Plan also included an objective on greater integration with social, behavioral, and economic sciences (USGCRP 2012)."
264,876,0.99,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"The Program Language and communication are recognized to be core components in the teaching and learning of mathematics, but there are many outstanding questions about the nature of interrelationships among language, mathematics, teaching, and learning. Recent research has demonstrated the wide range of theoretical and methodological resources that can contribute to this area of study, including those drawing from cross-disciplinary perspectives influenced by, among others, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and semiotics. In this topic study group participants presented and discussed the latest research in language and communication in mathematics education internationally. This TSG invited presentation, discussion, and reflection on the latest research on language and communication related to learning and teaching mathematics. We use âlanguage and communicationâ in its broadest sense to mean the multimodal and multi-semiotic nature of mathematical activity and communication, using not only language but also other sign systems. We thus welcomed contributions focusing on all modes of communicationâoral, written, gestural, visual, etc. The TSG built on the strong body of research in mathematics education that addresses these issues and also considered important questions that remain."
245,707,0.99,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"2008) is a prominent example which has been initiated in many education systems, and across many diverse disciplines. Broadly, Tuning involves supporting collaboration among academics with the aim of generating convergence and common understanding of generic and discipline-speciï¬c learning outcomes. Canada adapted this work in innovative ways, focusing the collaborations around sector-oriented discipline clusters rather than education ï¬elds (Lennon et al. 2014), while in Australia a more policy-based and regulatory-focused approach was deployed (ALTC 2010). Such collaboration stimulates appreciation and articulation of learning outcomes, going several steps further than qualiï¬cation frameworks by engaging and building academic capacity within disciplinary contexts. Like the qualiï¬cation frameworks, however, the work usually stops short of advancing assessment resources, and tends to focus instead on advancing case studies or best practice guidelines. Hence while it may arise in particular ï¬elds, there is no emphasis on the application of common procedures or amalgamation of shared results. In shortâthere is no âdata on the tableâ. As well, it must be noted, while the Tuning Process has proliferated internationally there has been little if any summative evaluation, which would add to its traction. A slightly deeper line of development involves the application of shared rubrics to moderate assessment tasks or student performance. Moderation in assessment can play out in many ways (Coates 2010) as indeed has been the case in recent higher education initiatives. The moderation of resources has involved rudimentary forms of peer review through to slightly more extensive forms of exchange. Mechanisms have also been developed to help moderate student performance. In the United States, for instance, the AAC&U (Rhodes and Finley 2013) has developed VALUE rubrics for helping faculty assess various general skills. The United Kingdomâs external examiner system (QAA 2014) is a further example. Several such schemes have been launched in Australia, including a Quality Veriï¬cation System and a Learning and Teaching Standards Project, both of which involve peer review and moderation across disciplines (Marshall et al. 2013). This work travels deeper than qualiï¬cation- or discipline-level speciï¬cations, for it involves the collation and sharing of evidence on student performance, often in ways that engage faculty in useful assurance and development activities. Such moderation work is limited, however, in being applied in isolation from other assessment activities and materials. Hence it implies various unsystematic forms of application and amalgamation. Collaborative assessments build from the developments discussed so far to advance more coherent and expansive approaches to shared assessment. As with other developments addressed here, such work plays out in myriad ways. For instance, medical progress testing in the Netherlands (Schuwirth and Van De Vleuten 2012) involves the formation of shared assessment materials, and administration of these in a longitudinal sense. Other assessment collaborations have focused on the development of shared tasks, analytical or reporting activities (e.g. Edwards et al. 2012; Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al. 2014). Such work is impressive as it tends to involve the most extensive forms of outcome speciï¬cation, task production, assessment administration, analysis and reporting, and at the same time"
72,76,0.99,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Added to this are individual initiatives and rebellions against prevailing morals, customs, rules â interruptions or crossings of âimitation streamsâ â that are transferred and imitated from person to person, leading to social innovations. âResearching the âmany small inventionsâ, according to Tarde, is a matter for a sociology which âhas become a truly experimental scienceââ (Balke, 2009, p. 151). Social change must be viewed as a contingent phenomenon that resists any general (macro) theory. Because of the basic interdependence between social structures and social negotiation (Joas, 1992, p. 60), in every reproduced action there exists simultaneously the momentum of creation, change and transformation. The benefit of conceptualising a micro foundation of the social realm consists in decoding the recursive processes based on many small social inventions, ideas, initiatives and innovations as drivers of social change. If social micro units are accorded constitutive importance for the dynamics of society, it becomes possible to describe social change not simply as a trend in the sense of a transition from one state at time t to another at time t1, but to see it as an independent non-deterministic reality. Thus, social innovation can be understood as a âstarting point for creating social dynamics behind technological innovationsâ (Geels, 2006, p. 6), that is, as change that arises as a result of constant changes by inventive and imitating actors (Tarde, 2009c, p. 67). With Tarde, social change can be traced back to the effects of small and micro units. Change is explained from the bottom up in current discourse on social transformation processes, as a fundamental prerequisite for substantial change (Paech, 2012). Its emergence from unintended and intentional deviations from the ideal of imitation provides the possibility of linking micro and macro perspectives (Gilgenmann, 2010, p. 7) â connecting a view of individuals in their society with a view of the society as a whole. While the macro perspective looks at how social facts and constructs impact on social life, that is, it refers to the power of structures, institutions etc. to shape actions (see, for example, Hasse and KrÃ¼cken, 2005, p. 17), the micro perspective on the social realm focuses on the âlaw of their formationâ (Tarde, 2009a, p. 101) and discovers how they emerge and transform, that is, it enables a micro foundation of social change. The key to analysis, therefore, lies in identifying social innovations that spread through society as a result of imitation to bring about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). These are non-teleological and highly contingent processes."

The initiatives under study all undertake activities that in one way or another support, promote, maintain, develop or upscale nature-based solutions. We investigate the way transition initiatives operate in accelerating urban transition initiatives with nature-based solutions with a conceptual framework of acceleration mechanisms developed as the core of a 3 year EU funded research project ARTS (www.acceleratingtransitions.eu). The conceptual framework of the mechanisms driving accelerating of urban sustainability transitions is not to âbe taken as a recipe for successâ of how transition initiatives should relate and connect but âas handles for reflective practiceâ that in the context of multi-level governance can instigate accumulation of changes and increase the pace of changes required for urban sustainability transitions to take-off (Bussu and Bartels 2014). Building from the literature of sustainability transitions (Rotmans et al. 2001, p. 17; Van der Brugge and Van Raak 2007; Avelino and Rotmans 2011) and urban governance and with a focus on transformative agency working (Westley et al. 2013 p. 2; Olsson et al. 2014; Cote and Nightingale 2012), we propose five mechanisms that may contribute to acceleration of sustainability transitions and we selectively present the most recent writings that ground our conceptualization and further show the applicability of our conceptualization in understanding accelerating dynamics in cities. Upscaling is the growth of members, supporters or users of a single transition initiative in order to spread these new ways of thinking, organizing and practicing. Boyer (2015, p. 322) identifies scaling up as a diffusion pathway of grassroots innovations focusing on a scaling of a practice by referring to âapplication of practice beyond an activist core, to a broader audienceâ. Desa and Koch (2014) identifies the diffusion and spread of one product or practice to greater number of users as a scaling and Staggenborg, and Ogrodnik (2015) point at different ways that transition initiatives meaningfully scale up in broadening participation and engagement of new members and supporters without compromising values and operation models. Replicating is the take up of new ways of doing, organizing and thinking of one transition initiative by another transition initiative or different actors in order to spread out these new ways. Garcia et al. (2015, p. 96) recognizes replication of innovative practices as a process that contributes to systemic change, further backing our conceptualization as a process for changing the pace of change in transitions. Boyer (2015, p. 322) identifies replication as a diffusion pathway of grassroots innovations addressing âspread through a network of dedicated activistsâ and later on, as âdiffusion of practice with a committed activist networkâ. Partnering is the pooling and/or complementing of resources, competences, and capacities in order to exploit synergies to support and ensure the continuity of the new ways of doing, organizing and thinking. Partnering is the mechanism that describes the ways transition initiatives act for pooling synergies and leverage"
381,568,0.99,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"A Continuous Improvement Approach The second core element of a high-quality system is the simple but demanding concept of continuous improvement, which is a logical extension of our earlier observations about the importance of contextual conditions and systemic contributors to the success of any effort to improve outcomes for traditionally underserved students. An outgrowth of W. E. Demingâs work in Japan, continuous (quality) improvement has been a focus for research and organizational change efforts in both public service and private industry for decades. A recent comprehensive review of this work identified five core features of quality improvement across a variety of approaches: 1. It is focused on system outcomes for a defined population of beneficiariesâand on the processes that lead to those results; 2. It uses variation in performance (including âfailureâ) as opportunities for learning and improvement; 3. It takes a system perspective, with the understanding that systems are designed to get the results they produce, so if you want to change the results, you have to change the system; 4. It is evidence-based, including measurement of not only outcomes but processes (and resources), and this measurement is embedded in the day-to-day work of the system and its participants: and 5. It involves a specific and coherent methodology and processes. Some of the more familiar methods include PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles, âSix Sigma,â and âLEAN.â24 While specific methodologies differ, continuous improvement processes generally start with identification and analysis of a problem of practice in the given system, followed by repeated cycles of inquiry in which a plan for addressing that problem is developed, tested, revised based on data, and then implemented more broadly (or retested anew), followed by new data and more refinement. Most authors discuss quality improvement as a necessarily ongoing activity, often involving multiple cycles over periods of 7â10 or even more years to address major performance problems. For Tony Bryk and his colleagues at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, a critical feature of an improvement approach is not simply the repetition of the cycles of planning, action, and feedback but also the integration of continuous improvement processes into the daily work of individuals throughout the system.25 Collaboration and active involvement of system participants allows for more effective individual and organizational learning, diffusion of promising practices, and adaptation to changing conditions (both internal and external)âall aspects of the implementation challenges discussed earlier. Such collaboration has repeatedly been identified as a central feature of more effective schools"

In our opinion, prospective IE models provide such implementation. The scenario approach makes explicit the underlying exogenous assumptions that necessarily accompany any prospective model of an indeterminate system. Several authors, including Zamagni et al. (2012), Plevin et al. (2014a), and Suh and Yang (2014), acknowledge the importance of scenario modeling for the scientific assessment of decision-making in general and the questions posed by CLCA in particular. The use of a comprehensive model of societyâs metabolism allows us to study the system with the high level of detail and biophysical consistency that is a distinctive feature of industrial ecology methods. The combination of the scenario approach and a detailed model of societyâs metabolism make prospective IE models a powerful and scientifically credible approach to explore the potential consequences of decisions."
347,371,0.99,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"In spite of high policy ambitions, many initiatives and efforts made by a wide set of actors and stakeholders, the overall conclusion of the three cross-case studies is that implementation and enforcement generally lag behind in relation to existing objectives for the Baltic marine environment and that this to a significant extent is associated with âimperfectionsâ in the studied governance structures and processes as outlined above. However, to address the aim of this chapter â to develop more concrete ideas for improvements â it is important to ask whether it is possible to identify any root problems and causes for these implementation deficits. Based on the specific problems and shortcomings identified in the cross-case comparisons of the focused governance dimensions (multilevel and multisectoral structures, assessment-management interactions and stakeholder communication and participation), it is possible to discern a set of recurring problem areas (Table 10.3). These problem areas have in previous governance research been identified as key governance challenges (SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015) and have for the purpose of our analysis, given its limitations, been classified as ârootâ problems. In the following discussion, these identified root problems â together with conclusions from the individual cases â provide a basis to formulate broader pathways as well as associated specific ideas about measures and âinstitutional reformsâ to potentially improve Baltic Sea environmental governance (Table 10.4). In general, we conclude that it is difficult to go much further with regard to adopted environmental targets for the Baltic Sea, without more fundamental changes, i.e. efforts for improvement must consist of something else than âmore of the sameâ. This is challenging and complex and requires a continuous and adaptive policy-making and transition process. However, despite these challenges, some positive steps have already been taken in line with our proposed pathways, albeit often in rudimentary ways or only in specific cases. Hence, despite difficulties, we do not see the proposed pathways as impossible to embark on more broadly. It is hardly surprising, looking at the three cross-case governance dimensions focused on in the book, that the root problems differ between governance structures, assessment-management interactions and stakeholder participation (Table 10.4). Still, even though root problems such as âinsufficient coordination and integrationâ and âinsufficient flexibility and adaptabilityâ were most influential and problematic in the case of governance structures, these problems are also significant and important with regard to other governance dimensions. This means that Table 10.4 should not be seen as an attempt to strictly differentiate between totally different root problems and pathways for the studied governance dimensions. Instead, the table is an attempt to organise our analysis by highlighting key root problems and potential pathways associated with the studied governance dimensions. This analysis reveals that current multilevel and multisectoral governance structures mainly are hampered by insufficient coordination and integration, as well as insufficient flexibility and adaptability (Table 10.4). In our cross-case analysis, we identified a set of specific ideas that together can promote a pathway for improved"
97,169,0.99,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Due to the multiple factors of risk, management in cities and urban regions needs to be based on a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach. A social-ecologicaltechnological systems (SETs) approach (illustrated in Fig. 6.1) can be a useful framework to understand the dynamic interactions between social, ecological, and technical-infrastructural domains of urban systems. The SETs approach aims at overcoming the limitation of a purely socio-technological approach which tends to exclude ecological functions, or of a social-ecological approach inclined to overlook critical roles of technology and infrastructure as fundamental constituents, and drivers of urban system dynamics (McPhearson et al. 2016a). As the SETs approach, can broaden the spectrum of the options available for intervention (Grimm et al. 2016), it is therefore a suitable framework to explore the range of options available and needed to adapt to climate impacts in the urban context. Using this framework, we investigate the pros and cons of adapting to climate change through grey infrastructures (i.e. hard or engineering approaches), âgreenâ and âblueâ approaches (i.e. the restoration of ecosystems, various types of"

What modelers can do, however, is to deï¬ne and evaluate, in different levels of detail, numerous alternatives that represent various possible compromises among conflicting groups, values, and management objectives. A rigorous and objective analysis should help to identify the possible tradeoffs among quantiï¬able objectives so that further debate and analysis can be more informed. The art of modeling is to identify those issues and concerns that are important and signiï¬cant and to structure the analysis to shed light on these issues. Although water resources planning and management processes are not restricted to mathematical modeling, such modeling is an important part of those processes. Models can represent in a fairly structured and ordered manner the important interdependencies and interactions among the various control structures and users of a water resource system. Models permit an evaluation of the economic and physical consequences of alternative engineering structures, of various operating and allocating policies, and of different assumptions regarding future supplies, demands, technology, costs, and social and legal requirements. Although models cannot deï¬ne the best objectives or set of assumptions, they can help identify the decisions that best meet any particular objective and assumptions. We should not expect, therefore, to have the precise results of any quantitative systems study accepted and implemented. A measure of the success of any systems study resides in the answer to the following questions: Did the study have a beneï¬cial impact in the planning and decision-making process? Did the results of such studies lead to a more informed debate over the proper choice of alternatives? Did it introduce competitive alternatives that otherwise would not have been considered? There seems to be no end of challenging water resource systems planning problems facing water resources planners and managers. How one models any speciï¬c water resource problem depends on (a) the objectives of the analysis;"
234,164,0.99,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"PERSPECTIVES FROM SOCIO-LEGAL STUDIES AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY (CA) It was at this point that we reviewed some of the work on capabilities from the perspective of socio-legal studies, which itself draws on social philosophy and citizenship studies. This research would most certainly not be picked up in a systematic review. We have called this group of theories the âcapability approachâ (CA). Once again, this literature uses complex concepts and language, potentially limiting accessibility and opportunities for holistic multi-disciplinary thinking. Barbardâs paper addresses âcapabilitiesâ from the perspective of the development of the European Union and its associated legal institutions. It is concerned primarily with the conditions necessary for the realisation of the European Councilâs strategic goal of becoming âthe most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesionâ (2001: 464). At ï¬rst sight we may dismiss this work as somewhat peripheral to our concerns (with professional voluntarism and health systems in lowresource settings). The language used is more up-beat; less about âproblemsâ and more about knowledge for foresight and innovation. However, the immediate link with âinvesting in people and combating social exclusionâ lies at its heart. What initially interested us was the quite different approach to the concept of capabilities. Here they are not reduced to intrinsic or raw attributes of individuals but linked to concepts of agency and âproactive securityâ (2001: 467).

As IDEs are a main tool in software development, they also play a major role in making developers productive and comfortable in their work. Moreover, IDEs are a key aspect in developer experience (DX), a concept that encompasses developerâs perceptions of their work and phenomena related to it such as cognitive, motivational, affective, and social aspects. For example, memory overload is a limiting factor for programmers, especially for beginners who have not yet developed strategies to relieve it [20]. Modern development environments provide many aids to programmers, but the same challenges are still present. Cognitive factors also concern larger structures in software development, such as methods and processes, but research on this aspect is scarce. Developer Experience and Motivation. The concept of DX aims to provide an intuitive abstraction of the huge variety and quantity of human factors that influence developers and the outcomes of SE [7]. While UX considers the context of use of a system, DX considers the context of software development, including aspects beyond software tools, such as development processes, modeling methods, and other means of structuring SE tasks. Some of these aspects are embedded in tools such as IDEs while others are part of organizational practices. The software development activity and environment differ in signiï¬cant ways from other information-intensive activities and environments. For example, software development requires a nested understanding: developers use software to build further software that is to be used by users to accomplish their particular tasks. Also, developers frequently conï¬gure and extend their tools, in effect continuously developing both the development environment and the end product at the same time. Developer motivation is as another important factor in SE. The majority of studies on motivation in SE report that developers are distinct from other occupational groups with respect to motivation [3]. âThe work itselfâ is the most commonly cited motivator, but there is a lack of detail regarding what aspects of the work is motivating, how motivational processes occur, and the outcomes of motivating developers [3, 21]. Investigations also show the importance of considering affective aspects of SE. The presence and variation of developersâ emotions over time has been documented [22]. Programming is influenced by mood [4], and happiness has been found to have productivity beneï¬ts [2]. This underlines the importance of considering affective aspects both for purposes of well-being and outcomes."
287,22,0.99,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"In the following decade, from 1992 up to the beginning of the 21st century, the discussion on theory concepts died down in the German community of mathematics educators while the theoretical diversity in the ï¬eld grew. Considering the two main scientiï¬c journals, we identiï¬ed scientiï¬c contributions from several theoretical communities addressing three topics related to the TME program (without any claim of completeness): 1. Methodology: methodological and thus theoretical aspects in interpretative research (Beck and Jungwirth 1999), interviews in empirical research (Beck and Maier 1993), multi-methods (Wellenreuther 1997); explaining in research (Maier 1998), methodological considerations on TIMSS (Knoche and Lind 2000); 2. Methods in empirical research: e.g., two special issues of ZDM in 2003 edited by Kaiser presented a number of methodical frameworks; and 3. Issues on meta-research about what mathematics education is, can, and should include: considerations on paradigms and the notion of theory in interpretative research (Maier and Beck 2001), comparison research (Kaiser 2000; Maier and Steinbring 1998; Brandt and Krummheuer 2000; Jungwirth 1994), and mathematics education as design science (Wittmann 1995) and as a text science (Beck and Maier 1994). This short list indicates thatâat that timeâdistinct theoretical communities seemed to share the need for methodological and meta-theoretical reflection. However, the German community of mathematics education as a whole did notâ and still does notâshare a common paradigm. In order to provide deeper insight into theory strands of German-speaking countries, two examples are presented. The ï¬rst one is the theory of learning activity that originates in activity theory developed by Joachim Lompscher. It is used today in several educational subjects: for example, Bruder has further developed and adapted this concept to the needs of mathematics education, and she and Schmitt will present this theory strand. The second theory strand is a speciï¬c view on semiotics presented by DÃ¶rfler and contrasted with Otteâs view on signs as a vehicle for doing mathematics as a human activity. The theory of learning activity provides a general educational theory that has been borrowed then applied and adapted to mathematics education, while DÃ¶rfler bases his work profoundly in the philosophies of Peirce and Wittgenstein and reconstructs mathematics as a kind of game using diagrams in a more home-grown Open Access This chapter is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits use, duplication, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, a link is provided to the Creative Commons license and any changes made are indicated."

They can reveal unique ï¬ndings beyond the scope of large-scale studies and also complement large-scale studies by providing deep understanding about different societies and education systems, thereby enhancing interpretations and implications. Examples of such small-scale studies are Cai (1995, 2000), Cai, Ding, and Wang (2014), Ma (1999), Silver, Leung, and Cai (1995), Song and Ginsburg (1987), and Stevenson et al. (1990). In Cai et al.

346,85,0.99,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","This section argues that textbook revision and development processes are well positioned to undermine the coherence of competing conflict narratives warned against by Cobb. Specifically, textbook work appears to hold great potential for creating a âdialogical spaceâ (Hermann 2004) in which to engage participants from former conflict sides in reassessing and redefining their narratives, and their underlying antagonistic perceptions and belief systems. This can be achieved through textbook work that involves and that facilitates sustained cooperative interaction and critical and âconstructive confrontation with the painful pastâ (Nadler and Shnabel 2008: 44)âtwo processes otherwise respectively described in the conflict transformation literature as âinstrumentalâ and âsocioemotionalâ forms of âsocial learningâ conducive to intergroup reconciliation (Aiken 2013; Nadler et al. 2008; Nadler and Shnabel 2008). By engaging former enemies in such processes of âsocial learningâ, textbook work may act as a catalyst for ânarrative transformationâ directed towards increased ânarrative complexityâ (Cobb 2003). It can, in other words, contribute towards broadening the narrow and uniform stock of stories that often define intergroup relations and towards crafting more complex and nuanced narratives on the basis of dialogical interaction and critical enquiry. The processes involved in this transformative model of textbook work may ultimately allow a transition from competing narratives that one-sidedly emphasise incompatible historical claims towards more inclusive and pluralistic narratives, which are at once shared and heteroglossic and which accept, expose and discuss multiple understandings of the divisive past on scientific bases while also being appreciative of the often overlooked positive interactions and transfers that marked histories of intergroup relations. Based on worldwide experiences in post-conflict societies, a number of key procedural principles and prerequisites can be highlighted as being fundamental for this transformative process to occur within the proposed model of textbook work. The first regards the importance of adopting an inclusive, symmetrical, and democratic collaborative approach to textbook revision and development, which ensures a sense of empowerment and ownership for the various parties and sides involved. A review of case-studies on textbook projects indicates the importance of respecting a concern for inclusiveness and equality both in the configuration of participant groups and in the perspectives and stories discussed and eventually presented in the newly designed textbooks. This approach may both initiate and signal a crucial shift from a common practice"

[46] review agile maturity models and agile improvement and adoption frameworks/grids on the basis of work orientation, mode of assessment and intent. They also query what it is that actually makes organisational capabilities mature and they identify âEmphasis on Learningâ as one of four elements that are typical. Maier et al. [46] draw on Argyris and Schonâs [1] concepts of single & double loop learning to discriminate between different levels of maturity. Korsaa et al. [40] support this focus on the people & learning aspects in amongst all the process and practice improvement focus of CMMi and SPICE initiatives. They assert that improving software processes does depend upon the organisationâs ability to support empowered individuals through a learning environment. This is key as it recognizes the importance of individuals being empowered to learn as a means of achieving improvements in the delivery of software. They recognize that the human aspect is crucial for process improvement as it is entirely dependent upon the individualâs motivation to change the way they work. Korsaa et al. [40] also compare the work of Michael Hammer [29] and Jacobsen et al. [33] and conclude that both perspectives place the individual central in process analysis making individuals responsible for changes and improvements. This is most likely to take place within a learning organisation culture that supports continuous improvement. Boehm [4] points out that as agile projects do not put the emphasis on documentation then the implication is that much of the project knowledge will not be held explicitly and will be held tacitly within individualâs minds. Following a survey of agile professionals, Rejab et al. [59] identify ï¬ve approaches to distributing (sharing) knowledge and expertise within agile teams from hands-on learning to apprenticeâ master models and coaching & mentoring. In terms of facilitating this knowledge sharing, Kahkonen [35] advocates that Agile project management approaches need to incorporate practices that lead to the creation of Communities of Practice (CoPs) and has found them to be useful in aspects of Agile methods as well as ultimately assisting with the agility of the organisation. Similarly, Jugdev and Mathur [34] identify Project Reviews and Communities of Practice as vehicles for gathering and sharing project learning and more recently there has been a signiï¬cant focus on CoPs with Paasivaara and Lassenius [53] and Paasivaara and Lassenius [54] identifying the existence of multiple examples of the adoption of Communities of Practice within a large distributed Agile project management environment (Ericsson).

278,506,0.99,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The Role of Science in Shaping Sustainable Business: Unilever Case Study Sarah Sim, Henry King, and Edward Price Abstract Unilever is a leading example of a multinational company in the FastMoving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector. Unilever has long been an advocate of sustainable business, using scientific assessment as the basis for its strategy and initiatives. Given its business, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is established within the company and there is a current focus on improving the methodology and scope of LCA. Recent developments include new approaches to fill data gaps for agricultural ingredients and new impact assessment methods for assessing land use change. We have also adapted LCA approaches to inform corporate strategy and to engage a broad range of stakeholders both within the company and outside. The most recent and significant example of this has been the use of product footprinting as an integral element of Unileverâs Sustainable Living Plan (USLP); currently over 2000 products are footprinted annually across 14 countries. LCA approaches will continue to play an important role in Unileverâs strategy. However, there is an urgent need to develop more predictive, regional/global level approaches that take into account the limited availability of many earth resources, the non-linearity of certain impacts and the absolute limits of sustainability. Several conceptual systems-level frameworks and theories already exist, but the Planetary Boundary (PB) approach has been selected as the most promising for developments in data, modelling and contextualization of environmental assessment. We have identified the need for developments in informatics to exploit new data gathering approaches as well as new modelling initiatives utilizing Geographical Information Systems (GIS) mapping and âbig dataâ approaches. In particular, we see real value in developing a distinct and novel, âPB-enabledâ normative LCA approach to support product/service/sectorial decision-making.

277,8,0.99,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"In this context, the social sciences have played an important role in shaping public understanding of immigrant integration processes, and in many cases also in shaping government policies. When this started to happen and the way in which this took place, however, varies from one country to another, and from city to city. The specific role of social scientists in shaping policies also varies greatly: in some cases researchers have been quite active both in the scientific process of formulating the content of policies and in the political process of getting policies established. In other cases, social scientists have distanced themselves, or have been kept at a distance, from policymaking. Between these two positions many variations also exist. Scientists may have influenced policies, but the reverse may also be the case: policymakers may play a role in shaping the production of knowledge. Policymakers may solicit the knowledge they wish to have in many ways and with varying degrees of scientific freedom for researchers. Major differences exist between European countries in the way relations between policy and research on immigrant integration have evolved. Nowadays, however, a feature common to many European countries is that the body of scientificallybased knowledge on immigrant integration has increased substantially, while at the same time public authorities seem to have become less interested in making use of the assembled knowledge. The current relationship between migration research and policymaking seems to have led to a certain disenchantment about researchpolicy dialogues. Although the idea of âevidence-based policymakingâ has gained wide recognition discursively, strong evidence also exists that politicians and policymakers often use scientific research for symbolic rather than instrumental purposes (Boswell 2009). Clearly, in parallel with the increasing politicisation of the field, earlier optimism about the value of academic expertise in guiding rational societal steering has yielded to a growing cynicism about the validity of research and the credibility of researchers (Scholten and Verbeek 2014). At the same time, various scholars have indicated their disenchantment about the policy-driven orientation of research in this area and the lack of theoretical development in this research field (Favell 2003; Bommes and ThrÃ¤nhardt 2010). They see this as an effect of the intense contacts between researchers and policymakers that have existed in several countries. Critics have coined the term âmethodological nationalismâ to describe research fields where choice of topics, questions to be answered, conceptual and theoretical approaches, and the sources to be used largely depend on political and policy framing by national governmental actors (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002). This, in turn, has led to a call for more independent, theory-driven and (international) comparative research (Penninx et al. 2006). This book aims to develop deeper insights into how research and policymaking in the field of migrant integration have developed historically and how this interrelationship plays out in the strongly politicised climate of opinions on migration in Europe. We do this firstly by developing a conceptual frame for analysis of research-policy dialogues (in this introductory chapter). This is followed by a comparative analysis of empirical cases in the rest of the book: Part I presents comparative case studies of different forms of dialogues and their functions, while Part II systematically analyses the development of research-policy dialogues in"

In Chap. 5, James Haselip and Mike Hughes critically assess the landscape of AfricaâEurope cooperation on the topic of climate change. The authors argue that the complexity of R&I challenges for this issue calls for subtler collaborative programming and more rigorous evaluation. Critically, they emphasise the need for greater harmonisation between scientific and political priorities on climate change, and also point out that project goals should be much more precisely defined so as to ensure that results can be measured and solutions progressively improved. Chapter 6 investigates the strategic benefits of global health collaboration programmes for AfricaâEurope cooperation. Lamenting the lack of alignment or harmonisation of research priorities and cooperation patterns, its authors show how recent positive research development on health issues in Africa can foster more constructive and more balanced research partnerships with European countries and institutions. In this vein, the authors lobby for greater support for the Research Fairness Initiative (RFI), that is, as a promising emerging global standard for fostering fair and sustainable research partnerships and as a tool to establish more inclusive and better institutionalised framework for AfricaâEurope cooperation on health development and innovation. In Chap. 7, Gerard Ralphs and Isabella E. Wagner reflect on the issue of the âhealthâ of cooperative STI projects, by drawing out the distinction between project efficiency, on the one hand, and partnership effectiveness on the other. In a context where partnering can be challengingâfor reasons related to history or power imbalancesâthe authors propose a set of concrete applications to address these challenges during the partnering process. In doing so, they argue that using evaluative concepts, such as âpartnership learningâ, are needed to better situate partners within the increasingly complex political, economic and cultural settings of STI collaboration projects. Taking a birdâs eye view on all the chapters, the postscript offers a set of critical perspectives on the framework conditions that shape Africaâ Europe STI cooperation today. Reasserting the necessity of cooperation between the two neighbouring continents, it argues for more radical and innovative cooperative mechanisms, more commercially oriented funding models and a stronger âoutcome thinkingâ mindset so as to ensure the sustainability of collaboration that can not only foster greater synergies"

Paradigmatically, David Morley states in opposition to mediacentric approaches that âwe need to âdecentreâ the media, in our analytical framework, so as to better understand the ways in which media processes and everyday life are interwoven with each otherâ (Morley 2007: 200). Most studies prefer open-ended interviews as an adequate method to enable respondents to articulate their individual relevance frames (Gray 1992: 21; Krajina 2014: 51â57). Most empirical studies following this approach apply an ethnographic oriented âmethodic triangulationâ, and use different forms of data collection such as observation, media diaries and also qualitative interviews. The latter is attributed a âpivotal roleâ (Livingstone 2010: 566) to reconstruct how individuals use media in a broader cultural and social context. There are methodological reflections about the problems that the artificial interview situations and the interviewerâs interventions have the effect of limiting the possibility that respondents will tell their own âstoriesâ. Furthermore, there is obviously a more or less explicit awareness of the structural tension between an open-ended interview approach and the media-related research question in mind (Morley and Silverstone 1991: 155). But as far as we see, so far no systematic method has been worked out to address this problem. As a typical example, in his study about individualsâ âeveryday encounters with public screensâ in cities, Krajina characterizes his interview method as âin-depth, unstructured conversation, loosely anchored around themes such as routines and interaction with screensâ (Krajina 2014: 57). Nevertheless, the discussion explicitly poses questions of how to âunlockâ implicit or prereflective practices and knowledge in a phenomenological perspective; implicit media use which is discussed above as a special routine practice is hardly reflected in the ongoing discussion. To summarize, we can conclude that problem awareness in the methodological literature and the media studies exists with regard to the balancing act between adhering to the principle of openness, on the one hand, and maintaining the thematic focus, on the other. What is less discussed is the implicit nature of media use as a routine practice as was outlined by KÃ¼bler in 1987, but which has been neglected subsequently. Although scholars found ways of enquiring about such routine practices with the help of experience questions that encourage respondents to reflect upon their daily routines, in most of the empirical studies researchers do not reflect upon the risk of influencing the intervieweesâ"

224,109,0.99,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"4.2.1 Agricultural Intensification and Innovation Land use practices are known to be closely linked to societal institutions and the population (Turner et al. 2007). The theoretical scholarship on the populationâagricultural change nexus has notably been anchored in two seminal works. One is Thomas Malthusâs (1798) essay on the intrinsic imbalance between population growth rates and food production. The other is the book by Ester Boserup (1965) that suggests that farmers in âprimitiveâ agricultural systems such as shifting cultivation tend to produce below the maximum because this allows for the optimal inputâoutput efficiency. The conceptual frameworks suggested by Malthus and Boserup have had a huge impact on various scholars who have addressed the issue of how and why agricultural change and land use intensification occur. Although the models are contestable simplifications of real world situations, they have nevertheless provided a constructive starting point from which to discuss the complexity of agricultural change and land use trajectories. A number of classic studies (e.g. Adams and Mortimore 1997; Netting 1993; Turner et al. 1977, 1993; Wiggins 1995) have provided empirical documentation, which supports the perception that Boserupâs model fits fairly well for land use systems that rely on land and labour extensive methods when land is abundant. More recent research emphasizes a number of economic, social or political factors that shape land use change beyond what is implicitly assumed in Boserupâs simple model (Brookfield 2001; Stone 2001). One crucial issue is that the assumption of a direct, inverse relationship between efficiency and production concentration may not mirror realities (Stone 2001). The possible effect of local inputâoutput energetic and population factors may be overshadowed by other factors; market access may, for example, play a significant role in the change trajectories when the land use system becomes part of a larger, spatial setting (Netting 1993)."

In many cases the omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Martinez-Alier 2001; Nagarajan and Thiyageasan 2006; Varela 2001). The unavoidability of feedbacks between largely structural and technical interventions and the socio-economic systems within which they are embedded, highlights the need for employing more systematic (or ecosystem) approaches to analyse cause and effect relationships and to explore future sustainable, efï¬cient and equitable development scenarios (Hopkins et al. 2011; Belton and Bush 2014). This raises the question, what processes are needed to include issues and concerns that are not currently promoted by active and resourceful stakeholders (Buanes et al. 2004). This is especially important in offshore areas under multi-use conditions, since this is a novel line of resource use which lacks yet experiences on which stakeholder groupâs work well together under which governance and management conditions and what type of socio-economic outcomes can be expected. Indeed, more detailed and context-speciï¬c socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture operations include many important factors which need to be understood: gender, employment and income, nutrition, food security, health, insurance, credit availability, human rights, legal security, privatization, culture/identity, global trade and inequalities, as well as policies, laws and regulations, macro-economic context, political context, customary rules and systems, stakeholders, knowledge and attitudes, ethics, power, markets, capital and ownership (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Certainly, the lack of consensus on the social dimension is striking when compared with the universally accepted general deï¬nitions that exist for the biological and economic dimensions for sustainable ecosystem management (Krause et al. 2015). This is even more so the case of offshore marine management. Based on the existing literature from coastal aquaculture (see references below) we identify these major types of socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture which are universally applicable: (a) Attitudes to and perceptions of aquaculture and its effects (b) Organization of and participation in planning for aquaculture (c) Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution (d) Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests (e) Effects on the wider economic and innovation system (f) Effects on cultural fabric and other social aspects As the list indicates, the social implications of aquaculture are multi-dimensional and affect multiple levels. As a starting point of this analysis, we capture what we account as social dimension by stating what aspects of aquaculture we have excluded: The internal organization and efï¬ciency of the aquaculture production units, and the ecological effects of aquaculture production (including biological,"
170,264,0.99,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"We conclude with comments on the internalizations of changes in values, attitudes and practices of individual participants and reflections on the role of researchers in the participatory process. It is worth noting that gender and age variables were not items of analysis; hence, we refer directly to teachersâ comments. Due to the dynamic nature of the educational context, it was necessary to equally recognize varying uses of technology in schools, where each translates to different thresholds of attitudes and skill levels. For that reason, we limited our analysis to teacher-level adoption and reaction to the development of an educational software within a formal education space that consists of interactions between teachers and children."

Physicians are also âsignificant othersâ whose roles deserve further attention (Daalman and Elder 2007). Studies have repeatedly shown that even in health care interactions, socioeconomic inequalities exist. For example, it has been reported that more-deprived individuals receive a lower quality of care (Hall and Dornan 1990), spend less time with a doctor (Videau et al. 2010) and receive less information (Willems et al. 2005). Sociological explanations for these divergences are scarce (Willems et al. 2005), but important insights could be derived from the observation that patients in a higher socioeconomic position secure more information from doctors, through effective expressiveness and assertiveness (Verlinde et al. 2012). This active stance precisely constitutes the underlying idea for Shim (2010) developing how cultural health capital may shape the content and tone of patientprovider interactions. The life course perspective highlights that we should extend all these questions beyond the individual level and include the societal processes that shape and reshape the dynamics of inequality that underlie these preventive health care inequalities (Graham 2002). The example of mammography screening illustrates that the role of national policies can be elucidated both by cross-country comparisons and through the study of changes within a single country over time. A lack of (longitudinal) data and methodological difficulties are only some of the reasons why many of these questions have remained unexplored. At least as important is to keep the underlying theoretical premises in mind. Both life course research and medical sociological theory are particularly well-suited to move beyond the agency-oriented and short-term perspective, which is still dominant in preventive health care research. The life course not only provides a longer-term view and includes the broader societal context, but also stresses that research should be inter-disciplinary, given that inequalities can proliferate across different life domains (Graham 2002).

242,29,0.99,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Migration, Gender, Social Justice, and Human Insecurity and empirical research regarding womenâs agency in migration. By integrating macro-, meso-, and micro-perspectives, gender research on migration has produced new perspectives on (1) how migration systems evolve from gendered interactions between regulation and the actions of all those involved: migrants, employers, social networks, civic organizations, and law enforcement agents; (2) how the intersecting inequalities which shape the security-seeking actions of particular groups of migrants pose new challenges to justiceseeking actions. We will see this in detail in the chapters that follow. Gender is now approached as a matrix of power relationships operating at multiple levels: 1) as a resilient structure expressed through the various social and cultural meanings of being male and female that are embedded in the ethos of the state; 2) as a set of relationships that have organized the social and cultural reproduction of society; and 3) as the formation of identities and the definition of subject positions in a given social order. A key point of contention is whether the contemporary, economics-dominated framing of migration, and the diffusion of related practices of management, contain emancipatory potentials for marginalized migrants, or whether these have become another apparatus of power that has created new categories of gendered mobile subjects whose identities remain distant from the human rights framework based on citizenship as the main criterion of belonging. This has led to the exploration of the social construction of femininities and masculinities in migration. A small body of literature has now emerged on how transnational migration also impacts on masculine identities, norms, and conventions, and how men negotiate and reconstruct their identities as they encounter different gender regimes, rationalize their experience of racial discrimination, and find new lines of inter-group differentiation (Datta/McIlwaine/Herbert/Evans/May/ Wills 2008). Several chapters in this volume engage with those themes, including the studies by Haile and Siegmann (chapter 6), Sinatti (chapter 11), and Huijsmans (chapter 20). The use of âgenderâ as a heuristic device in several disciplinary interfaces (political economy, law, sociology, and anthropology) in migration studies suggests that satisfactory treatments of the relationship between gender and human rights require insights and angles of multiple kinds. Aspirations for a genderequal world cannot avoid employing epistemic vigilance to discern where and which thinking about âgenderâ is valid and how unjustifiable biases may be cor-"
219,58,0.99,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Sampling Framework for Case Studies Proximate and underlying causes of land degradation are intricately embedded in their speciï¬c local contexts (Nkonya et al. 2011; von Braun et al. 2013), and hence, only through comprehensive analysis of these local heterogeneous interactions that meaningful insights could be derived about causes and necessary actions against land degradation. On the other hand, needless to say that these insights should not be exclusively limited only to some speciï¬c local settings, but should have a global relevance. In this regard, case study methodology is a preferred choice of method when the phenomenon being studied is indistinguishable from its context (Yin 2003)âwhich enables to achieve the ï¬rst objective of local thoroughness. The second objective of global relevance is achieved by designing a rigorous sampling framework with theoretically sound case study selection strategy. Extrapolation of case study ï¬ndings beyond these case studies themselves is possible only when the case study design has been based on theoretical grounds: where speciï¬c research questions are asked to test the validity of rival explanations of cause-and-effect relationships in land degradation. Carefully selected multiple case studies are the means to provide a more convincing test of a theory and specify conditions under which different, perhaps even opposing, theories could be valid (De Vaus 2001). Moreover, the external validity of a case study depends on its capacity for theoretical generalization, rather than statistical generalization which is conducted through probability-based random sampling techniques. In that sense, case studies are like experiments with replications: if the theoretical insights gained from case studies conducted in multiple settings coincide, then the potential of external validity of these results is higher. To achieve such external validity, case studies are selected not statistically, but âstrategicallyâ (ibid.), which necessitates selecting those cases which will enable to rigorously test the causal relationships in different contexts (ibid.). Moreover, random probability based selection of countries"

This was postulatedârather unjustly, as things have turned outâto indicate general hostility to technology among Germans (for more on this, see Chap. 30, on risk analysis and assessment) ([10, 11]: 45 ff). The aims of acceptance research are, ï¬rstly, a better understanding of particular acceptance phenomena (social-science/empirical analysis). Secondly, it is to enable speciï¬c objects of acceptance, e.g. a speciï¬ed technology, to be developed and designed in such a way that acceptance occurs (normative-ethical approaches). At research and policy levels in Germany, several institutions accompany the development of (new) technologies and debate surrounding them. They have emerged in parallel with the various research approaches to meet these requirements ([11]: 47 ff). All institutions share the basic assumption that technology cannot be viewed removed from its embedding in social, economic, and also usage-related contexts. In short, technologyâs embedment in its sociotechnical system must also be taken into consideration (see e.g. [11, 12])."
245,801,0.99,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"3 Comprehensive Evaluation Approachesâ EUROSTUDENT and PL4SD Although the social dimension has not been able to translate into an implementable policy item on the European level, the inclusion of social dimension in the Bologna Process has initiated discussions and debates on the underrepresentation of certain groups in higher education. Indeed, the social dimension could be reconceptualised, not as an implementation policy, but as an evaluative perspective on educational policy and practice. Alongside the Bologna Process Implementation Report from 2012 and its forerunner from 2009 (Eurostat and Eurostudent 2009; Eurydice et al. 2012), a major source of data on aspects of studying related to the social dimension of higher education in international comparison has been the EUROSTUDENT project (Orr et al. 2011). The full set of EUROSTUDENT data covers the topics of demographics, including social background; access routes; study programs; accommodation, funding, and living costs; time use and employment during studies; and temporary mobility during studies. The data are drawn from harmonised national student surveys in more than 25 countries. In sum, the EUROSTUDENT data set provides a strong source of data on important aspects of student life in Europe within a comparative framework (Clancy 2010, p. 93). In this, EUROSTUDENT attempts to deal with the ï¬rst problem of the social dimension mentioned above, i.e. provision of data suitable for indicators. An alternative approach is to look closer not at the students, but at the whole education system and how it works for different student groups. This approach has been taken by the project Peer Learning for the Social Dimension (PL4SD). PL4SD is a three-year project (2012â2015) funded by the European Commission through the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus Multilateral projects).1 The objective of the project is to provide policy-makers and practitioners with resources to develop effective measures for improving the social dimension of the European Higher Education Area. The instruments used to fulï¬l these goals are a database of policy measures and three national country reviews, which look at the combination of measures and processes in an education system and assess their appropriateness for improving the social dimension of higher education. Three Country Reviews were carried out in 2014. The approach of PL4SD recognises the second problem of the social dimension mentioned above, i.e. understanding how various levels of an education system and various stakeholders work together to influence learning opportunities and choice."
224,227,0.99,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"modern lifestyles as they integrate their production systems into a global division of labour. In other words, the prevalent development model promotes the integration of remote communities into the market economy through industrial development approaches based on the use of fossil fuels, either directly (through the industrialisation of agricultural production) or indirectly (through specialised machinery). This appears to be the only means of escaping poverty.2 The ecological crisis of our current times cannot be understated. The crisis is global: 60 % of our ecosystems have been degraded (MEA 2005; Steffen et al. 2004), and in many respects, we have exceeded the safe operating space of the planet. The distortion of the nitrogen cycle is primarily attributed to industrial agriculture and the use of fertilisers (RockstrÃ¶m et al. 2009). As we head towards the erosion of our own natural resource base on a global level, these current development trends run counter to the increasingly accepted notion of sustainable development. A more sustainable global future therefore requires a broader search for pathways where short- and long-term benefits for people come at the lowest possible environmental cost and the lowest possible burden and stress on individuals in terms of working time (Haberl et al. 2004, 2011). Guided by this focus on sustainable development, our primary aim is to gain a better understanding of these transition processes âat the peripheryâ along with the transformative potential and impacts that are generated at the society-nature interface thereof. The conceptual framework of sociometabolic transitions (Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007) is an attempt in this direction. In this context, local rural subsistence communities have been empirically investigated to understand the systemic interrelations between food production systems and the resulting environmental pressures. Comparing and contrasting these cases in terms of their demographic, sociometabolic, and agro-ecological profiles has aided the modelling of development trajectories for larger regions. A variable that is often left out from such analysis is âtime useâ and its link to sociometabolic transitions. While we have previously illustrated our findings on the environmental pressures triggered by the specific material, energy and land use activities in the different communities (see Fischer-Kowalski et al. 2011), the focus of this chapter is the social pressure on individuals in terms of working time and how the burden of labour changes with agricultural development. To this end, we revisit Boserupâs (1965, 1981) theory of agricultural change in subsistence systems and, in particular, her hypothesis on increasing area productivity at the expense of labour productivity as a consequence of technological intensification in traditional farming systems. Boserupâs theory provides a framework for comparing the burden of labour among four contemporary subsistence communities in the global south that are in different stages of agricultural development. We will first provide a brief overview of Boserupâs hypothesis, followed by our sociometabolic concept of human time as a (limited) biophysical resource. What follows is a brief description of the four case studies and methods used for data collection. We then present the main findings and conclude with a brief reassessment of our hypothesis."
17,21,0.99,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"education. Naturally, it needs to be recognised that âsocial justiceâ is an open concept, the meaning of which can be explored in many different directions. Addressing equity also represents concerns of critical mathematics education, and the discussion of social justice and equity bring us to address processes of inclusion and exclusion. Social exclusion can take the most brutal forms being based on violent discourses expressing racism, sexism, and hostility towards âforeignersâ or âimmigrantsâ. Such discourses might label groups of people as being âdisposableâ, âa burdenâ, or ânon-productiveâ, given the economic order of today. It is a concern of critical mathematics education to address any form of social exclusion (see, for instance, Martin 2009). However, social inclusion might also represent a questionable process: it could mean an inclusion into the capitalist mode of production and consumption. So, critical mathematics education needs to address inclusion-exclusion as contested processes. However, many forms of inclusion-exclusion have until now not been discussed profoundly in mathematics education: the conditions of blind students, deaf students, students with different disabilitiesâin other words: students with particular rights. However, such issues are now being addressed in the research environment created by the Lulu Healy and Miriam Goody Penteado in Brazil. Such initiatives bring new dimensions to critical mathematics education. Mathemacy is closely related to literacy, as formulated by Freire, being a competence in reading and writing the world. Thus, DâAmbrosio (1998) has presented a âNew Trivium for the Era of Technologyâ in terms of literacy, matheracy and technoracy. (DâAmbrosio talks about matheracy, while I prefer to use mathemacy.) Chronaki (2010) provides a multifaceted interpretation of mathemacy, and in this way it is emphasised that this concept needs to be re-worked, re-interpreted, and re-developed in a never-ending process. Different other notions have, however, been used as well for these complex competences, including mathematical literacy and mathematical agency. Jablonka (2003) provides a clarifying presentation of mathematical literacy, showing how this very notion plays a part in different discourses, including some that hardly represent critical mathematics education. The notion of mathematical agency helps to emphasise the importance of developing a capacity not only with respect to understanding and reflection but also with respect to acting. Dialogue. Not least due to the inspiration from Freire, the notion of dialogue has played an important role in the formulation of critical mathematics education. Dialogic teaching and learning has been presented as one way of developing broader critical competences related to mathematics (see AlrÃ¸ and Skovsmose 2002). Dialogic teaching and learning concerns forms of interaction in the classroom. It can be seen as an attempt to break at least some features of the logic of schooling and as a way of establishing conditions for developing mathemacy (or mathematical literacy, or mathematical agency). Problem-based learning and project work can also be seen as way of framing a dialogic teaching and learning. Pedagogical imagination. Critique in terms of imagination has been formulated in terms of sociological imagination. Through such imagination one reveals that something being the case could be different. I ï¬nd that a pedagogical imagination"

To date, because of its novelty, literature hardly addresses this topic. In October 2017 Flool et al. [2], analyzing the history of the blockchain technology and of cryptocurrencies, presented the ICO phenomenon as a realization of an anarchocapitalists system, made trusty by the underlying technology. Authors reported results of their studies related to key elements which make good an ICO, stating that the crucial element is trust (generated by the technology and by the ICO features). The initial coin offering process has also been studied by Kaal et al. [4] in November 2017. They described ICOs and the related environment. In addition, they underline the similarities and differences between ICOs and the IPOs of the stocks market, focusing the attention on risks and bad practices which could compromise investments and the general trust in the ICO system. Trust creation can not ignore the legal aspects of the ICO funding mechanism. Barsen [1] gave particular attention to this aspect. He highlights regulator organisms are well equipped to apply existing regulation to virtual currencies and ICOs. He also provides a legal classification of ICOs, distinguishing the currency-like tokens from the security-like ones.

182,12,0.99,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Expanding beyond much-studied laboratory contexts to explore the medical history of animals in zoos, on farms, in hospitals, post-mortem rooms and international policy arenas, it illuminates the diverse species that have participated in medicine, the many roles they have played in it, and how their bodies and habits have both shaped and been shaped by its ideas, practices and institutions. Crucially, the volume highlights how these diverse species forged multispecies networks, thereby extending animal historyâs typical focus on the dyadic relationships between humans and another species of animal. The third objective of this volume is to speak to the twenty-first-century initiative known as One Health (OH). featuring prominently in medical, veterinary and scientific publications, and in national and international health policy and position statements, OH pursues an expansive vision of improving health and wellbeing through the multidisciplinary study of problems at the interface of humans, animals and their environments. for its proponents, OH represents a necessary response to a host of shared threats to human and animal health, such as emerging diseases that transmit between animals and humans, antimicrobial resistance, food insecurity, food safety and climate change. They argue that such issues cannot be tackled effectively within the traditional disciplinary compartments of human medicine, veterinary medicine and the life sciences. Rather, integrated, coordinated approaches are required, in which the health of animals is considered in relation to the health of humans and the environment.6 This volume situates OH within a longer historical context by illuminating certain precedents to this way of working. It also offers a critical, empirically grounded perspective on its operation today by exploring the circumstances that gave rise to its emergence as a self-conscious movement, and how its proponents conceptualize the roles of animals within it. In addressing these three objectives, the volume also addresses three distinct audiences: historians of animals, historians of science and medicine, and health professionals concerned with OH today. The remainder of this chapter introduces the history of animals as a field of enquiry, and situates this study in relation to it. While historians of animals will be familiar with its discussion of the methodological and conceptual issues"

Obviously, this new framework enhanced by molecular biology and metagenomics will maintain biological signiï¬cance and usefulness as long as molecular proxies will remain related to species concepts, taxon names and classiï¬cations linking to the wider biological knowledge (Mace 2004; German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina 2014). The peril to invest only in an isolated and blind molecular database was already keenly emphasized by many taxonomists at the occasion of the rise of the barcoding initiative (e.g., Will et al. 2005). Building the network between names, biological knowledge and molecular data is from far the biggest challenge of present-day systematics and other sciences of diversity, much beyond the molecular technical tour de force (Grandcolas et al. 2013). We must keep in mind that this challenge takes place in a difï¬cult moment when discovery rates of species new to science do not decline (Tancoigne and Dubois 2013) but in a context of rising rates of extinction (RÃ©gnier et al. 2015)."

The former task includes tools and methodologies from business process management (BPM) [12] [13] for understanding of care processes (careflows, CfMS [14]) in which DSS needs to operate. This includes the healthcare organization goals, information flow and work flow, roles and responsibilities of medical personnel and communication and coordination issues of the care processes [11]. Besides the formal approach based on BPM methodology there exists also an informal approach â a workbook [15] to help implementers of DSS to define the stakeholders relevant to healthcare provision, goals and objectives of DSS, defining the system capabilities and finally selecting, deploying and monitoring DSS interventions. There are two different views on connection between DSS and clinical workflow. One view is that in order to be successful DSS need to fit into the existing clinical workflow. The other approach is that implementation of DSS into existing clinical workflow is perceived as the process improvement of that workflow and therefore the emphasis should be put on the change management of organizational development triggered by DSS implementation. We believe that both views can be perceived as a complementary to some point â including the DSS into existing clinical workflows minimises the disruption of clinicians from their daily work to learn new technology or to spend more time with âjust anotherâ technical gadget rather then with patients. On the other side even when DSS is part of the clinical workflow the clinicians are aware of its existence and functionality and the communication should be developed towards clinicians to show them benefits of DSS resulting in its acceptance and utilization. Knowledge modeling task relates to two different types of knowledge. Explicit knowledge is represented in some formalized way accessible to other people (e.g. scientific literature, clinical guidelines). Tacit knowledge is âsubjectiveâ knowledge of the expert, his experience and ability to perform particular tasks and cannot be expressed easily. When formalized and made accessible to other people it becomes explicit knowledge. Knowledge modeling involves various stages of tacit and explicit knowledge management including acquiring, representation, sharing, evolution and delivery of knowledge to the user. Knowledge acquisition from expert is a very demanding and time consuming process. It includes methodologies like interviews, observation of clinicians during their work, questionnaires. Acquisition of new knowledge from literature, EHR and other formalized knowledge repositories can be achieved with various data and knowledge mining tools and machine learning techniques [16].

Multiperspectivity allows students to take into account the perspectives of marginalized and silenced social categories, including ethnic and linguistic minorities, women, the poor, and ordinary people more generally (see Stradling 2003). Civil society projects that encourage historical thinking and multiperspectivity in history teaching typically design and implement training programs for history teachers and prepare new educational materials and curricula to supplement traditional history textbooks. Such curricula include oral histories, primary and secondary sources of historical events, and the historical perspectives of different groups. As an example, the Association for Historical Dialogue and Research is an organization whose mission is to contribute to history education in Cyprus by focusing on enhancing the teaching of historical thinking. Specifically, the group aims to foster critical thinking skills with regard to understanding the past, respect for the people of the past, appreciation of the distance between the past and the present, and evaluation of competing narratives of the past (Psaltis et al. 2011). Students are taught to evaluate claims of different narratives and analyze how interpretations of evidence of historical events change over time and are dependent on historical actors. There are two potential mechanisms through which historical thinking might influence intergroup outcomes positively: critical thinking and perspective taking. Historical thinking raises awareness about the limits of historical knowledge and evidence. Critical thinking pushes students to analyze, interpret, and think critically about historical events. Learning to think historically is likely to counteract traditional history education, which is often ethnocentric and presents only a dominant groupâs view of the past. Historical thinking breaks down historical myths, propaganda, and monolithic narratives of the past and also encourages perspective takingâthe ability to view a situation from different angles. A large body of work in social psychology research has revealed the positive impact of perspective taking for intergroup relations. for instance, perspective taking is associated with less prejudice (Galinsky and Moskowitz 2000; Galinsky and ku 2004), more positive evaluation of out-groups (Batson et al. 2002), and higher levels of intergroup forgiveness (Noor et al. 2008b). However, recent studies have also shown that the benefits of perspective taking might be limited in conflict contexts (e.g., Bruneau and Saxe 2012; Paluck 2010, but also see Bilali and Vollhardt"

The âhexagonâ represents six key factors contributing to global environmental changeâ three nature-induced or supply factors: soil, water and air (atmosphere and climate), and three human-induced or demand factors: population (growth), urban systems (habitat, pollution) and rural systems (agriculture, food). Throughout the history of the earth and of Homo sapiens these six factors have interacted. The supply factors have created the preconditions for life while human behavior and economic consumption patterns have also contributed to its challenges (increase in extreme weather events) and fatal outcomes for human beings and society. The series covers the complex interactions among these six factors and their often extreme and in a few cases fatal outcomes (hazards/disasters, internal displacement and migrations, crises and conflicts), as well as crucial social science concepts relevant for their analysis. Further issues related to three basic areas of research: approaches and schools of environment, security, and peace, especially in the environmental security realm and from a human security perspective, will be addressed. The goal of this book series is to contribute to a fourth phase of research on environmental security from a normative peace research and/or human security perspective. In this series, the editor welcomes books by natural and social scientists, as well as by multidisciplinary teams of authors. The material should address issues of global change (including climate change, desertiï¬cation, deforestation), and its impacts on humankind (natural hazards and disasters), on environmentally-induced migration, on crises and conflicts, as well as for cooperative strategies to cope with these challenges either locally or in the framework of international organizations and regimes. From a human-centered perspective, this book series offers a platform for scientiï¬c communities dealing with global environmental and climate change, disaster reduction, human, environmental and gender security, peace and conflict research, as well as for the humanitarian aid and the policy community in national governments and international organizations. The series editor welcomes brief concept outlines and original manuscripts as proposals. If they are considered of relevance, these proposals will be peer-reviewed by specialists in the ï¬eld from the natural and the social sciences. Inclusion in this series will also require a positive decision by the publisherâs international editorial conference.

Small-scale studies tend to be used towards the beginning of a research program to explore new phenomena. Large-scale studies, in contrast, tend to be employed after such methods or instruments have been piloted and their use justiï¬ed, and the phenomena to which they apply have been adequately deï¬ned. Anderson and Postlethwaite (2007) deï¬ne the purpose of large-scale studies as describing a system as a whole and the role of parts within it. But the complexity of the system, and the type of understanding to be gained from the study, greatly impact how large the scale must be. There are a number of advantages of large-scale international comparative studies, such as their utility for understanding situations and trends, the technical capacity they provide for testing hypotheses involving a number of variables, and the sophisticated analytic methods often employed in such studies (Cai et al. 2015; Middleton et al. 2015). The international comparative studies, such as TIMSS and PISA report a wide range of achievement variables, school variables, system variables, and student variables, and there are literally thousands of individual results for each survey. As a multitude of commentaries also attest, the implications of any of these results for educational policy must be derived with careful attention to local situations and to the details of the measurement instruments. There are also resource and time limitations for conducting large-scale international comparative studies. Because of less resource and time constraints, small-scale international comparative studies, on the other hand, can offset some of the pitfalls of large-scale international comparative studies by providing valuable analysis that is relevant to the situation of the particular participants. Small-scale studies allow for in-depth analysis of issues being studied. Thus, while small-scale and large-scale international comparative studies are conducted separately, their ï¬ndings and analysis could complement to each other for us to understanding and improving studentsâ learning. An alternative complementary role of the small-scale and large-scale studies is to conduct in-depth analyses for some issues based on the large-scale data. For example, go back to PISAâs three processes of Formulate, Employ, and Interpret. When we compare students from Australia, China, Singapore, and the USA on the three processes, we found a different pattern. For Australia and USA students have relatively better performance on interpreting than on the other two processes, while Shanghai and Singapore students did a better job on formulating than on the other two processes. With in-depth analysis from large-scale data, we can ï¬nd such subtle, but important differences, but we need a range of other studies to understand why this might be the case (Table 5). In addition to small-scale and large-scale studies, LPS gives an example of another possible kind of international collaboration that serves a complementary role to the other international studies and provides opportunities for studying the artifacts of classroom instruction by reconstruction of the classroom data from"
333,37,0.99,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"Since the introduction of electronic calculators in mathematics education in the 1970âs, the discussion of using those aids has been ongoing. Many studies have been conducted (cf. Barzel 2012) and many questions have been surveyed: â¢ Which speciï¬cations are necessary for designing tasks in mathematics education as well as in mathematics assessments by considering technology? â¢ How is it possible to work meaningfully in mathematics classrooms by using technology? â¢ Is it possible to raise the motivation for discussing mathematical problems by using technology in mathematics education? â¢ Where is it possible to identify mathematics in everyday life and what is the role of technology? â¢ Is it possible to form another picture of mathematics when using technology in mathematics education? â¢ How does the use of technology influence mathematical skills and competencies of students? It is beyond controversy that the use of technology broadens the palette of tools in mathematics education. By using digital tools as a black-box (cf. Buchberger 1989), complex and real problems can be discussed (cf. Rousseau and Saint Aubin 2008). Besides real-life applications, problems of everyday life that do not have an explicit connection to mathematics can be discussed (cf. Siller 2015). Meaningful questions like evacuating a special region or a football stadium, ï¬nding the optimal path on a mountain or position-planning can be discussed because the complex mathematical part and the mathematical solution can be outsourced to technology. There are only the personal requirements of identifying and understanding mathematical connections and applying mathematical skills. These are the (new) challenges in mathematics education. Laborde (2002, p. 285) writes: When a new element such as technology is introduced, the system is perturbed and has to make choices to ensure a new equilibrium is attained, choices that may be related to the various interrelated elements of the teaching system mentioned [â¦]."

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the theorized PAR process assumes a balanced conversation between the varied groups of teachers, coordinators and developers. This includes a variety of ethnographic approaches such as semistructured and in-depth interviews and participant observations. Further, it has been noted that the PAR method should be adopted from the onset of application design and must involve constant monitoring (Tufte and Mefalopulos 2009). Towards this end, teachersâ opinions and perceptions of the application were gathered at every stage of technology development prior to actual implementation."
72,75,0.99,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"theory â in terms of its implications and usefulness in the analysis of innovation â has been little explored until now.7 Revisiting Tardeâs social theory â which, at its core, is a sociology of innovation â allows a widening of perspective on the nature of social innovation. This goes beyond the economic and technological innovations noted by Schumpeter (1964) and, after him, by the sociology of technology focused either on the social consequences of technology (Ogburn, 1937) or on the âsocial shaping of technologyâ (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985; Williams and SÃ¶rensen, 2002) or âsocial construction of technological systemsâ (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). At the same time, this new focus reveals the blind spots of a narrow economic view. Because Tarde places the laws of the practices of imitation at the centre of his theory of social development, the associated micro foundations of social phenomena provide vital input into an integrative theory of innovation. It enables a discovery of how social phenomena â conditions and constructs â come into being and how they change. The key to this discovery is to analyse the development of social inventions and innovations as well as the associated social practices of their imitation. Unlike Schumpeter, for whom the innovator â namely the âentrepreneurâ â is the focus of interest, Tarde is concerned with the inventions that are understood to be the central driver of social change. For Tarde, these are the many small inventions and ideas, which were difficult or easy to arrive at and mostly went unnoticed at the time of their arising, which therefore are usually almost exclusively inglorious and nameless. (Tarde, 2009b, p. 26) These countless inventions can change society and its practices through multiple acts of imitation, and only as a result of imitation do these inventions become an innovation and a true social phenomenon: âIn the realm of the social, everything takes place as invention and imitation, with imitation forming the rivers and inventions the mountainsâ (ibid, p. 27). For Tarde, imitation is the central mechanism of social reproduction and of social change: All similarities of social origin that belong to the social world are the fruits of some kind of imitation, be it the imitation of customs or fashions through sympathy or obedience, instruction or education, naÃ¯ve or carefully considered imitation. (ibid, p. 38) According to Tarde, imitations always involve variations and simultaneously bring about innovations in social structures and practices."

Polk uses the term âtransdisciplinary co-productionâ as a research approach that includes practitioners and researchers who interact along the knowledge production process starting with the joint problem formulation. This new role of science triggers the need for new scientists who play a central role as catalysts, managing and conducting more contextualised research using collaborative and participatory frameworks. Thus, collaboration emerges as a common vision, central for the resolution of wicked problems as well, which demands the active leadership of professionals to enable the interaction among stakeholders and to create participatory solutions to specific challenges. In this chapter, a newly emerging professional, the bioeconomist, is introduced and described as that catalyser and enabler of collaboration for the transition from a fossilbased economy to a bioeconomy, a systemic shift that involves multiple complex challenges, goals and agents. Therefore, bioeconomy professionals are expected to be specialised in one field but also able to understand the scientific language of associated disciplines. Furthermore, the increase focus on innovation and interdisciplinary teamwork has created new student profile expectation to deal with global challenges and find sustainable solutions. In this regard, the formation and development of special competences through inter- and transdisciplinary learning is fundamental."
284,110,0.99,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Decolonizing indigenous and peasant knowledge The objective of this chapter is to understand how, on the one hand, indigenous and peasant knowledge penetrates technoscientiï¬c knowledge and how, on the other hand, it becomes part of rural-development projects and environmental issues. Of major help in this attempt are the general concepts of âtranslationâ (Callon and Latour, 1981; Akrich et al., 2006), âboundary-objectâ (Leigh Star and Griesemer, 1989; Trompette and Vinck, 2009) and âtranscodiï¬cationâ (Lascoumes, 1994). They have been forged in the ï¬eld of social studies of science in order to deal with similar problems (Callon, 1986 on scientists, ï¬shermen and the plan to breed sea shells). These concepts postulate a continuity between the logics of knowledge production and political logics, and a centrality of the dynamics of translation and hybridization in different epistemic spheres (Harding, 1997). Social studies of science examine the mediations between knowledge of differing types (and especially between scientiï¬c and profane knowledge), and between scientiï¬c knowledge and the political logics involved in action.4 Meanwhile, the anthropology of local knowledge has analysed the categories grouped under the term âtraditional knowledgeâ. Agrawal (1995, 2002) points out the context of their use (and the political dimensions involved in asymmetrical exploitation of this knowledge compared with that of âscientiï¬c knowledgeâ), particularly in development projects. In regard to environmental issues, several authors have stressed the embedding of different types of knowledge in their conditions of production, their historical, social and institutional settings, and the need to study the full context of practices and circulation when they are put into operation (Fairhead and Leach, 2003; Goldman et al., 2011).5 All these aspects have to be analysed if one is to understand exchanges"
77,315,0.99,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Conclusion This chapter explained and compared mixed models and latent class growth models using existing life course data of the Amsterdam Growth and Health Study cohort. We combined a methodological focus with empirical findings and demonstrated the value of both techniques for life course researchers who aim to study (heterogeneity in) individual health trajectories over time. Both techniques can be used to study the individual development of a certain variable over time, but depending on the specific focus of the research question either LCGM or MM are preferred.

What kind of collaborative model does November set out to be, and how are these ideas negotiated and brought into practice? The key purpose of this chapter is to identify challenges in terms of reinterpreting the Barnahus model to accommodate adult victims of domestic violence in the current landscape of policies and measures against domestic violence in Norway. This analysis of Project November may highlight important issues to consider for the implementation of other types of collaborative models, such as the Barnahus model. The discussion will be linked to theoretical concepts on multi-agency and multi-professional collaboration (Atkinson et al. 2007). The chapter is based on results from the first part of an ongoing process evaluation of the November project.1 Empirically, we draw on different types of data: Written material that includes initial project plans describing the model and process documents from the implementation phase and qualitative interviews with 21 key stakeholders and operative personnel within November. The interview material is central to our analysis but as anonymisation is complicated, we will refrain from direct quotations."

This fundamental relationship between evolutionary history and conservation goals traces back at least to the IUCN 1980) proposal that taxonomically distinctive species may deserve greater conservation priority. At about the same time, SoulÃ© (1980), in his book, Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective, articulated a broad evolutionary perspective for conservation, and argued that âreduction of the biological diversity of the planet is the most basic issue of our time.â The term âphylogenetic diversityâ is relevant to these biodiversity conservation perspectives. The term can be traced back to the introduction of the âPDâ phylogenetic diversity index (Faith 1992a, b, 1994a). PD was designed as a simple measure of the degree of representation of evolutionary history (by a given set of taxa). Faith (2002) summarised the basic deï¬nition and rationale for PD: ârepresentation of âevolutionary historyâ (Faith 1994b) encompassing processes of cladogenesis and anagenesis is assumed to provide representation of the feature diversity of organisms. Speciï¬cally, the phylogenetic diversity (PD) measure estimates the relative feature diversity of any nominated set of species by the sum of the lengths of all those phylogenetic branches spanned by the set.â That summary mentions species, but Faith (1992a, b) in fact applied PD from the outset not only to phylogenies whose tips were species, but also to phylogenetic pattern among genetic haplotypes or populations, in order to set spatial priorities to conserve within species genetic diversity (see also Faith et al. 2009). The common element across these levels is the inference of underlying diversity, where the units of variation are features or traits of taxa. This link to âfeaturesâ reï¬ects the attempt, through PD calculations, to address a fundamental concern of biodiversity conservation - unknown variation, with unknown future values. Faith (1992a, b) suggested that the interpretation of phylogenetic diversity as a measure of feature diversity helps to clarify its link to conservation values: âDiversity is seen as important as the raw material for adapting to change (McNeely et al. 1990), and so provides what McNeely et al. (1990) and others call âoption valueâ: a safety net of biological diversity for responding to unpredictable events or needs. The diversity of features represented by a subset of species provides option value in ensuring not only that one or more members of the subset can adapt to changing conditions, but also that society may be able to beneï¬t (e.g. economically) from features of these species in response to future needs.â Examples of these beneï¬ts include many from bioprospecting. For example, Smith and Wheeler (2006) have used phylogeny to assess potential for new discoveries of piscine venoms. Pacharawongsakda et al. (2009) have applied PD to help ï¬nd natural products from microbes. Another interesting example is found in the study of Saslis-Lagoudakisa et al. (2012). Phylogenetically-related plants have provided a key medical component, discovered independently in the plants found in three different regions. This perspective accords well with the IUCN (1980) argument for conservation of diversity in order to ensure beneï¬ts âfor present and future useâ. Reid and Miller (1989) echoed these ideas in their early paper, âKeeping options alive: the scientiï¬c basis for conserving biodiversityâ (see also Wilson 1992; McNeely 1988; Faith 1992a, b).

(2) Assessment at full scale: The ultimate goal of the coming transformation is to rescale human activity to a level that can be sustained by nature in the long run and that allows for future human development at the same time. Identifying the appropriate scale of human activity requires us to study socioeconomic metabolism on the global level, which was not necessary to understand the previous socioeconomic transitions. Socioeconomic metabolism is a nonlinear system, which means that the impact of upscaling small modifications to the system is in general not proportional to the scaling factor. The upscaling of certain sustainable development strategies is subject to local and global constraints for, e.g., land, water, or mineral resources. Moreover, large-scale implementation of certain strategies feeds back into the system and causes structural change. Examples include changing recycling systems, technology learning, or rebound and spillover effects (Hertwich 2005). The total system-wide impact of the strategiesâ potential effect can therefore only be reliably assessed if the latter are studied at full scale, so that constraints and feedbacks can be included in the assessment. (3aâc) Multilayer modeling, satellite accounts, and balancing constraints allow scientists from different disciplines, like industrial ecologists and economists, to use a consistent framework to describe societyâs metabolism and to address a variety of research questions. In multilayer modeling, the physical and economic properties of objects are quantified in consistent parallel frameworks (Pauliuk et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2012). Satellite accounts, like emissions to nature or labor requirements, contain additional information about how societyâs metabolism is connected to the environment and to human agents. They form the interface between models of SEM and those from other scientific disciplines, like climate models or environmental impact assessment. Balancing constraints for the physical and monetary layers, like industry or market balances, is the most fundamental way to check the validity of a prospective system description. Prospective models should always respect these fundamental balances. (4) Scenariomodeling with exogenous parameters acknowledges the indeterminacy of future development and reduces system complexity to a manageable level. Only with scenario modeling one can build scientifically credible prospective models of complex indeterminate systems like socioeconomic metabolism. This central aspect of prospective modeling needs some more elaboration. Socioeconomic metabolism is a non-isolated and non-deterministic complex system. It is not isolated, because it exchanges energy and matter with the inner of the Earth and with space. SEM is non-deterministic, because it is controlled by human agents that use their environmental literacy to intervene and divert the system from its current trajectory in a non-predictable"
320,502,0.99,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"(Smit and Pilifosova 2001). Adaptation of conservation management means adjustments in management practices, decision-making processes and organisational structures (Welch 2005). Although the adaptation process should be started now, it must be planned as a long term process. It will be successful only if as many institutions and stakeholders as possible are actively involved and are willing to support it. Scientists have an important role to play in the development of adaptation strategies, but to facilitate effective implementation of adaptation actions local communities and decision-makers are essential. Expertise and data provided by research are a basis for a transparent and understandable decision-making process, but scientific results need to be translated and presented in a form that is accessible to professionals and decision-makers and local stakeholders (Welch 2005). The scientific information for local climate adaptation must be relevant for the decision at hand and tailored for the decision context. It should be authorised and trusted by the people affected, and transparent in the process of production. Meeting and addressing the needs, knowledge and language of local communities who have to implement adapted management practices is a major challenge for many scientists in climate impact research. Acknowledging this challenge, the project HABIT-CHANGE initiated a science-management approach to plan jointly for adaptation in protected areas. This kind of collaborative research has already produced beneficial results in other areas (Littell et al. 2012; Lonsdale and Goldthorpe 2012). The science-practice partnership for collaborative research proved to be invaluable for testing useful methods, the identification of applicable solutions and the enhancement of practical conservation management within HABIT-CHANGE. It was built on an intensive dialogue between an interdisciplinary panel of scientists and local management and facilitates the co-production of knowledge. In this process several barriers to the practical implementation of theoretical concepts were identified. Much data and many methods provided by science did not fit with planning reality and the decision context of protected area management. On the other hand, many management practices were lacking a foundation in solid facts and evaluation of their success was often neglected. Furthermore, it seems that much of the available knowledge and guidance on adaptation of conservation management does not reach local management. From the experience gained in the project we could see that climate change is rarely perceived and accepted as a high priority challenge on site level. There is often too little awareness that climate change is already a main driver of biodiversity loss and that its significance will increase even more in the future. Usually, neither management authorities nor land users and stakeholders have enough information, knowledge or incentives to plan and negotiate necessary adaptations to climate change. The adaptive capacity of local institutions like the administrations of National Parks or Biosphere Reserves is a crucial component too. The lack of expertise, methods and tools for climate adaptation as well as limited resources prevents proper management and adaptation (Fig. 20.1). The institutional setting of protected areas influences capacity and willingness to respond to new challenges"
187,79,0.99,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"Abstract The ultimate target of Modelling and Simulation (M&S) activities in the ï¬eld of CIP is to provide Models, Methodologies and tools to help in the analysis of different crisisâ scenarios and, subsequently, in crisis management decision making. A CIsâ disruptions scenario is simply a sequence of random events following a well-deï¬ned chronological order. Generally, each identiï¬ed scenario produces a set of consequences which is a function of: the initiating event, the concerned CIs and the geo-organizational context of the disrupted CIs. Formal sciences represent the reality of our surrounding world. But formal sciences are imperfect and what we call ârealityâ is the projection of the inaccessible âRealityâ on our world. This projection is the only reality we are talking about in formal sciences. Subsequently, formal sciences construct objects in which small parts of the sensible reality are grasped and formalized. These objects can be called âmodelsâ. We are limiting our interest here to formal sciences and engineering activities that cover both conceptual and phenomenological modelling processes. Models are ï¬rst validated before being admitted in the construction of a global model of the sensible reality. Regarding our focus on crisis scenarios modelling, simulation and analysis (MS&A), engineersâ ambition is to simulate not only independent isolated phenomenon but also interacting multi-physic multi-scale phenomenon."
209,37,0.99,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"It is important to study theories relevant to public engagement in the specific context of deliberation around science and technology development and policy. Empirical findings from the lab or even from one deliberative discussion to another do not always easily generalize. Science, technology, and society (STS) scholars generally agree that public engagement should be context sensitive (Delgado, KjÃ¸lberg, & Wickson, 2011), making it important to examine the impact of design factors within specific, concrete contexts. As part of our strategy for connecting features, processes, and outcomes, we held context as constant as possible across our experiments. While our approach necessarily limits the generalizability of results, it provides a solid foundation for establishing the existence of internally valid and robust results within our chosen context, before extending to others. As the reader will see in Chaps. 3, 4, and 5, even with all the controls we employed, finding consistent effects was, nonetheless, no small feat. The contextual features held constant in our studies include the type of participants involved, the topics of deliberation, and the use of a longitudinal, repeated measures design."
284,221,0.99,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"they go beyond that because of the obvious practical consequences that they have and will have in social and political aspects. The ï¬rst two discourse models have a technical bias (hard technologies and management technologies); the third and fourth discourse models have ideological-political biases, the last being traversed by ecological worldviews. From the perspective of environmental governance, the positions behind the models point at disagreement. They will be a great source of conï¬ict to the extent that some defend the thesis of economic growth, taking ecological factors into account only as secondary externalities (positions found in the ï¬rst model). Others take an alternative stance, proposing an ecological perspective that focuses on avoiding economic growth and overconsumption in the neo-extractivist Third World (positions found in the fourth model). The analysed discourses, with few exceptions, do not take long-term environmental risks into account. The central grid of this discursive logic is the capacity to control and intervene in water and energy consumption in mining, through technocratic (ï¬rst model), normative and institutional (models two and three), or political-environmental (models three and four) means. The abstraction of the accumulative and latent effects of the long-term environmental impacts of the abovementioned consumption is proof that the autonomized effects of sociotechnical processes as a result of the increased extractive economy in the region are unknown. Our study of discourses conï¬rms that most of the stakeholders who are more likely to defend the expanded reproduction of the waterenergy-mining complex â as the basis of the socioeconomic development of the region â do not take responsibility for the international and global implications of local environmental behaviour. The majority of these actors do not think in terms of a long-term global horizon. Consequently, the problems of climate change and the decisions that they implicate in terms of energy and water policy are considered without taking into account the reï¬exivity of local social processes in overall environmental risks. The structural positions of these stakeholders in developing countries, in the periphery of the world system, thus condition discourses with respect to these global implications. In this chapter we ï¬rst presented the problem of water and energy consumption in the mining sector, situated within the water-energymining complex. We sought to clarify linear, sectorial and reductionist perspectives and to approach a perspective that integrates synergies among discourses, rules, technologies, institutions and interpretations"

This can be an interesting working milieu for scientists as their involvement in these open innovation processes may lead to third-party funding. Firms usually initiate open innovation processes by setting up challenges of their own or using dedicated platforms; participation is often rewarded by incentives. The kinds of problems that crop up in the context of open innovation can be very diverse: Challenges can include anything from a general collection of ideas to finding specific solutions for highly complex tasks. IBMâs ââInnovation Jamââ (www.collaborationjam.com) or Dellâs ââIdeaStormââ (www.ideastorm.com) (Baldwin 2010) quote companies that involve employees of all departments and partners in open innovation as an example. They also interact with external experts, customers and even researchers from universities and other scientific institutions, who do not necessarily belong to the research and development department, in order to pool and evaluate ideas. This concept was introduced by Chesbrough (2003). Firms tend to favor tried-and-tested solutions and technologies when working on innovations: Lakhani (2006) defined this behavior as local search bias. To his way of thinking, co-creation can be seen as a tool for overcoming the local search bias by making valuable knowledge from outside the organization accessible (Lakhani et al. 2007). Hippel names various studies that have shown some favorable impacts that user innovation has on the innovation process (Hippel 2005). The advantages of open innovation are not only of interest to companies and firms: it is also becoming increasingly popular with the scientific community in terms of collaboration, co-creation and the acceleration of the solution-finding process (Murray and OâMahony 2007). In the fields of software development (Gassmann 2006; Hippel and Krogh 2003) and drug discovery (Dougherty and Dunne 2011) in particular, scientists have discovered the advantages of open collaboration for their own work: Open Scienceâwhich, for the sake of simplicity, we can define as the inclusion of external experts into a research process. Most open innovation initiatives do not necessarily address the average Internet user. Often scientists and other specialists from different disciplines are needed: Lakhani et al. (2007) find that the individuals who solve a problem often derive from different fields of interest and thus achieve high quality outcomes. Open innovation accordingly refers to the inclusion of external experts into a solution-finding process. This process was hitherto thought to be best conducted solely by (internal) experts (Chesbrough 2003). Opening up the solution-finding process is the initial step of using participatory designs to include external knowledge as well as outsourcing the innovation process (Ehn and Kyng 1987; Schuler and Namioka 1993). Good ideas can always come from all areas. Special solutions, however, require specialized knowledge and, of course, not every member of the crowd possesses such knowledge (ââmass mediocrityââ, Tapscott and Williams 2006, p. 16). The intense research on open innovation confirmed this conjecture (Enkel et al. 2009; Laursen and Salter 2006)."
264,542,0.99,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"Subject-Matter Didactics (German: Stoffdidaktik) In the development of the didactics of mathematics as a professional ï¬eld in Germany, subject-related approaches played an important role. Felix Klein created a model that has been referred to for a long time. A general goal was to develop approaches for representing mathematical concepts and knowledge in a way that corresponded to the cognitive abilities and personal experiences of the students while simultaneously simplifying the material without disturbing the mathematical substance. A fundamental claim was that such simpliï¬cations should be âintellectually honestâ and âupwardly compatibleâ (Kirsch, 1977). Concepts and explanations should be taught to students with sufï¬cient mathematical rigor in a manner that connects with and expands their knowledge of the subject. For this reason, subject-matter didactics placed value on constructing viable and robust mental representations (Grundvorstellungen) to capture mathematical concepts and procedures as they are represented in the mental realm. In the 80s, views of the nature of learning as well as objects and methods of research in mathematics education changed and the perspective was widened and opened towards new directions and gave more attention to the learnersâ perspective. This shift of view issued new challenges to subject-related considerations that have been enhanced by the recent discussion about professional mathematical knowledge for teaching. The session started with an overview lecture on the main issues of subject-matter didactics given by Lisa Hefendehl-Hebeker and Rudolf vom Hofe entitled, âSubject-matter didactics: Overview of origin, main issues, theory, methods, and ï¬elds of application.â Subsequent presentations concentrated on two paramount concepts of subject-matter didactics that can serve as guiding orientations in a local and global sense to present mathematical knowledge corresponding to the overarching goals. The concept of Grundvorstellungen, which can be roughly translated as âbasic mental models,â describes relationships between mathematical content and the phenomenon of individual concept formation. For example, the actions of distributing and measuring provide basic mental models for the operation of division within the domain of natural numbers (partitive and quotitive basic model). Sebastian Wartha and Axel Schulz unfolded this concept in the context of natural numbers and fractions: âNumbers, fractions, operations and representations: Grundvorstellungen in primary school.â"
170,110,0.99,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"5 Conclusion The debate on the impact of the information society on the Global South is ongoing and the jury is still out. In this chapter, we attempted to provide context and perspective to this debate. The misgivings of development planners, governments, and donors regarding the outcomes of ICT4D projects were reviewed. The contradictions attendant to evaluating ICT4D impacts were articulated. We discussed The Hague framework, described how it came about, and proposed a way forward, which was to construct theories of change for specific projects or programmes. The chapter presented a generic theory of change that established causal links between attributes of information society and the Millennium Development Goals. It developed indicative ToC maps or pathways to change applicable to eAgriculture, ICT for education, and KM for climate change adaptation. We capped the chapter by describing a possible downside to the use of theories of change. We said that ToCs may guide us in establishing causal links between ICTs and development in the Global South, but we can get blindsided by them. The parameters that we set in our impact evaluations sometimes act as horse blinders, denying us of our peripheral vision and preventing the full appreciation of the information society phenomenon. At a certain point in the evaluation process, we will have to remove these blinders and explore unintended outcomes or impacts."

SOLAS science by its nature deals with interactions that occur: across a wide spectrum of time and space scales, involve gases and particles, between the ocean and the atmosphere, across many disciplines including chemistry, biology, optics, physics, mathematics, computing, socio-economics and consequently interactions between many different scientists and across scientific generations. This chapter provides a guide through the remarkable diversity of cross-cutting approaches and tools in the gigantic puzzle of the SOLAS realm. Here we overview the existing prime components of atmospheric and oceanic observing systems, with the acquisition of oceanâatmosphere observables either from in situ or from satellites, the rich hierarchy of models to test our knowledge of Earth System functioning, and the tremendous efforts accomplished over the last decade within the COST Action 735 and SOLAS Integration project frameworks to understand, as best we can, the current physical and biogeochemical state of the atmosphere and ocean commons. A few SOLAS integrative studies illustrate the full meaning of interactions, paving the way for even tighter connections between thematic fields. Ultimately, SOLAS research will also develop with an enhanced consideration of societal demand while preserving fundamental research coherency."

Breiter and Ruhe state that âthe micro level of classroom management will be excluded from the analysisâ (317). However, the administrative practices of individual teachers, including their use of mobile phones, are traced in group discussions (321). 2. Just as Kramp and Loosen repurpose and reinterpret their previous research to create new insights in a figurational study, it is striking how some classical studies of media practices can retrospectively be seen as analyses of communicative figurations. For instance, James Lullâs seminal ethnographic study of the social uses of television can be seen as an analysis of the communicative figuration of the (American) family (Lull 1980); and even more so Janice Radwayâs similarly ground-breaking study of womenâs reading of romance novels can be seen as an analysis of the ways in which these media-based collectivities were incrementally transforming gender roles in the early 1980s (Radway 1984). A significant difference, though, is that these two studies did not analyze crossmedia repertoires."

The dominant organization in the ecosystem, usually the platform owner, heavily influences the culture of the ecosystem. The health of a SECO stands for the growing and continuity of the software ecosystem remaining variable and productive over time [11]. The assessment of SECO health can be performed with respect to different aspects, including robustness, productivity, and niche creation [11]. Some studies present quantitative assessment on SECO health [13]. Practices can be useful to understand a SECO and assess its health. For instance, the practice âreview all code before accepting into the releaseâ may impact several quality indicators and contribute to increasing productivity while avoiding rework. However, to our knowledge, there is no qualitative study that focuses on software practices and their relation to SECO health. In this paper, we present the results of an ethnographic-based study conducted with the purpose of investigating the practices used by a SECO from three perspectives [5] â business, social, and technical â and their impact on SECO health. The selected research method, ethnography, has been used to study software practices in different contexts [16,17]. The object of our study was KDE1 , an open source SECO that gathers a set of platforms and products for Linux distributions. During the Latin-American KDE users and contributors meeting (LaKademy 2015), we collected day-to-day practices and analyzed them to understand their impact on SECO health. Softgoal interdependency graphs (SIG) [7] extended with practices, support the analysis of KDE practices and their influence on health aspects of SECO such as productivity and robustness. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents background on SECO. Section 3 introduces SIG-P, our customized SIG [7]. Section 4 presents the context and design of our study.

266,38,0.989,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Community Policing and Aspects of Strategy Strategy is regarded useful for CP in three related senses of the term. At the most fundamental level CP needs strategy to reflect its overall purpose. Next, strategy helps to depict feasible journeys from the present situation to the desired future. In CP with multiple focus groups and partnerships a whole number of strategic purposes is likely to come up. A challenge is how to make the purposes meet in a fruitful way. Strategy assists in addressing various security issues that concern different communities and collaborative partners. Consequently, CP service design should not be police-centric but interactive. It should be based on information of the various security needs and utilize the analysis of the underlying mechanisms behind the security issues (see Pawson and Tilley 1997). Furthermore, CP should engage partners to search sustainable solutions for these issues. CP as a specific way of policing is as much a strategic question as it is tactical and operational task. Strategic design of CP should start from critical analysis of the current position, and the available resources and capabilities, thus helping to make most out of the circumstances. Authorities, such as the police, often understand their purpose rather strictly as something statutory. On the other hand, police is also agile to borrow the latest business management vocabulary, such as being customer oriented, while at the same time resisting, contesting or decoupling any substantive changes in work processes and the scope of tasks (Goodson and Lindblad 2011). Fulfilling the strategic purpose presupposes critical revision of both processes and tasks. This includes a reflection of professional mandates and jurisdictions, and a possibility to re-distribute tasks between other professions or occupations. Often security issues are more than police matters and the analysis of underlying mechanisms may reveal a need for collaborative intervention. Favoreu et al. (2016) divide three different aspects in the strategy formulation process: rational, political and collaborative. These aspects donât refute each other but vary at different phases of strategy process. Rational approach to strategy emphasizes the effective alignment of goals, targets and means, and suggests that activities are organized and led on the basis of valid situation picture. Political approach points out various interests that individuals and groups carry to strategic planning. In CP collaborative aspect underlies strategy process, which is an opportunity to improve interaction and mutual learning among stakeholders. (see Favoreu et al. 2016)."
223,263,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Self-Regulatory Resources Vohs (2006) argues that the RIMâs reflective system is, in fact, powered by selfregulatory resources (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, & Tice, 1998). This account is based on the similarity between the idea of such resources and the cognitive resources discussed in relation to the RIM. Vohs & Faber, (2007) argue that impulsive spending, a phenomenon expected to occur under circumstances that inhibit reflective processing, does indeed occur more often when participants are depleted of self-regulatory resources. A structurally similar argument is made with respect to overeating among dieters (Vohs & Heatherton 2000). Further evidence for this integration of theories comes from research showing that effortful selfregulation has a detrimental effect on subsequent reasoning capabilities (Schmeichel, Vohs, & Baumeister, 2003). The bidirectionality of this effect, that is, a negative effect that prior reflective decision-making exerts on subsequent self-regulation, is shown in a laboratory paradigm encompassing many simple decisions followed by a self-regulatory exercise. The effectâs bidirectionality also surfaces in a field study in which shoppers who reported having made effortful decisions previously solved fewer math problems than those who had engaged in fewer decisions during their shopping trip (Vohs et al., 2008). Although this evidence hints at a connection between self-regulatory and reflective cognitive resources, these studies do not show a direct link between the two. Other research shows that dietary standards and explicit target attitudes predict behavior only when self-regulatory resources are available; when it is not, implicit attitudes are better predictors (Friese, Hofmann, & WÃ¤nke, 2008; Hofmann, Rauch, & Gawronski, 2007). The fact that impulsive and reflective predictors diverge depending on the availability of self-regulatory resources underlines the conceptualization of self-regulation as a conflict between impulsive and reflective behavioral activation. Together with the evidence presented by Vohs (2006), these findings permit the conclusion that research on resourcebased self-regulation can be integrated into the RIM. It remains to be seen whether self-regulatory resources are equivalent to working memory resources or whether they constitute their own construct."

Its application to urban settings may be considered as an approach for strategic planning of NbS, which is founded in principles of multifunctionality and connectivity (e.g., Hansen et al. 2016). GI can thus help to integrate NbS, EbA and not least ESS into the realm of urban planning with its established repertoire of instruments. In turn, national policies, such as the US Clean Water Act, have proven to be strong drivers for mainstreaming the GI concept into urban development (Rouse and Bunster-Ossa 2013). Consequently, so-called âstormwater GIâ has become more and more widespread in the USA. Swedish policies for ESS, on the other hand, have been shown to drive the adoption of EbA at municipal level (Wamsler and Pauleit 2016). Furthermore, expanding governance-based approaches for GI may also advance the development and implementation of NbS via activities initiated by civil society at large (Buijs et al. 2016). In turn, GI may benefit from closely connecting it to the NbS and EbA discourses to re-emphasise the importance of biodiversity. From this, we argue that NbS and EbA can make a significant change to current practice of urban development but core principles of the concepts should be more clearly articulated. A mere re-labelling of business as usual under the new concept of NbS would risk to discredit these concepts, on the other hand (Reid 2016). Therefore, the rapidly developing body of theory and methods of ESS and GI as well as evidence from their application should be recognised in further developing NbS as a concept. Moreover, emphasising the links to GI as planning approach and ESS as an approach to assess natureâs benefits can promote systematic integration of NbS in urban development (Vierikko and NiemelÃ¤ 2016; Hansen and Pauleit 2014. Conversely, it has been suggested that the NbS approach complements the ESS framework because it promotes (and relies more on) biodiversity to increase the resistance and resilience of soci-ecological systems to global changes (Eggermont et al. 2015)."

Following a short presentation of the typical functions of (science-specific) SNS, we firstly present the state of knowledge regarding academic usage practices, both in general purpose SNS and in science-specific SNS. Secondly, we assess potential impacts by addressing identified key issues such as privacy, the role of pseudonymity, and the specific form of informal communication in question. In particular, we focus on the issue of network effects and the challenge of multiple channels, which presents itself as a major hurdle for an effective implementation of SNS in academia. Despite these difficulties, we come to the conclusion that SNS are, in principle, functional for scholarly communication and that they have serious potential within academia."
72,54,0.989,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"how these roles can be strengthened in order to support the generation of social innovation. The chapters in this section underline the importance of collaboration in producing social innovation, even while some also highlight the roles of key individuals in the process, such as Mayor Park in Seoul. In this way, the chapters in this section echo arguments made by Howaldt et al. and McGowan and Westley, which emphasise the roles of different actors within the social innovation process. In Chapter 7, SÃ¸rensen and Torfing argue that multi-actor collaboration in networks, partnerships and inter-organisational teams can spur public innovation. They argue that the principles of New Public Management are giving way to âNew Public Governanceâ, and that the enhancement of collaborative innovation has now become a key aspiration of many public organisations around the world. However, collaborative and innovative processes are difficult to trigger and sustain without proper innovation management and a supportive cultural and institutional environment. Arguing strongly that innovation is produced through collaboration and not through the actions of âheroic individualsâ, the authors describe the roles for public innovation managers that are necessary to enhance innovation through collaboration. In Chapter 8, Han, Kim, Rim and Park provide an empirical case study from Seoul. Led by Mayor Park, a famous social innovator, Seoul Metropolitan Government has developed various communication channels, both online and offline, which have enabled new forms of consultation and engagement between the city administration and citizens. The chapter outlines three communication tools and programmes that reflect the current administrationâs approach and values, and presents a case study of a particular challenge that the city government solved through engaging with citizens. New communication tools often have a limited reach, and the methods currently being used only contribute to solving a limited range of social problems. Nevertheless, Seoul Metropolitan Governmentâs approach offers valuable lessons to other cities that are ambitiously planning to initiate and drive social innovation. In Chapter 9, Tjornbo examines whether the wisdom of crowds can be harnessed to generate social innovation. The development of modern information and communication technologies has led to a renewed interest in the phenomenon of collective intelligence, defined here as the capacity to mobilise and coordinate the knowledge, skills and creativity possessed by large groups of individuals, and combine them into a greater whole. Social innovation is deeply reliant on the capacity to combine the ideas, knowledge and resources possessed by disparate"
373,15,0.989,Introduction to Data Science,"A lot of people believe that the word Data Science is broadly mentioned and used after the publishing of the book The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery [1]. In this book, the first broad look at the way that increasing use of data is bringing a paradigm shift to the nature of science is presented. For reader interest, the four paradigms are empirical evidence (experimental paradigm: thousand years ago), scientific theory (theoretical paradigm: last few hundred years), computational science (computational paradigm: last few decades), and the fourth paradigm is called Data Science (the last decade). Today, Data Science [2] is an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information technology, information science, domain and business knowledge (Figure 2.1). It uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data to solve analytically complex business problems [3]. Data Science is closely related to machine learning, data mining, data analytic, Data Intelligence and Modelling, Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, AI-powered systems and usually Big Data [4]. Data Science includes the processes of capturing data, analyzing, and deriving insights from it. Data Science is all about using data to solve real life problems such as identifying which email is spam or not; monitoring anomaly states in systems; predicting the outcome, who will be the next President of the USA; recommendation which movie to watch, which item to buy; healthcare like tumor detection, drug discovery, medical analysis, virtual medical bots; transportation, self-driving cars; risk detection; environmental monitoring; and entertainment and Internet search."

It is here that the concept of culture becomes problematic. While culture itself is very much transformative and unstable by definition, much of the non-Western international relations literature defines culture with pre-given distinctive patterns of thinking and behavior accepted and maintained by the nationals of a given place and which is assumed to be not observable anywhere else. The reason why much of the literature defines culture in such an essentialized manner is its methodological and epistemological modernist orientation of scientific investigation. Modernism has developed with such concepts as evercontinuing progress and civilization, and the development becomes possible only when it is supported by the accurate comprehension of the present (Hamashita, 1994, pp. 2â3). Thus, human progress and civilization have inevitably evolved hand in hand with the positivist scientific epistemology striving for the transcendent and universal truth. Obviously this epistemology assumes the subject/object division, which is inflexible in its ontological quality. The result is the static view towards the object of inquiry as a âthing,â and the acceptance of a rigid concept of culture within liberal multiculturalism can be understood according to this line of reasoning. As this pursuit of the transcendent and universal truth is a distinctive characteristic of modern knowledge construction in general, the analysis of world affairs with a specific focus on the cores and centers of the world mapping, i.e. nation-states, is not confined to international relations. The critique of methodological nationalism with regard to social sciences has been carried forward by a number of scholars in recent years (Chernilo, 2006; Wimmer and Glick-Schiller, 2002). Area Studies, focusing on the East Asian cultural relations, is not an exception either. In the discourse of Asian Area Studies, much attention has been paid to explaining interactions among different parties in the region with such essentialized and immobile concepts as âChinese,â âJapanese,â and âKoreanâ cultures. However, this pre-given analytical framework, based on the concept of nation-state is, we argue, insufficient for fully comprehending, and thus providing a feasible solution for, conflicts and disputes in the Asia Pacific region. Hamashita (1994) contends in this context that the reason why the contemporary knowledge structures of social sciences and humanities are unable to sufficiently grasp the issues of East Asian politics is due to their ignorance of the margins. Because previous studies have analyzed the region only in terms of nation-states and concomitant"

Whereas the challenges to be addressed are widely known and accepted, the question of how these goals can be achieved, i.e. how an economy can be transformed into a bioeconomy, is still at the centre of scientific, political, and societal debate. Historical evidence from recent decades demonstrates societyâs essential role in any successful transformation of systems. Norms, values, and thus behavioural patterns, along with the degree of acceptance and the willingness to support changes, are as important as technological and economic factors (Verbong and Loorbach 2012). These norms and values shape the preferences of what a future bioeconomy should look like. Any thinking about the future is accompanied by uncertainties and relevant but as yet unknown processes within and outside the control of stakeholders. The development of potentially successful strategies for dealing with uncertainties on the way to a bioeconomy requires instruments and tools to depict possible transition paths. This chapter provides the reader with a number of instruments and tools, without claiming to be comprehensive. To identify future possibilities, scenarios have increasingly been used in the past decades. They address complexities and uncertainties by explicitly acknowledging that different futures are possible and that reliable, long-term predictions in the field of sociotechnical transition are not possible (Grunwald 2011). Scenarios aim to explore and develop potential or desirable future states and development pathways. One established approach is to combine scenarios with models (Poganietz et al. 2000). Models can reveal interdependencies between resources, production, consumption, markets and sectors, and the environment."
293,283,0.989,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Introduction This state-of-the-art volume taking stock of and presenting existing research on integration processes and policies in Europe was triggered by European Union (EU)-level policymaking on integration. A 2011 European Commission policy document proposes that integration policies should involve not only immigrants and the society of settlement but also actors in immigrantsâ countries of origin (EC 2011). Compared to the Commissionâs earlier deï¬nition of integration (EC 2003), this constituted a shift from a two-way to a three-way process approach. The current volume has reformulated the EUâs policy shift into a broader question for academia and integration research: What does research have to say about (the study of) integration processes and, in particular, about the relevance of actors in origin countries for integration? What does the existing literature say about integration policies in Europe and use of the concept of integration in policy formulation and practice? Does the proposal to include actors in countries of origin as important players in integration policies ï¬nd legitimation in empirical research? With the purpose of answering these questions, we asked experts in the relevant subï¬elds to write state-of-the-art chapters. Chapter 2, by Penninx and GarcÃ©sMascareÃ±as, examined development of the concept of integration in the academic study of settlement processes of migrants and in policies. Chapter 3, by Van Mol and De Valk, analysed changes in migration patterns and characteristics of immigrants as a potential explanatory factor for changes in integration processes and policies. R.

212,463,0.989,Life Cycle Management,"the last decade. While globalization and trade liberalization has led to greater integration in the world economy, it has also been accompanied by increasing fragmentation in production (see OECD 2012; Elms and Low 2013). The life cycle assessment (LCA) community has seen a lively debate on, for example, the value of deepening research to the level of product subsystems versus widening research through systems expansion (cf Curran 2013), as well as combining process-LCA and Inputâoutput (IO) LCA to deal with the complexities of long supply chains and product chain organization (see Gereffi et al. 2005; Finnveden et al. 2009; Koh et al. 2013; Lake et al. 2014; Eriksson and Olsson 2011; Baumann 2012). Furthermore, global financial crises as well as dramatic cases of corporate failure has led to renewed questioning of the role of corporate reporting. Frustration about information overload in annual reports and apparent lack of what is really material or strategic information has led to the birth of an integrated reporting movement. The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) seeks to promote âintegrated thinkingâ, akin to âlife cycle thinkingâ. In defense of the GRI Guidelines, all its environmental indicators reflect a life cycle approach. This includes impacts at the end of the useful life of the product, especially important for life cycle management (LCM) as environmental life cycle costing (LCC) takes into account use- and endof-life phases and hidden costs (KlÃ¶pffer 2008). The LCA response to the integration challenge has been to define the emergence of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) (see Finkbeiner et al. 2010; Guinee et al. 2011; Hellweg and Canals 2014) Against this background of value chain complexity and initiatives in favor of integration, this chapter seeks to define pathways along which life cycle assessment (LCA) applications and life cycle thinking can be integrated with core business planning and strategic financial performance (Eun et al. 2009). Importantly, this chapter is not about moving from environmental and/or social LCA to economic LCA. Rather, it is about moving from environmental LCA to business finance and accounting. Its reflections will also be relevant for what integration in the form of sustainability LCA (a new integrated LCA or compilation of separate assessments) implies, and how life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) could be engrained in corporate financial planning."
38,206,0.989,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"gene of any biological sample (including eggs, larvae, or parts of an organism such as legs or leaves) leads to rapid identiï¬cation if the species has already been catalogued in a reference library (e.g., Barcode of Life Database; Ratnasingham and Hebert 2007). In addition to species identiï¬cation and studies of phylogenetic relationships, the variation in DNA sequences also enables reï¬ned estimates of genetic diversity at the species level and above (Faith 1992). These can be applied to speciï¬c taxa (e.g., an endangered species) and/or places (e.g., a national park or farm) and monitored over time, and these are the units we focus on for genetic monitoring. Within-species genetic diversity estimation has been transformed by the use of various genetic proï¬ling methods since the late 1980s involving the use of DNA sequencing and DNA fragment analysis (Sunnucks 2000) and an ever-expanding range of statistical frameworks in which to analyse the data (Beaumont et al. 2002). Notably we can not only analyse levels of genetic variation but use this information to infer population parameters and demographic trajectories, often from a single point sample. Furthermore, the advent of metagenomics through environmental shotgun sequencing (Tyson et al. 2004; Venter et al. 2004) opened up the microbial world, heralding a new age of biotic exploration documenting what constitutes the overwhelming majority of life in both biomass and variation terms. Some of these advances have not reached the conservation monitoring literature and seemingly went almost unnoticed by the CBD and its associated bodies until recently. This oversight can perhaps be attributed to the astonishing pace of DNA sequencing capacity, increasing at a much faster rate than Mooreâs Law since the mid 2000s. Perhaps the explosion in technologies and analytical methods made it difï¬cult to settle on standardised genomics-based approaches for biodiversity monitoring. Of course, attention has also been largely focused on the more established (and visible) levels of biodiversity (e.g., CBD-related efforts on the global taxonomy initiative and the so-called âecosystem approachâ). Ignoring the power and promise of genomics seems increasingly anachronistic. The public is increasingly aware of the beneï¬ts the ânew age of genomicsâ offers for personal and public health, and food and energy production (Field and Davies 2015). Genetics is likely to become increasingly important in biodiversity monitoring with rapid molecular assessment of species and ecosystems now feasible using high throughput DNA sequencing in a fraction of the time and cost of previous approaches (Whitham et al. 2008). Simultaneously, with the establishment of the IPBES, the recognition that understanding and maintaining genetic diversity within and among species may be key to ecosystem (and therefore ecosystem service) resilience in the face of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors, has raised the proï¬le of genetic diversity substantially (Sgro et al. 2011; Mace et al. 2012; Pereira et al. 2013) leading to its incorporation into the Aichi Targets."
169,21,0.989,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(AM), which offers a framework to integrate the knowledge, methods, and operations of the research, policy, and local practice communities. It has been developed over four decades of experimental applications to understand and manage crises of collapsed ï¬sheries, agriculture, forestry, and rangeland grazing (Holling 1978; Walters 1986; Gunderson et al. 1995). In addition to incorporating multiple perspectives, AM increases adaptive capacity by shifting decision-making processes from linear (crisisâanalysisâ policy) to a cyclic process (Fig. 1.3). This process structures learning and iteratively integrates how we modify assessment and policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring in order to track and manage change in the world (Magnuszewski et al. 2005). The search for durable solutions to crises in ecosystems and society has repeatedly expanded the scope of inquiry outward from science to develop policies based on a broader base of experience and practice. Initial experiments (Holling 1978) acknowledged government and local practice but focused mostly on bridging disciplines within science. Subsequent experiments worked to include government (Walters 1986), local practitioners (Light and Blann 2000). However, managing aquatic ecosystems proceeds over time scales (decades) that far exceed those of individual projects or individual management campaigns. To make ecosystems sustainable, the adaptive potential raised by AM must be sustained over periods long enough to institutionalize adaptive and sustainable practices. This drive to build long-term ecosystem sustainability proposed adaptive governance as a framework that would foster AM while addressing social aspects neglected in initial AM experiments (Gunderson et al. 2016). Speciï¬cally, it should create a workspace where formal and informal institutions can collaborate to understand and manage complex issues in social-ecological systems (Schultz et al. 2015). Adaptive governance would be distinguished by its capacity to increase the importance of learning and to bridge previously separate levels: formal/informal, scales of administration (polycentricity), in ways that embrace cross-scale interactions in ecosystems and society (Chafï¬n et al. 2014; Chafï¬n and Gunderson 2015)."

Another option for a learning context is to introduce the problemand project-based learning approach (Barrett 2005; Savery 2006) as a key feature. Specific to transdisciplinary research is the integration of actors other than scientists. A widely used term for these actors is âstakeholdersâ. Stakeholders are persons, groups or collective actors with interests in and/or influence on the addressed issue (see also Sect. 4.2.3). According to this definition, a fundamental stakeholder classification proposes groups according to (1) problem ownership, (2) actors who have interest in outcomes and (3) the actorsâ ability to act and to influence and shape project outcomes. Thus, stakeholder identification in transdisciplinary research necessitates both an understanding of the research question, so that boundaries of the social and ecological system can be established, and an overview of required resources, rights and capabilities that are necessary to successfully complete the project. It is an iterative process, where stakeholders might be added as the analysis continues. In practice, it is often not possible to identify all concerned stakeholders, and it is necessary to draw a line at some point, based on predetermined and welldefined decision criteria, to stop the selection and recruitment process (Gerster-Bentaya 2015; Grimble and Wellard 1997). In order to appropriately address practitioners and to understand and assess roles, agencies and power constellations of actors involved, a stakeholder analysis is an essential step (GersterBentaya 2015). With regard to the categorisation of stakeholders, the first question to be addressed is: Who classifies them? In the case of top-down âanalytical categorisationsâ, stakeholders are classified by researchers or experts, while bottom-up âreconstructive methodsâ allow the categorisations and parameters in a stakeholder analysis to be defined by the stakeholders themselves. General stakeholder classification criteria may be based on interest and influence, legitimacy and resources and networks or types of"

278,225,0.989,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The concept of socio-economic metabolism is relatively young in the literature. Here we interpret the term in an inclusive sense that is synonymous with social (Fischer-Kowalski 1998; Fischer-Kowalski and Weisz 1999), industrial (Ayres 1989) and anthropogenic metabolism (Baccini and Brunner 1991). Modelling methods that incorporate anthropogenic stocks and ï¬ows can trace their lineage back to the early works of Forrester (1958), but examples where social metabolism and material and energy ï¬ow accounting are united with dynamic stock analysis are rare (Baccini and Bader 1996; MÃ¼ller et al. 2004; Lennox et al. 2005; MÃ¼ller 2006; Baynes et al. 2009; MÃ¼ller et al. 2013; Pauliuk and MÃ¼ller 2014). Even within that handful, few talk of the services from stocks that are germane to our discussion on sustainable development. There are a number of proponents of this integrated thinking and there is a natural application in urban systems. The âSocial-Ecological-Infrastructural Systems Frameworkâ of Ramaswami et al. (2012) begins with questions of urban sustainability and expands to the same scope as the socio-economic metabolism framework. They speciï¬cally include services from internal and âtrans-boundaryâ infrastructures, but the key difference from the socio-economic metabolism framework lies in the dynamic treatment of stocks in-use in the latter. In the following sections, we discuss key features of the socio-economic metabolism framework (hereafter the âmetabolic frameworkâ or approach) â see Fig. 6.2."
223,32,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"the key criterion for distinguishing between direct and mediated experiences and between face-to-face and mediated communication, the three main foci of this bookâaction, knowledge, and spaceâare conceptualized in a new framework, the socially constructed relations of space. The geographer Huib Ernste illustrates in his chapter that the divorce of rationality and reason during the philosophical development of modernity led to recognition of different types of rationality, each with its own logics of deliberation and argumentation. Poststructuralists emphasize that each rationality contains multiple paradigms, each establishing its own set of principles, institutions, and lines of conflict that need to be taken into account. He demonstrates how these views are intricately involved in late-modern geographical theories of action and in language-pragmatic approaches25 in geography. Proponents of poststructuralist approaches emphasize the structural aspects of discourse, especially power structures. Laclau and Mouffe (1985), by contrast, try to retain and restore the possibility of deliberative interventions in these discursive structures by inverting Foucaultâs power/knowledge equation. Ernste explores the extent to which this inversion reinstates responsible and rational spatial decisions and actions as a focus of research in human geography. In his view rationality could be reconstituted as a culturally contingent phenomenon, and critical geographical analysis could again contribute to concrete problem-solving, albeit in a culturally much more informed and embedded way than hitherto. Ernste also discusses geographical action theory as put forward by Werlen (1987, 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1997, 2010a, 2010b, 2013, 2015; see also Werlenâs Chap. 2 in this volume) in the phenomenological tradition of SchÃ¼tz (1932). According to that school of thought, the internal mental intentionality directed to outer objects is what ascribes meanings to these objects, as people do through their everyday place-making and everyday spatially differentiated actions. Ernste interprets this geographic action theory as the subjectivist version of what Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Savigny (2001) and Reckwitz (2002) designated as the mentalist paradigm in social theory. This approach contrasts with the objectivist version of mentalism, which stems from classical structuralism. Ernste shows that the advent of poststructuralist thinking ushered in a great reluctance to conceptualize human behavior as conscious rational actions and that the term action is generally avoided in most poststructuralist literature. Talking about practice instead of action indeed amounts to a novel picture of human agency and rationality (Reckwitz, 2008, p. 98). In contrast to Benno Werlen, with his subjective, meaning-oriented approach to geographical action theory, and unlike Zierhofer (2002), who advocated the language-pragmatic approach in geography, poststructuralist thinkers do not tend to place structures inside the mind or in pragmatic procedures of interaction but rather âoutsideâ bothâin chains of signs, in symbols, discourse, or text. Pragmatics is âa branch of linguistics dealing with language in its situational context, including the knowledge and beliefs of the speaker and the relationship and interaction between speaker and listenerâ (âPragmatics,â 2010)."

Viewpoint of Emergence. Emergence is an intrinsic property of the SoS and it concerns with novel phenomena that manifest at the macro-level (i.e., at SoS level) which are new with respect to the non-relational phenomena of any of its proper parts (i.e., CSs) at the micro level. The rationale behind emergence is that by composing CSs, either positive or detrimental global emergent phenomena may occur. Managing such phenomena can help avoiding unsafe unexpected situations generated from safe CSs, and may help eliciting positive emerging phenomena. Appropriate effort shall be devoted to monitoring, analysing and predicting detrimental emergence phenomena and to mitigating (executing appropriate reactions) their effect on the SoS. For non-detrimental emergence, it is desirable, but not mandatory to monitor, analyse and predict emergence phenomena. Emergence may be influenced or generated by modiï¬cations to the Structure (e.g., adding new components which introduces new functionalities, or adding new components that may change the error model, e.g., introducing new Itoms which enables new interoperability between CSs), dynamicity and evolution (making the system able to make changes to the way its CSs interacts with each other and how the system is aligned with changing business requirements). Note that emergence phenomena may cause violations to handling of time, dependability and security of the SoS/CS. In the Conceptual level, starting from the SoS mission, the meta-requirements and basic SoS concepts, we identify the instantiated emergence requirements. The Logical Level concerns with applying the proï¬le to identify emergence and categorize it according to the strength and predictability of effects. Because of the nature of the emergence concept, in we deemed not sufï¬cient to simply elicit an emergent behaviour. We also consider worth capturing operational aspects related to emergence by considering an SoS in action. For these reasons, in we consider two possible diagrams to represent emergence through Block Deï¬nition Diagram and Sequence Diagram. The building blocks deï¬ned in Section Y support the monitoring, analysing, planning and executing mitigating activities required by the emergence management requirements. The instantiation of the proï¬le should be tightly connected with the Structure viewpoint of the SoS. Interactions elicited among CS should be deï¬ned according to the RequestResponse model and take into account the service provided at the RUI interfaces as regulated by the SLA. For supporting early identiï¬cation and mitigation of emergence, particular attention has to be devoted to the interactions through stigmergic channels. The design process will also consider application and domain speciï¬c details which will be added by the designer. Finally, validation activities will check the correct application of building blocks, their integration and the usage of SoS domain speciï¬c concepts (possibly available through an SoS proï¬le). The platform independent architecture resulting from the logical is instantiated, conï¬gured and to linked the architectural elements, which support the achievement of the emergence requirements through the implementation of a platform-speciï¬c instance."

Technological innovation refers to widespread use of an invention or a technology regardless of its use or possible innovative practices with it (BÃ©chard 2001). For example, it is possible that interactive whiteboards, a technology that is no longer new, could be used to either reinforce traditional teacher-centred practices or facilitate innovative learning approaches. The SITES project for instance found that many of the 174 case studies of innovative practice it gathered used âordinary technologyâ to do innovative things (Kozma 2003). Pedagogical innovation exists only when approaches in teaching and learning are modiï¬ed; this could be the introduction of a totally new approach or a novel combination of existing approaches. Consequently this could require a major change in educational values and organisation (both pedagogical and administrativeâstructures, functions, roles, communication). Given these conditions, it can be difï¬cult therefore to pinpoint speciï¬c pedagogical practices and to recognise these as innovative. Such changes can be qualitative (e.g., depth) or quantitative (e.g., frequency, duration). The same analysis can be made of relationships between teacher and student (teacher or student locus, peer learning, etc.). In all cases, it is important to document qualitative and measure quantitative aspects, with and without the technology, and the wider effects (e.g., motivation, conï¬dence in working with others). Gathering such evidence is also needed to scale up a pedagogical innovation but that is not possible through the development of a simple formula or step-by-step guide applicable in any context. What really makes an innovation scalable is that it can be adapted to any new environment (recombining, adjusting, etc.)âwhile retaining its essence (Tobin 2005)âin order for other teachers and learners truly to own it. Furthermore, the iTEC project was ï¬rmly focused on delivering sustainable mechanisms for wide scale adoption of innovation that had deep and lasting impact. This aim was underpinned by belief that incremental change (Kampylis et al. 2012) is as important as disruptive innovation. And this is supported by Rogersâ (1995) âdiffusionâ model of innovation which demonstrates how individual, small-scale changes can support and lead to a broader set of local innovations by other âendusersâ. Similarly, Fierro-Evanâs research (OECD 2008) identiï¬ed: âWhile microlevel innovations might seem to have âlimited relevanceâ, paradoxically, they are usually the most permanent and make the deepest impact on practiceâ (p. 19). From this, in the iTEC project, an innovation in education is deï¬ned as a change that brings about a positive result in teaching and learning but which is context speciï¬c. This is because an innovation in one country or school is not necessarily considered innovative in another. Moreover, innovations are often found to be most"

LPS is an excellent example of a long-standing collaboration which has capitalized on shared interests with a fluid structure within which many people can work together. The recent rapid increase of international comparative studies on curriculum is another example (Lloyd, Cai, & Tarr, 2017). Many individual researchers chose to focus on certain aspects of curriculum as they conducted comparative analyses across nations. These studies provided new insights into the content and design of mathematics textbooks and generated key questions about relationships between written curricular materials and studentsâ opportunities to learn. Another avenue for individual researchers is to engage in secondary analyses of large-scale international comparative studies, which generally make a great deal of data publically available. This work can also be done with few resources and the often severe time constraints that apply to individual or beginning researchers. Our overall message is that international comparative studies can provide a wealth of information for mathematics education researchers and policymakers. The mathematics education community has a unique capacity to contribute to an in-depth understanding of both national and international ï¬ndings, and hence to assist us all in learning the right lessons from international comparisons."

293,17,0.989,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Dutch context, Schinkel (2010) coincides to note that the very notion of society is problematic, as it implies the existence of a more or less homogeneous and cohesive social environment in which only certain types of peopleânamely migrantsâneed to integrate. Despite being a contested concept, integration continues to be central in many studies and debates on the settlement of newcomers in host societies. In Europe, several authors have attempted to strip the concept of its normative character and build a more open and analytical definition (Hoffmann-Novotny 1973; Esser 1980; Heckmann 1981, 2015; Penninx 1989, 2005; Bommes 2012). Esser (2004, 46) defines integration as âthe inclusion [of individual actors] in already existing social systemsâ. For Heckmann (2006, 18), integration is âa generations lasting process of inclusion and acceptance of migrants in the core institutions, relations and statuses of the receiving societyâ. According to Bommes (2012, 113), âthe problem of migrant assimilation refers to no more (and no less) than the conditions under which they succeed or fail to fulfil the conditions of participation in social systemsâ. In order to work or to gain access to goods, education, rights, and social welfare, Bommes (ibid.) argues, every individual must have some knowledge of what it means to work or how to behave as a patient, a client, a pupil, a student, or an applicant. From this perspective, there is no alternative to integration. Interestingly, all of these approaches have in common the assumption that actors (immigrants in this case) are partially engaged in multiple autonomous and interdependent fields or systems. This implies a shift away from a holistic approach that conceptualizes integration into a taken-for-granted reference populationâthe âcore cultureâ or national society as a wholeâtowards a disaggregated approach that considers not only multiple reference populations but also distinct processes occurring in different domains (Brubaker 2001, 542â544). For instance, Esser (2001, 16) refers to four dimensions: culturation (similar to socialization), placement (position in society), interaction (social relations and networks), and identification (belonging). Similarly, Heckmann and Schnapper (2003) distinguish between structural integration, cultural integration (or acculturation), interactive integration, and identificational integration. From this perspective, integration dynamics and tempos are viewed as different for each dimension, and processes of structural marginalization and inequality become key. In line with these more recent approaches to the concept of integration, this chapter aims to set up an analytical framework for the study of integration processes and policies. For this purpose, we focus in the first part on the concept of integration, introducing an open non-normative analytical definition and identifying the main dimensions, parties involved, levels of analysis, and other relevant factors such as time and generations. In the second part, we define integration policies and propose a distinction between policy frames and concrete policy measures as well as a shift from government to governance in order to account for the complex, multi-layered, and often contradictory character of integration policies. The conclusion returns to the concepts of integration and integration policies and suggests lines for further research."
198,471,0.989,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"explored by analyzing the relationships between climatic and agricultural variables (Di Falco et al. 2011). In practice, continued refinement of soil, water, tree and crop management practices will contribute much of the required adaptation, except in systems that are already water stressed (Turral et al. 2011). However, while it is globally acknowledged that food productivity contributes to food security, post-harvest processes are also important. Furthermore, since their own agricultural activities are the primary sources of food for many people in developing countries, effects of climatic changes on crop productivity (and the peopleâs responses to them) will strongly influence their overall food security (Ingram et al. 2008). Hence, efforts to ensure food security must include strengthening of the adaptive capacity (Plummer and Armitage 2010) of individuals, households and communities by improving their access to, knowledge of, and control over natural, human, social, physical and financial resources (Pramova and Locatelli 2013). For these reasons, several authors (Pittock and Jones 2000; Stafford Smith et al. 2011) have argued that adaptation to climate change needs to be seen as an iterative process. If so, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation and/or progress towards it are clearly important to assess the effectiveness of adaptation interventions, options and technologies (UNFCCC 2010). However, there are uncertainties regarding appropriate adaptation indicators. Ideally, they should be different but complementary to development variables, but current approaches to adaptation M&E do not take this distinction into account. This chapter describes efforts to improve the design and implementation of adaptation M&E, at program and project levels, undertaken in a CGIAR Research Program (CRP7). Specific objectives were: (i) to demonstrate the applicability and utility of the theory of planned behavioral changes for adaptation M&E, focusing on adaptive capacity, and (ii) contribute to the development of an integrated biophysical-behavioral changes approach to adaptation M&E."

Recently, research in mathematics education has turned its attention to the problem of âlanguage and semiotic aspects in the construction of mathematical knowledge, both in an individual and in a social construction perspectiveâ (Boero and Consogno 2007). In particular, starting from the assumption that the language is fundamental since the mathematical objects are not directly accessible Duval (1993), elaborated a theory based on this main idea: the learning of mathematical objects is necessarily conceptual and an activity on them is possible only using âregisters of semiotic representationsâ (Duval 1993). He provides a very rich theory about it based on the assumption that there is no knowledge without representation. Moreover, two kinds of transformations are mathematically relevant: the âtreatmentâ (Duval 1993, p. 41), the transition from a representation to another in the same register, and the âconversionâ (Duval 1993, p. 421), the transition from a representation in a register to another in a different register. The transition from a semiotic representation to another and vice versa is essential for the conceptual learning of mathematical objects: âThinking in mathematics depends on the synergy of several registers and not on the activity of a single system. Unlike what occurs in other ï¬elds, mathematical concepts are only understandable within such a synergyâ (Duval 2006, p. 21). Duval (2005) afï¬rms that geometry requires a cognitive activity very complex but complete, since it stimulates the gesture, the language, and the seeing. It is a ï¬eld of knowledge that implies the cognitive joining of two very different representation registers: the visualization of the shapes and the language; a synergy between visualization and language is fundamental to understand geometrical arguments. Duval (2005) identiï¬es the origin of the difï¬culties in geometry in the intuition which relies on perception. According to psychological studies, perception plays a fundamental role in the visualisation process: âBy perception the visual thought organises itself as a starting point of insight and reflection, mental activities which contribute to the formation of conceptsâ (Marchini et al. 2009, p. 62). Perception is a process of selection and organization, cognitive activities connected with knowledge and understanding. Nevertheless, visual perception may hinder the way of seeing geometrical ï¬gures. Following Duval (2005), this way depends on the activity in which it is involved. There are two ways of seeing a ï¬gure: iconic and not iconic. The second is a sequence of operations of geometrical property identiï¬cation that implies that the âdeconstructionâ of the shapes has been visually recognized. This brief overview of theories that underlie geometrical knowledge has been focused mainly on those elements that affect research conducted at the lowest educational level. However, even such a selective approach shows that theoretical background can be varied, taking into account many different aspects of building the geometrical knowledge of students. It also shows the speciï¬cs of the geometric research that distinguish it from research in other areas of education."
192,24,0.989,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"understanding (Begriff) of what integrity is and how misconduct is to be avoided (M1). But as soon as researchers become actively involved in concrete research practices (as soon as they really become entangled in the vicissitudes of laboratory life), things may prove not as transparent and unequivocal as was initially expected. Contradictions and anomalies begin to emerge, involving tensions between codes of conduct and actual practices, between âbackstageâ and âfrontstageâ, between the âcontext of discoveryâ (the daily research activities in which researchers are actually involved) and the âcontext of justificationâ (a cleansed and standardised version of their methods and results, as reported in academic papers, suggesting a straightforward trajectory leading from question and hypothesis via experiment to conclusion). In their efforts to apply the formal procedures of the scientific method to concrete situations, researchers inevitably experience the recalcitrance and messiness of the complex realities they purport to study (M2). The empirical cycle, neatly described in methodological textbooks, begins to hamper and researchers may experience all kinds of compromising frustrations. Real research may seem chaotic and deficient in comparison with the normative methodological ideal. Theoretical expectations (hypotheses) are confronted with instances of ânegationâ, and it may prove impossible to replicate initial results. Even the conceptual framework or research methodology as such may become challenged. Gradually, however, researchers will realise that this actually constitutes a crucial, inevitable and formative experience; that these frustrations and complications contribute to the Bildung process, the socialisation and edification of the scientists involved. In the long run, such problematic experiences may strengthen the robustness of their approach. The scientistsâ âmetalâ is being tested, and these frustrations and disappointments are an inevitable part of being in science, basic predicaments of the scientific profession as such. Challenges may then be redefined as opportunities, allowing scientists to transform (âsublateâ) their initial (abstract) conception of the scientific method into a genuine understanding of what research is about (realitycompatible as it were, and building on experience). Thus, they have reached a higher level of comprehension and performance (in dialectical terms: the ânegation of the negationâ), where abstract methodological standards evolve into robust research practices as part of a viable epistemological culture, or Sittlichkeit as Hegel phrases it, so that formal standards and actual practices (which at a certain point seemed to contradict one another) may become reconciled, in the context of best practices (M2 â M3). In order to reach this âthird momentâ, however, researchers have to expose themselves to and work through the painful experiences of the âsecond momentâ, so that actual empirical research constitutes an important experience (food for reflection). But all this requires effort, labour and perseverance, and in real life, as obstacles and anomalies begin to accumulate, this âthirdâ moment may prove horrendously difficult to attain (M2 â | M3). Instead of facing these challenges, inevitably involved in real-life research practices, researchers (âsubjectsâ of science) may become reluctant to expose themselves to the multiple tensions and frustrations emerging within the âcontext of discoveryâ. They may deplore the various problematic aspects of actual research practices to such an extent that they abstain from committing themselves to this"
212,253,0.989,Life Cycle Management,"holistic understanding of the interdependence of industrial systems. To this end, sound tools are needed that can capture the complexity and provide metrics to embed sustainability in different business decisions. Systems thinking helps to understand the different parts within the system and their relation to other systems. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a systems analysis tool that can assess and help improve the environmental performance (one of the three pillars of sustainability) of products and processes by providing powerful insights into the whole value chain (ISO 2006a, b; ILCD 2010). By doing this, LCA provides an understanding that allows avoiding shifting impacts from one process step/industry to another, from one impact category to another and from one place to another. LCA supports businesses in making various decisions such as the selection of processes, materials, and supply chains. By supporting these business decisions and actions, LCA can offer value creation opportunities to business and improves shareholder and stakeholder value simultaneously. Similarly, other tools such as Life Cycle Costing (LCC) and Social Life Cycle Assessment (Social-LCA) can be used to understand the economic costs (externalities can also be included) and social impacts and risks (both positive and negative) throughout product life cycles. The authors focus on environmental LCA and combine other tools wherever possible. LCA has been applied in companies and in public policy making. When applied in companies, LCA has often been seen as a mere auxiliary technical tool and the insights were limited to the impact quantification, which is the major strength of the tool, without actively involving business functions. Many companies are not implementing LCA in their day-to-day business due to its resource-intensive nature, complexity and the difficulty of contextualizing the relevance of LCA for the circumstances of companies. There has hardly been any exploration of how LCA can offer advice to existing corporate structures through decision support of business functions. And most importantly, the insights of LCA have by far not been fully exploited for the potential value creation opportunities in companies. There is little research to understand the role of LCA in supporting business functions (Sandin et al. 2014) and consequently linking it with sustainable value creation opportunities (UNEP/SETAC 2009; Rebitzer and Buxmann 2005; Gloria et al. 2014). The objective of this chapter is to bridge the gap between sustainability science and business management by contextualizing the application of LCA in corporate sustainability and aligning it with business activities/functions and business priorities (value creation). This alignment can mainstream and advance the implementation of LCM in business. In order to fulfill the above mentioned objective, the authors explain the context of corporations, the opportunities for value creation, and the role of different functions in integrating sustainability in day-to-day business. Case studies show how LCA can be contextualized in business and connected to value creation opportunities. Based on case studies, the authors offer an iterative procedure to conduct LCAs and create sustainable value."
278,373,0.989,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"industrial ecology community (Cohen-Rosenthal 2004), was consistently critical of reductionist strategies that would rely solely on engineering know-how, proper technologies and market-based incentives. For Cohen-Rosenthal, the focus should be on social processes, or the actual points of connection between material and energy flows, and specifically connections between people. Yet little attention is given in IE to the relation between interests, institutions and resources (Opoku 2004), and this dimension remains to be further conceptualized â although interest in this dimension has been growing in the past decade, as we will now turn to. IE engages with various tools, which are now considered a part industrial ecology approaches, including InputâOutput Accounting and Material Flow Analysis, as well as Life Cycle Assessments. The value of LCA has been to extend beyond the âend of pipeâ perspective, which only addresses final outputs, in terms of pollution and environmental degradation. Rather, inputs and outputs are described and can be quantified and qualified across the production-consumption chain, from extraction of natural resources, through manufacturing, distribution, usage and final disposal. In more recent years, social LCA has developed to consider the social impacts in the life cycle of products and processes (UNEP 2009; Andrews et al. 2009; Hauschild et al. 2008), with more recent work in developing a social hotspots database that includes a consideration of labour intensity and worker rights (Benoit-Norris et al. 2012) and on integrating occupational health and safety standards (Scanlon et al. 2015). One aspect of the social and solidarity economy is that the primacy of people over profit is not an âend of pipeâ gesture, but rather embedded across the economic activity in question, from its guiding principles and mission, to how salaries and employee benefits are organized, to how profit is shared. We will come back to this notion in the next section of this chapter, when we consider forms of âend of pipe sharingâ to distinguish more robust solidarity economy activities from âbusiness as usualâ. The notion of reciprocity, which is an important concept underpinning the SSE, is interesting to explore in relation to IE. If we continue with the notion of IE as being based on a metaphor, can we identify any forms of reciprocity in nature? In other terms, do we see cooperation or competition in natural systems? Ehrenfeld (2000) suggests that a balance is needed between both. Does altruism exist in nature? Perhaps something closer would be mutualism, which would suggest cooperation between members that lead to mutually beneficial or even neutral outcomes. For Ehrenfeld, ââ¦the power of the concept of industrial ecology lies in its normative context and in its potential to shape paradigmatic thinking. It is normative in the sense that (â¦) three features of the ecological metaphor â community, connectedness, and cooperation â are characteristics we should strive for in designing our worlds.â (Ehrenfeld 2000: 238). These three features, of community, connectedness and cooperation, are closely related to the social and solidarity economy and would merit being further conceptualized. We could draw on the work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809â1865) here, the father of mutualism in economic theory, who suggested that human activities could be mutualized towards the creation of a collective good. In terms of governance systems, the notion of voluntary engagement in complementary relations, which is important in the SSE literature, is not explicit in the IE literature. Forms of auto-organization are usually upheld as the preferred way of"
143,452,0.989,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"and English used in Nairobi, is an example of a hybrid cultural artifact that emerged out of the close quarters in the city that brought many different linguistic cultures into contact with one another. For scholars of organizations, hybrids are organizations that cross sectorial or institutional boundaries or use core beliefs and practices from multiple organizational types (Doherty et al. 2014; Mangen and Brivot 2014). A social enterprise is the quintessential example of a hybrid organization because it has both a social-impact purpose and a drive for financial sustainability (Doherty et al. 2014), meaning that it is motivated by core beliefs from two different sectors, the nonprofit and the for-profit sectors. A prominent debate among researchers of organizations is whether hybrid organizations are stable and sustainable. For example, Greenwood and Hinings (1993) have argued that organizations tend to move toward a single set of core values and beliefs because of the internal conflict caused by the presence of multiple potentially incompatible beliefs. This view of hybrid organizations as inherently unstable dominates the existing literature on organizations. However, more recent research carried out in countries in the Global South has provided evidence that hybrid organizations may actually be well suited to such environments. In Bolivia, Battilana and Dorado (2010) demonstrated that new organizations that began as some kind of hybrid, like a social enterprise, had greater potential for sustainability than more established organizations seeking to change their organizational culture. For social enterprises in two different African countries, Gupta et al. (2015) made the case that hybrid organizations may actually be useful in resource-constrained environments. By combining the theories of organizational culture and hybrids described above, I believe it is possible to attain a more holistic and nuanced sense of the construction of hybrid organizations that goes beyond the core beliefs typically examined. In the rest of this chapter, I use Scheinâs framework of the levels of organizational culture: (1) to identify organizational culture at traditional nonprofit and for-profit organizations and (2) to examine how iHub and 88mph, two organizations in the Kenyan technology sector, are to varying extents organizational cultural hybrids that have adopted beliefs, practices, and even assumptions from both traditional nonprofit and for-profit organizational cultures."
188,146,0.989,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Conclusion and Future Work Developing an evaluation framework for PLEs is challenging, since technological, organizational, psycho-pedagogical and social aspects need to be considered in an integrated manner and with a diverse set of stakeholder perspectives being taken into account. Our attempt was to propose a unified framework encompassing the main valid constructs (derived from relevant theoretical models), yet at the same time providing a flexible and adaptive methodology that is capable of accommodating the changes that are inevitable in an emerging field. In order to achieve this, we have elaborated an integrated framework that is by nature case study based and follows a multi-method approach. Furthermore, we recommended concluding the cyclic evaluation with a cross-case analysis in order to consolidate data from different contexts so as to establish a holistic view. A number of metrics and possible methods have been identified and located in the proposed unified framework. The metrics, criteria, methods, techniques, and tools proposed are subjected to further refinement and improvement. A process model ensures the possibility to do so in a well-defined manner. Obviously, more research efforts are called for to investigate the complex phenomenon of PLEâand this contribution provides the methodological basis on which such future endeavors can be built.

We support interoperability between different existing analysis tools, as well as our own analysis using the popular tool Uppaal as a back-end engine. Formal methods have the advantage of being precise, unambiguous and systematic. A lot of effort is spent on their correctness proofs. However, these benefits are only reaped if the tools supporting formal analysis are also correct. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to apply the systematic approach of MDE to the development of formal analysis tools. Through model-driven engineering, we have developed the attack tree metamodel (ATMM) with support for the many extended formalisms of attack trees, integrating most of the features of such extensions. This unified metamodel provides a common representation of attack trees, allowing easy transformations from and to the specific representations of individual tools such as ATCalc [2] and ADTool [12]. The metamodels for queries and schedules facilitate a userfriendly interface, obtaining relevant questions and presenting results without needing expert knowledge of the underlying analysis tool. We have presented our approach specifically for attack trees, but we believe it can be equally fruitful for different formalisms and tools as well (e.g. PRISM [24], STORM [9]) by using different metamodels and model transformations.

A key feature of the Diderichsen model is that it incorporates both social causation and social selection mechanisms within a common framework, across the life course. Importantly, the model also explicitly links the broader social environment to the causal pathway at the individual level and makes it clear that the social determinants of health are policy sensitive (Taylor-Robinson 2013).

Scenarios can also help detect unwanted consequences of actions, âblind spotsâ, or even contradictions in decisions or policy measures as well as dilemmas. The latter means different aims cannot be achieved simultaneously. As such, trade-offs between targets may exist. To give an example, intensification of farming that targets the enhancement of yields may contradict the aim of environment-friendly agriculture. The second aspect stems from the process of scenario building. Scenarios can capture only part of a complex system. The analysed system must be âsimplifiedâ by dispensing with irrelevant elements or reducing the complexity of interrelationships between elements to focus on those that provide knowledge for the intended aim. For example, in agricultural economics, model-based scenarios often exclude nonagricultural activities such as forestry (Balkhausen et al. 2008). However, a sine qua non for reducing the complexity is the awareness of what is considered relevant for a particular question and what is not. In this way, scenarios reduce complexity in a systematic and transparent manner to a cognitively measurable level. Specifically, the scenario-building process enables the systematic and targeted integration of different information types, i.e. findings and theses from different disciplines, as well as qualitative and quantitative data. In principle, scenarios also offer the possibility to integrate social objectives, norms or values in a transparent way (Kosow and GaÃner 2008). In cases where scenarios are developed in collaboration with stakeholders, they can serve as an integrative platform for players from different fields and thereby help structure topics and arguments. This can assist the parties involved in better understanding their respective positions or interests and working out priorities. It can also encourage them to discuss the subject matter in a long-term perspective (Havas 2014). Thus, scenarios have a communication function that should not be underestimated."
42,88,0.989,S-BPM in the Production Industry : A Stakeholder Approach,"3.3.1 Designing Industrial Workplaces in a Subject-Oriented Subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM) aims to provide simple tools for people when designing and improving their own workflows. As it has been successfully used in many ofï¬ce-based business processes such as credit applications and order processing (Konjack 2010; Nakamura et al. 2011; Walke et al. 2013), the addressed processes are predominantly virtualâthey are executed almost entirely within IT-based environments using various software tools such as SAP, Microsoft Ofï¬ce and email programs. As a result, business processes can be speciï¬ed without much information related to the physical, cultural or social environment in which they occurâthey can often be executed independently of the spatiotemporal location of the involved or concerned people. However, more detailed information about the context is crucial in the physical world of production processes where the spatial layout of workplaces in the factory, the artefacts and tools available, the work culture and the company values embody a speciï¬c way of working that may be different from the desired processes. Successful factory and workplace development creates a way of working that employees want to adopt. This can only be achieved once there is no mismatch between the planned interactions people are to perform to achieve their personal and company goals, and the actual interactions afforded by the peopleâs work context (Vilpola et al. 2006). What could an enhanced S-BPM methodology look like for improving workplaces considering both people-centred and economic aspects? One way to derive such a methodology is to examine existing approaches for each aspect and check whether they could contribute extending the current S-BPM methodology (cf. Table 3.2). Typical approaches for the two aspects include contextual design (emphasizing people-centred aspects) and value stream design (emphasizing economic aspects). However, we ï¬rst look at the existing S-BPM methodology. Its steps include (Fleischmann et al. 2012, p. 29ff): 1.

72,231,0.989,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion This chapter has explained how the notion of social innovation has helped to create a new focus on service and policy innovation in the public sector and has shown how collaboration â defined as the constructive management of difference â can drive public innovation. It has also explored the challenges that collaborative innovation poses to public leadership and management and delineated three important roles for public leaders and managers aiming to enhance collaborative innovation. Finally, it has shown that the further advancement of collaborative innovation is predicated on a shift from New Public Management to New Public Governance. Despite its importance and promise, the research on collaborative innovation is only in its infancy and further research is needed. Five top priorities for this future research agenda are clear. First, a combination of qualitative case studies and quantitative research is needed in order further to document the causal relationships between multi-actor collaboration and public innovation. Second, research should seek to explain why"

In conclusion, an educational model of big science is emerging, combining computational and inferential thinking in an integrated fashion, cementing conceptual understanding through direct experience with data (Data Sciences @ Berkeley 2015). This approach stems from a new emphasis on âbig dataâ, which can be traced back to the Fourth Paradigm book (Hey et al. 2009) and which is becoming more and more relevant with the growth and worldwide organization of big data repositories; I offered some examples of them in the biology sector. One big question which is left somehow opened is whether computing should be driven by models rather than by data; according to some opinion-makers and colleagues, traditional computer science models should be used when/if needed but no longer be the key foundational aspect of problem solving."

When such histories of relations eliminate novelty based on new information or innovation, then management becomes path dependent (David 1988; Arthur 1994; Page 2006), i.e., locked into previous decisions, and it loses the initiative to adapt to changes (Barnett et al. 2015). For example, if the history of investment in the science and technology of dam and dike infrastructure makes it unthinkable to open such barriers as part of managing for droughts or ï¬oods, this constricts the range of options for research and policy. It is as if the way forward for science or managers can only proceed along a narrow set of rails. These constraints hamper our attempts to experiment by moving laterally. This inertia from path dependence can be especially challenging for managers who seek to experimentally develop policies to address uncertainty arising from the dynamism of nature and/or society. In response to such challenges, decades of experimentation have produced a range of tools to engage these twin challenges and make decision-making and policy formulation more ï¬exible and comprehensive (Gunderson et al. 1995). This book reports on the opportunities afforded by these new approaches under the general rubric of adaptive management and governance."

Moreover, it takes into account the multiple conceptualizations of and claims over nature as part of a contested sphere, which we denominate âenvironmental governanceâ. The three parts of this book address the changing context, social interactions and institutional adaptations in contemporary natureâsociety relations in Latin America. Part I introduces the socioenvironmental context through a focus on the historical legacy of Latin American environmentalist thinking, the increasing pressure on the regionâs environment due to the global demand for its natural resources, and the rich ecological knowledge within local communities. These chapters set the stage to analyse the recent transformations of natureâsociety relations in the region. Part II addresses the politics of nature, raising issues related to the role of powerful actors â the state, elite and corporations â and their interactions in shaping discourses and practices regarding natural resource use. These processes are explored through the analysis of new policy models deployed by post-neoliberal governments, the role of new and old elites and their interactions, the narratives around the waterâenergyâmining nexus by contesting actors, and strategies for poverty alleviation. In Part III, new and emerging forms of environmental governance that tackle issues of participation, autonomy and environmental security are examined. The analysis of the implementation of REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), the controversial international compensatory scheme to prevent climate change, addresses how participatory mechanisms have become invited spaces of selected legitimized groups while the bottom-up initiatives of community-based autonomous economies and local consultations to mining projects that address the struggles for effective inclusion, wellbeing and justice emerged from resistance movements. In general, this volume aims to understand environmental governance in Latin America by looking into the ways in which historical legacies and current socioenvironmental contexts are driving new social interactions and institutional adaptations among multiple actors. The chapters cover a range of Latin American countries, mostly based on empirical data from multiple contexts, actors and production systems, and focus on transnational, national or subnational processes. Together they provide an overview of current regionwide trends, and a variety of themes and approaches to environmental governance, which feeds lively and sometimes heated debates in academia as well as in civil society and policy-making circles."

Models of such systems can be successfully mapped onto quite diverse âreal-lifeâ situations like the climate, the coherent emission of light from lasers, chemical reactionâdiffusion systems, biological cellular networks, the dynamics of stock markets and of the Internet, earthquake statistics and prediction, freeway trafï¬c, the human brain, or the formation of opinions in social systems, to name just some of the popular applications. Although their scope and methodologies overlap somewhat, one can distinguish the following main concepts and tools: self-organization, nonlinear dynamics, synergetics, turbulence, dynamical systems, catastrophes, instabilities, stochastic processes, chaos, graphs and networks, cellular automata, adaptive systems, genetic algorithms, and computational intelligence. The three major book publication platforms of the Springer Complexity program are the monograph series âUnderstanding Complex Systemsâ focusing on the various applications of complexity, the âSpringer Series in Synergeticsâ, which is devoted to the quantitative theoretical and methodological foundations, and the âSpringerBriefs in Complexityâ which are concise and topical working reports, case-studies, surveys, essays, and lecture notes of relevance to the ï¬eld.

The characteristics of organisations and interactions (relations) will serve as discriminating factors for providing a better understanding of certain types of social innovations. Thus, by expanding the level of analysis and by allowing for comparative analyses, the database can strengthen and build the existing links between social innovation and social transformation. In this way, it will allow for a thorough examination of a central assumption of CRISES, namely that room for innovation and experimentation widens when the macro-social regulations (market, state, collective agreements) are in flux. In such a context, micro-systems can serve as places from which to identify the processes in which new social patterns emerge. By building clusters (Schumpeter, 1932; Porter, 1990) and by institutionalising along different logics, they can form systems and eventually shape new national trajectories of growth (Hollingsworth and Boyer, 1997; Strange, 1996; Crouch and Streeck, 1996)."
245,201,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"According to the Field Force Theory, the social environment at the university and its salient level of intercultural competence is a state of equilibrium resulting from driving forces and restraining forces. Internationalization can be seen as the driving force aiming to progress the level of intercultural competence of its students. The restraining forces are possible organizational inertia (Hawanini 2011) or the lack of organizational capability to deliver on intercultural competence development (Gregersen-Hermans 2014). The pressure of the social environment and the need of an individual to ï¬t in with the dominant majority as a survival strategy in an unfamiliar environment may have functioned as a confounding variable and hindered intercultural competence development in terms of the IDI. Increasing the driving forces whilst not addressing the restraining forces proved not sufï¬cient to achieve a social environment in the university, which spurs intercultural competence development. Implication for university leaders is that strategies for internationalization need to include the identiï¬cation of constraining factors and measures to redress or diminish these. This study is based on a single case study so the results and conclusions have to be interpreted with caution. In this report the possible impact of previous experience abroad, language of instruction and nationality has not been included. The composition of the test group in terms of national background may be the result of an unintended selection bias caused by different patterns of mobility between Dutch, EU and non-EU students at the time of the research. Additional analysis needs to be undertaken. Furthermore, the assessment of the level of intercultural competence in this study relied on a single measure, the IDI. According to Deardorff and Jones (2012), for a more in-depth analysis of the level of intercultural competence a multiple assessment approach is essential. Future research on the impact of the social interactions on campus needs to take this into account. The study highlights the need for more in-depth research into the actual development process that is taking place in an internationalized university, be it inside the classroom or extracurricular; not only relying on self-reports of students, but combining qualitative assessment methods development with quantitative measurement of intercultural competence; and also considering the social context of the university environment and the organizational capability to deliver on intercultural competence development.

287,36,0.989,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"presentation by Lompscher (1975, p. 46) on the model interrelations between analytical and synthetic operations in mental activities was taken up by Bruder and BrÃ¼ckner (1989). According to this approach, identifying and realising mathematical contents can be described as elementary actions on the basis of deï¬ned mental operations. Empirical studies provide preliminary indications of evidence that these two elementary actions can be distinguished and also of basic actions of a more complex construction, such as describing and justifying each time in relation to given mathematical concepts, connections, or processes (see Nitsch 2015). Such a hierarchical approach to describing learning actions results in a heuristic construction for learning and test tasks (see the general approach to the task theory in Bruder 2003) which has already proven its worth in theoretical competence modelling. These action hierarchies are currently being used in a project aimed at describing the requirements for the central school-leaving examinations in Austria in a four-stage competence structure model for action dimensions in operating, modelling, and arguing (see Siller et al. 2015). Such a theoretical background was also used for the construction of items within the scope of the project HEUREKO on the empirical clariï¬cation of competence structures in a speciï¬c mathematical context, notably the changes of representation of functional relationships (see Nitsch et al. 2015). Boehm (2013) used basic positions of the activity theory to establish curricular objectives for mathematical modelling at Secondary Level I. The theoretical framework for the analysis of modelling activities that he elaborated allows for a differentiated model description of the action elements in mathematical modelling. This also includes the successful involvement and clariï¬cation of problem-solving activities in modelling. Mathematical problem-solving competence can be interpreted, from an activity theory angle, as variously pronounced mental agility where mental agility represents a marked process quality of thinking [see the construct of process qualities in Lompscher (1976)]. According to Lompscher (1972, p. 36), content and the progress of learning actions are decisive for the result. Bruderâs (2000) operating principle in acquiring problem-solving competence was that through the acquisition of knowledge about heuristic strategies and principles, insufï¬cient mental agility can partly be compensated. This approach was transferred to a teaching concept about learning how to solve problems in four stages building on each other, and the corresponding effects at student level have been empirically proven (Bruder and Collet 2009; Collet and Bruder 2008). Nitsch (2015) investigated typical difï¬culties of learning in changes of representation of functional relationships and interpreted these as incomplete orientation bases. Existing error patterns could be described as inadequate patterns. In this way, and in connection with the concept of basic ideas (Vom Hofe 1995), a tentative explanation is provided about mechanisms to activate certain mathematical (error-) ideas. In terms of orientation bases, there was a discussion in the 1970s both in the GDR and in a Western response by critical psychology about whether another type going beyond the ï¬eld orientation should be added to the previously mentioned"

97,130,0.989,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Cities are places and spaces of sustainability transitions: where solutions can be created, tested, and scaled (Coenen and Truffer 2012; Wolfram and Frantzeskaki 2016). In urban contexts, we found that actor configurations position themselves through practice and belief and often create new realities worth investigating in view of amounting unsustainability pressures. In our research we cast an eye on transition initiatives, actor collectives led by public, civic, business or partnerships of those, who put in place new ways of doing, thinking and organizing and transform current systems of provision with the aim to actively contribute to environmental sustainability. Understanding how these actor configurations play out with local governments, businesses and how they change the ârules of the gameâ in cities is a governance question upon which we reflect. Especially in view of how they can influence the pace of change to more sustainable practices, lifestyles and living in cities of the future (Romero-Lankao 2012). In recent years, sustainability transition studies have identified transition initiatives as the seeds of local transformation (Seyfang and Smith 2007; Seyfang et al. 2014) looking closely on the ways they create new practices, new narratives and understandings of sustainabilities as well as viewing how they transform infrastructure systems (Reeves et al. 2014). Civil society-led transition initiatives have been examined closely by scholars to assess their transformative potential, and it is the local understanding and local knowledge that civil society has that catalyzes the âtailoring to local contextâ and consequently leads to a fast-paced realization of new ideas and new approaches for more socially responsible governance (Aylett 2010, 2013, p. 869). Civil society can advocate for more radical and progressive ideas rather than âreturning to old idealsâ (cf. Calhoun 2012, p. 27). These characteristics of rapid experimentation adapted to the local context make civil society function as a driver of sustainability transitions (Boyer 2015; Burggraeve 2015; Bussu and Bartels 2014; Calhoun 2012; Carmin et al. 2003; Cerar 2014; Christmann 2014; Creamer 2015; Foo et al. 2015; Forrest and Wiek 2015; Fuchs and Hinderer 2014; Garcia et al. 2015; Kothari 2014; Magnani and Osti 2016; Seyfang and Smith 2007; Seyfang and Longhurst 2013; Seyfang et al. 2014; Touchton and Wampler 2014; Verdini 2015; Zajontz and Laysens 2015; Walker et al. 2014; Warshawsky 2014; Wagenaar and Healey 2015). When investigating how transition initiatives change urban space and urban systems of provision, we found that a great number of those initiatives put in place and experiment with solutions that restore nature, imitate and build upon nature processes as ways to address environmental issues in place-explicit ways, known as nature-based solutions. Nature-based solutions have been defined as living solutions"
147,24,0.989,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"2006; Tang, Kacmar, & Busenitz, 2012). Unsurprisingly, given its roots in cognitive psychology, most of this research has focused on individual-level characteristics (Baron & Ensley, 2006; Mitchell et al., 2002; Shane, 2000; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2005) or cognitive processes (Bryant, 2007; Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Cornelissen & Clarke, 2010; GrÃ©goire et al., 2010) when explaining how people detect, understand, and/or assess possible opportunities. Future research can extend this body of research as well as enhance our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena by taking a more interactive view of the entrepreneurial process and investigating how a community of inquiry influences the refinement of a possible opportunity and changes in the entrepreneurâs mind, how potential opportunities alter a community of inquiry, and how an evolving opportunity can lead to the mutual adjustment between the entrepreneurâs mind and the community of inquiry. Second, previous research has significantly deepened our knowledge of the outcomes (Bornstein, 2004; Dean & McMullen, 2007; Foss, Foss, Klein, & Klein, 2007; Roberts & Woods, 2005) and antecedents of entrepreneurial action (Krueger, 2007; McMullen & Shepherd, 2006; Meek, Pacheco, & York, 2010; Mitchell & Shepherd, 2010). Scholars can further complement this research by exploring the numerous sub-activities associated with a single entrepreneurial action. More specifically, by focusing on activity as the key unit of analysis, future research can extend the literature on nascent entrepreneurship that emphasizes the series of activities involved in new venture emergence (Delmar & Shane, 2004; Gartner, 1985; Lichtenstein, Carter, Dooley, & Gartner, 2007) rather than the solitary act of exploiting an opportunity. Such research will help separate entrepreneurial action into its basic sub-activities and elucidate the interrelationships between activities, between an activity (or sequence of activities) and an individualâs motivation to form an opportunity belief, and between an activity (or sequence of activities) and the knowledge needed to form an opportunity belief. With this research, scholars will be able to begin constructing a theory of the micro-foundations of entrepreneurial action. Third, research has already provided strong evidence of the role cognition plays in individualsâ execution of tasks essential to the entrepreneurial process, including identifying (e.g., Ardichvili, Cardozo, & Ray, 2003; Corbett, 2005; GrÃ©goire et al., 2010), assessing (e.g., Haynie, Shepherd, & McMullen, 2009; Keh et al., 2002), and acting on (e.g., Autio, Dahlander, & Frederiksen, 2013; Hmieleski & Baron, 2008; McMullen & Shepherd,"

These participants argued that different types of ârationalityâ should be considered more intensively when society makes decisions regarding science and technology issues. This controversy is associated with the previous point, of course. â¢ Prof. William Kastenberg raised an issue about âsafety cultureâ in the Japanese nuclear industry (see Chap. 9). He pointed out its weakness in light of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and its consequences, and suggested an explanation of the roots of this weakness based on cultural and historical differences between Western and Asian societies. He illustrated the importance of individualism when considering engineering ethics. This argument triggered much discussion regarding the character of social-scientific explanation and analysis of the root cause of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Some participants questioned Prof. Kastenbergâs theory. This contestation also extended the horizon of participantsâ perspectives on the mechanism behind the tragedy. â¢ Many participants also focused on the importance and difficulty of public and inter-expert communication during emergency situations (so-called âcrisis communicationâ). They described some dilemmas: timely information vs. well-confirmed information, simple and understandable explanation vs. detailed and correct explanation, controlled disclosure vs. unlimited disclosure, and so on. Participants realized the possible tough choices for engineers posed by those dilemmas. As we intended, no particular single conclusion was reached on these complex and difficult issues during this summer school. However, students reported that they conceptualized such dilemmas more sharply than they did before as a result of interactions with people who took different stances, brought different methodological perspectives, and held divergent opinions."

Its goal is not only elucidation of collective phenomena of self-driven particles, but also development of solutions for jam, which disrupts smooth flow. Dynamics of pedestrians, which has been vigorously studied in traffic engineering, architecture and psychology, is also one of the main research topic in Jamology. Pedestrians (self-driven particles) do not obey the law of action and reaction; therefore, Newtonian mechanics does not work effectively. Moreover, it is almost impossible to predict the movement of individual pedestrian in detail since he/she has own will. In spite of these difficulties, researchers have developed new theories and models [1, 2], and studied macroscopic collective behaviors of pedestrians when the destination of pedestrians is clear. Some solutions for ease congestion (jam) are also considered. In this paper, the author reviews the achievements of research on onedimensional unidirectional flow, egress (evacuation) process and queuing process. In congested unidirectional flow, slow rhythm improves pedestrian flow [3].

The proposal concerning awareness of the limits of scientific and technical abilities was formed through interdisciplinary discussions among the experts. Some readers of the SCJ report seem to have felt uneasiness with this proposal because this proposal apparently cast a scientific doubt on the feasibility of the geological disposal of HLW. To the authorâs understanding, this proposal is a rather general statement that there is no perfect scientific evidence to support the safety of HLW disposal for more than 10,000 years. Having heard the discussions related to this proposal, the author recognized there are many different academic approaches depending on the field of science. For example, natural scientists seek truths in natural phenomena, whereas engineers try to make things and/or systems that are valuable and acceptable for human society. HLW issues are related not only to various fields of science, but also to value systems shared by society. Here again, the author was convinced that we need to reflect more deeply on the relationship between science and society."

Second, the importance of face-to-face interactions is also supported by observations from other areas of decision-making, for example from the private business sector: Especially when it comes to complex decisions that require a significant amount of trust and/or involve decisions on resource allocation and distribution, actors rely on face-to-face meetings.1 Finally, various shortcomings of technically mediated forms of decision-making interactions have been identified, for example in the context of studies on online deliberation or protest movements.2 But although these studies support the idea that face-to-face interactions are of particular importance to political decision-making, they do not present answers to the core question: Why exactly do face-to-face interactions structure figurations of political decision-making in this way? And, furthermore, why might a changing media environment lead to a point at which they become more important? Following the concept of communicative figurations,3 a promising approach of empirical research that tries to find an adequate answer to these questions is a focus on the construction of relations within actor constellations. If one analyzes the micro-level of political interactions, and especially the micro-level of decision-making interactions, it is possible to identify typical sequences of interaction that constitute important relational structures within figurations of political decision-making. Furthermore, the micro-analysis of these typical sequences has implications for the meso-analysis of the political domain as a whole. This link becomes apparent if one takes a closer look at the way Norbert Elias introduces the concept of âfigurationâ: The network of interdependencies among human beings is what binds them together. Such interdependencies are the nexus of what is here called the figuration, a structure of mutually oriented and dependent people. Since people are more or less dependent on each other first by nature and then through social learning, through education, socialization, and socially generated reciprocal needs, they exist, one might venture to say, only as pluralities, only in figurations.

Moreover, it appears that entrepreneursâ prior knowledge plays an important role in the cognitive process of structural alignment that âconnects the known with the unknownâ and, in doing so, can facilitate opportunity recognition.

The next step involves stakeholder mapping and engagement to identify and gain consent on the study boundary, attributes, impact categories, identifying the ground rules of data mining and analysis and the need to use proxy data where this is required. In essence this step would include defining goal; scope and agreement on broad materiality and prioritization approach for the study. 2. Data gathering, expert insights and analysis: This step would include knowledge building through data mining, data analysis, data validation, expert interviews and stakeholder consultations. This step typically involves drawing together different evidence threads such as the findings from life cycle studies, input/ output analysis data, scientific research studies, product information, sales volumes/economic value and trade information, depending on the scale and scope of the study (e.g. whether the analysis is being done at the national, city, sector or product-category-level). 3.

170,326,0.989,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4 On Affect: A Prelude to Cybersex as Affective Labour The utility of affect is significant for its theoretical and practical reconsideration of the neoliberal subject (Paasonen 2011), giving expression to âa new configuration of bodies, technology, and matterâ (Clough and Halley 2007: p. 2). Central to theoretical perspectives on affect is âthe capacity to affect and to be affectedâ, which stems from Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinozaâs philosophy of ethics (Clough and Halley 2007; Clough 2010). This is the underlying logic that compels the moment preceding emotions and psychological states towards movement and action. Affect is not limited to feeling states; it encompasses forms of energies and forces that emanate from the body (Brennan 2004), as well as the bodyâs potentiality, capacities and consequences (Clough et al. 2007; Clough 2010). Approaches to affect are related but differ in their emphases and concerns (Seigworth and Gregg 2010), and we draw on three of these iterations. The first approach, drawing on thermodynamics, cybernetics and information theory, construes the individual as an organism whose affective capacities enable not only rational thought and action (Clough and Halley 2007) but also irrational, sometimes inconsequential states. Affect is a reservoir of potential matter and energy for determined and unintended actions, and often emerge as intensities (Hayles 1999; Hansen 2006; Massumi 2002; Clough and Halley 2007; Clough 2010; Gregg and Seigworth 2010). It also carries political possibilities or individual capacities for selforganizationâwhat may be referred to as âautopoiesisâ (Massumi 2002; Clough and Halley 2007). However, in an era of âintensified financializationâ, the productivity of affect is a constant struggle between its autonomy and commodification (Clough 2010: p. 219), bound up with forms of neoliberal biopolitics and the regulation of populations. Biopolitics here is defined as âthe extension of an economic rationality to all aspects of society, including life-itselfâ (Clough et al. 2007: p. 72)."
141,106,0.989,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"5 Interfaces in Evolving Cyber-Physical Systems-of-Systems Evolution of Cyber-Physical Systems-of-Systems (CPSoSs) concerns design modiï¬cations introduced into the interacting Constituent Systems (CSs) that are triggered by changes in the CPSoS environment. Changes of the CPSoS environment might include, for example, advances in technology, or are changes in societal or business needs. Often these needs originate from the desire to change a service towards increased efï¬ciency or the wish to introduce new services altogether. Ultimately, evolutionary changes to the design and consequently operation of the CPSoS should counteract obsolescence in order to keep the CPSoS relevant, increase its business value for involved stake holders, while not deteriorating already provided and still needed services. When discussing evolution in possibly large and complex systems like CPSoSs we distinguish between unmanaged and managed evolution [32]. In unmanaged evolution there is no guidance about how a CPSoS evolves. Owners of CSs are free to change services and cooperation with other CSs is motivated by each CS ownerâs own gain in perceived business value. Facebook, Wikipedia, Google services, and Twitter messaging are examples of CSs whose interfaces are controlled and evolved by the respective owning companies. The composition of such CSs is not driven by a speciï¬c central purpose and leads to virtual SoSs (e.g., Twitter/Facebook integration of ï¬tness tracking and training applications, or a clever integration of Wikipedia and Facebook to realize ï¬le-sharing services). Consequently, unmanaged evolution is most suitable for virtual SoSs where there is no clear central purpose. In this section we focus on the technical realization of managed evolution [32] which is most appropriate for collaborative SoSs (but also directed and acknowledged SoSs, see Chap. 1 for details about SoS classiï¬cations). Managed evolution has been originally suggested in the context of large, long-term operational software systems that also show many similarities with CPSoSs (complex functional, semantical, temporal, technical, and operational interdependencies of interacting systems with non-trivially replaceable legacy subsystems). In collaborative SoSs, managed evolution must be planned and supervised by an SoS authority, i.e., an organizational entity (for example established by a CPSoS consortium or enterprise), such that âthe efï¬ciency of developing and operating the system is preserved or even increasedâ [32]. The SoS authority has a speciï¬c CPSoS purpose in mind, maintains the speciï¬cations of Relied Upon Interfaces (RUIs), and has a set of capabilities in order to manage CPSoS evolution. The capabilities are: â¢ means to introduce changes into a CPSoS by ultimately modifying RUI speciï¬cations of CSs, â¢ monitor the evolutionary performance of the evolving CPSoS, and â¢ give incentives to steer the evolutionary process forward, i.e., influence CSs to implement modiï¬ed RUI speciï¬cations. In the following we discuss scope and challenges of managed evolution in time-aware CPSoSs and in particular investigate evolution at Relied Upon Interfaces (RUIs) of CSs. We attempt to conï¬ne risks associated with unexpected detrimental emergence and ï¬nally suggest a set of guidelines how to handle evolution in time-aware CPSoSs."
244,898,0.989,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","Chapelle et al. (2008, 2010) used the argument-based approach to analyze the validity of the TOEFLÂ® test in some detail and, in doing so, provided insight into the meaning of the scores as well as their empirical characteristics and value implications. In this work, it is clear how the emphasis in the original conception of construct validity (Cronbach and Meehl 1955) on the need for a program of validation research rather than a single study and Messickâs emphasis on the need to rule out threats to validity (e.g., construct-irrelevant variance and construct underrepresentation) play out in an argument-based approach to validation. Mislevy (1993, 1994, 1996, 2007) focused on the role of evidence in validation, particularly in terms of model-based reasoning from observed performances to more general claims about students and other test takers. Mislevy et al. (1999, 2002, 2003a, b) developed an ECD framework that employs argument-based reasoning. ECD starts with an analysis of the attributes, or constructs, of interest and the social and cognitive contexts in which they function and then designs the assessment to generate the kinds and amounts of evidence needed to draw the intended inferences. The ECD framework involves several stages of analysis (Mislevy and Haertel 2006; Mislevy et al. 1999, 2002, 2003a). The first stage, domain analysis, concentrates on building substantive understanding of the performance domain of interest, including theoretical conceptions and empirical research on student learning and performance, and the kinds of situations in which the performances are likely to occur. The goal of this first stage is to develop an understanding of how individuals interact with tasks and contexts in the domain. At the second stage, domain modeling, the relationships between student characteristics, task characteristics, and situational variables are specified (Mislevy et al. 2003a, b). The structure of the assessment to be developed begins to take shape, as the kinds of evidence that would be relevant to the goals of the assessment are identified. The third stage involves the development of a conceptual assessment framework that specifies the operational components of the test and the relationships among these components, including a student model, task models, and evidence models. The student model provides an abstract account of the student in terms of ability parameters (e.g., in an IRT model). Task models posit schemas for collecting data that can be used to estimate the student parameters and guidelines for task development. The evidence model describes how student performances are to be evaluated, or scored, and how estimates of student parameters can be made or updated. With this machinery in place, student performances on a sample of relevant tasks can be used to draw probabilistic inferences about student characteristics. The two dominant threads in these argument-based approaches to validation are the requirement that the claims to be made about test takers (i.e., the proposed interpretation and use of the scores) be specified in advance, and then justified, and that inferences about specific test takers be supported by warrants or models that have been validated, using empirical evidence and theoretical rationales. The argumentbased approaches are consistent with Messickâs unified framework, but they tend to focus more on specific methodologies for the validation of proposed interpretations and uses than did the unified framework."
169,18,0.989,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(Kagalou et al. 2012). Gari et al. (2015) conclude that two factors explain the widespread use of DPSIR, especially in the realm of policy-related science: â. . .it structures the indicators with reference to the political objectives related to the environmental problem addressed; and . . . it focuses on supposed causal relationships in a clear way that appeals to policy actors (Smeets and Weterings 1999).â However, the use of DPSIR has been complicated by discrepancies in its application, such as the placement of the same variables in different categories (Gari et al. 2015). As applied by the EEA (2003), the categories of the DPSIR framework are described as follows. Driving forces are created by the patterns of production and consumption that emerge from the intertwined social, demographic, and economic developments of society. These forces of societyâs metabolism drive the pressures that impact SES, e.g., emissions of chemical, physical, and biological substances and agents and shifts in land use and land cover. In response to these pressures, the state of an SES can shift physically (temperature), biologically (ï¬sh stocks), and/or chemically (atmospheric CO2, water column nitrogen). Impacts resulting from shifts in ecosystem state are reï¬ected in diminished functioning of the environment, e.g., lower human or ecosystem health, resource availability, and/or biodiversity. Any or all such impacts can precipitate responses to mitigate or adapt, which can emerge at the level of individuals and groups at different levels of organizations (Gari et al. 2015). Management decisions to hold steady or change course beneï¬t from precise measurements, but such choices grow out of many critical decisions that come beforehand. What should be measured, how, to answer what questions or policy dictates, and whose perspective should be included in the discussion? These are among a plethora of decisions that face river managers. With regard to measurements, who decides how to deï¬ne the space and time dimensions of the reference condition? What is the baseline in time against which one measures change (degradation or progress) in ecosystem properties? For example, radically different conclusions can be drawn from the number of salmon found in 2002 in the Northwestern US Columbia River basin depending on when one sets the baseline. The baselineâs date can inspire optimism (200% increase since 1930) or pessimism (90% decline since 1866) (Olson 2002). To shape sound research as well as policy, management must account for the false optimism inherent in such a shifting baseline syndrome (Pauly 1995), which can be reversed if management can integrate ecological restoration within the larger social context, restoring habitat connectivity, local ï¬sh populations, as well as local ï¬sheries (McClenachan et al. 2015). Constructive and effective engagement with these questions can help build a comprehensive overview and a ï¬exible approach that managers need to deal with uncertainty. However, the global decline of river socio-ecosystems reï¬ects a history of management that did not meet these challenges but defaulted to convention and tradition based on previous knowledge and historical relationships. Historically, river management regimes have evolved as complex webs of relationships that reinforce each other and create a momentum carrying them down a development path. In this way, a river system advances along a trajectory determined by complex feedbacks of interacting actors, policies, technologies, and concepts (Sendzimir et al. 2007)."

Chib et al. (2013a) highlight that rural doctors in China utilised both informal and formal networks to address their need for medical information, with informal guanxi networks compensating for the limitations of the formal healthcare information system. Yet another important dimension highlighting the informal versus formal dilemma is the traditional versus biomedical systems of medicine which coexist in a healthcare system. Studies have shown that traditional systems of medicine form an integral part of health-seeking behaviour of the patients, especially in developing countries, and that these systems are central aspects of the logic of care (Miscione 2007; Sujatha 2007). Indeed, many educated patients and intelligent therapists resort to alternative medicine in spite of the limited scientific and statistical support for effectiveness of such therapies (Beyerstein 2001). Nissen and Manderson (2013) map the changing attitude of the healthcare systems in various countries across the world towards CAM (complementary and alternative medicine). CAM is heterogeneous with several societies considering specific CAM as legitimate, for example, Ayurveda in India and Chiropractic in Australia (Nissen and Manderson 2013). The coexistence of these systems affects the healthcare delivery processes. Sachs and Tomson (1992), for example, in their study on drug utilisation among doctors and patients in Sri Lanka illustrate how the sociocultural norms about Ayurveda influenced the doctorâpatient interaction and drug usage. Policymakers and healthcare systems in several countries have started recognising the contribution of these systems of medicine in emphasising the logic of care, though the biomedical system proponents raise issues about the âlack of evidence baseâ in some of these systems. Telemedicine can complicate the already complex relationship between the traditional and biomedical systems of medicine interventions. CAM forms the usual recourse adopted by the patients, especially in the case of primary care in developing country contexts (Sujatha 2007; Shaikh et al. 2006). Telemedicine interventions that are largely restricted to the field of modern medicine emphasise biomedical conceptualisation of health, perpetuate the logic of choice by providing people with an alternative to their usual course of health-seeking in primary care, thus accentuating the conflict between the logic of care and logic of choice (cf. Merrell and Doarn 2012). Further, the technology itself can be perceived differently by the doctors as well as patients. For example, while doctors are more likely to perceive telemedicine from a formal perspective (e.g. technology as conduit of knowledge), the patients may perceive it as an informal channel for communication (such as appearing on a television screen). The doctor can also invoke formality or informality in a telemedicine encounter by verbal and non-verbal cues. The differential perspectives potentially invoked by the doctors and patient can complicate the interplay between the choice and care logic."

In [20], the presented SysML modeling approach allows the deï¬nition of the SoS structure and how to support dynamicity and evolution viewpoints by means of understanding the dis-alignment of a simulated SoS with respect to its requirements. Noteworthy, it is still missing a speciï¬c support to emergence, multi-criticality, dependability, security and time. The approaches presented in [3, 8] provide support to model the structure of an SoS and emergence by means of the extension to SysML diagrams. Analyses of the former models are conducted to provide evidence that requirements are fulï¬lled. The approach supports fault-handling (dependability viewpoint) and responsiveness (time viewpoint) of an SoS, but it does not provide any speciï¬c support to dynamicity, evolution and multi-criticality. The approach in [6], within the context of the DANSE EU project [4], supports the deï¬nition of an SoS structure, dynamicity and evolution (by means of Graph Grammars), emergence, etc., with the only exception of multi-criticality. DANSE presented a set of methodologies and tools to model and to analyze SoSs based on the Uniï¬ed Proï¬le for DoDAF and MoDAF (UPDM). In particular, DANSE focuses on the six models that can be represented as executable forms of SysML as partially reported in [6], according to a well-deï¬ned formalism to relate basics SoS concepts and their relationships. In the context of DANSE, the Goal Speciï¬cation Contract Language (GSCL) assures the achievement of dependability and security requirements and it guarantees the timely response of an SoS. All these approaches have shown the utility of adopting SysML formalisms to model architectural aspects of SoSs, thus supporting different types of analysis and a ï¬rst step towards executable artifacts which can be automatically derived. Although these approaches provide detailed insights for different viewpoints aspects, it is still missing (i) an homogeneous synthesis at a more abstract level of key design-related SoS concepts, and (ii) a viewpoint-based vision. Bringing this perspective in one single consistent reference model, it is possible to provide solutions to speciï¬c design problems while still keeping the required interconnections among viewpoints."

This type of survey is a standard approach in political sociology and empirical policy network studies (Henning 2009; Knoke et al. 1996; Pappi and Henning 1999; Pappi et al. 1995). In the first step of the policy network study, the set of relevant governmental and nongovernmental organizations (N ), the set of relevant policy concerns (z) and the set of relevant policy instruments (Î³), are identified via expert interviews and document analyses. In the second step of the policy network study, personal interviews will be conducted with all identified relevant organizations. Within the personal interview, policy network relations with other organizations, including political communication, are collected. Based on the stated network relations of all interviewed organizations, the corresponding global networks can be derived directly (Laumann and Knoke 1987; Henning 2009; Knoke et al. 1996; Pappi and Henning 1999; Pappi et al. 1995). Alternatively, an advanced econometric approach can be applied to estimate global network structures based on the stated network relations of the involved agents (Assmann et al. Chapter âThe Formation of Elite Communication Networks in Malawi: A Bayesian Econometric by Approachâ, Snijders 2002). This approach facilitates the identification of the underlying network-generating process and allows an adequate imputation of missing data. Moreover, this approach allows for the identification of determinants of the structure of policy networks and the identification of possible strategies for designing network structures that imply more efficient policy processes. Further, the stated policy preferences of organizations are collected. In the first stage, organizations state their relative interests (X) b Ã, with respect to identified policy concerns. In the and their preferred positions Ã°Z second stage, organizations state their relative interests (Îg) and preferred positions with respect to identified policies Ã°b Î³ Ã. Based on the stated policy positions of all relevant organizations, the underlying macro policies (Î³ P) can be identified as latent variables by conducting a principal component analysis (see below for details). The stated relative interest in policy concerns is used to specify the CobbâDouglas parameters of the individual support functions (Xi Â¼ [Xik])."

376,553,0.989,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","STMs evolved from the recognition that vegetation change was more complex than could be accounted for by succession alone, and could occur along numerous pathways, be discontinuous, and result in multiple stable states in the same environment. Conceptualizing vegetation as discrete states also provides a useful platform for tailoring management actions to the properties and possibilities associated with each state. For rangeland managers, the value of STMs resides both in their flexibility for organizing information and in their ability to foster a general understanding about how rangelands function. Progress toward developing rangeland STMs at a global level has been uneven due to several factors, including limitations of data and fiscal and personnel resources. As strategies to overcome these limitations are developed, the ultimate success of STMs as management tools will require careful attention to several topics. First, there should be a clear understanding of the characteristics of alternative states, including a reference state where such a concept is meaningful. Field sampling, synthesis of experimental results and long-term vegetation records, and participatory approaches are important resources for defining states. State characterization should ideally represent information on a variety of ecosystem services. In most cases, this will require coordinated sampling efforts to link variations in plant community states to empirical or model-based evaluations of habitat quality, soil carbon storage potential, and value for livestock, for example. Second, STMs should attempt to distinguish transient dynamics from state transitions. Evidence-based approaches necessitate clear statements not only about drivers of transition but also about the controlling variables and processes constraining recovery and timelines for ecosystem change. STMs should feature logical and testable statements about how states will respond to management, such that STMs can support experimentation, quantitative models, and eventual revision. Even where data are scarce, local knowledge can be framed as testable propositions. Predictions regarding the effects of climate change on ecosystems may best be addressed at a regional scale, but information on the impact of past extreme events can be highlighted. Strategies to manage alternative states, such as through novel uses of states invaded by woody plants, may help with climate adaptation over the longer term."

Green 1952; Harman 1967; Lord and Novick 1968; Tucker 1955). Exploratory factor analysis makes it possible to represent the relationships (e.g., correlations or covariances) among observed scores on a set of assessments in terms of a statistical model describing the relationships among a relatively small number of underlying dimensions, or factors. The factor models decompose the observed total scores on the tests into a linear combination of factor scores, and they provide quantitative estimates of the relative importance of the different factors in terms of the variance explained by the factor. By focusing on the traits as latent dimensions or factors or as some composite of more basic latent factors, and by embedding these factors within a web of statistical relationships, exploratory factor analysis provided a rudimentary version of the kind of nomological networks envisioned by Cronbach and Meehl (1955). The utility of exploratory analyses for explicating appropriate interpretations of test scores was enhanced by an extended research program at ETS to develop sets of reference measures that focused on particular basic factors (Ekstrom et al. 1979; French 1954; French et al. 1963). By including the reference tests with a more broadly defined trait measure, it would be possible to evaluate the factor structure of the broadly defined trait in terms of the reference factors. As in other areas of theory development, the work done on factor analysis by ETS researchers tended to grow out of and be motivated by concerns about the need to build assessments that reflected certain traits and to evaluate how well the assessment actually reflected those traits. As a result, ETSâs research on exploratory factor analysis has involved a very fruitful combination of applied empirical studies of score interpretations and sophisticated theoretical modeling (Browne 1968; French 1951a, b; Harman 1967; Lord and Novick 1968). A major contribution to the theory and practice of validation that came out of research at ETS is confirmatory factor analysis (JÃ¶reskog 1967, 1969; JÃ¶reskog and Lawley 1967; JÃ¶reskog and van Thillo 1972). As its name indicates, exploratory factor analysis does not propose strong constraints a priori; the analysis essentially partitions the observed-score variances by using statistical criteria to fit the model to the data. In a typical exploratory factor analysis, theorizing tends to occur after the analysis, as the resulting factor structure is used to suggest plausible interpretations for the factors. If reference factors are included in the analysis, they can help orient the interpretation. In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a factor model is specified in advance by putting constraints on the factor structure, and the constrained model is fit to the data. The constraints imposed on the model are typically based on a priori theoretical assumptions, and the empirical data are used to check the hypotheses built into the models. As a result, CFAs can provide support for theory-based hypotheses or can result in refutations of some or all or the theoretical conjectures (JÃ¶reskog 1969). This CFA model was extended as the basis for structural equation modeling (JÃ¶reskog and van Thillo 1972). To the extent that the constraints incorporate theoretical assumptions, CFAs go beyond simple trait interpretations into theory-based construct interpretations."
177,15,0.989,Assessment in Mathematics Education : Large-Scale Assessment and Classroom Assessment,"This section explores assessment design as it relates to two broad issues: â¢ The development of assessment tasks that reflect the complexity of mathematical thinking, problem solving and other important competencies. â¢ The design of alternative modes of assessment in mathematics (e.g., online, investigations, various forms of formative assessment, etc.) (Suurtamm and Neubrand 2015, p. 562). In so doing, we consider different examples of what we know about the design of assessments and assessment tasks. An extensive discussion of design issues of mathematics tasks can be found in the study volume for ICMI 22 on Mathematics Education and Task Design (Watson and Ohtani 2015)."

As previously stated, the assessment phase serves to deï¬ne the management challenge and identify which factors may be involved in its genesis or in any solution(s). How factors are assessed depends both on mental models and goals held by individual stakeholders as well as the model(s) of the problem developed by the group. The process of building a model of the problem that is understandable and acceptable to the group offers a chance to clarify what goals and mental models are being used by individuals. If those are ignored, there is a good chance that efforts to reform policy or encourage the adoption of new innovative policies may be rejected by stakeholders. This highlights the importance of sustaining the learning process long enough to achieve such clariï¬cation. This deeper level of learning, e.g., doubleloop learning, involves probing the decision-making process itself and how social and institutional relations and stakeholder perspectives inï¬uence it (Torbert et al. 2004; Argyris 1976, 2005; Argyris and SchÃ¶n 1978; Williams 2011).

Even though internal platforms for crowdfunding in which only researchers can donate to a project proposal may develop faster, it is conceivableâas with the peer review in traditional fundingâthat mainstream research is favored. Some also suspect that crowdfunding, but also social payments, could establish a disproportionate preference of applied research over basic research (Giles 2012, p. 253). The same could also be suspected for popular science or science that lends itself easily to media portrayal. Crowdfunding, social payments, and virtual currencies place new demands on researchersâ self-marketing (Ledford 2012), but these demands need not be a bad thing, since a clear, succinct, and understandable presentation of a project proposal can only enhance and augment the verifiability and testability of scientific concepts by eliminating the dense prose and difficult wording found in many funding applications (language that is often mandated by fundersâ requirements), thus promoting the intersubjective verifiability of scientific concepts called for by science theory and philosophy of science. A more solid grounding in the scientific community might be achieved if crowdfunding, social payments and virtual currencies were not applied in entirely open contexts, but rather only within scientific communities (if necessary under the umbrella of discipline-specific associations or learned societies). In such a scenario, however, the aspect of involvement of civic society would be lost."
161,222,0.989,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"individual vulnerabilities (fear of being identiï¬ed as HIV-positive). Requiring information about the HIV status of oneâs partner was compounded by the cultural communicative practice of shared mobile phone usage, creating a sociocultural vulnerability for women residing in deeply patriarchal societies, and rendering the program as potentially harmful as opposed to beneï¬cial. The Pakistani case study (Chap. 2) conjectures that mediated interpersonal and mass media based campaigns be employed as micro- and macro-communicative strategies, but would gain considerable credibility if these recommendations were to be supported with empirical evidence linking these strategies to the sociocultural vulnerabilities presented. Further, these recommendations could be considerably strengthened were the analysis to be based on deliberation of the impact of the performance indicators identiï¬ed. We can commend the attempt to utilize methodological pluralities to address the sensitive sociocultural issues identiï¬ed. The relative strength of these communication tools (organic mobile-based strategies of individual actors vs. planned interventions, whether mobile-based or delivered via traditional mass media) can, allied with sophisticated and rigorous analysis, certainly provide context to policymakers. The case studies from Indonesia and China provide us a rich evidence base to discuss sociocultural contexts across a number of dimensions. First, I shall continue to develop the particular dimension of gender as a key sociocultural dimension in Asia, elaborating on the patriarchal constraints identiï¬ed. However, rather than merely considering this a barrier to the successful translation of mHealth introduction to public health outcomes, I advance the notion of technology appropriation as both a determinant of success (as articulated in health indicators) as well as a social outcome. Second, when arguing for the importance of sociocultural context, it is equally important to advance theoretical frames that are themselves driven from the ground up. To do so, I situate the learnings from the volume chapters within existing literature in the mHealth ï¬eld. First, it is hardly a coincidence that multiple chapters encounter the issue of gender inequality as a determinant of mHealth success. In particular, in Chap. 4, Pitaloka situates diabetes management via mobile communication within the context of gender empowerment and autonomy. In this case study, diabetic women in two rural Javanese villages have taken to using SMS as an alternative to diabetes apps, communicating with local health providers through their mobile phones, calling or texting them for help and advice regarding their health conditions, and receiving self-care reminders. As a consequence, texting seems to have become a practice and routine for diabetic self-management. It is worth noting that agency and autonomy are complex phenomenon, and contested terms, in relation to gender and empowerment, thus require sensitive and meticulous elaboration (Nguyen, Chib, & Mahalingam, 2017). Pitaloka suggests that beyond traditional domestic roles, rural Javanese women, being petty traders, gain self-reliance as ï¬nancial managers for the family. In addition, these women actively engage in public matters, particularly those related to religion. This vision of gender autonomy is interesting as mobile communicative practices reveal usage mediated by males, alongside a reinforcement of traditional gender roles amid"
147,49,0.989,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"ronment. In line with our comments earlier regarding the unique domain of entrepreneurship, although discussions about the specific definitions of âsocial entrepreneurship,â âsustainable entrepreneurship,â and âenvironmental entrepreneurshipâ are stimulating (as an example, see a review of multiple definitions of social entrepreneurship by Zahra, Rawhouser, Bhawe, Neubaum, & Hayton, 2008), these discussions should not become a perpetual debate that restricts or destroys interesting research because a study does not correspond to a pre-specified category of âsustainable,â âsocial,â or âenvironmentalâ entrepreneurship. By being more flexible about the boundaries of topics within the entrepreneurship field, we provide the space for scholars to explore these themes more freely, thus opening up the field to contributions that can expand our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena (which, over time, might also converge into a commonly accepted definition of the field of interest). Compassion Organizing Positive psychology research has improved our understanding of how to alleviate peopleâs suffering (e.g., Dutton, 2003; Dutton, Workman, & Hardin, 2014; Dutton et al., 2006; George, 2013; Kanov et al., 2004; Lilius et al., 2008). A subset of this research has studied compassion organizing, âa collective response to a particular incident of human suffering that entails the coordination of individual compassionâ and recognizes that the structures and routines an organization uses for normal work can be repurposed to alleviate a memberâs suffering (Dutton et al., 2006, p. 62). Suffering, or âthe experience of pain or loss that evokes a form of anguish that threatens an individualâs sense of meaning about his or her personal existenceâ (Dutton et al., 2006, p. 60; see also Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), can be caused by a number of factors, such as personal tragedies, work-related events, and disasters (Armstrong, 2011; Frost, 2003; Rynes, Bartunek, Dutton, & Margolis, 2012). Organizations are particularly well positioned to respond compassionately to member suffering. More specifically, through existing relationships with organizational members, organizations are able to collectively identify a memberâs suffering, feel that memberâs pain, and respond by repurposing current routines to lessen that memberâs suffering (Dutton et al., 2006; Kanov et al., 2004; Lilius, Worline, Dutton, Kanov, & Maitlis, 2011; Rynes et al., 2012). While much research has already been done on compassion organizing, scholars can add to and expand positive organizational research to"
77,14,0.989,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"The Added Value of the Life Course Perspective to the Analysis of Health Developed in the social sciences in the 1960s, life course research represents a major shift in the study of human life. It aims at analysing human development throughout the lifespan, considering together processes originally examined separately (Elder 1998; Featherman and Lerner 1985; Sapin et al. 2014). The comprehensive approach of the life course perspective offers important insights with specific relevance for the study of health trajectories, as will be described in this section. The notion of time is central to the life course perspective. As human development and ageing are life-long processes, research in this domain extends across the successive segments of life or life stages: âdifferent periods across the life course influence phases of biological development, stability or declineâ (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002, p. 286). Contrasting but interwoven aspects of time can influence health trajectories, in particular individual ageing and social change. Individual ageing is associated with biological development and decline and with successive social life stages. Research documents âstandardâ trajectories and identifies factors associated with deviations from normal paths (non-normative trajectories). In parallel, social change determines specific life conditions since exposure to different risks is time-associated (Wadsworth 1997). Behaviours change over historical time, as for example with smoking patterns: âit is possible to be born into a period of high prevalence of parental smoking and to have lived middle life in a time of much reduced likelihood of smokingâ (Wadsworth 1997, p. 864). Patterns of infectious illnesses vary over historical periods of time, as a result of contagion or vaccination. Transformations in medical care and efficacy of treatment also intervene, including the growing capacity to detect diseases earlier in life than before. Changes in policy for example regarding education and in social norms such as those illustrated by the increasing rate of divorce are also time-dependent (Wadsworth 1997). The chapter"
60,48,0.989,Research on Teaching and Learning Probability,"This does not mean, however, that the field does not continue to look to other domains of research to help better inform mathematics education. For example, recent investigations (e.g., Chernoff 2012a, b) have gone back to their proverbial roots and integrated recent developments to the heuristics and biases program, which attempts to deal with the âarrested development of the representativeness heuristic in the field of mathematics educationâ (Chernoff 2012a, p. 951). Similar investigations embracing research from other fields have opened the door to alternative views of heuristics, intuitions, and learning difficulties, such as in the work by Gigerenzer and the Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) Group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin (e.g., Gigerenzer et al. 2011). Based on these developments, the field of mathematics education is starting to also develop particular research which is building upon and questioning certain aspects of probabilistic intuitions and learning difficulties. For example, Chernoff, in a recent string of studies (e.g., Chernoff 2012a, b; Chernoff and Zazkis 2011), has begun to establish that perhaps normatively incorrect responses to a variety of probabilistic tasks are best accounted for not by heuristics or informal reasoning, but rather participantsâ use of logical fallacies. In considering how students reason about probability, advances in technology and other educational resources have allowed for another important area of research, as described in the next section."

223,356,0.989,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Theoretical Framework Some work has been done in this direction (Baldry, 1999; Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007; Ford & Harding, 2004; Friedman, 2011; Kornberger & Clegg, 2004; Meusburger, 2009; Taylor & Spicer, 2007; Woodward & Ellison, 2010). A review of the growing literature on space in organization studies found the field fragmented but identified three principal streams, each with interesting contributions and shortcomings (Taylor & Spicer, 2007). In one stream scholars conceive of space in terms of distance and proximity between points and have convincingly demonstrated how space makes a difference for important issues at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels. However, they are âunable to account for the ways in which actors attribute meaning and significance to a space â¦ [and] not able to explain the role which perceptions or experiences of distances and proximity playâ (p. 329). In another stream researchers compensate for this weakness by focusing on the materialization of powerâbut it is questionable âwhether all spaces are necessarily manifestations of powerâ (p. 332). Furthermore, such a focus implies a âsystematic disregard of the ways that space may actually be the product of inhabitantsâ ongoing experience and understandingsâ (p. 333). Scholars in the third stream attend to this gap by exploring âhow spaces are produced and manifest in the experiences of those who inhabit themâ (p. 333). The inherent disadvantages are that power relations are overlooked and that the emphasis on perception undervalues the material, physical aspects of space. Logically, therefore, Taylor and Spicer argue for an integrated approach that addresses all three dimensions by building on the ideas of Lefebvre (1974/1991), who sought to bring together mental, physical, and social modalities of space (see also Ford and Harding 2004, p. 817). Although we agree that an integrated approach is needed, this particular proposal does not take some essential concepts into account. Strikingly absent from the organizational literature on space is the work on social space by two of the twentieth centuryâs most influential, and nonconventional, social scientists, the psychologist Kurt Lewin (1936, 1948/1997, 1951/1997) and the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1985, 1989, 1993, 1998; Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Both placed social space as the cornerstone of their theoretical and methodological work, turning to the philosophical work of Ernst Cassirer (1923/1953, 1944, 1961), who conceived of space in rather relative terms as the positional quality of the material world. Cassirer, Lewin, and Bourdieu adopted the view that there is no empty space, only spaces that are formed by and between objects, and they applied this concept to the creation of social reality rather than to the physical world. At the heart of social space is a relational logic of social reality, which focuses neither on the individual nor the group as the unit of analysis but rather on the processes through which individuals, in interaction with others, construct their social spaces and identities (Friedman, 2011). These interactions are causal loops that link the ways people bring their thinking and feeling into the world through action, to"
49,236,0.989,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"Figure 22. A diagrammatic outline of relationship between connectionism and symbolism in interpretations of cognitive activities of human brain. An interpretative efficiency of this diagram consists in theorems proved by S. Kleene and N. Chomsky [2,8], which state that each neural network is equivalent to a finite state machine, and vice versa. It means that going from bottom to up, we look for symbolic correlates of neural activities. Reversely, going from up to bottom, we look for connectionist correlates for symbolic notions. Henceforth, we may say that between connectionist and symbolic approaches for a study of cognitive activities there doesnât exist an exclusive disjunction. The main criterion of inclusion of the first or second approach consists in an effectiveness and easiness of study of cognitive activities. Recently, there is used a compromise solution that higher level activities are considered on symbolic level (though there exist good connectionist models), whereas low level cognitive activities are considered on connectionist level. For completeness, we mention that D. Gabbay published a seminal book Neural-Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning (Springer, 20008) in which he and his coworkers demonstrated connectionist approaches based on neural networks for a study of logical reasoning."
72,35,0.989,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"state structures can also drive disruptive social innovation by focussing on reforming democracy and enlarging or deepening citizensâ roles within it. Social innovation can also be defined in terms of the level of its action or impact from the individual to the systems level (micro-, meso- or macrolevel). Such levels or dimensions can be mapped against the two main definitions of social innovation focused either on new social processes or on new social outcomes (see Table I.2). These differing levels of impact point to the complexity of performance measurement on social innovation and emphasise the need for clarity about the unit of impact of a social innovation. Social innovation can also be considered in the context of the more institutionalised fields of social entrepreneurship (Dees, 1998; Nicholls, 2006) and social enterprise (Alter, 2006; Nyssens, 2006). In this setting, social innovation can be seen as the biggest field of"

Secondly, previous experiments on North American rivers, e.g., the Columbia River basin, the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin river basin and delta in California (Johnson 1999), have proven very costly in terms of time and money invested as well as the institutional complexities that had to be harmonized (Richter et al. 2006). In these cases the process entailed multiple layers (executive, manager, and technical) of decision and review (Walters et al. 2000) and was agitated by the levels of sociopolitical controversy surrounding the signiï¬cant economic trade-offs at hand (Richter et al. 2006). If success requires years of sustaining such effort, many might opt for less costly approaches. Finally, despite some exceptions (Allan and Stankey 2009), there are few, convincing success stories in AMâs history of risky and costly experiments (Lee 1999; Medema et al. 2008). One reason may be that often success is hard to detect when clear thresholds are difï¬cult to establish and measure (van Wilgen and Biggs 2011), though adaptive learning successfully developed ï¬ow thresholds on the Letaba (Pollard et al. 2009) and Kissimmee (Toth et al. 1998) rivers. Another reason is that no history of successfully repeated experiments can be built on the basis of contradictory deï¬nitions or applications of AM (Allen et al. 2011). The slow adoption of AM can broadly be explained by path dependence on conventional, control-centered management strategies. A variety of factors can contribute to this: funding and administrative priorities based on reactive rather than proactive management paradigms (Walters 1997), failure to identify or address the potential to shift goals to acknowledge the increased risk of surprise because of social sources of uncertainty (Tyre and Michaels 2011), defaulting to extant institutional norms rather than reï¬ecting, box-ticking as opposed to learning and favoring competition over cooperation (Allan and Curtis 2005), and resource limitations in terms of funding and human capital. The novel capacities that AM requires of any river manager would be a major barrier to adoption. These capacities include developing new ways for managers and stakeholders to collaborate under high uncertainty, especially in integrating science and policy in participatory processes, considering a wide range of practices over long time periods projected in future scenarios (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007). As opposed to direct administration of agency employees, managers might have to patiently attend to repeated phases of social learning by the community in implementing and then sustaining new and innovative management approaches (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007)."

As a process rural design brings science to society and in doing so it can identify new research questions (Fig. 4.6). The 2014 International Conference on Peri-Urban Landscapes: Water, Food and Environmental Security was an exciting opportunity to dialogue about connections and how science and society can more fully interact for social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The authors of this book chapter believe that the Second International Symposium on Rural Design being planned to be held in Australia in the near future (the ï¬rst was held at the University of Minnesota in January 2010) can be an important follow-up to provide a strong evidence-based argument for political and policy changes impacting urban expansion at national, state, regional, and local levels in Australia and worldwide.

92,164,0.989,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Recognizing the value of understanding the interconnectedness and interactions of global health, the PINGH structure facilitates approaches for developing and fostering institutional relationships and collaborative research agendas. Although most projects were developed within the context of a PINGH meeting, they all expanded to reach out to global partners who may or may not have been at meetings. The goal is to create a project or research agenda that focused on an idea or universal health need. Conversations which formed the basis of these projects seemed to be done with the disposition of including multiple voices and perspectives. Participants and organizers approached their project with a sense of urgency and an understanding of their potential role in creating awareness of challenges that exist within areas of global health such as data collection methods, transparency of data, or improving the understanding in an evidence based material. Additional features of these projects leaned towards the role and importance of faculty in fostering global educational experiences for students, challenging the status quo of student learning beyond the traditional Western models of thinking and learning, and developing bilateral partnerships between students and emerging and experienced faculty. The framework of PINGH enabled faculty and staff to consider conceptual frameworks that pressed learning environments to take place in both the Global North and South. Feasibility and specifications of learning sites and the relationship between these sites and selected social and global health trends aided in fostering these relations between countries. The inclusion of the north-south connection was not without challenges such as language barriers or understanding of cultural values and norms that impacted healthcare systems. But at the very least, participants were exposed to a different way of being and were able to co-construct knowledge with a diverse set of colleagues who held different sets of ideologies and systems. The merit of these relationships was due to actions and behaviors that supported the engagement of individuals across and within various institutions and countries. Most notable were: 1. Conferences and workshops within multiple settings (US and abroad) (a) Discussion of ideas and potential projects took place in these settings (b) Training of emerging researchers and fostering support for all participants (c) Networking opportunities 2.

344,502,0.989,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"hand, the ability of stakeholder participations to increase the incentives for responsible politicians to implement policies that favor the interest of the general public is questionable. On the other hand, economic modelling is often criticized by political practitioners as a purely academic exercise that fails to provide practical tools for understanding or designing optimal real-life economic processes (Geurts and Joldersma 2001). Accordingly, scholars promote participatory policy analysis that is characterized by an interaction between economic theory and political praxis to combine the âobjectiveâ knowledge derived from economic theories and empirical data with the âsubjectiveâ knowledge of stakeholder organizations as political practitioners (Durning 1993; Joldersma 1997; Geurts and Joldersma 2001). Moreover, inadequate communication between scientific policy analysts and political actors is proposed to be a principal cause of the limited impact of research on policymaking. For example, the âutilization of knowledge schoolâ emphasizes the fact that policy analysts and policymakers live in two separate communities (Geurts and Joldersma 2001). Hence, to become more efficient, the relationship between scientific experts and policy actors must be redefined. For example, Duke (1974) discusses the role of the interaction between scientific experts and political practitioners within the theoretical perspective of policy learning. In this context, we suggest the evolutionary Computable General Political Economy Equilibrium Model (eCGPE) as a quantitative approach to modeling and evaluating policy processes. In contrast to standard political economy approaches that focus on political incentive problems and have primarily ignored imperfect political knowledge as a source of inefficient development policies (for example, see Persson and Tabellini 2000), the CGPE approach explicitly allows a quantitative assessment of the impact of both imperfect political incentives and imperfect political knowledge. While the theoretical CGPE approach has already been introduced in the chapter âModeling and Evaluation of Political Processes: A New Quantitative Approachâ this chapter provides an empirical application of the CGPE approach to the case of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) reform in Malawi. CAADP reform in Malawi is a good case in point. First, despite some positive trends, high levels of poverty, poor health, malnutrition and hunger continue to plague Malawi. Second, while it is commonly agreed that these disappointing outcomes are caused in large part by suboptimal public policies, the causes of the continuing failure of the Malawi government to provide optimal public policies remain unknown. Is the Malawi government unwilling to implement the right policies due to biased political incentives or is the government simply unable to implement effective policies due to inadequate political knowledge? For example, by adopting CAADP, the Malawian government, in agreement with the governments of 21 other African countries, committed to a strong role of agriculture in economic development. The pursuit of a 6% annual growth rate in agriculture via the allocation of at least 10% of public resources to the agricultural sector is one of the main principles of CAADP. However, although there is a general agreement among African development specialists that any poverty reduction strategy in Africa must consider rural development and incomes, the role of agriculture in African development is controversial (Brzeska et al. 2012). First, the optimal allocation of public"
346,33,0.989,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","history teaching is used as a way to achieve conflict transformation aims supported by various international organizations: Council of Europe, UNESCO and OECD (Bentrovato, Chap. 2). The contribution of various local and international NGOs like EUROCLIO has been instrumental in this effort (Bilali and Mahmut, Chap. 3; McCully and Reilly, Chap. 12). However, not all efforts towards reconciliation have treated history teaching with respect for critical historical enquiry since some postconflict societies following the early example of the franco-German textbook decided simply to delete from textbooks offensive sentences or material (e.g. BaH) or harmonizing conflicting narratives through a process of political negotiation which was the result of a political compromise rather than that of critical enquiry. In some cases they even decided to promote a nation building approach, by writing up a single authoritative narrative; this is the case of Rwanda where the government enforced a new, hegemonic narrative of past events, applying a narrow understanding of what is to be taught. This narrative promotes the concept of âRwandannessâ, emphasizing the nationâs alleged primordial unity and dismissing ethnic identities as a historically unfounded colonial invention that was supposedly the primary cause of genocide in Rwanda (Bentrovato, Chap. 2). Despite the epistemological weaknesses of single-narrative approaches, there is an emerging realization that common history textbook commissions (korostelina and LÃ¤ssig 2013), provided they respect the principles of cultivating historical thinking skills, can indeed produce valuable textbooks or supplementary teaching material. Moreover, probably the most significant contribution of joint textbook commissions is the performative and transformative aspects of the co-operative writing up itself (Pingel, Chap. 9). This is only expected from the social psychological and wellestablished paradigm of prejudice reduction through intergroup contact (Allport 1954; Brown and Hewstone 2005; Tausch et al. 2010) given its potential to deconstruct negative stereotypes, facilitate perspective taking and forgiveness, reduce threat and intergroup anxiety, and more importantly build trust. It could be claimed that depending on the implicit lay social psychological theories of change or practice, and conflict transformation processes held by both practitioners in civil society (Bilali and Mahmut, Chap. 3) variations in the strategies followed to tackle representations of the past can also be expected at the level of civil society initiatives."

Public resources are not used much, not even by small firms, thus currently they do not represent a factor in balancing the gap. Governments provide some training opportunities, but these are not used much. However, the data on access to publicly supported programs do not assess the quality and design of these policies and programs. In other words, it is not clear whether these programs address the right problems, whether their design is coherent with a correct diagnosis of the factors hindering enterprise performance in LAC, or indeed, whether the quality of policy design is responsible for much of the success and failure of many policies in the region. For many years, the priority given to macroeconomic reforms has shifted interest away from the microeconomic dimension in LAC, leading many governments to place microeconomic concerns further down the policy agenda. Therefore, while the consensus on the appropriate macroeconomic policies is widespread, the variety and the ongoing experimentation with many different microeconomic policies reveal that the issue is far from being settled. A better understanding of the factors that foster firm performance is increasingly important for policy design and implementation. This book offers new insights here. The book also points to further research in several areas that could not be analyzed here. The list is long and far from being complete, but it would include more analyses focused on the services sector and on different subsectors (e.g. high- versus low-tech manufacturing), complementary research on the informal sector that is so relevant in Latin America, deeper analyses of GVCs and the constraints on their integration, and the role of complementarities in factors affecting performance (e.g. human capital, organizational innovations, and ICT adoption). New methods could be used to address the issue of dispersion and heterogeneity in productivity (e.g. quantile regressions), as well as panel data to add a time dimension to these analyses.

10,22,0.989,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"context with a normative foundation (summary from Bressers 2011: 25; based on Kooiman 2003: 4). Government is thus no longer the sole decision-maker, and allows for direct influence of other parties. The advantages of this are numerous, for instance greater support from stakeholders, higher quality of work as a result of expert and layman input, and greater legitimacy of decisions (van Schie 2010: 33; Termeer 2009: 300). Another effect of the shift to governance is the increase in organizational adaptivity (Teisman 2008: 358). Flexibility and changeability are more included from the start onwards in decision-making processes. At the same time, the inclusion of other stakeholders besides government is not risk-free. Accountability is a real issue when decision-making is shared (Koliba et al. 2011: 35â36; van Kersbergen and van Waarden 2004; SÃ¸rensen and Torï¬ng 2005). Furthermore, some stakeholders are more vocal than others, which might result in an unrealistic representation of some interests above others. Water governanceâdrought governance being a part of thatâconcerns the same multi-actor approach in the ï¬eld of water. For water, governance is very important, because water is a complex and highly interconnected system which touches upon many others domains and ï¬elds such as agriculture, economic development, social development, ecology and health (Edelenbos et al. 2013: 2). This means many stakeholders are involved, each with very different stakes (Leach and Pelkey 2001; Kuks 2004). In such a ï¬eld it is almost impossible to realize change in just a top-down hierarchical manner. Rather, more bottom-up, horizontal and multi-stakeholders approaches are required (Edelenbos et al. 2013: 2). Especially in the light of the fact that even though numerous methods and technologies exist to solve water problems such as water pollution, water supply and water surpluses, it is highly noteworthy that implementation is often still lacking. That has led some to argue that not a lack of water technology is what causes the current âwater crisisâ (UNDP 2013: iv) but rather a lack of water governance (UNESCO 2006). Perhaps as a result of that, water governance is an upcoming theme in the ï¬eld of public administration (Edelenbos et al. 2013; de Boer et al. 2013; Edelenbos and Teisman 2011; Teisman and Edelenbos 2011; Bressers and Lulofs 2010; Huitema et al. 2009; Kampa 2007; Pahl-Wostl 2007; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2005; Kuks 2004). The rationale for the shift from government to governance is the fact that awareness has increased that monocentric government models and approaches are incapable of handling persistent uncertain and complex situation (Edelenbos et al. 2013; Kickert et al. 1997; Koppenjan and Klijn 2004; Van Buuren et al. 2010). The required adaptivity cannot be found in solely governmental steering. Koppenjan and Klijn (2004: 95â100) deï¬ne governance as a fundamentally different form of response to uncertainty than traditional responses. Governance then is a way of linking complex interactions between actors in solving difï¬cult problems (ibid.: 99), whereas more traditional responses rely more on research, go alone strategy, only limited consultation, and top-down steering. The degree of actor involvement is therefore an important characteristic of the governance approach. But governance is more than âjustâ including more actors. It also concerns the multiplicity of all levels and scales involved and the varying problem perceptions and objectives that occur in such a multi-scale, multi-actor"
6,236,0.989,Teaching Tolerance in a Globalized World,"validity in several educational systems, broader conceptualizations may be thought of when designing future research, including future international large-scale assessments of this kind. More speciï¬cally, the measure of tolerance may be further improved to capture not only political but also social tolerance (Weldon 2006; Quintelier and Dejaeghere 2008), attitudes of tolerance toward a wider range of groups (Caro and Schulz 2012; Forst 2003; Green et al. 2006; Mutz 2001), while perspectives oriented toward rejection of social groups (intolerance, discrimination) may be particularly useful for identifying youth at risk. Lastly, this report has tackled the complexities inherent in the study of relationships between differing classroom factors and student attitudes toward equal rights. Among such issues, we note that the ICCS 2009 was designed to sample one intact class per selected school in most countries. For this reason, school and classroom levels are confounded. Therefore, results concerning the relevance of school factors in relation to attitudes toward equal rights must be interpreted with caution. Future research could address the need to better differentiate both theoretically and empirically between school and class-related factors and their relationship to young peoplesâ egalitarian attitudes (using sampling strategies targeting more than one class per school). Complex methodological and theoretical questions pose further aspects for reflection, including identifying the most appropriate measurement models for studentsâ ratings of classrooms, addressing plausible endogeneity in modelling multilevel data, and unfolding the complex explanatory mechanisms (the why, how, and when) that link classroom factors to student attitudes (see Stapleton et al. 2016). Recommendations for Further Research: â¢ Interpret correlational ï¬ndings only as starting points for discussion, formulating hypotheses and establishing patterns. â¢ Complement knowledge acquired through correlational studies with rigorous impact evaluations and qualitative studies. â¢ Develop even broader conceptualizations of tolerance that take into account its complex and multifaceted nature. â¢ Address the need to better differentiate both theoretically and empirically between school- and class-related factors that are related to tolerant attitudes. â¢ Reflect on complex methodological and theoretical questions, such as identifying the most appropriate measurement models for studentsâ ratings of classrooms and addressing plausible endogeneity in modeling multilevel data. â¢ Unfold the complex explanatory mechanisms (the why, how and when) that link classroom factors to student attitudes."
42,355,0.989,S-BPM in the Production Industry : A Stakeholder Approach,"such as design thinking. This ï¬ts with observations that design thinking techniques have been rarely adopted in enterprise IT despite their popularity in product design (Gartner 2015). This is especially the case for IT in the production industry, where company cultures, organizational structures, and work procedures are oriented rather to traditional engineering approaches. Understanding process modelling as a documentation or requirements deï¬nition method has led to the development of comprehensive process notations such as BPMN that aim to support a high degree of expressiveness. BPMN, today the most commonly used approach in BPM (Harmon 2016), requires a complex syntax that is not easy to be learned and applied (Recker 2010). Since there is a correlation between process modelling competence and the creativity of process modelling outcomes (Figl and Weber 2012), it can be assumed that the lack of adequate BPMN expertise of many practitioners affects their creativity in process modelling negatively. In addition, the complex notation of BPMN requires computational tool support for modelling, which may explain the apparent importance of process modelling tools in BPM surveys (Harmon 2016). It is certainly possible to sketch process models using only a core or subset of the most important modelling elements in BPMN (Recker 2010; Grosskopf et al. 2010). Yet, the resulting models would then have to be interpreted by modelling specialists to manually transform them into more complex diagrams using a more complete subset of the BPMN speciï¬cation, and using the BPMN modelling tools that many companies already invested in. This approach is error-prone as it bears the risk of misinterpretation. The widespread view of process modelling as a routine task, reinforced by the current dominance of the BPMN approach that has been declared a standard for BPM, clearly favours procedures and tools over individuals and interactions. This is an obvious obstacle for the adoption of S-BPM, particularly in rather conservative domains such as the production industry."
170,429,0.989,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"become central to understand the design of virtual spaces for government-citizen interaction (Coleman and Shane 2012). Given the relevance of public consultation for democratic events, and the potential of applying ICT tools in such processes, investigations on this field have recently raised interest within the research community. Application areas of public consultations include drafting legislation, urban planning, election monitoring and participatory budgeting preparation, among others. This research focuses on online public consultations applied for drafting legislation. The medium of law gives legitimacy to the political order and provides it with its binding force. Legitimate lawmaking itself is generated through a procedure of public opinion and will-formation (Habermas 1996). However, drafting legislation is a hermetic process mostly driven and managed by governments. Such process can be opened to the citizenry through public consultation, which usually follows two types of approachesâtop-down and bottom-up. Experiences following a topdown approach are started by government and aim at engaging society. Experiences following a bottom-up approach are started in society and aim at mobilising government for listening to public concerns. In particular, top-down initiatives of e-rulemakingââa deliberate agenda-setting process designed to elicit, sort, and clarify fact and opinion from a wide variety of interested partiesâ (Fountain 2003)â are known for being too technical for non-specialised audiences, bureaucratically complex and polarised (ÃstrÃ¶m and GrÃ¶nlund 2012). At the same time, such initiatives are known for producing policymaking outputs tied in an accountable way to actual governmental policymaking (Coleman and Price 2012). Consequently, challenges remain high for those willing to enrol in lawmaking experiences even when opportunities to participate are real. To overcome some of the challenges described above, Web 2.0 tools appear useful and innovative. Web 2.0 tools are increasingly popular across different segments of society, and digital barriers, although still present, are gradually being reduced (Norris 2001). Although a complex term to be set, Web 2.0 can be understood in at least three different ways: (1) as a set of social relationships and practices, (2) as a mode of production and (3) as a set of values (Postigo 2011). In this work, Web 2.0 refers to the term as coined by OâReilly (2005), focusing on the use of collaborative tools that require no specialised knowledge and allow content generated by users to be reused by others in their own social networks. From this point of view, it seems that Web 2.0 tools have the potential to revolutionise how legislation is made, but it is not clear how politics and technology should interact (Wright and Street 2007). Based on that, the aim of our research is to study how Web 2.0 tools are used to enhance collaborative practices in policymaking, particularly in drafting legislation, and how they affect political communication during the first two stages of the policy life cycleâagenda setting and policy formulation. To achieve the aim, we address the research questions of (1) what aspects of Web 2.0 tools are used by online consultations and (2) what democratic environments are generated by combining different Web 2.0 tools. Our methodology to address these questions is based on an evaluation of two case studies of online public consultation that took place in Brazil. For each case, we analyse"

In short, MM are regression-based techniques designed to study the individual development of a certain variable over time by adjusting for the correlations of the observations within one subject. This is done by estimating the differences between the subjects; a variance for the intercept and a variance for the slope(s). The intercept is indicative for the baseline values and the slope(s) for the rate of development over time. LCGM also aims to study the individual development of a certain variable over time, but uses the data to additionally generate groups of individuals with comparable trajectories over time. The purpose of this chapter is to explain and compare MM and LCGM in more detail by combining a methodological focus with empirical findings using existing life course data of the Amsterdam Growth and Health Longitudinal Study cohort. We will address practical issues with which researchers within life course research are confronted when aiming to find answers to their research questions, paying particular attention to when, how and why to use MM and LCGM. Further, detailed readings are recommended for interested readers (Hancock and Samuelsen 2008; Nagin and Odgers 2010; Nagin 2005; Preacher et al. 2008; Singer and Willett 2003; Twisk 2013)."

275,25,0.989,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"operation is inefficient and dangerous, mandating the use of autonomy for a wide range of spacecraft functions. With increasing miniaturisation of spacecraft, traffic management and collision avoidance are becoming pressing problems driving greater degrees of spacecraft autonomy. Yet the lack of trust ascribed to the limitations of automated code generation, runtime analysis and model checking for verification and validation for software that has to make complex decisions is a large barrier to adoption of higher-level autonomy for spacecraft. Linked to this is the need for human domain experts to be involved in the design and development of software in order to build trust in the product. The chapter concludes with some possible space scenarios for autonomy, the first of which might be achieved in the near future, involving greater autonomous analysis of information from different sources. The second concerns autonomy in space traffic management, linked to all spacecraft that have the ability to manoeuvre, that includes the decision-making and action currently undertaken by humans. The final scenario concerns distributed space systems that can self-configure with minimal human input, both to achieve capabilities not achievable using single large spacecraft and to respond to unexpected events such as partial system failure. The final chapter presents a picture of autonomous systems development primarily from an economic point of view, on the basis that an economic agent is an autonomous agent; the difference being that economics is primarily concerned with analysing overall outcomes from societies of decision-makers while AI is squarely focussed on decision-making algorithm development. The connection between economics and AI is probably more widely understood in economics - which has long utilised and contributed, in turn, to the development of machine learning and automated reasoning methods - than it is in autonomy research. Thus the chapter treats autonomy as the allocation of scarce resources under conditions of fundamental uncertainty. The main thrust of the chapter is an economic view of uncertainty, which distinguishes between epistemic uncertainty and ontological uncertainty, and its consequences for autonomy. Ontological uncertainty is the deeper of the two: epistemic uncertainty amounts to ignorance of possible outcomes due to sampling limits, while ontological uncertainty relates to the presence of unsolvable paradoxical problems; the chapter thus draws out the connection between the economic notion of ontological uncertainty and the famed incompleteness theorems of GÃ¶del, the unsolvability of the Halting Problem of Turing, and incompressibility theorems of Algorithmic Information Theory. Drawing on both financial economics and macroeconomic theory, commonplace investment strategies are presented in the context of this notion of uncertainty, noting that, under conditions of ontological uncertainty, what might be seemingly rational for an individual agent in the short-term need not be rational in the long-term nor from the perspective of the entire social enterprise. Certain well-known bond investment strategies, however, appear to have the potential to strike a healthy balance and yield desirable long-term properties for both the agent and the broader system of which it"
232,236,0.989,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"3 Evaluation Metrics The metrics that we will use to gauge public perception of energy and its sources must be familiar to the general public rather than technical. At the same time the signiï¬cance and relevance of such metrics will be guaranteed following a well-established framework. The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in the 1987 deï¬ned sustainable development as the âdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.â [1] A typical framework, empowering this deï¬nition is the âTriple Bottom Lineâ [2]. The Triple Bottom Line (3BL) is a framework, well established in the scientiï¬c literature as well as public-oriented publications, with three key elements: social, environmental (or ecological) and economics. It provides a holistic perspective to assess the sustainability of several engineering solutions. A state-of-the-art framework to assess the sustainability of power plants and their life cycle (nuclear in particular) is provided in [3]. Regarding environmental indicators in particular, the US EPA has focused on determining and developing the best impact assessment tool for Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), Pollution Prevention (P2), and Sustainability Metrics for the US. This research led to the creation of TRACIâthe Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts. The methodology has been developed speciï¬cally for the US using input parameters consistent with US locations. Site speciï¬city is available for many of the impact categories, but in all cases a US average value exists when the location is undetermined. The average values were implemented in the ecoinvent data. Further information is available at http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/std/traci/traci.html. TRACI is therefore useful to compare different power plants and their life cycle. Unfortunately, these frameworks are hardly compressive for non-experts. In particular regarding the power sectors, people often have misconceptions that the tool envisaged by this research program will contribute to overcome. Some of the most relevant examples that we will address are:"
148,253,0.989,Anti-fragile ICT Systems (Volume 1.0),"13.1 Achieving Anti-fragility While many commentators find Talebâs concept of anti-fragility both interesting and useful, other commentators believe it is very similar to the well-known concepts of robustness and resilience. To determine whether Talebâs work [10] really brings any new insight into the development and operation of large ICT systems, the author has investigated different aspects of anti-fragility. The main insights are summarized in the following. Stakeholders of complex adaptive ICT systems must embrace hardware and software failures because they are inevitable. Local failures should, at worst, result in degraded performance, not systemic failures such as unplanned system downtime. The book introduced four design principlesâmodularity, weak links, redundancy, and diversityâto isolate the impact of local failures and one operational principleâ the fail fast principleâto quickly detect vulnerabilities by inducing artificial failures. The collective goal of the five principles presented is to limit the impact of failures by failing early, isolate the impact of local failures, and learn from small Â© The Author(s) 2016 K.J.

347,87,0.989,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"inertiaâ (Wilson 2009: 93). This institutional inertia is the central concern of this chapter. Besides the problems with the TAC management approach, our case study also deals with the shift towards results-based fisheries management and the role of marine regions, Member States and stakeholders in such outcome-oriented management systems. Results-based management has been intensively discussed in the context of the recent reform of CFP, finalised in 2013. The European Commissionâs 2009 Green Paper on CFP reform suggested an approach where strategic decisions on principles and standards should remain at Community level (CEC 2009b), whilst decisions relating to technical implementation be delegated to Member States ideally organising themselves at the level of marine regions such as the Baltic Sea region (CEC 2009a). However, it is still unclear how the concepts of results-based management and a shifting burden of proof will be implemented through a regional approach under the new post-2013 CFP (Linke and Jentoft 2013; Nielsen et al. 2015). In Wilsonâs publication The Paradoxes of Transparency, Science and the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management in Europe, he highlights the importance of changing future fisheries management (Wilson 2009). Results-based management is identified as a promising alternative to current regulatory processes, which are overcentralised and top-down: âThe CFP can in many ways be argued to take the form of a classical intergovernmentalist, state-centric command-andcontrol, top-down management systemâ (Hegland 2009: 8). The European Commissionâs Green Paper (CEC 2009b) also recognised that the current CFP takes a top-down approach and needs to give the fishing industry more incentives to behave responsibly. In Wilsonâs and otherâs views, a ânested results-based system, organised around both sets of economic activities and geographical areasâ (Wilson 2009: 276; cf. Raakjaer and Tatenhove 2014), is better suited for governing an unpredictable and complex system such as the Baltic Seaâs fisheries and essential for the implementation of EAFM. The role of stakeholders in CFP over the last 15 years is the other important topic taken up in this chapter. In particular, we look at how two main structures for stakeholder interaction within CFP â the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA), set up in 1971 and now replaced by several specialised advisory councils, and the more recent Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) â inform CFP. The key research questions dealt with in this chapter with respect to the governance changes described here are: How is uncertainty dealt with in the governance interactions between risk assessment and risk management (science and policy)? And how does communication between different actors address differences in the framing of the central issues in todayâs fisheries governance structures? These fundamental governance issues are analysed and discussed. Our case study does not however deal with how external factors such as climate change, eutrophication (e.g. hypoxic bottoms), environmental pollution, invasive species or spreading diseases might contribute to decreasing fish stocks. Although these external pressures do exist, we do not treat them as part of the ârisk of overfishingâ."

Critical ethnography research emphasizes giving local people, women, and invisibilized groups the right to express and represent themselves, establishing a dialogue and collaboration with them and being critical of its own standpoint; engaging in serious longitudinal studies that enable one to acquire an honest meta-reflexive position and deep insights with regard to and in relation to the research context and people, while considering silences, omissions, and processes of invisibility; and enabling researchers to be an active part of the social process, collaborating in the transformation of society, for example through participative-action research (Delgado 2010).

In Chap. 11, Maria Forsman discusses childrenâs legal representatives in Sweden and their role in Barnahus. The last theme (IV) addresses professional autonomy and interagency collaboration. These are core elements in Barnahus as a multiprofessional collaborative model with the main aim of facilitating and improving interagency collaboration. As the chapters will show, professional autonomy and collaboration create tensions and challenges in an interagency model, which require balancing. Susanna Johansson relates to the Swedish context and shows in Chap. 12 how Barnahus collaboration spans different regulatory fields and brings together conflicting logics, creating an institutional tension between âjusticeâ and âwelfareâ. Her chapter analyses collaboration in Barnahus in a critical manner, drawing on institutional theory and a three-dimensional concept of power. Elisiv Bakketeig explores the issue of conflicting logics further in Chap. 13 by discussing whether, and how, juridification manifests in the Norwegian Barnahus model using the Swedish Barnahus model as a point of reference. She discusses factors that may stimulate or constrain processes of juridification in the Norwegian model. In Chap. 14, Lene Mosegaard SÃ¸bjerg explores how the establishment of Barnahus in Denmark has been perceived by child welfare workers in the local municipalities. More precisely she discusses how the establishment of Barnahus in Denmark affected the capability of child welfare caseworkers to work holistically with abused children and how this relates to Barnahus as an integrated service. Finally, in Chap. 15 Anja Bredal and Kari Stefansen discuss a pilot project in Norway called âproject Novemberâ which involves adapting the main features of the Barnahus model with the aim of developing integrated services for adult victims of interpersonal violence. They highlight the importance of analysing the local landscape of services before new collaborative models are implemented. In the concluding chapter, we comment on the contributions in the book and identify key challenges and potentials relating to the Barnahus model, both within a Nordic welfare state context and beyond. We also introduce Barnahus as an emerging organisational field and a corresponding field of research."

244,1136,0.989,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","As was true for the 1970s, in this decade, ETS methodological innovation was notable for its far-ranging impact. Lord (1980) furthered the development and application of IRT, with particular attention to its use in addressing a wide variety of testing problems, among them parameter estimation, linking, evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF), and adaptive testing. Holland (1986, 1987), as well as Holland and Rubin (1983), continued the work on causal inference, further developing its philosophical and epistemological foundations, including exploration of a longstanding statistical paradox described by Lord (1967).2 An edited volume, Drawing Inferences From Self-Selected Samples (Wainer 1986), collected work on these issues. Rubinâs work on matching, particularly propensity score matching, was a key activity through this decade. Rubin (1980a), as well as Rosenbaum and Rubin (1984, 1985), made important contributions to this methodology. These widely cited publications outlined approaches that are frequently used in scientific research when experimental manipulation is not possible. Building on his research of the previous decade, Rubin (1980b, c) developed âmultiple imputation,â a statistical technique for dealing with nonresponse by generating random draws from the posterior distribution of a variable, given other variables. The multiple imputations methodology forms the underlying basis for several major group-score assessments (i.e., tests for which the focus of inference is on population, rather than individual, performance), including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and the Programme of International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC; Beaton and Barone, Chap. 8, this volume; Kirsch et al., Chap. 9, this volume). Also of note was the emergence of DIF as an important methodological research focus. The standardization method (Dorans and Kulick 1986), and the more statistically grounded Mantel and Haenszel (1959) technique proposed by Holland and Thayer (1988), became stock approaches used by operational testing programs around the world for assessing item-level fairness. Finally, the research community working on DIF was brought together for an invited conference in 1989 at ETS. Although there were a large number of observed-score equating studies in the 1980s, one development stands out in that it foreshadowed a line of research undertaken more than a decade later. The method of kernel equating was introduced by Holland and Thayer (1989) as a general procedure that combines smoothing, Lordâs (1967) paradox refers to the situation, in observational studies, in which the statistical treatment of posttest scores by means of different corrections using pretest scores (i.e., regression vs. posttest minus pretest differences) can lead to apparent contradictions in results. This phenomenon is related to regression artifacts (D. T. Campbell and Kenny, 1999; Eriksson and Haggstrom, 2014)."
3,176,0.989,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"Strategic scaffolding bootstraps a strategy that students can use to solve a problem (Hannafin et al., 1999; Reiser et al., 2001). From an activity theory perspective, this approach would still leave open the possibility for student agency in the application of the strategy, and possible modification thereof. This is because according to this framework, the semiotic process of building signs according to tools (e.g., scaffolds) is highlighted (Belland & Drake, 2013; Wertsch & Kazak, 2005). For example, a scaffold bootstrapped positive collaboration skills by providing a database of positive groupwork rules, inviting students to (a) create their own groupwork rules, (b) evaluate their group processes in light of the group rules they created, (c) discuss according to given discussion questions, and (d) self-evaluate the whole process (Ulicsak, 2004). Experimental students engaged in more lengthy discussions and exhibited greater reflection (Ulicsak, 2004). As another example, the Connection Log leads middle school students through a generic argument creation process (Belland, 2010) grounded in the persuasive theory of argumentation (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958). This led lower-achieving experimental students (Belland, Glazewski, & Richardson, 2011) and average-achieving experimental"

This paper argues, therefore, against naÃ¯ve summative evaluations based on oversimpliï¬ed criteria, which are not helpful for policy learning. Instead, the task of a formative evaluation is to describe and analyse these remedial and differential processes. The Country Reviews from PL4SD are an early attempt to do this. If this could be done for multiple countries, the analyses could be used to identify clusters of national systems, which are organised in the same way and use the same supporting processes. Comparing survey data (e.g. from EUROSTUDENT) on a higher education systemâs student body and study framework within such a country cluster could provide insights into what is effective in a certain type of higher education system. That is to say that summative evaluation is possible but only when describing similar systems, i.e. following a kind of benchmarking approach made possible through formative evaluations.

However, he stresses the importance of people involvement by participatory design techniques to meet human expectations and requirements. Furthermore, LÃ¼dtke (2015) recommends a model-based approach to support these phases. Thereby, he proposes to apply different kinds of models which cover tasks, the work domain, humans, machines and user interfaces. The Involvement of people in the development of humanâsystem interactions represents an important aspect for any development attempt. System design always serves a certain purpose, aims to reach certain objectives and addresses actual user groups. Research and developments in the ï¬eld of human computer interaction (HCI) promote human-centric design processes to meet userâs expectations and requirements. Standards such as ISO 9241-210:2010 promote approaches and guidelines to integrate users in the design and evaluation of IT solutions in order to improve adequate system design and adaptation. ISO 9241-210:2010 Ergonomics of humanâsystem interactionâPart 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems promotes the following key principles: â¢ The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments â¢ Users are involved throughout design and development â¢ The design is driven and reï¬ned by user-centred evaluation â¢ The process is iterative â¢ The design addresses the whole user experience â¢ The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives Besides the explicit recognition of humans in design speciï¬cations and their active involvement in development initiatives, humans themselves represent an essential enabler for organizational improvement. Employees are considered to be domain experts in their ï¬eld of activity within a company. As such, employees pose a valuable source for improvement ideas (Setiawan et al. 2011; Fairbank and Williams 2001). Nevertheless, employees are often not involved in the innovation process (Setiawan et al. 2011; Fairbank and Williams 2001). The idea of employee participation in innovation processes is well-proven. Since the late eighteenth century employee suggestion systems (ESS) provide means for employee engagement and have been used to collect suggestions and ideas for improvements (Fairbank and Williams 2001). Integrating employees in the innovation process has the potential to lead to important improvements and ï¬nancial beneï¬ts (Fairbank and Williams 2001). However, empowering employees to take part in innovation and improvement processes requires organizational structures facilitating employee involvement as well as adequate tools supporting employee commitment (Fairbank and Williams 2001). Considering the design of organizational structures enabling employee involvement, requirements and principles have already been deï¬ned (cf. Lawler 1986). Taking into account such design principles for organizational"

6,227,0.989,Teaching Tolerance in a Globalized World,"In Chap. 3, Miranda and Castillo aimed to examine, from a comparative perspective, the reliability and validity of the main constructs used to measure tolerance (attitudes toward equal rights). They applied a broader conceptualization and operationalized deï¬nition of tolerance as a set of three, interrelated attitudes toward the rights of women, immigrants and ethnic minorities. They investigated the cross-cultural comparability of these latent variables through empirical analyses of measurement invariance conducted in a factor-analytical framework (conï¬rmatory factor analysis and multigroup conï¬rmatory factor analysis models) applied to the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) 2009 data. By applying multigroup conï¬rmatory factor analyses techniques in order to test the validity of the conceptual framework elaborated upon across the chapters of this book. They found that the three scales used to measure tolerance had the same structure and were equivalent across all the countries analyzed at the scalar level of invariance. By implication, direct comparisons of the mean scores and correlates of the three egalitarian attitudes across countries are empirically justiï¬ed and can be interpreted in a meaningful way (Desa 2014, Rutkowski and Svetina 2014). Moreover, the analysis also conï¬rmed that multilevel modeling was an adequate strategy for the estimation of the explanatory models. Chapter 3 provides a solid methodological and theoretical basis for all the comparative and multilevel analyses reported in the subsequent chapters, and contributes to the current research by providing empirical support to a broader conceptualization of tolerance based on the ICCS 2009 data. In what can be considered a general study of factors associated with attitudes toward egalitarian values, Chap. 4 focused on the capacity of schools and other agents to promote positive attitudes toward diversity. TreviÃ±o, BÃ©jares, Wyman and Villalobos aimed to analyze how several characteristics of schools and individuals shape student attitudes toward equal rights. Multilevel regression analyses conducted within countries showed both commonalities and differences in the explanatory mechanisms present across countries. The results provided important information that helped to determine the focus of the subsequent chapters. They ï¬rst identiï¬ed that individual and family characteristics had a stronger positive influence than schools across all the countries analyzed. Individual student characteristics, such as their interest in social and political issues and their support for democratic values, were related both positively and generally with young peoplesâ attitudes toward equal rights. In most countries, female students tended to exhibit more positive egalitarian attitudes. Further, and in agreement with previous studies (see, for example, Caro and Schulz 2012), an open classroom climate for discussion and participation in civic-related activities at school were the two school variables that exhibited the most consistent positive relationship with attitudes toward equal rights. This study also revealed the importance of country-speciï¬c contexts when examining the relationships between different school variables and the three indicators of tolerance. Different school composition or segregation variables (percentage of girls, immigrants and students belonging to an ethnic minority), and the socioeconomic composition of the school"
84,505,0.989,Eye Tracking Methodology,"A wide assortment of eye tracking studies can be found in the increasingly related fields of neuroscience and psychology. Topics range from basic research in vision science to the investigation of visual exploration in aesthetics (e.g., perception of art). A useful approach to navigating through vast collections of early and contemporary literature is to (for the outset) dissociate high-level cognitive studies from those concerned with a low-level functional view of the brain. In this sense, to use a computational analogy, one can distinguish between the âhardwareâ (low-level brain circuitry) on which the âsoftwareâ (high-level cognition) functions. In a complementary view of the apparently disparate disciplines, neuroscience identifies the physiological components that are ultimately responsible for perception. In the context of vision and eye movements, knowledge of the physiological organization of the optic tract as well as of cognitive and behavioral aspects of vision is indispensable in obtaining a complete understanding of human vision. To illustrate the interdependence of neuroscience and psychology, consider again the scene integration problem (see Chap. 1). Neurophysiological studies clearly identify the visual components involved in dynamic (or active) vision. That is, due to the limited informational capacity of the fovea, the eyes shift from point to point while scanning the visual field. The neuronal organization of retinal cells, which in a sense is the reason for eye movements, is well known. Furthermore, the general organization of foveoâperipheral vision has also been mapped along the magno- and parvocellular pathways leading to deeper regions of the brain and farther still into regions implicated in higher cognitive functions. From psychological observations, we know that humans are aware of a large field of view, even though physiology does not permit a holistic cameralike capture of the entire scene in one exposure. This is the crux of the scene integration problem. Psychologists show us that we are quite adept at maintaining a fairly accurate mental image of the visual scene in front of us. Indeed, various illusory pictures such as the Kanizsa (1976) square show us that we âseeâ more than what is physically there. The main question of how the brain is able to âpiece togetherâ small high-resolution snapshots of the scene remains a mystery. Â© Springer International Publishing AG 2017 A.T.

243,45,0.989,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"division of labour, the legal and professional regulations in place, and so on (see e.g. Hanseth and Monteiro 1998a). The main argument is that information infrastructures are never designed from scratch, but they develop through the evolution of an installed base. Hanseth and Lyytinen (2010) define an installed base as the existing âset of ICT capabilities and their users, operations and design communitiesâ, and it also encompasses existing institutional and organizational components (Lanzara 2014). In the health sector for example an installed base may encompass patient record systems, medical departments, various groups of professionals as users (nurses, clinicians), dispensing practices, regulations etc. Accordingly, the main argument put forward in this book is that projects for the creation of large-scale health information infrastructures are shaped by the existing installed base: the organizational, institutional, regulatory, sociotechnical arrangements that are already in place. We should keep in mind that an installed base is not a given âthingâ, it is rather a conceptual tool. This conceptual tool can help us to capture the continuities and discontinuities in infrastructure evolution. It becomes observable and visible when analyzing plans and interventions acting upon the existing infrastructural arrangements. Rather than asking âwhat is the installed baseâ we should ask âwhen is an installed baseâ? In other words, rather than pointing to specific elements, we need to ask when and how some element of an existing reality becomes significant, for whom, with what effects? In what way do the different elements become significant, are they working as triggers, as resources, as competitors, as alternatives? For instance, will a particular feature of the organizational culture serve to facilitate or hinder change? The concept of installed base is a sense-making tool to examine and reflect on the challenges faced in the development of infrastructures. It implies a process-oriented understanding where it becomes crucial to trace and analyse the historical sequence of events and decisions that shape the forming of infrastructures. The generic change strategy of the information infrastructure perspective â âcultivation of the installed baseâ â denotes a strategy that starts from what already exists (the installed base). This implies a re-conceptualization of the very notion of design of information infrastructure. Rather than design in the conventional sense, dealing with the evolution of infrastructures requires strategies to intervene and influence ongoing processes. The Information Infrastructure evolution process is best captured by the notion of âgrowingâ (instead of e.g. âbuildingâ or âconstructingâ) since it gives a âsense of an organic unfolding within an existing (and changing) environmentâ where there is a ârecurring issue of adjustment in which infrastructures adapt to, reshape, or even internalize elements of their environment in the process of growth and entrenchmentâ (Edwards et al. 2007, p. 369). These processes of infrastructure evolution happen along multiple temporal scales (Edwards et al. 2009; Ribes and Finholt 2009; Karasti et al. 2010). In this perspective, we approach the cases by paying attention to the strategies enacted in order to deal with the installed base, and examine how developing infrastructures entails engagement in processes of extension, recombination, substitution of parts and arrangements that already exist. In this view, new information technologies should never be seen"
378,55,0.989,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"From an ecosystem perspective, the main question for the SES camp could be summarized thus: how can we best understand sustainable human societies and apply system innovations to achieve them? Important institutional research in this ï¬eld is carried out at the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Stockholm, Sweden, and also the STEPS Centre in Brighton, United Kingdom. One report that made signiï¬cant waves in Germany was the WBGUâs 2011 World in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability. The WBGU was founded just before the 1992 UN World Summit on Sustainable Development with the mandate of providing independent scientiï¬c advice. A key idea promoted by the WBGU in an earlier report was that of âplanetary guard railsâ similar to the âPlanetary Boundariesâ introduced by RockstrÃ¶m et al. (2009). While acknowledging other environmental domains and their overuse, the main emphasis of both the WBGU guard rails and the 2011 transition or transformation report (the German title uses âTransformationâ but the English translation is âtransitionâ) lies on climate change (WBGU 2011a). Overall, the single most important issue and overarching goal of the different measures and strategies discussed, is the avoidance of catastrophic climate change with all its implications for âthe worldâs ecosystems and their ability to sustain human life.â Given the wide-reaching consequences of the carbon cycle for life on earth, a transformation toward âclimate complianceâ is declared an âethical imperativeâ similar to that of the abolition of slavery and child labor (WBGU 2011c: 1). Climate change is introduced as the most important environmental global challenge and the report discusses other global megatrends in order to understand interlinkages: economic development; democratization; global energy supply and demand; urbanization; and patterns of increasing competition for land use between food, bio-energy and forests. It also seeks to identify how these and ecological earth system trends interrelate. As a result, the three areas with the highest transformative impact are identiï¬ed. These are the sustainable design of future energy systems, urbanization trends, and land use patterns. The programmatic gist of these required transformations is to turn current carbon-based economies into ones based on renewable, or at least recyclable resources. The magnitude of this remodeling is"
198,628,0.989,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Description Which of the three general purposes (i) management, (ii) learning or (iii) accountability an M&E approach is likely to predominantly address Management refers to supporting the ongoing management of adaptation actions and processes (in the sense of adaptive management) Learning refers to acquiring a detailed understanding of how and why adaptation interventions have led to certain results or why they did not achieve their objectives Accountability refers to demonstrating that processes and/or actions have taken place and have led to results The nature of an approach, i.e. what data and procedures it uses and what information it provides, determines which of the three general purposes it can best support. For example, if a small number of standard indicators like âNumber of beneficiariesâ are aggregated for a portfolio of adaptation projects, the resulting information is not adequate to infer how and why adaptation has worked (Chen and Uitto 2014). Thus, this approach is most suitable for accountability purposes, but not for learning M&E approaches can cater to more than one general purpose depending on how exactly they are designed in practice Whether the M&E approach is focusing more on the process of implementation or on the outcomes of adaptation This distinction is common in the literature on adaptation M&E since assessing adaptation outcomes is faced with various challenges (Bours et al. 2014b). As a result, it was suggested to initially focus on process-based indicators and gradually move to outcome-based ones (Harley et al. 2008)"

However, we also can observe a continuous disciplinary differentiation and itemisation that is expressed, for example, in extended titles of academic chairs. From a social science perspective, scientific disciplines can be considered as institutions that shape the way in which people do research in a certain thematic field and on a range of topics (following CastaÌn Broto et al. 2009).

148,83,0.989,Anti-fragile ICT Systems (Volume 1.0),"While it is impossible to predict all potential swan events that can severely impact complex information and communications technology (ICT) systems, we know the general reasons for extreme global behavior: single points of failure such as shared resources, local failures initiating systemic failures due to chain reactions, scaling effects, and cascading failures between system layers and different systems [35, Chap. 4]. Because the removal of single points of failure is a well-understood problem [47], this chapter first introduces four design principles that together isolate local failures before they propagate and cause systemic failures. It then presents one operational principle to quickly remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Finally, the chapter discusses how a systemic failure can occur in a complex adaptive system even when no parts fail, as well as the need to build models to understand such extreme global behavior. The current chapter defines and illustrates five principles needed to design and operate anti-fragile ICT systems, while the following chapters discuss how these principles can be implemented in different types of complex ICT systems. The principles are rooted in the analysis in Chap. 2, showing the need to isolate local failures and use natural and induced failures to learn about vulnerabilities. The reader may recognize some of the principles as software patterns described in books on software design [35, 48]. Here, we use the term principle rather than pattern to emphasize that these ideas or concepts can be found in many research fields, not only software design [3, 4, 19, 35, 48, 49, 50]."
242,6,0.989,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Preface This book emerges from a collaborative effort between partners from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The empirical data of the book originate mostly from the IDRC research programme on Women and Migration (2006â2011) that was funded as a component of the larger Womenâs Rights and Citizenship programme (WRC). Whereas previous support for research on gender by IDRC has been integrated into broader themes such as agriculture, health, social and economic policy, science and technology, the WRC programme has used the concept of citizenship as an entry point and sought to bring Southern voices more fully into current international debates in the field of gender and development. Built on the vision of a just world where women in the South are acknowledged to have a sense of self that is connected to the ideals of citizenship, the WRC programme has supported work directed at undoing social discrimination based on gender and enabling the realization of the full range of rights and freedoms for women. With the support of IDRC, a team based at the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) of Erasmus University Rotterdam has led the work of distillation and synthesis of the research findings of the Women and Migration research programme, by way of a sustained exchange of knowledge and practice between partners over a two-year period (2011 and 2012). The synthesis project had the title Migration, Gender and Social Justice (MGSJ). It involved an opening workshop at ISS in The Hague in January 2011, followed by individual visits to The Hague for writing and discussion, and a concluding workshop at the Centre for Development Studies, Trivandrum (India) in February 2013. The synthesis of research findings has aimed at promoting long-term collaboration based on reciprocal and selfreflexive learning between partners. It is hoped too that by connecting communities of research and practice the collaboration can contribute to a change in attitudes and views in order to bridge differences in the understanding of migration and thus improve policy interventions. Against this background, the book is problem-oriented and multidisciplinary and connects the research results of international teams working across different research sites, with different emphases and on different scales of analysis. Given the diversity of research approaches, the richness of the findings, and the complex realities of rights claiming, the task of the MGSJ research project has been threefold. 1. The first task of the project has been to distil the research findings of WRC projects, and articulate commonalities and differences in the operation of different structures of power (gender, class, race/ethnicity, generation) and their interaction within the institutional domain of migration (with reference to organizational practices, legal regulations, circulation of material and ideational resources) which produce context-specific forms of social inequality. 2. The second task was to generate critical reflections on the intersection of the different power structures that circumscribe the space for migrants to claim rights, and to relate these perspectives with existing approaches to social justice. For this purpose additional contributions were solicited to cover core issues that had not been fully addressed by the WRC projects, including legal liminality and how the social construction of not only femininity but also masculinity affects all migrants and all women."
245,998,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"research-related activity, which may be described using rather generic labels (e.g. networking and collegial interaction, writing, reading, speaking, data collection, data display, data reduction) or labels that are, to varying degrees, more speciï¬c and that represent moreâand differentâmicro levels of description or categorisation (e.g. testing, observing, comparing, contrasting). Procedural change relates to changes to peopleâs capacity to deal with or manage procedures within research-related practice. Often such procedures will be imposed at institutional level or within the wider disciplineâsuch as research bidsâ applications procedures. Sometimes they may be self-imposed strategic procedures. Competential change involves the increase or enhancement of research-related skills and competences, such as the development or reï¬nement of writing, analytical or presentation skills. Productive change refers to change to peopleâs research output: to how much they achieve, produce or âdoâ, such as an increase in published output or research grant applications or increased involvement in conferences, seminars and research networks. Perceptual change refers to change in relation to peopleâs perceptions, viewpoints, beliefs and mindsetsâviews about whether, for example, research should have relevance and usefulness and impact upon policy and practice: whether it should be âappliedâ or âpureâ; or about whether it mayâand shouldâbe done by inexperienced and untrained amateurs/practitioners. Perceptual change relates, too, to perceptions of research as a component of oneâs work, or a constituent of oneâs professional identity; as such it incorporates self-perception. Drawing upon the etymological derivative of the word âevaluationâ, by evaluative change I do not mean peopleâs capacity to evaluate, as a research process; rather, the term refers to changes to peopleâs research-related values, including not only âgrandâ values (such as equality and social justice), but also the day-to-day minutiae of what they consider important: that is, what matters to them, and what they like about, research and researching. Motivational change refers to increases in peopleâs motivation and levels of morale and (job) satisfaction in relation to their research activity. By epistemological change I mean change to the bases of what people know or understand in relation to research and researching, and to their research-related knowledge structures, as well as the theoretical and conceptual frameworks within which they locate and undertake their research activity. Rationalistic change is about change to the extent of, and the nature of, the reasoning that people apply to their research practice. Analytical change refers not speciï¬cally to data analysis (which is a research process and therefore falls within the processual dimension), but to change to the degree or nature of the analyticism applied to research-related activity. Finally, comprehensive change involves the enhancement or increase of peopleâs research-related knowledge and understanding. Deconstructed in this way, we see researcher development as a multi-dimensional process or agency, for its constituent partsâits dimensionsâ become much more apparent. Knowing and understanding the complex ways in which these may fuse together and interact to effect the process whereby people develop as or into researchers isâor ought to beâinvaluable to those responsible for promoting this process. We may in fact conceptualise researcher development as"
144,312,0.989,25 Years of Transformations of Higher Education Systems in Post-Soviet Countries : Reform and Continuity,"institutions (HEIs) in Kyrgyzstan has been transformed into an expansive, diverse, unequal, semiprivatized and marketized higher education (HE) landscape (Amsler 2011; Brunner and Tillett 2007; Mertaugh 2004; Narkoziev and Yanzen 2013). How should we make sense of these changes within the framework of institutional diversification? Mindful of Fumasoli and Huismanâs (2013) arguments that the marketization of higher education does not necessarily generate institutional diversification, that government regulation does not necessarily lead to homogenization among institutions, and that universitiesâ own institutional strategies and responses to environmental changes shape processes of structural reform in complex ways, this chapter assesses the specific character of these changes to the landscape in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan. After briefly describing the structure and financing of higher education in the Kirgiz Soviet Socialist Republic (KSSR) from 1917 to 1991, we consider some key factors which have shaped patterns of the differentiation and diversification of HE in the post-Soviet period. These include the historical legacies of Soviet HE infrastructures, new legal and political frameworks for HE governance and finance, changes to regulations for the licensing of institutions and academic credentials, the introduction of new multinational policy agendas for higher education in the Central Asian region, changes in the relationship between higher education and labor, the introduction of a national university admissions examination, and the adoption of certain principles of the European Bologna Process. The picture of HE reform that emerges from this analysis is one in which concurrent processes of diversification and homogenization are not driven wholly by either state regulation or forces of market competition, but mediated by universitiesâ strategic negotiations of these forces in the context of historical institutional formations in Kyrgyzstan. The analysis presented in this chapter focuses on trends, since 1991, in both âexternal diversificationâ within the HE system (in which differences emerge between institutions) and âsystemicâ and âprogrammaticâ differentiation, with particular attention to the relationship between this process and the dismantling, reinforcement, or emergence of hierarchy and stratification within the HE system. âSystemic differentiationâ refers to âdifferences in institutional type, size, and control found within a higher education systemâ, and âprogrammatic differentiationâ refers to the âdegree level, degree area, comprehensiveness, mission and emphasis of programs and services provided by the institutionsâ (Huisman 1995, 13). The chapter draws on national and international statistical indicators of higher"

Are they achieving their objectives? Are they actually leading to a reduction in vulnerability to climate change? Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) can help answer these questions. However, due to the context specific and cross-sectoral nature of adaptation there is no one-size fits all approach to M&E. The Adaptation M&E Navigator helps to select a suitable M&E approach by providing a list of specific M&E purposes and matching them to relevant approaches. Key characteristics of each approach are highlighted to enable informed decision making. The Adaptation M&E Navigator also provides links to further guidance and examples from practice.

Does the curriculum envisage learning outcomes from non-institutionalised learning through community activities, use of media or working? Curriculum structure can thus be assessed on its responsiveness to the interplay between formal curricula and outcomes from nonformal and informal learning. The NQFs developed after 2005 differ in important ways from the first generation of frameworks developed in England, New Zealand and South Africa (in the meantime these have been revised). The early frameworks were based on what may be described as an âoutcomes-ledâ rather than âoutcomes-basedâ approach. The former approaches tended to make a distinction between learning processes and learning outcomes. A number of countries refer to competences within qualification frameworks, particularly in areas where concrete tasks and skills can be identified. Young (2010) argues that such behavioural output measures employed in NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications) in England, in the South African NQF, in the New Zealand Qualifications Framework and, until recently, in the EQF represent an attempt by industry and the labour market to take control of educational outcomes from educational institutions. Within the NVQ, individuals are able to fulfil the requirements of a set of descriptors without necessarily following a prescribed curricular and pedagogic path. There is thus no internal or conceptual link between the assessment of a learning outcome and a particular path of study. Recent developments in learning outcomes-based NQFs have precipitated change in an increasing number of countries in the developing world (Singh and Duvekot 2013). India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Namibia, Burkina Faso and Ghana have either developed or are in the process of developing an NQF in the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sector. This shift towards learning outcomes reflects the growing perception of the recognition of skills and knowledge as an achievable goal. Learning outcomes expressed in terms of competencebased approaches hold the potential for the immediate recognition, utilisation and further development of existing skills. However, the possibility that curricular and pedagogic processes might be disregarded, with serious repercussions for the quality of the learning, cannot be discounted within this context. As Young and Allais (2011) alert us with respect to the development of qualifications frameworks in developing countries, competence-based approaches must be complemented by inputs, i.e. the knowledge that a learner needs to acquire if he or she is to be enabled to move beyond existing performance levels. The EQF originally represented an attempt to adopt a transformational approach to qualifications by regimenting national systems in broadly behavioural terms (Raffe 2011). Brockmann et al. (2011b) criticise the manner in which the term âcompetenceâ is used in the EQF as a separate category from knowledge and skills, therefore making it potentially non-integrative (p. 9). The EQF concept of broader competences, they argue, is reduced to responsibility and autonomy and excludes the moral and civic dimensions. However, this ambiguity in the concept of competences has been addressed by several countries as reported in the recent European Inventory on NQFs (CEDEFOP 2012), in which it has been shown that"
365,38,0.989,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Abstract Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach to guide the management of agriculture in the era of climate change. The concept was first launched in 2009, and since then has been reshaped through inputs and interactions of multiple stakeholders involved in developing and implementing the concept. CSA aims to provide globally applicable principles on managing agriculture for food security under climate change that could provide a basis for policy support and recommendations by multilateral organizations, such as UNâs FAO. The major features of the CSA approach were developed in response to limitations in the international climate policy arena in the understanding of agricultureâs role in food security and its potential for capturing synergies between adaptation and mitigation. Recent controversies which have arisen over CSA are rooted in longstanding debates in both the climate and sustainable agricultural development policy spheres. These include the role of developing countries, and specifically their agricultural sectors, in reducing global GHG emissions, as well as the choice of technologies which may best promote sustainable forms of agriculture. Since the term Ê»CSAâ was widely adopted before the development of a formal conceptual frame and tools to implement the approach, there has been considerable variation in meanings applied to the term, which also contributed to controversies. As the body of work on the concept, methods, tools and applications of the CSA approach expands, it is becoming clearer what it can offer. Ultimately, CSAâs utility will be judeged by its effectiveness in integrating climate change response into sustainable agricultural development strategies on the ground."
79,14,0.989,Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing : Estimation of Agricultural Crop Biomass Water Equivalent,"When designing experiments, environmental scientists face the challenge of how to accurately represent nature. The idea of sampling patterns and strategies truly reflecting research variables is intrinsic to scientific pursuits. This is particularly true in environmental science due to the complex heterogeneity present in nature. It is vitally important in most studies for researchers to account for natural variations in soil, air, water, and vegetation that can change in space and time. Many strategies focus on the use of strategically placed transects or plot-based sampling campaigns designed to include as many aspects of a particular variable as possible within a study area. Determining how many samples must be taken, whether they are of soil, plant matter, water, etc., depends entirely on the balance of time, effort, and cost while in the field. As a rule of thumb, the more samples that can be gathered correctly, the more trustworthy eventual results will be. Unfortunately, environmental sampling can be time-consuming and expensive depending on its location or the procedures for its procurement. This is one of the reasons why the use of satellite-based remote sensing, computer modeling, and proximal sensing has gained popularity within the scientific community in recent decades. However, the heterogeneity and scale of the environment again make large spatial-scale research difficult and often require in situ validation campaigns to"
243,239,0.989,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"These considerations suggest that if we wish to understand difficulties encountered in HEPMA procurement and implementation, it may be helpful to analyse the evolution and current state of development of the HEPMA market in England, drawing parallels and insights from our studies of the ES technology field. The idea of the maturation of technology fields can be traced back to classic 1970s studies by Abernathy and Utterback who proposed a three stage model (Abernathy and Utterback 1978). In an initial experimentation phase, we see the rapid entrance of diverse and changing products into a new market, the ultimate direction of which is still unknown. As the market and the applications of the technology become better appreciated by suppliers and adopters, in the next, transitional phase, the market begins to converge around what is known as a âdominant designâ with broadly comparable characteristics. In the mature phase, as dominant designs become established, we find concentration of the market around a smaller number of products with higher performance. The focus of supplier efforts shifts from differentiation to enhancing performance and lowering costs within an existing product paradigm. Similar stage models have been advanced to analyse the cyclical evolution of product markets including the software product life cycle (Agarwal and Tripsas 2008; Fincham et al. 1995). âInstitutionalistâ organisation theorists have described the homologous processes by which new âtechnological fieldsâ (Pollock and Williams 2011; Swanson and Ramiller 1997, 2004) emerge and take shape by establishing consensus amongst communities of vendors, consultants and adopters. The establishment of a technological field greatly reduces uncertainties about the characteristics of a technology both for vendors and customers. They are coupled with the emergence and stabilisation of classifications of technologies and criteria for their assessment. Here we reject simplified (e.g. technology management) approaches which take for granted the formation of technological fields and their progression, once established, to maturation and seek a more dynamic, processual account of the evolution of technological fields which explores how boundaries and names may be recast and maturation may be reversed by the emergence of new technical solutions or business models (Fincham et al. 1995). In the ES field we saw the emergence of new kinds of knowledge intermediaries â industry analysts like Gartner Inc. â which capture and collate community experience to advise adopters about available software products and their vendors. By overcoming the asymmetry of access to information between vendor and adopter this provides the âknowledge infrastructureâ needed for the operation of the IT markets for these complex software products whose capacities and fit to the needs of particular adopter organisations cannot be readily established, for example, by inspection (Pollock and Williams 2011, 2016)."
197,154,0.989,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"with urban processes that evolve and develop over long periods of time. This shows how energy transitions create displacements that are reflected within multiple spatio-temporal scales and thematic areas of activity. Vulnerability to domestic energy deprivation thus cannot be considered as a household issue, but rather a phenomenon that is distributed throughout the âenergy chainâ (Chapman, 1989)âan issue that warrants further research in the domain of energy geographies (Calvert, 2015). As argued previously (Bouzarovski et al., 2017) such findings call for a rethink of the conceptual assumptions that inform wider sustainability transitions frameworks, by considering the material and infrastructural characteristics of place and space as contingencies that deserve customized conceptual attention. Domestic energy deprivation does not bring about a passive and reactive set of behaviours and practices within households and institutions (Bouzarovski, Tirado Herrero, Petrova, & Ãrge-Vorsatz, 2016). Rather, the diverse strategies that are articulated with respect to the condition have far-reaching effects on the systemic conditions that underpin the emergence of energy poverty. They can thus potentially challenge the triad of distribution, procedure and recognition that dominates current understandings of the injustices that underpin fuel and energy poverty (Walker & Day, 2012) by introducing notions of spatial justice into the debate (Bouzarovski & Simcock, 2017). The work reviewed in this book also points to the need for developing a more explicit conceptual and policy link between domestic energy deprivation and the implementation of climate policies. Ex ante studies focusing on the co-benefits and multiple benefits of energy efficiency interventions (Ãrge-Vorsatz, Tirado Herrero, Labzina, & Foley, 2012) have highlighted the significant welfare-enhancing effects of thermal retrofitsâa key infrastructural solution often prescribed in the policy-oriented literature. However, high or increasing levels of domestic energy deprivation complicate the application of policies that promote energy vulnerability-enhancing measures, such as renewable feed-in tariffs or surcharges paid by domestic energy users irrespective of income, needs or living conditions. In a number of European countries, the expansion of energy poverty among the general population has been accompanied by the adoption of household strategies orientated towards carbon-intensive and polluting fuels, such as coal or firewood (Bouzarovski et al., 2016). Throughout the book, I have argued in favour of developing a deeper understanding of the manner in which material deprivation both arises out"

For example, efforts to understand the reality of how legal, institutional and policy frameworks can mediate the translation of ecosystem services to benefits (see Chaps. 2 and 4) were driven in large part by stakeholders identifying key issues of interest during the early stages of the research. A highly structured approach was accordingly adopted to ensure the ability to respond to stakeholder priorities and knowledge and ensure that stakeholder expectation of findings were realistic. In addition to the manifest need to match stakeholder needs with research capacity, the views of stakeholders are also integral to the scenario development process described in Chap. 9. This chapter describes the stakeholder engagement process as well as the first two stages of the four-stage scenario development process (see Fig. 10.1), identification of key issues and development of scenario narratives."
264,820,0.989,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"multi-disciplinarity involves two or more disciplines, but in both these cases the disciplines themselves may remain intact. Inter-disciplinarity, on the other hand, involves some sort of hybridising of âmultiâ disciplinesâe.g. chemistry and biology becoming biochemistry. Trans-disciplinarity acquires its transcendence due to disciplines being subsumed in joint problem solving enterprises that may perhaps result in a new form of mathematics. While multi-disciplinarity and trans-disciplinarity offering hybridity of disciplines, the disciplines themselves are not displaced, but instead provide the value interdisciplinarity requires. Meta-disciplinarity transpires in an awareness of relationships and differences between disciplinesâe.g. the contrasting nature of âusing evidenceâ in history and science may be contrasted and thereby clariï¬ed (see Williams et al., 2016). As can be seen from the programme details, presenters covered a wide range of topics under the umbrella of interdisciplinarity. Presenters provided views of interdisciplinarity from several academic disciplines, including mathematics, physics, medicine and music, as well as across much of the spectrum of interdisciplinarity discussed above. In addition, presenters represented a wide cross-section of countries, which added to the notion that interdisciplinarity is indeed of global interest and importance. Of particular note were presentations and posters outside the expected scientiï¬c disciplines, for example, music and poetry. Discussion following each presentation allowed a range of perspectives to be aired. Attendees brought to the discussion the perspectives of many different educational cultures, their affordances and their constraints. The review of the literature carried out as part of the pre-ICME Topical Survey showed that interdisciplinary mathematics education is relatively under-developed as a research subï¬eld. There is some evidence of beneï¬cial outcomes of interdisciplinary work in integrated curricula that often involves projects, with these beneï¬ts typically emphasising motivational, affective and problem-solving learning outcomes. The papers and presentations reinforced these conclusions. Progress in interdisciplinary mathematics education appears to be hampered by a lack of clarity and consensus about the concept of disciplinarity and how to adequately describe âinterdisciplinaryâ interventions and programs, together with a lack of consistency about relevant learning outcomes and how they can be identiï¬ed and measured, and a lack of research on which future work can build. Interdisciplinary mathematics education offers the opportunity to encourage possibly disaffected students to reconsider mathematics. It offers mathematics to the wider world in the form of added valueâe.g. in problem solvingâand, conversely, it offers the added value of the wider world to mathematics. Therefore interdisciplinary mathematics education should be a major topic for mathematics education and can be expected to become much more prominent in educational research and practice. Discussion among the large group of session attendees, almost all of whom attended all main sessions, was fruitful. Plans were made to set up a website for"

As Hybrid OSS communities consist of a mix of companies and independent developers with varying motivations [8], finding a mutually beneficial collaboration model poses various challenges. Several calls exist for further research on management practises in the hybrid OSS arena (De Noni et al., 2013) [9]. LinaÌker et al. (2015) pinpointed the governance structures in open environments and the openness of the software product development process as interesting topics for future endeavors [10]. Hussan et al. (2016) invite research on practical implementations of the software development process to complement the current work in the academic landscape [11]. To address these calls, we investigate how three profit-oriented companies develop OSS-based products with their respective open source software development communities. We compare how they allow external contributors to access their development process and what knowledge they let out of the priorities and decisions that shape the future of the software. With this, we hope to provide new understanding on how the hybrid OSS development model can be formed and managed at the practical level and which factors can be used as design elements when organizing the communityâs collaboration model. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes typical characteristics of hybrid OSS communities, shedding light on the different styles of governance that companies can employ towards their communities. Section 3 presents our research approach for studying the collaboration practices of the case companies that are introduced in Sect. 4.

Drawing on the example of myExperiment, De Roure et al. (2008) propose four key capabilities of what they consider a Social Virtual Research Environment (SVRE): â¢ According to the authors, a SVRE should firstly facilitate the management and sharing of research objects. These can be any digital commodities that are used and reused by researchers (e.g. methods and data). â¢ Secondly, it should have incentives for researchers to make their research objects available. â¢ Thirdly, the environment should be open and extensibleâmeaning that software, tools and services can be easily integrated. â¢ Fourthly, it should provide a platform to action research. Actioning research is, in the authorsâ understanding, what makes a platform an actual research environment. Research objects are in this regard not just stored and exchanged but they are used in the conduct of research (De Roure et al. 2008, p. 182). This depiction of a SVRE does of course not exclude mass computation (the third capability in fact endorses the integration of additional services)âit does, however, clearly focus on the interaction and collaboration between researchers. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that the authorsâ notion of âvirtual social researchâ involves a multitude of additional tools and services enabling"
284,5,0.989,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Preface This book is the result of the collaborative research project Environmental Governance in Latin America (ENGOV) funded by the European Union (EU). For four years, a team of experts from ten Latin American and European academic institutions investigated how environmental governance is currently being shaped in Latin America. In this joint effort, we were driven by our concerns about widespread ecological degradation, poverty and injustice, as well as by our curiosity about the ways in which the emergence of new political regimes and elites, and innovative steps by communities and social organizations, affects governance practices and natureâsociety relations. To understand the possibilities and obstacles for sustainable and equitable natural resource use, a range of case-studies were carried out in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico. Although some of the research topics and cases are not included in this volume, their ï¬ndings have contributed to the discussions and theoretical reï¬ections in the overall analysis. The ENGOV project has been simultaneously challenging and inspiring. The theme of environmental governance is a huge academic enterprise because it addresses complex social relations, practices and views inï¬uencing how societies perceive nature and use natural resources. Combining methods and theories from different ï¬elds of the social sciences is a prerequisite which in practice is fairly demanding. Furthermore, by encompassing political, economic, cultural and environmental changes, formal as well as informal arrangements, and cross-scale connections, the study of environmental governance can easily become a âmission impossibleâ. Arguably this is even more the case for contemporary Latin America, with its variety of local and national conditions facing rapid-paced changes. Finally, collaborating in an international research consortium of ten institutional partners and more than 25 researchers from different disciplines, schools of thought and generations has also proved to be both daring and rewarding. The fact that we spoke in different academic languages and idiom accents was not only a hurdle to tackle during our group discussions, but also forced us to learn from each otherâs approaches and convictions, and the foundations on which these are based.

275,639,0.989,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"21.11 Conclusion There is a deep connection between economics and autonomous systems research, for the simple reason that the two fields have at their core questions about the nature of agency as autonomous decision-making. The difference is roughly that economics is mainly concerned with descriptive models of agency, while artificial intelligence is squarely focussed on engineering prescriptive models. The interface has been, and must be, permeable. Both fields face the same basic issues about the nature of agency and, in particular, suffer from the inadequacy of current approaches with respect to decision-making under conditions of fundamental uncertainty. Previous work [44] in the economic literature has sought to exert influence primarily on economics audiences about poor representations of human agency, has noted the role in artificial intelligence of wishful mnemonics in masking the severe limitations incumbent in standard assumptions, and has concluded that artificial intelligence has not even begun to replicate the abilities of real humans to cope with fundamental uncertainty as a result. This chapter is firstly about raising awareness among machine learning, automated reasoning and robotics communities about the relevance of the economic literature on decision-making under uncertainty. In particular, economic theory distinguishes between stochastic risk and unmeasurable epistemological uncertainty, and between epistemological uncertainty and a deeper notion of ontological uncertainty. Secondly, it is about relaying and extending the mathematical underpinnings of this economics literature. The connection from the basic economic notions of uncertainty to nonlinear dynamics and ergodic theory that has been relatively recently established in economics [13, 50], with epistemological uncertainty and ontological uncertainty formally distinguishable on this basis. I have also sought here to extend this viewpoint with reference to the well established mathematical practices of formulating questions about future behaviours of non-linear systems as computational problems, whereby ontological uncertainty then manifests as formally unsolvability and incompressibility [35, 39]. Yet the formal unsolvability of computational problems is a particularly deep extension to the slightly earlier results establishing the incompleteness of non-trivial systems of formal reasoning, which means that within such systems there are always questions that cannot be answered, even with infinite resources. Ontological uncertainty can perhaps be best understood on this basis: the possibility of self-reference in any system means that some problems we might like to solve, such as predicting what will happen in the future, are paradoxical in the sense of being unresolvable within the system as either true or false. Far from constituting an abstruse irrelevance, the practical consequences in economics of failures to handle this kind of uncertainty are difficult to overstate. The sophisticated risk models heavily implicated in the 2007â2008 GFC [3] are now widely acknowledged as having failed so spectacularly for the precise reason that they fail to address epistemological - let alone ontological - uncertainty. There is abounding circumstantial evidence that the same kinds of failures have been felt"
17,12,0.988,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"The above ï¬ve questions and their concomitant sub-questions might be taken to represent a âbottom upâ introduction to the philosophy in mathematics education, because they start with, interrogate and problematise the practices of teaching and learning mathematics and related issues. A âtop downâ approach might use instead the abstract branches of philosophy to provide the conceptual framework for analysis. Thus it could consider research and theory in mathematics education according to whether it draws on ontology and metaphysics; epistemology and learning theory; social and political philosophy; aesthetics, ethics and axiology (the philosophy of values) more generally; the methodology of mathematics education research; or other branches of philosophy. Ontology and metaphysics have as yet been little applied in mathematics education research (Ernest 2012). Work drawing on aesthetics is still in its infancy (Ernest 2013, 2015; Sinclair 2008). However extensive uses of epistemology and learning theory, social and political philosophy, ethics and methodology can be found in mathematics education research and literature. In addition to the contributions of the substantive branches of philosophy to mathematics education, there are also beneï¬ts to be gained from applying philosophical styles of thinking in our research. For example, many of the constructs we utilise need careful conceptual analysis and critique. I have in mind such widely used ideas as understanding, development, progress, progressivism, mathematical ability, nature/natural, cultural/artiï¬cial, values, objectivity/subjectivity, identity, working like a mathematician, learning, discovery learning, problem solving (including pure, applied, ârealâ and âauthenticâ problems), teaching, assessment, mathematics, knowledge, sex/gender, special needs in mathematics, multiculturalism/antiracism, ethnomathematics, context, both social and task-related, and so on. Understanding is perhaps the most basic and obvious of these terms, so what can deconstructing it add to our knowledge? Can it contain hidden assumptions and pitfalls? First of all, it is based on the peculiar metaphor of âstanding underâ. In what way does this capture its meaning? Synonyms like âgraspingâ, âgetting a handle onâ or âseeingâ it are all based on familiarity through a sensory encounter with meaning,"

344,318,0.988,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"5 Summary and Conclusion This chapter develops the eCGPE as a theoretical framework and an empirically applicable tool for defining, evaluating and designing efficient participatory and evidence-based policy processes. The eCGPE is a sequential dynamic political economy equilibrium model that incorporates five modules that model legislative decisionmaking, the transformation of policies into socioeconomic outcomes, interest mediation via voting and lobbying, political belief formation and policy learning. In contrast to existing political economy models, which highlight the biased incentives of politicians as a main cause of persisting inefficient policies, the CGPE approach explicitly incorporates the lack of adequate political knowledge as another important source of inefficient policy choices. In particular, the CGPE approach incorporates a model of political belief formation and updating to explain how political agents use a combination of observational and communication learning processes to improve their political knowledge. According to our model, the main determinants of the speed of knowledge are the structures of policy networks that reflect communication patterns between governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Based on empirical policy network data, relevant communication structures can be identified. Combining the identified network structures with the"
347,122,0.988,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"We have suggested in this chapter that the main challenges of fisheries governance in the Baltic Sea relate to risk assessmentârisk management interactions and their treatment, communication of different forms of uncertainty, harmonisation of the (interdisciplinary) knowledge base and the organisation of stakeholder participation to improve communication. Based on our case studies, we conclude that current governance structures are not yet capable of fully addressing the problems of scientific uncertainty, interpretations of this uncertainty and connected misunderstandings amongst the different actors in terms of reaching desired outcomes of sustainable fisheries in the Baltic Sea. Increased interactions amongst individual actors, for example, in RACs as well as between different management organisations (e.g. ICES, RAC and the EU Commission), as well as more developed institutional and procedural designs for stakeholder involvement in management and decision-making at the regional level, are urgently needed for improving environmental governance of the Baltic Sea."
341,290,0.988,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Performances and designs built on stationarity and fixed knowledge forms give rise to systematic (i.e. linear, step by step) practice rather than systemic practice that is relational, recursive and circular and characterised by feedback processes, learning and adaptation (Ison 2010). In other words, traditional framings used in water/ catchment governance are no longer adequate to our circumstances. As the commentators cited above argue, new understandings and practices (new paradigms) are needed. What a river/catchment is taken to be is undergoing a shift of historical proportions as exemplified in a move from the framings on which IWRM rests (see below) to the governance of a social-ecological system. The use of the concept ânexusâ is a further shift in framing choice exemplified by Campbell (2014) when he spoke about âconverging insecurities of food, water, energy and climate, and their implications for 21st Century farming systemsâ. In our Systemic Governance Research Program (SGRP) and CADWAGO research (see http://www.cadwago.net/), we are exploring the implications of framing governance in terms of the theory-informed practices (praxis) that can give rise to effective performances amongst multiple stakeholders in contexts of uncertainty and surprise (Ison and Wallis 2011; Ison et al. 2013b). A performance as in a good team, an orchestra, dance or play demands inclusion of the âright actorsâ."
275,245,0.988,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"8.5 Instruments for Measuring Trust While a large body of work on trust in automation and robots has developed over the past two decades, standardized measures have remained elusive with many researchers continuing to rely on short idiosyncratically worded questionnaires. Trust (in automation) refers to a cognitive state or attitude, yet it has most often been studied indirectly through its purported influence on behavior often without any direct cognitive measure. The nature and complexity of the tasks and failures studied has varied greatly ranging from simple automatic target recognition (ATR) classification [33], to erratic responses of a controller embedded within a complex automated system [57] to robots misreading QR codes [30]. The variety of reported effects (automation bias, complacency, reliance, compliance, etc.) mirror these differences in tasks and scenarios [27] and [28] have criticized the very construct of trust in automation on the basis of this diversity as an unfalsifiable âfolk modelâ without clear empirical grounding. Although the work cited in the reply to these criticism in [98] as well as the large body of work cited in the review by [96] have begun to examine the interrelations and commonalities of concepts involving trust in automation, empirical research is needed to integrate divergent manifestations of trust within a single task/test population so that common and comparable measures can be developed. Most âmeasuresâ of trust in automation since the original study [92] have been created for individual studies based on face validity and have not in general benefited from the same rigor in development and validation that has characterized measures of interpersonal trust. âTrust in automationâ has been primarily understood through its analogy to interpersonal trust and more sophisticated measures of trust in automation have largely depended on rationales and dimensions developed for interpersonal relations, such as ability, benevolence, and integrity. Three measures of trust in automation, Empirically Derived (ED), HumanComputer Trust (HTC), and SHAPE Automation Trust Index (SATI) have benefited from systematic development and validation. The Empirically Derived 12 item scale developed by [46] was systematically developed, subjected to a validation study [120] and used in other studies [75]. In [46], they developed their scale in three phases beginning with a word elicitation task. They extracted a 12-factor structure used to develop a 12-item scale based on examination of clusters of words. The twelve items roughly correspond to the classic three dimensions: benevolence (purpose), integrity (process), and ability (performance). The Human-Computer Trust (HTC) instrument developed in [72] demonstrated construct validity and high reliability within their validation sample and has subsequently been used to assess automation in air traffic control (ATC) simulations, most recently in [68]. Subjects initially identified constructs that they believed would affect their level of trust in a decision aid. Following refinement and modification of the constructs and potential items, the instrument was reduced to five constructs (reliability, technical competence, understandability, faith, and personal attachment). A subsequent principal components analysis limited to five factors found most scale items related to these factors."
73,659,0.988,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"In the planning phase of adaptation it is important to undertake a whole-of-business approach to drive a deeper and shared understanding of the issues. This ensures that potential climate change risks, exposure and vulnerability, opportunities and adaptation options were identified for all Macedon Ranges directorates. This included Community Wellbeing, Assets and Operations, Corporate Services, Planning and Environment and Organisational Development. Translating and communicating climate change information and scientific data in a meaningful way ensures that the issues are made real and relevant (CRED 2009; TrÃ¼ck et al. 2010). Much of this comes back to understanding the target audience within local government. Using trusted and authoritative knowledge brokers to deliver climate change and scientific data assists in buy-in and builds greater understanding. The technique of âbackcastingâ, or learned experience from recent extreme events, neutralises climate sceptics to focus on real events and data, and in-house lessons. Significant capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment is built in undertaking the steps in the development and planning phases. The process also enables further clarification of roles and responsibilities, which is important in adaptation planning (NCCARF 2012). This includes defining local government, directorate and personnel area of operation, influence and responsibility in regards to adaptation actions, and the role of other external stakeholders. Risk assessments and vulnerability assessment are two quite different processes in determining the possible impact of climate change (Fig. 24.3). Although risk assessments take into account preventative measures and corrective actions from outside the system to reduce the risk, they generally do not explicitly consider any intrinsic capacity from within a system to adapt to the impacts. As a result, the risk assessment may identify a system as at high risk of impact when in fact it may actually adapt quite well without external support, while others that appeared to be at low risk but do not have the internal capacity to adapt on their own are overlooked (Jacqueline Balston and Associates 2012). While the risk assessment approach governed the process for Macedon Ranges, elements of the vulnerability assessment were also used to assess internal council and external capacity to respond to the impacts of changes in climate variables."

An instructional approach grounded in activity theory takes a decidedly postmodern approach, in that it allows for multiple approaches and recognizes the importance of individual perspectives and those of members of the culture in which the student is operating (Friesen, 2012; Hlynka, 2012; Solomon, 2000). Furthermore, such an approach would welcome the type of critique and dialogue that one would expect to see in a scientific laboratory or conference/publishing venue. Thus, such approaches would likely involve addressing a central, ill-structured problem (Jonassen, 2011; Jonassen & Rohrer-Murphy, 1999). Furthermore, students would be provided considerable latitude to address the problem in the manner that best suited them."
141,10,0.988,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"1 Introduction A System of System (SoS) stems from the integration of existing systems (legacy systems), normally operated by different organizations, and new systems that have been designed to take advantage of this integration. Many of the established assumptions in classical system design, such as e.g., the scope of the system is known, that the design phase of a system is terminated by an acceptance test or that faults are exceptional events, are not justiï¬ed in an SoS environment. This is well represented by Table 1. In this chapter we present the fundamental concepts for Systems of Systems engineering established within the AMADEOS1 project, with the objective of proposing a shared System of Systems vocabulary and deï¬ne an implicit theory about the SoS domain. The overarching concern of our work is to target the reduction of the cognitive complexity needed to comprehend the behaviour of a SoS by the application of appropriate simpliï¬cation strategies [29]. In fact, the considerable cognitive effort needed to understand the operation of a large SoS is the main cause for the substantial engineering (and monetary) effort required to design and maintain many of todayâs Systems of Systems. Our position is that the ï¬rst important step of achieving simplicity is the development of an understandable set of concepts that describes the SoS domain. In fact, if the language used to talk about a domain contains terms with clearly deï¬ned meanings that are shared by a wide part of the domain community, then the communication of ideas among experts is simpliï¬ed. Consequently, starting from a detailed analysis of the existing concepts for the SoS domain (e.g., from the projects DANSE [35], DSoS [7],"
219,70,0.988,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Introduction Land degradation as a global phenomenon occurs in many countries and in very different ecological, socioeconomic and climatic contexts. Estimations suggest that between 20 and 30 % of the global land surface is already degraded (Imeson 2012; Stavi and Lal 2014; Le et al. 2014). Anthropogenic as well as natural drivers of land degradation continue to exist and some even accelerate (see Chap. 7), mainly due to climate change and population growth. Sustainable land management (SLM) and mitigating measures are widely known, but adoption rates remain low. Two explanations for action and inaction prevail: (i) actor-oriented explanations that focus on socio-economic characteristics of the land user, suggesting that resource-poor households do not have the capacity, incentives or resources to invest in land improvement, and (ii) institutional economic explanations that underline the importance of constraining and enabling environments within which the land users take their land-use decisions. This chapter presents a framework that combines and links both perspectives, demonstrating their complementarity. The framework includes the different layers of the institutional environment within which land users take their decisions. It builds on the works of Williamson (2000) and his analytical framework for institutional analysis as well as relevant sections in Nkonya et al. (2011).1 The chapter starts with a review of the existing literature on the action/inaction against land degradation and identiï¬es, by means of four instructive case studies, the knowledge gap in the institutional understanding of this action/inaction. A structured analysis of the four cases reveals that the drivers of land degradation and the actorsâ behaviour related to land degradation are regulated and modiï¬ed through different institutional layers.2 In the second half of the chapter, we list a number of possible institutional responses to land degradation, showing how multiple entry paths can address the issue sustainably. The chapter concludes with policy recommendations and indications for future research."
376,323,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Nonequilibrium Ecology and Resilience Theory David D. Briske, Andrew W. Illius, and J. Marty Anderies Abstract Nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory have transformed rangeland ecology and management by challenging the traditional assumptions of ecological stability and linear successional dynamics. These alternative interpretations indicate that ecosystem dynamics are strongly influenced by disturbance, heterogeneity, and existence of multiple stable states. The nonequilibrium persistent model indicates that plant production and livestock numbers are seldom in equilibrium in pastoral systems because reoccurring drought maintains livestock number below the ecological carrying capacity. However, it has recently been demonstrated that livestock are often in equilibrium with key dry-season resources, even though they may only be loosely coupled to abundant wet-season resources. Similarly, state-andtransition models were initially influenced by nonequilibrium ecology, but they have subsequently been organized around resilience theory to represent both equilibrial dynamics within states and existence of multiple states. Resilience theory was introduced to describe how ecosystems can be dynamic, but still persist as self-organized systems. It envisions that community structure is maintained by ecological processes representing feedback mechanisms and controlling variables to moderate community fluctuation in response to disturbance. Appropriate qualification of equilibrium ecology within resilience theory, rather than its complete replacement by nonequilibrium models, provides more realistic interpretations for both plantâherbivore interactions and vegetation dynamics than does complete reliance on disturbance-driven events. Resilience thinking represents a âhumans-in-natureâ perspective that emphasizes human values and goals and it seeks to guide change in social-ecological systems by creating opportunities for multiple stakeholders to adaptively design management strategies and policies.

169,28,0.988,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"History has been acknowledged for 20 years as an important research element for river management that has been applied, for example, to deï¬ne reference conditions and assess the level of degradation. The evolution of river uses and related ecological conditions, especially in recent decades, has been utilized to show the impact of humans on these ecosystems. Integrating a historical perspective into river management can, however, go beyond these targets (see, e.g., Haidvogl et al. 2014, 2015; Higgs et al. 2014). Just as present river management decisions will inï¬uence future conditions, paths trodden by users in the past have a bearing on todayâs ecology. Sound long-term studies of the natural and societal drivers shaping historical river changes can thus support our understanding of the present situation and identify trajectories of change. In long-term studies taking into account the dynamics of natural forcesâin particular climate change and subsequent altered hydrologic and temperature conditionsâas well as social dynamics (e.g., decision-making processes, main energy sources and technologies, superordinated practices and values) can reveal distinct overarching patterns of river use and management. This can contribute to developing future strategies and plans with lower ecological impacts. This chapter describes major milestones of human river uses and ecological impacts. With some brief mention of Asian river case studies, it highlights especially examples, which are representative of industrialized countries of Europe and North America. In Europe, larger environmental changes of aquatic ecosystems occurred already in ancient and medieval times. European colonists spread practices and techniques of river uses to other areas of the industrialized world after they reached"

It follows that âproject successâ is a multifaceted term that can be measured in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions, expanded economic opportunities within the host country, improved local health outcomes or even in terms of social ideals such as increased gender equity or enhanced participation in decision making processes. The promise of âwin-winâ outcomes associated with environment and development projects is readily critiqued (Visseren-Hamakers et al. 2012; Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016). To add further to the conceptual tangle, the success of the project is contingent upon the householdâs willingness to utilize the technology, a behavioral feature that involves considerations such as cultural appropriateness (Troncoso et al. 2007; Shankar et al. 2014), intra-household dynamics (Shankar et al. 2014), and aftercare (Levine et al. 2013). Globally, Wang et al. (2015) tracked 277 cookstoves, 134 biodigesters projects and 11 water filter projects that were either preparing for registration, registered, or issuing credits with both CDM and other voluntary standards as of June 2014 (Wang et al. 2015). Of this total, 112 projects had issued credits at least once and 222 projects were registered, with the remaining 88 projects in various stages of preparation (idem). Given that these carbon projects have multiple goals, it is likely that evaluations for their âsuccessâ can differ greatly, depending on the goal of interest. The likelihood of unintended negative consequences resulting from a development intervention have been well documented in the general development literature (Ferguson 1994; Scott 1998) and in specific assessments of carbon credit projects. However, existing studies tend to focus on the theoretical merits and pitfalls of market-based approaches either by providing a global assessment of the market (Abadie et al. 2012; Kossoy and Guigon 2012; Climate Policy Initiative 2014; Climate Funds Update 2016) or by utilizing illustrative case studies to bolster a position on the carbon marketâs merits in general (Haya 2007; Bumpus and Cole 2010) or that achieving climate and development co-benefits is context dependent (Simon et al. 2012). Rather than condemn or condone carbon markets as a concept, there is a need to uncover causal mechanisms that can explain variations in development outcomes between carbon project types and designs."
344,39,0.988,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"instruments and induced policy outcomes is difficult. As a result, political actors use simple mental models to understand how policies translate into outcomes. We call these simple mental models policy beliefs. Based on their policy beliefs, political actors derive their individual preferences with respect to policies. Similarly, some authors have recently highlighted the role of biased voter beliefs as a main determinant of inefficient policy choices (Beilhartz and Gersbach 2004; Bischoff and Siemers 2011; Caplan 2007). In particular, the work by Caplan (2007) has been highly recognized in public choice literature, as he has collected an impressive amount of evidence showing persistently biased voter beliefs. Based on his empirical findings, Caplan (2007) draws the rather pessimistic conclusion that democratic mechanisms of preference aggregation naturally lead to the choice of inefficient policies. In this context, two key underlying premises that define the framework of evaluating policy processes are adopted here. The first premise is that biased voter beliefs imply biased voter behavior and hence a biased aggregation of preferences. The second premise is that politicians and lobbyists do not fully understand the complex relationship between political instruments and desired policy outcomes. Hence, beyond biased incentives, lack of political knowledge becomes another important cause of policy failure. The evaluation of policy processes can be based on the comparison between actual, implemented policy choice Î³ actual and the ideal policy choice Î³ ideal : kÎ³ actual Î³ idealk . kk is the Euclidian distance. That is, the evaluation of policy processes should be able to identify political performance gaps as defined above. Policy diagnosis should also allow for the separation of identified performance gaps into incentive-induced and knowledge-based gaps. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation of policy processes should provide the possibility of developing a political therapy, i.e., the derivation of a strategy to reduce identified performance gaps. The latter in particular calls for model-based evaluation methodologies. Our methodology is derived from the model described in Fig. 2. Schematically, a dynamic policy process includes a sequence of political decisionmaking based on actorsâ policy beliefs, the transformation of the selected policy into outcomes via induced policy responses in the economic system, the translation of economic and political outcomes into political support via elections and lobbying and policy learning, i.e., the updating of policy beliefs (see Fig. 2). Policy learning occurs via two mechanisms. First, based on observed outcomes, political actors engage in observational policy learning, i.e., they update their policy beliefs by comparing observed outcomes with the policy outcomes they expected based on their initial policy beliefs. Individual observations, however, are noisy and hence individual observational learning is limited. Accordingly, political actors engage in communication learning, i.e., they update their policy beliefs based on political beliefs communicated by other actors. Within policy processes, communication learning occurs via political mass communications, i.e., the formation of a public opinion, as well as via exclusive political communication within a political elite comprising of relevant politicians and stakeholder organizations. Interestingly, the social organization of political communication processes has a significant"
278,427,0.988,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"This motivation to improve human development standards comes with significant challenges specific to developing countries, due to limited data availability. The IE community can provide significant assistance to developing countries by simplifying and downsizing data requirements to a point which yields sufficiently accurate results to inform policy. It would indeed be counterproductive if developing countries were to wait for economic growth to fuel complex data gathering operations that can in turn inform their sustainable development policies. Some of the relatively simple metrics developed in IE that can be used to inform specific policies are ratios of different materials to measure resource efficiency. These ratios along with the caveats that need to be kept in mind while incorporating them into policies are in Table 11.2. In addition, IE research has developed frameworks and models that capture the complexity of real systems by integrating several IE-based tools, for example the social-ecological-infrastructural systems (SEIS) framework and LCA analysis in EIPs (Ramaswami et al. 2012; Eckelman and Chertow 2013). An example of the socio-economic metabolism approach is advocated in Chap. 6. The SEIS framework is currently being used to assess environmental impacts of emerging cities in USA, China and India (Ramaswami et al. 2015). A similar framework is the Integrative Regional Action Planning (IRAP) framework that integrates planning across undeveloped land, rural and urban regions (Jaderi et al. 2014; Van ZeijlRozema and Martens 2011; Huynen et al. 2004; Lowe 2006). Such integrative frameworks call for cooperation between various stakeholders and institutions for a comprehensive understanding of regions, their impacts and solutions. These inte-"

Promoting growth and food security must draw on the rich literature of the past 50â60 years while also addressing potential structural shifts in the factors that promote growth. This paper summarizes the economic considerations of Climate Smart Agriculture, a concept developed by the FAO to address the complex issue of how to achieve sustainable agricultural growth for food security under climate change. It addresses the lack of coherence on the CSA approach by building a formal basis of the CSA concept and methodology. We do this by posing a dynamic optimization problem wherein a social planner seeks to maximize expected discounted welfare associated with agriculture of the population they serve, both now and in the future. We analyze constraints, choices, and features of design of CSA to illustrate on the concept can be applied across a range of locations and conditions. This has implications for research, innovation, and policy design."
278,395,0.988,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Abstract Sustainable development is not a simple, singular and well-tested path. It needs an interdisciplinary examination of resource use patterns, ecological heritage, demographics and cultural values. Industrial ecology, owing to its emphasis on using a holistic approach, can provide a valuable platform to draw out sustainable strategies and policies for developing countries to implement. It can offer a paradigm within which IE methods and tools can inform responses to local development challenges. Within this paradigm, sustainable industrial, rural and urban development strategies and policies in developing countries should follow from IE research and analyses. A SWOT analysis of IE in developing countries highlights strengths of high economic growth and threats from outdated policies and inadequate industrial ecology awareness in the policy making and governing spheres. Examination of the IPAT equation in the context of developing countries highlights the role that new technological hubs such as China and India can play, the significance of increasing affluence among ânew consumersâ in the developing world and the role of population in managing resources sustainably. Research in IE since its introduction to the global south around the mid-1990s has primarily focused on two concepts of IE â cleaner production and eco-industrial parks â largely due to the impetus of development organizations. Other studies using the IE lens and tools have shown the potential of the IE paradigm in developing countries. These studies have highlighted the importance of focussing on scarce resources such as water, examining the possibilities of using well-tested technologies and evaluating the long-term maintenance of new technologies and practices before recommending their implementation. New policies in the developing world can gain from the IE community in terms of assistance in simplifying and downsizing data requirements, application of solutions to contemporary sustainability challenges and framing effective policies based on IE concepts."

This approach was adopted because it can assist entities to connect better with the local people affected or dealing with energy issues. It can transform ï¬eld data into actionable ideas, assist the team to ï¬nd new opportunities and help to increase the speed and effectiveness of creating new solutions [47]. There are many models that represent the human-centred design process such as participatory design, ethnography, lead user approach, contextual design, co-design, co-creation and empathic design [62, 109, 119]; Beyer and Holzblatt [4]; Bennette [1, 3, 100]; EPICS [34, 47]; Steen et al.

These types have evolved into highly complex entities that are held together by a number of complementary institutions. None of these models consistently exhibits superior performance in terms of social welfare, making it difï¬cult to determine which model the European Union as a whole should strive to converge towards. The observation that the European Union overall suffers from a lack of innovation motivates the analysis in this study. We identify entrepreneurship and innovation as the relevant aspects that policy reforms should strive to improve. Entrepreneurship and innovation are crucial for the growth of the polities in which they occur and for their effect on growth on a global scale.

277,481,0.988,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"15.1 Introduction The Danish integration and immigration policies are among the most restrictive of their kind within Western Europe. As in other countries integration is a highly contested policy-domain and a salient policy issue. It is also one of the policydomains most subject to change over the last two decades. This can raise the question of what has driven this development â new types of problems or the scope of the problem, political convictions or evidence-based research? It can be argued that the utilisation of external expert knowledge at national level has been minimal and the research-policy relationship can perhaps best be considered as a âpickand-chooseâ model where politicians and policymakers have employed the research that supports the hegemonic policy-frame of integration and definition of problems. Research thereby serves a legitimising function rather than an instrumental function (JÃ¸rgensen 2011). This characterisation at the same time stands in contrast to the importance and emphasis given to evidence-based policymaking. Subsequently, this situation may lead to disenchantment about research-policy dialogues. While the use of external research arguably has been limited there has in contrast been a proliferation of in-house research institutions within the political system itself, although often with limited budgets. This chapter examines the role and impact of the scientific community on integration- and immigration policymaking. This analysis will be elaborated by three cases investigating, first; the âWorkgroup on Burkas and other Similar Clothingâ, which reported in 2009â2010 secondly; the development of the Action"

Their peripatetic forms of expertise are also transformed by the journeys that they make. â¢ Third, mobile policies rarely travel as complete âpackagesâ, they move in bits and piecesâas selective discourses, inchoate ideas, and synthesized modelsâ and they therefore âarriveâ not as replicas, but as policies already in transformation. They do not simply travel, intact, from sites of invention to sites of emulation. Instead, through their very movement they remake connections between these sites, evolving in form and effect through mobility (Peck and Theodore 2012, p. 23). That means high rates of policy mobility are not leading to some sort of policy monopoly because new forms of uneven spatial development and new localizations are constantly being produced. Hence, there is no expectation of global convergence in these open-ended processes. â¢ Fourth, the resulting dynamic in the policy making process is not one of simple emulation and linear replication across the policymaking sites, but a more complex process of nonlinear reproduction. Policies will therefore mutate and morph during their journeys. â¢ Fifth, the spatiality of policy making is not âflattened into some inert plane or transaction space, marked only with jurisdictional boundaries, across which transfers occur, but in terms of a three-dimensional mosaic of increasingly reflexive governance shaped by multi-directional forms of cross scalar and interlocal policy mobilityâ (Peck and Theodore 2010, p. 170). In sum, diffusion scholars tend to be preoccupied with accounts of rationally selected best (or better) practices moving between jurisdictional spaces. They neglect the fact that the policy making process involves âa series of contexts from the production of the policy to its movement and new point of ï¬xityâ (Dale and Robertson 2012). The mobility approach asserts that these contexts are not neutral backdrops or convenient landing places, rather they are co-constitutive social spatial contexts able to produce âhybrid mutations of policy techniques and practices across dynamized institutional landscapesâ (Peck 2011, p. 2), including scale, territory, place, locality and the global (Cochrane and Ward 2012). One of the methodological challenges in studying mobile policies is to follow them, to trace their twists and localized effects. In essence, this requires an ability to trace power through the set of relations associated with policy mobility and mutation from one context to another."
170,131,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"subject at hand not only as another issue in a world of constrained budgets but as part of the solution to such issues. While the discussion on the policy cycle and locus might be more clearly stated, the discussion of the context for policies tends to seem elusive. As Avgerou (2010) has mentioned in the case of ICTs, oversimplifying context as a different âlocal cultureâ adds little value on understanding the interactions of people and technology in the developing world. With regard to policy context, it may involve understanding the interaction between policy and research, political systems, electoral processes, structure of governments, and so on. For the purpose of simplifying our understanding regarding the politics of implementing ICT4D initiatives and the role research can play in the process, I would argue for focusing on understanding the rational and value-driven aspect of policy problems. Hoppe (2010), for instance, looks into two dimensions of a policy problem: on the one hand, the level of certainty regarding relevant knowledge for the policy process and, on the other hand, the level of consensus on relevant norms and values. The first dimension is rational and relates to what is known about the problem at hand and how stakeholders react to such knowledge. Is knowledge valid, trustworthy, and relevant? The second dimension refers to values surrounding the problem and whether stakeholders agree or disagree on how the problem is defined and the values that should guide its solution. This way of thinking about the political context focuses on the relationship among the stakeholders involved in relation to their rational and value-based interpretation of the problem at hand. Some of the questions that could be seen from this perspective involve both the evidence and the value surrounding decisions on the role of the state and the provision and support of ICTs. Furthermore, it would be interesting to explore the perceptions of stakeholders. For instance, it could be interesting to examine how policy actors see technology, either as something that should be imported from the developed world or constructed locally or the result of the articulation of imported and local knowledge. It could also be interesting to explore if ICTs are seen as a disruptive or progressive force of development (Avgerou 2010), the expected uses of ICTs (Harindranath and Sein 2007), and how they would gauge the success of an ICT policy. Research in the realm of ICT4D-related policies and its politics is the basis to be able to plan research programmes that can respond to the challenges of public policy. This research allows understanding of the setting where ICT4D research would interact with policy and politics and sheds light on the complexities of policymaking and the adoption of ICTs in public programmes, projects, and regulations."
264,503,0.988,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"The Role of Diagrams and Gestures in Geometry Education Research highlighting the role of diagrams and gestures has largely emerged out of recent emphases on the semiotic and embodied nature of geometry thinking and learning (e.g. Bartolini Bussi & Baccaglini-Frank, 2015; Bartolini Bussi & Mariotti, 2008; Ng & Sinclair, 2015a, b). Here we consider historical-cultural perspectives that underscore the role of semiotic processes and artefacts in geometry teaching and learning. In doing so, we highlight embodiment perspectives that stress the important roles of gestures and diagrams in geometry teaching and learning.

This work, when combined with the studies noted above on the semiotic and embodied nature of geometry thinking and learning, provides a clear indication of the importance of encouraging learners to engage in more gesturing and diagramming.

While such approaches may be an inherent characteristic of the academic approach, there is the potential and fairly serious risk of confusing practitioners and policymakers seeking to guide investment to initiatives that produce impactful results. From this review we consider two issues as significant. First, trust is highlighted as a mechanism factor that leads to adoption. As the poor relies more on physical money and face-to-face relationships and mediations to exchange money, issues of trust may be important for future research, to understand more of its functions and how to manage it. It is important to note how the literature reports that trust can be transferred, being this a remarkable feature to be applied by mFinance practitioners. Second, the review has come through interesting literature, discussing and deepening issues of affordability. Even though it is considered a main barrier for adoption, the literature shows that cost is relevant only for some groups, showing that the poor should be thought of as a heterogeneous group. That being said, it is the rare study that focused on the poor. Indeed, despite the rhetoric (potential is a term much associated in the literature with mFinance) and the related optimism, there is little evidence that mFinance has made a substantive impact on the well-being and empowerment of the poor. Certainly there is evidence that mobile phones are being widely accessed and used by the poor; the uptake of mFinance services is sketchy at best, with little conclusive evidence of their benefits to those at the bottom of the pyramid. Assessing the few papers that focus on outputs from the perspective of the ICT4D Value Chain (Heeks and Molla 2009), it appears to be that almost all the outputs may be categorised as outcomes of financial inclusion, cost savings and improved communication. Nonetheless, there is no study bringing evidence of net beneficial financial impacts, comparing regular finance services and transformational mFinance ones and balancing invisible costs to access the latter. In our opinion the next aims to be assessed in mFinance research projects should focus on development impacts as outlined previously in terms of capabilities and empowerment. Towards this end, the definition of impact has largely been examined within a financial lens, ignoring the changes that are wrought in individual and community contexts. As one example, broadening the impact of mFinance to encompass gender perspectives may contain revelations about the pressures being exerted upon traditional patriarchal structures by the access to savings, investment and entrepreneurship by women with mobile phones and the resultant fissures and power struggles that accompany such transformational social change. Alternative approaches may understand contributions to well-being, including the capabilities approach (Sen 2001) and sustainable livelihood framework, stressing social inclusion and development domains such as improvements in poverty alleviation, living conditions, education, health (World Economic Forum 2011)"

This section describes a text mining technique to quantify possible linkages between decision-making and satellite Earth observation. Text mining retrieves high quality information from text data using statistical and mathematical techniques. In the mid-1980s, labor-intensive manual work was the primary approach to text mining. Advances in computing technology over the past few decades have allowed the automation of text mining methods and the development of many useful computer-coded tools. Text mining is now widely applied in many ï¬elds, not only in science but also in marketing, for example for the design of new products using information from customer surveys. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are essential. NLP is the analysis of human language so that computers can understand natural languages as human do. With the assistance of human experts, NLP techniques are capable of providing a way to verify the detected relationship across different text collections. Below we describe an investigation into the role of satellite Earth observation in the decision-making process for the Montreal Protocol. A quantitative linkage between the decision-making process and satellite Earth observation is then described."

The PAR Model explains disasters as the âintersection of the natural hazard and the processes that generate vulnerabilityâ (Wisner and Blaikie 2004; Blaikie and Brookfield 1987; Birkmann 2006). These processes, explained in part by political ecology, are categorized as root causes, dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions, as shown in Fig. 11.2, and are based on physical, political, economic and social environments and variables. For this research, the analysis included the role of DRE systems in improving the dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions that decrease vulnerability as well as how DRE systems can be more robust in order to decrease t impact of the hazards on them, and reducing the overall risk of the disaster."
271,330,0.988,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"public complaints of âimmoralâ or âinadequateâ (communicative) performance on the part of actors involved within the crisis and their loss of reputation. Constellations of actors, process dynamics and âarenasâ of these crisis-related negotiationsâfor example, public debates in generalâmay change under conditions of deep mediatization and with changing media environments. With the emergence of digital media and hyperlinked connections, we are dealing with a certain change in the preconditions of public communication. Those âformerly known as the audienceâ (Rosen 2006) are able to immediately comment on media coverage, to blog or tweet, and gain public visibility and resonance with their own inputs and positions, thus strengthening the diversity of viewpoints available that complement traditional media (cf. Baden and Springer 2014). The implications of the changes alongside shifting actor constellations with communicators beyond organized media institutions as âprofessional producersâ are controversially discussed in academic discourse. Such discourses emphasize the potentials to foster interaction and dialogue (cf. Debatin 2011), to improve deliberative qualities of debates (cf. Papacharissi 2004) or, contrarily, the radicalization of public debates via moralization, elements of scandalization (Imhof 2014) or even incivility, flaming and hate speech (cf. Sobieraj and Berry 2011; Friemel and DÃ¶tsch 2015; Stroud et al. 2015; Suhay et al. 2015). The latter tendency is generally discussed for virtual online communication, often attributed to the possibilities and dysfunctions of anonymous communication (Averbeck-Lietz 2014). However, there are few empirical findings that shed light on specific communicative practices and interaction patterns under conditions of deep mediatization (Neuberger 2014) or in blog communication, including blog readersâ comments (Baumer et al. 2008). So, how to characterize communicative practices and communicative constructions of norms and values in the actor constellation of debates in financial blogs? Ways of communicating about moral problems and processes of (re)negotiating norms and values are reflected by two at first sight rather different approaches and research traditions: by JÃ¼rgen Habermasâs concept of âpractical discourseâ relating to his model of deliberation and Thomas Luckmannâs and JÃ¶rg Bergmannâs social constructivist concept of âmoralizationâ. More or less contrary to Habermasâs dictum that âpractical discoursesâ deal with moral problems (Arens 1997; Habermas 1990) and despite reflections on âcompetitiveâ or âplebiscitoryâ discourses with potentially"

The potential gains of international elective placements for students are well-documented (see Brookï¬eld 1995; Elit et al. 2011; Murdoch-Eaton and Green 2011) and encompass in general terms, both professional and personal development and the acquisition of new knowledge in and of different contexts (Ackerman 2010). In more speciï¬c terms, these positive impacts for students are believed to include: the development of clinical skills in a new context; knowledge of and experience in different health systems; professional development; the development of generic skills, including organisational skills, communication, negotiation, self-evaluation, cultural competence (Jeffrey et al. 2011), compassion towards patients, awareness of resource use, conï¬dence, goal setting, widening studentsâ perspectives, independence, and personal growth; reï¬ective questioning of both the challenges and assumptions of practices; greater understanding of different value systems; and âsocial accountabilityâ (Brookï¬eld 1995; Elit et al. 2011) leading to a range of âsocially responsibleâ educational outcomes (Murdoch-Eaton and Green 2011).

Based on a comparison of the average performance of the randomly selected treatment and control groups, the impact of the policy program can be statistically evaluated. While experimental approaches can be applied for ex post and ex ante policy evaluation, a huge drawback of this approach is that it is extremely expensive and, for many policies, it is impossible to design sophisticated field experiments allowing a quantitative evaluation. In this case, other econometric procedures based on observational data are available that allow one to identify the true impact of a policy program assuming a non-random selection of treatment and non-treatment groups. These econometric approaches can be subdivided into non-parametric and parametric approaches. An increasingly popular non-parametric approach to policy evaluation is matching on observable factors, especially propensity score matching (PSM) (Caliendo and Hujer 2006). Matching and other econometric methods that build on the idea of controlling for observable factors have clear limitations. The policy impact is very often determined by factors that are unobserved by the researcher. This implies that PSM delivers biased results or that policy impact is heterogeneous across participants. In order to get around these problems, alternative methods have been developed. They are used to emulate experimental settings using observational data, i.e., ânaturalâ experiments, such as the instrumental-variable approach and the regressiondiscontinuity approach, or panel-data-based methods that aim to account for endogeneity. A general cutback of all statistical models, however, is the fact that they are limited to causal inferences, i.e., empirical testing on the question of whether a given policy program achieved its intended outcome or not. In general, they are not alone suitable to elucidate the question of why or how a policy program works. Therefore, the best approach to policy evaluation is to combine model-based and econometric methods as complementary approaches, where econometric techniques are applied to identify causal relations between specific policy programs (Î³) and central economic factors (Î¸), and model-based techniques to analyze the impact of a change in these economic factors on central outcome indicators (z). The transformation function T(z, Î³) is separated into two parts: (i) a policy impact function Î¸ Â¼ PI(Î³) describing the relationship between policy interventions and the economic factors Î¸, and (ii) a policy outcome function PO(z, Î¸) describing the linkages between the economic factor Î¸ and policy outcomes z. Econometric methods are more suitable for tackling the policy impact function, whereas economic models do a better job of tracking the policy outcome function."

My reference to peopleâs âwillingnessâ to undertake research is perhaps superfluous, given that I interpret capacity as including this, but I include it explicitly to factor in the importance of motivation and attitudinal preparedness. Researcher development constitutes a speciï¬c form of professional developmentâ it involves peopleâs development of the research-related elements of their professionalism and professional lives. It is therefore a sub-category of professional development, so to understand it we need to understand professional development, or human development, more broadly. The complex ecologies of peopleâs lives are becoming increasingly recognised as the fusion of work and personal life; development that occurs in a professional or work context, and that enhances oneâs capacity to undertake oneâs work, must inevitably impinge upon or influence the attitudes, viewpoints, knowledge, understanding, and skills that may be applied to oneâs life as a whole, and vice versa: a point that is implicitly incorporated into Erautâs (2004) thesis on workplace learning. My conceptualisation of researcher developmentâmy understanding of what it isâincorporates this more holistic interpretation of development.

Clearly, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat modification. To advance ecological understanding, we have highlighted a number of more specific research needs across all themes in this chapter. We further stress the following key research directions as particularly worthy of pursuit, many of which have been summarized in different context for mammals in general (e.g., Willig 2001). 1. Geographic and taxonomic biases toward the Neotropics and a focus on just one bat family, Phyllostomidae, need to be overcome. Although research efforts in Southeast Asia are gaining momentum (Kingston 2013), Africa deserves greatly intensified research activities. As technological advances now make acoustic sampling of aerial insectivorous bats increasingly time- and costefficient, this ensemble should regularly be targeted in ecological research, including environmental impact assessments. 2. Research should be broadened to encompass the full spectrum of possible responses at the level of populations, ensembles, assemblages, and metacommunities. Novel mechanistic insights could be gained by studies that assess behavioral responses to particular types of habitat conversion or habitat fragmentation. Similarly, studies are needed to investigate physiological and immune responses, as well as disease susceptibility across a broad range of host and vector species. A better understanding of the genetic effects on bats from habitat modification requires integrated research on a suite of different species that explore the link between patterns of genetic variation and speciesâ ecological and life-history traits. In general, the way in which species traits and"
330,268,0.988,Dynamics of Long-Life Assets : From Technology Adaptation to Upgrading the Business Model,"1 Introduction Knowledge management has emerged as a major factor for sustainability in the increasingly evolving and competitive marketplace of todayâs modern manufacturing industry (Pan and Leidner 2003; Patel et al. 2012). Numerous knowledge management principles have been proposed over the years (Davenport 1996; Allee 1997; Studer et al. 1998; Luen and Al-Hawamdeh 2001), including research that has linked the concept of communities of practice (CoP) with organisational knowledge management (Lave and Wenger 1991; Brown and Duguid 1991; Wenger 1998; Wenger and Snyder 2000; Storck and Hill 2000; Wenger et al. 2002; Ardichvili et al. 2003; DubÃ© et al. 2006; Eckert 2006; Du Plessis 2008; Scarso and Bolisani 2008). Wenger et al. (2002) deï¬ned CoPs as, âa group of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basisâ. It is through the process of regular interaction that members gain knowledge (Du Plessis 2007), for example, engineers working on a problem, university students studying together or managers sharing organisational information (Wenger 2009). This shared involvement over time, allows members of the community to develop opinions, ideas and ways of performing that deepens their knowledge and expertise on a particular subject or process, as they participate in practices and develop a common history (Gunawardena et al. 2009). In the past, the size and scope of a CoP has been determined by geographical boundaries. However, recent advances in computer technology and Web 2.0 applications now allow for virtual communities to be established. Virtual communities are a speciï¬c type of CoP that uses a web-based platform to provide an environment where geographically distributed members can interact, and share information, knowledge and expertise (Rothaermel and Sugiyama 2001). This allows them to overcome the geographical limitations of traditional CoPs and although, members of a virtual community may participate in telephone conferences and face-to-face meetings, most interaction will involve the posting or viewing of information through web-based technology (Andrews 2002). The ability of virtual communities to enable collaborations over time and across organisational boundaries provides the flexibility required for the strategic management of knowledge within industrial manufacturing. Interaction between the members includes distribution of news through events, announcements, and publications; problem solving opportunities from question and answer postings and best practice forums; and communication mediums such as discussion groups (Koh et al. 2007). Virtual communities have the potential to access information from different devices, and through interaction with other members, data or virtual objects (Hibbert and Rich 2006). The management of knowledge using the concept of virtual communities has the potential to increase the overall productivity and innovation of the organisation (Chiu et al. 2006)."

He poses that a subject to be examined by teachers and researchers âis whether, by drawing studentsâ attention to the reformulating process and given them practice in it, we can improve their problem solving performanceâ (p. 130). He also points out that problems may be a mathematical formulation as a result of exploring a situation and, in that sense, âschool exercises in constructing mathematical models of a situation presented by the teacher are intended to provide students with experiences in formulating problems.â (p. 131). Another important section of Kilpatrickâs work (1987) is Processes of Problem Formulating, in which he considers association, analogy, generalization and contradiction. He believes the use of concept maps to represent concept organization, as cognitive scientists Novak and Gowin suggest, might help to comprehend such concepts, stimulate creative thinking about them, and complement the ideas Brown and Walter (1983) give for problem posing by association. Further, in the section âUnderstanding and developing problem formulating abilitiesâ, he poses several questions, which have not been completely answered yet, like âPerhaps the central issue from the point of view of cognitive science is what happens when someone formulates the problem? (â¦) What is the relation between problem formulating, problem solving and structured knowledge base? How rich a knowledge base is needed for problem formulating? (â¦) How does experience in problem formulating add to knowledge base? (â¦) What metacognitive processes are needed for problem formulating?â It is interesting to realize that some of these questions are among the unanswered questions proposed and analyzed by Cai et al. (2015) in Chap. 1 of the book Mathematical Problem Posing (Singer et al. 2015). It is worth stressing the emphasis on the need to know the cognitive processes in problem posing, an aspect that Kilpatrick had already posed in 1987, as we just saw."

Drawing on theoretical insights and grounded research, the SVP operationalised the principle of âco-presenceâ to protect against lone working and labour substitution and foster the kinds of relationships conducive to optimal knowledge exchange and co-learning. Recognition of the externality effects (unintended consequences) associated with service delivery (by volunteers) has led to an increasing emphasis on âcapacity-buildingâ amongst key stakeholders and funders. And, in most cases, this has been interpreted to imply that professional volunteers should be primarily engaged in training/education and knowledge transfer activities. Chapter 3 reported evidence of the role that professional volunteers (in carefully structured programmes) can play as âboundary spannersâ and knowledge brokers. However, whilst transferring knowledge is evidently possible, it also reï¬ected on the failure of these approaches to stimulate and sustain lasting and effective systems change. Put simply, the knowledge is being shared but the impact is minimal and short-lived, rarely extending beyond volunteer stays. Chapter 4 addresses the âwhyâ question: why is systems change so elusive even in an environment of carefully managed knowledge transfer, translation and exchange? These concerns, drawing directly on a wealth of lived/empirical evidence, stimulated the authors to search for theoretical insights capable of throwing light on the dynamics involved and informing future interventions. It is highly unusual to place a chapter of this nature towards the end of a book. The fact that it is where it is reï¬ects the essentially iterative quality of our research journey and the inter-weaving of theory with empirical work. In this case, it is the empirical work that led to our search for new theoretical ideas to help us to understand our ï¬ndings as they emerged and then, in turn, stimulate new empirical questions. Theories exist to facilitate understanding and explain social phenomenon. Sadly, they are (almost always) associated with the construction of concepts and language that render them inaccessible to anyone outside the narrow disciplinary conï¬nes responsible for their development. Disciplinary silos tend to generate exclusive language that restricts the very objectives of theorisation (understanding) to the point at which small groups of people are essentially communicating only with each other. This chapter seeks to interpret a complex (if not comprehensive) range of theory to assess the potential for more holistic, multi-disciplinary, insights into the dynamics of health worker behaviour."

Other research (e.g., Andersson, 2010) has underscored the importance of fostering the domains of conceptual knowledge (e.g., place value, base-ten system, relationships within and between arithmetic operations) and procedural knowledge. The research undertaken by Ennemoser and Krajewski (2007), Pedrotty Bryant et al. (2008), WiÃmann et al. (2013) and Pï¬ster et al. (2015) showed signiï¬cant effects for such interventions with primary school students. Intervention studies at secondary level have often focused on direct instruction and âdrill and practiceâ teaching (Maccini et al. 2007). Nevertheless, Woodward and Brown (2006) and Moser Opitz et al. (in press) reported having successfully implemented a middle school program emphasizing conceptual understanding of primary arithmetic and problem solving. With regard to the settings in which interventions have been implemented, research results are inconsistent. For example, a meta-analysis by Ise et al. (2012) of studies from German-speaking countries showed one-to-one training to have advantages over small group interventions, computer-based programs, and interventions integrated into the classroom. However, Moser Opitz et al. (in press) found a signiï¬cant effect for an intervention in middle school which was partly integrated in the classroom teaching. Taken together these results present challenges: First, it is not always clear what is meant by âguided instructionâ or âexplicit instructionâ. Second, even if some of the studies focus on conceptual understanding, the interventions reported do not cover the whole range of mathematical domains, but focus on topics that are known to be âstumbling blocksâ for manyâbut not for allâstudents with learning difï¬culties in mathematics. Developing interventions for students with learning difï¬culties in mathematics is, therefore, a âbalancing actâ between giving guidance and taking into account the learners strategies and concepts; and focussing on well known âstumbling blocksâ without forgetting that mathematics means more than arithmetic."

The community and domestic units (blood-related or legal and ritual family units in this case) are the social institutions that mediate the causes and consequences of migration at the material and symbolic level. From a social psychological perspective, much mainstream research linked to justice in Mexico, Latin America, and North America (e.g. research into difference, discrimination, racism, violence, personality, identity, gender, inter-group relations, cooperation, and competition) has been undertaken from an individual and group perspective, leaving behind or in second place anthropological, societal, and sociological considerations.5 This has to do with the influence and weight of the behaviourist perspective, which can be traced back to figures such as G.W.

The recent advancements of tools and methods to study the response of aquaculture technology to environmental loading such as winds, waves, currents and other mechanical impacts describe above serve as the basis for the presented studies. Technological challenges and existing obstacles due to the high-energetic environment are discussed at the end. Within the ï¬rst two case studies, currently available potential and challenges of aquaculture is discussed in light of its applicability towards harsher environments and high-energy impacts from winds and waves. Then, we extend our analysis and the conclusions drawn from those ï¬rst two case studies and present a unique third case study. Therein, existing aquaculture cage technology is thoroughly tested as it is innovatively attached to a commonly used offshore wind energy converter foundation, called a tripile foundation. For the ï¬rst time, such a multi-use concept was tested under laboratory conditions with valuable conclusions and inter-comparisons between existing and anticipated offshore technologies being reported in the discussion and conclusion chapter."
49,371,0.988,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"4 Conclusions and Future Work We have showed that the MTRNN model was able to learn eight different behavioral sequences. These constitute the motor primitive for ongoing experiments for the learning of action and language compositionality. Current developments involve the use of three additional self-organizing maps, linked to the MTRNN, and trained to represent simple linguistic inputs, as well as the object shapes and color features, obtained from images fed through logpolar transform inspired by human visual processing. This extension will facilitate our investigation of language learning. In particular, our next experiments will be addressing a specific linguistic hypothesis first proposed by the cognitive psychologist and linguist Michael Tomasello. The hypothesis, which is also known as the verb island theory, predicts that verbal argument structures are learned on a purely itemspecific basis [30]. In other words, children do not learn that adult-like verb constructions can be combined with certain types of nominals and clauses, e.g. to get a transitive directobject structure. Rather, children acquire verb concepts by developing this knowledge on an item-by-item basis where the understanding of verbs is at first limited to the context where these verbs appeared. Consequently, the general notion of transitive construction and direct object is an abstraction that occurs only during later developmental stages when a critical mass of these verb islands have been attained and thus recognized as the instances of the same general underlying (sensorimotor) structure through the process of semantic analogy [31]. During the later developmental stages children are exposed to more and more construction types where different semantic roles are linked in a similar way and as a result the involved syntactic categories will be abstracted into subjects and objects [32]. The first planned experiment will investigate the role of semantic similarities between different words during early language acquisition. In particular, the hypothesis addressed by this experiment is whether a generalization to unheard sentences is easier in condition where all learned events are of the same semantic type. Though conceptually simple, this experiment will constitute the first viable extension of the already conducted research within the iTalk Project. In addition, these problems are also discussed in child development research and therefore this work could provide useful insights."

Empowerment: place decision-making (and sometimes implementation) in the hands of the public. The degree of involvement is a critical point in PP, because it inï¬uences all processes, in particular, the choice of participative technique. The lower levels of PP consist of one-way ï¬ows of information (either from the parties involved to decisionmakers or vice versa), whereas the upper steps are characterized by the existence of two-way ï¬ows (Videira et al. 2006; Demetropoulou et al. 2010). At least 30 different participatory techniques have been applied in IRBM (Mostert 2003). The ï¬rst step of PP involves informing the public to create a foundation for participation. This can be achieved by leaï¬ets, brochures, websites, and maps (CIS 2003; Ridder et al. 2005). Through consultation and collaboration processes, the government makes documents available for written comments, organizes a public hearing, or actively seeks the comments and opinions of the public through, for instance, surveys and interviews, (online) questionnaires, or public hearings or role playing games (CIS 2003; Ridder et al. 2005). Interactive Web GIS applications are promising tools to record public reactions that reï¬ect local knowledge, thereby linking public comments with geographic positions or spatial coordinates that connect discussion with the speciï¬c reality of local culture and environment (CIS 2003). The higher levels of PP imply that the public is invited to contribute actively to the planning process by discussing issues and contributing to the solution. Shared decision-making implies that interested parties not only participate actively in the planning process but also become (partly) responsible for the outcome. Appropriate tools for these levels of PP are, among others, workshops, review sessions, scenario building, and round table conferences (CIS 2003; Ridder et al. 2005; Maurel et al. 2007). Group sessions to deï¬ne the problem can be mediated through model building to identify key relationships related to the problem. Modeling can be done at the conceptual level, or with mathematical simulation to look at problem dynamics, or with social simulation or role-playing of social relations (see Chap. 16). As an example of the latter approach, âcitizen jury,â is an interesting participatory technique where a group of randomly selected people, who represent a microcosm of their community, are paid to attend a series of meetings to learn about and discuss a speciï¬c issue and make public their conclusions.

Another branch of the research has been investigating the âeconomic valueâ of culture. In this field, two approaches can be followed: the first one is focused on the âinstitutional valueâ of culture and analyses impacts associated to macroeconomic effects generated by cultural production; the second one is aimed at investigating the âmicro-economic valueâ, meant as peopleâs preferences expressed by price or willingness to pay3. Literature based upon the âinstitutional valueâ of culture has inspired the current definition of cultural industry, frequently used by governments and institutions while undertaking a cost-benefits analysis of public financial support to be granted to the cultural industry. The âmicro-economic valueâ has been less explored by scholars and policy makers. This perspective is deeply connected to the economic value of cultural products, as well as to the cultural firm itself. The underestimation of this perspective has caused the current distance between cultural industries and financial markets: investments are inspired by expectations and measures of the risk-return factors inherent to the projects, as well as the rating of the company that benefits from the financing. Therefore, those analyses do not consider macroeconomic impacts, nor cultural or intrinsic value. In this perspective, the philosophical discussion about culture is not relevant â though very interesting by the way â on the contrary, theories based upon economic value and focused on a mere empirical approach are crucial at this point of our study. It is then quite useful to anticipate that the inclusion of audiovisual within the cultural industry is mostly due to theories inspired by âinstitutional valueâ, more than the âintrinsic valueâ of culture.

242,1152,0.988,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract This chapter provides concluding reflections from a set of nineteen case studies of transnational and intranational migration and mobility. It contrasts the âsedentary biasâ present in policy regimes and associated thought centred on nation-states, where movement is seen as exceptional, including normatively exceptional, with the centrality of movement in the processes of socio-economic change and evolution, particularly those promoted under capitalist systems of economic organization. While market capitalist and nation-state principles of organization differ, they combine in hybrid systems, such as those currently being elaborated in policy regimes for temporary migrant workers, to exploit migrant labour. Many of these arrangements mirror the indentured labour regimes of earlier eras. The chapter presents by contrast a perspective based on principles of human rights and human security that uses a global framework both for understanding and for evaluation and then adds an explicit gender-aware enrichment of that perspective, in order to do justice to the special vulnerabilities and exploitation of womenâs migrant labour. A human security perspective, in particular, helps to base concern for human rights in an awareness of bodily and emotional needs, of global interconnections, and of the intersecting circumstances in peopleâs everyday lives; but it requires, and lends itself to, gender-enrichment through partnership with insights from feminist theory, as illustrated in the bookâs various case studies. The systems of the nation-state, market capitalism, and gender power that are discussed in this chapter, that structure the experiences of migrant women workers, are very deeply established. The chapter suggests directions for possible re-cognition, to reduce and counter the invisibility and misframing of migration, and of women and their work; it also suggests priority areas for research and networking following the format employed for the book: linking researchers, policy practitioners and migrant advocates, South-South-North.

This notion encompasses signs and semiotic systems such as the contemporary mathematics sign systems of algebra, Cartesian graphs, but also gestures, writing, speaking, and drawing systems. Arzarello et al.âs work is located within a broader context of multimodality that they explain as coming from neuroscience studies that have highlighted the role of the brainâs sensory-motor system in conceptual knowledge, and also from communication and multiple modes to communicate and to express meanings. Within this perspective, a semiotic bundle is deï¬ned as a system of signs [â¦] that is produced by one or more interacting subjects and that evolves in time. Typically, a semiotic bundle is made of the signs that are produced by a student or by a group of students while solving a problem and/or discussing a mathematical question. Possibly the teacher too participates to this production and so the semiotic bundle may include also the signs produced by the teacher. (Arzarello et al. 2009, p. 100)"
271,422,0.988,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"The aim of this chapter has been to introduce a possible answer to the question why decision interactions within figurations of political decision-making still rely on face-to-face interactions. Certain features inherent in face-to-face, embodied communicative practices, performed under conditions of physical co-presence, seem to promote the production of trust and reciprocity within actor constellations. Among other things, sequences referred to as practices of relatedness ensure that the decision process runs smoothly. In cases of disagreements or misunderstandings, practices of repair can put the process back on the right track. But these are practices that have a very complex, synchronous structure. And they rely on verbal as well as non-verbal elements of communicative practices. Therefore, it seems almost impossible to perform similar practices in computer-mediated communication. Practices of relatedness contribute to the success of problem-solving interactions, for example in cases in which political decisions are made concerning resource distributions. Practices of relatedness have a triadic, synchronous structure, while chat environments seem to be restricted to dyadicâand often a-synchronousâforms of interaction. Therefore, the empirical results suggest that these micro-scale acts of correction, translation and repair are found exclusively in face-to-face interactions, where, to cite Berger and Luckmann again, âthe otherâs subjectivity is available to me through a maximum of symptomsâ (Berger and Luckmann 1967: 29). These micro-level practices structure actor constellations within the field of politics in a way that has important implications for the study of communicative figurations and transforming communications in politics in"

The findings regarding RQ5 finally show that these media-related communication networks are strongly related to the friendship network. These findings suggest multiple conclusions. First, networked media collectivities should not be limited to a single medium. The structures transcend various types, but every network also has its own characteristics that help to reach a holistic representation of the figurations. Second, networked media collectivities are likely to be a resource of social capital. Media-related conversations are found to be of substantial relevance for everyday interaction and can be assumed to help create and maintain social ties. In fact, we are able to show strong overlap between media-related communication networks and friendship structures. Third, if figurations of friendship networks among adolescents are regarded as a benchmark for what structural properties a figuration should have, we are able to validate our theoretical and empirical approach of networked media collectivities. The proposed concept of networked media collectivities seems to provide an appropriate theoretical and methodological approach to describe todayâs media use of adolescents and its interdependence with social structures. However, only a longitudinal extension of this research design will be able to test how the changing media environment alters processes and characteristics of networked media collectivities. Hence, the consequences of the four trends described in the introduction (connectivity, omnipresence, differentiation, datafication) need to be analyzed in future studies."

The mid-twentieth century completion (in Europe, North America and parts of Australasia) of the resulting âprojectâ of mass provision of standardised water supply and sanitation services, explored elsewhere and called âhydromodernismâ, was then followed by several waves of restructuring in the water services value chain, based particularly on new ideas about the respective roles of the public and private sectors, new technologies and water needs of the natural environment. Of course, in much of the developing world, even âhydromodernismâ is as yet unattained and perhaps unattainable. In addition, rapid urbanisation in many developing nations has gone hand in hand with the growth of what are called âperi-urbanâ areas that combine âurbanâ and âruralâ characteristics and present new challenges to water (and other) services provision. Fortunately, they claim, there is a way of easily presenting the historical progression from a low to a higher level of water services provision. More to the point, it is possible to indicate the key drivers of water services development or, conversely, the key impediments to same. Cities around the world can be understood from the point of view of their location within the âurban hydrosocial transition (UHT)â, a historical geographical framework that sees cities as manifestations of successive âhydrosocial contractsâ between agents of economic, political, cultural and technological change. This concept builds on work undertaken by Brown et al. (2011) on âwater-sensitive citiesâ, Lundquist (2001) on the âhydrosocial contractâ, Swyngedouw (2005) on âurban metabolismâ and Thapa, Varady and Scott (2014) on âwater security indicesâ. A key innovation offered here is the simplified threepart historical geographical schema based on a limited number of readily available key indicators and associated drivers. Brief case studies from around the world are presented by way of illustration. Aziza Akhmouch offers an analytical framework to assess the impact of stakeholder engagement on water-related decision-making and policy implementation based on interdependent components. Citizens increasingly demand to be more engaged in how public policy decisions are made. In this environment, stakeholder engagement has emerged as a principle of good water governance. However, despite extensive research and case studies on the topic in recent years, the lack of evidencebased assessment on how effective engagement processes have proven to be in reaching intended objectives of water governance is striking. This chapter presents the key findings of an OECD study, which relies mainly on empirical data from a survey carried out across 215 stakeholders, within and outside the water sector and derived from 69 case studies collected worldwide. It suggests an analytical framework to assess the impact of stakeholder engagement in water-related decisionmaking and policy implementation, based on interdependent components, i.e. drivers, obstacles, mechanisms, impacts, costs and benefits. Results highlight the need for better understanding of the pressing and emerging issues related to stakeholder engagement. These include the external and internal drivers that trigger the engagement processes, arrival of new entrants that ought to be considered, innovative tools that have emerged to manage the interface between multiple players and types of costs and benefits incurred by engagement at policy"
211,152,0.988,Entrepreneurial Cognition : Exploring The Mindset of Entrepreneurs,"Goal Orientation Motives affect how individuals perceive and interpret context (Griffin and Ross 1991), and context can also define individualsâ motives (Wyer and Srull 1989). As such, we propose that this relationship is the foundation for the development and use of metacognitive strategies. For instance, in entrepreneurship, these motivations could be to increase oneâs share in a specific market, improve manufacturing productivity, or achieve higher sales. In other words, the goals managers pursue are often seen as a functionâor as a resultâof the environment those goals originated in. Therefore, we argue that the origins of cognitive adaptability stem from the combined effects of (1) the setting the individual functions within and (2) his or her motivations whereby the person interprets context. To capture this relationship between context and motivation, my (Dean) colleague and I (Haynie and Shepherd 2009) proposed the term goal orientation, which specifically refers to the degree to which a person interprets environmental changes in relation to a broad array of personal, social, and organizational goals. Goal orientation engages metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive experience as metacognitive resources. Metacognitive Knowledge Metacognitive knowledge is oneâs conscious understanding of cognitive processing in relation to (1) people, (2) tasks, and (3) strategy (Flavell 1979). First, metacognitive knowledge of people has both an external and internal focus. Externally focused metacognitive knowledge refers to understanding what other individuals, such as potential customers, competitors, and investors, think about their firms and environments. Internally focused metacognitive knowledge refers to understanding and acknowledging oneâs own biases, values, and intellectual strengths and weaknesses. For instance, a manager may know that he or she is better at sensing external stakeholdersâ needs than those of employees or other mid-level managers. Second, metacognitive knowledge of tasks relates to understanding the nature of a particular challenge as well as having knowledge of solutions to similar tasks that could be implemented for the task at hand. Lastly, metacognitive knowledge of strategy entails the procedures one uses to ensure that a particular decision framework is suitable in light of oneâs goal orientation and metacognitive knowledge of people and tasks. More specifically, metacognitive knowledge of strategy is the process of referencing"
284,351,0.988,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"âas a relational, power-laden and contested construction that actors strategically engage with, in order to legitimize or challenge existing power relationsâ. Hybrid institutions can be addressed from different theoretical perspectives. Instrumentalist approaches assume that actors are political and social entrepreneurs who actively use their social capital to build institutions that strive for optimal resource management. It is usually claimed that, to use social capital appropriately, institutions must be properly embedded in the cultural and social context from which the norms to support purposive decision-making are drawn (Ostrom, 1990). However, it has been claimed that concepts of embeddedness foster a functional and static conceptualization of culture and tradition that obscures the complex dynamics of institutional construction and evolution (Cleaver, 2001). Cleaver (2002: 17) claims that âthe evolution of collective decision-making institutions may not be the process of conscious selection of mechanisms ï¬t for the collective action task (as in Ostromâs model) but rather a messier process of piecing together shaped by individuals acting within the bounds of circumstantial constraintâ. In her studies of institutions for common property resource management in Tanzania, Cleaver (2001, 2002, 2013) develops the concept of âinstitutional bricolageâ as a process by which people consciously and unconsciously draw on existing social and cultural arrangements (rules, traditions, norms, roles and relationships) to shape institutions in patch-together institutions to change situations (Cleaver et al., 2013). In this dynamic, the resulting institution is a mix of modern and traditional, of formal and informal practices. Institutional bricolage offers a compelling approach to understanding the way in which hybrid institutions can be the result of a complex and dynamic assemblage process where contexts, conï¬icts, needs, scales, actors, and formal and informal institutions come into play to produce a particular hybrid institution. Environmental Justice Movements (EJMs) Latin American anti-mining movements and organizations played a central role in the emergence and spread of consultations. In this section we outline some key features of this actor, its central demands and its scalar dynamics. Latin American anti-mining movements have been framed as EJMs because they demand socioecological equity and fair decision-making processes in the governance of mining activities (Urkidi and Walter, 2011).

315,65,0.988,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"Another important component of comparative research on the children of immigrants concerns the geographical levels (local, national, etc.) at which comparisons are made and the types of groups that are used in such comparisons. Choosing the level of analysis has major conceptual implications and suits different research questions. This is an issue that has been ever present in recent migration research. In 1991, Bovenkerk et al. concluded that defining the correct level of comparison in European migration research is difficult, as research at the time either âmirroredâ European findings to that in one particular country or lacked a meaningful comparison point at all and took a too general approach. Given the short supply of general theories that can be or are applied, Bovenkerk and colleagues argued that comparisons in this sense run the risk in being solely descriptive and not really add to the explanation of phenomena. They concluded that the choice between generalization and specificity requires different levels of abstraction (Bovenkerk et al. 1991). With an outlook toward more general migration research, Green (1994) outlined three different models of comparison that are often used when thinking about the choice between level and groups: the linear model, the convergent model, and the divergent model. Given that the linear model, which focuses on following immigrants from origin to destination, does not necessarily relate to the experiences of the children of immigrants, it will not be explored in this section.8 Convergent modIt can nonetheless be the case that following the parents and their migration motives and patterns is important for understanding the outcomes of their children."

77,25,0.988,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"State of the Field and Contributions of the Volume The intersection of social epidemiology and the life course perspective is fairly recent. This volume shows that the field is expanding, with groups developing in different contexts. Infrastructure and resources required for this effort are also extending. These will help to further establish life course research groups, such as the International Centre For Life Course Studies In Society and Health at University College London, the University of Antwerpâs Centre for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies (CELLO), and the National Center for Competence in Research LIVES â Overcoming vulnerability over the life course â at the Universities of Lausanne and Geneva. Developments will also be strengthened through the funding of biomedical data collection as part of large-scale social surveys and the promotion of open academic access to these publically funded data. On the academic side, progressive institutionalisation can be observed with the establishment of learned societies, the organization of scientific conferences, workshops and summer schools. Further efforts should focus on comparisons between countries and international projects. Challenges exist in regard to the integration of interdisciplinary theoretical models and sophisticated statistical analyses, which requires collaborative interdisciplinary work, allowing a mix of skills to pursue the ambitions of life course epidemiology. This volume brings together nine contributions selected upon propositions received after a wide distribution of the call for papers at the international level. The authors of these contributions represent a range of disciplines and countries, including Switzerland, United States of America, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and United Kingdom. The chapters combine a mix of reviews, empirical analyses and methodological contributions. They address a range of health topics including obesity, oral health, coronary heart disease, mammogram screening, and cystic fibrosis and take into account different life stages, from childhood to late life. In the absence of clear criteria to structure the presentation of the contributions, we opted for a ârandomâ order for the first six chapters. The last three contributions have a common focus on methodological and statistical aspects. The first chapter, Trajectories and transitions in childhood and adolescent obesity by Laura Howe, Riz Firestone, Kate Tilling and Debbie Lawlor, offers a review of the evidence regarding trajectories and transitions in childhood and adolescent obesity. The rising prevalence of obesity has turned it into a major public health preoccupation, despite some variations across high-income countries. The chapter shows how adopting a life course perspective improves our understanding of long term consequences of overweight and obesity in early life. Longitudinal"
347,160,0.988,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"complexity should consider (1) interrelated and crosscutting environmental issues, (2) dynamics of marine ecosystems and (3) clear goals and incentives to vigorously put into practice a new legislation (Shine et al. 2010). Adaptive management is a way to improve the management process for IAS. Adaptive management is one of the concepts central to EAM that is also integrated in MSFD. Adaptive management recognises that long-term management decisions based upon conceptual modelling or knowledge of only a limited part of the system are unwise due to scientific uncertainty about related natural systems (Farmer et al. 2012). Thus, scientific knowledge and understanding of the system are necessary to reduce management uncertainties. Similarly, effective cooperation of all key stakeholders in a marine region is crucial to facilitate desired outcomes of adaptive management plans. Long-term goals should be revised periodically as new scientific information becomes available and as social needs change (ibid.). Developing a new European legislation on IAS not only generates problems and challenges but also provides an excellent opportunity to bring together crosscutting inquiries and reconsider interactions between different environmental threats. HELCOM was therefore proposed to be the main driving force in the implementation of EAM in the Baltic Sea marine area, as well as the coordinating platform for the Baltic Sea regional implementation of the Marine Directive in the Baltic Sea (EC 2011). In summary, we believe that despite increased activity in some IAS sectors, there is room for more action at the governmental level as has been the case, for example, in Australia and New Zealand. As importantly, more action is needed within nationstates and regional institutions, especially those responsible for the implementation of all the proposed preventive measures. Despite a number of actions taken, the impact has been limited and the spread of IAS continues to take place. To move from conceptualising solutions to translating them into practice requires (1) defining proper goals and objectives concentrating on sustainability, (2) intergenerational sustainability through the harmonisation of ecosystem processes and functions with management actions and (3) switching to adaptive management that by definition requires cooperation between different stakeholders. Moreover, as IAS risks are interrelated with other environmental threats (e.g. eutrophication, overfishing and climate change), invasive species considerations should be integrated into other policies. These policies should include information on the relevant linkages and recognise the interactions and synergistic effects. The implementation of the BWM Convention dealing with ship-mediated species introduction is an important step forward, but it needs to enter into force. Second, the Convention is not robust enough to cover different environmental risks. Finally, practically speaking, the Convention is still not detailed enough to be appropriate for the Baltic Sea given its peculiar conditions. For these reasons, an implementation strategy for each country that has ratified the BWM Convention is necessary. These strategies would have to address issues such as (1) uncertainties linked to specificity of the Baltic Sea environment and ballast water removal and (2) amending the distribution of responsibilities between ship owner and harbours (e.g. financial responsibilities, planning and building infrastructure for receiving ballast water). Additionally, there"

Also, nature has significant influence on humans, for example by providing restorative settings, for educational purposes, offering inspiration and promoting creativity. The provision of these services to humans by nature has been captured in the concept of ESS. Thus, ESS is basically a categorization of the broad range of âbenefits people obtain from ecosystemsâ (MEA 2005:V). The concept emerged in the late 1970s when ecosystem functions beneficial to humans where termed as âservicesâ in order to raise public awareness for biodiversity conservation (GÃ³mez-Baggethun et al. 2010). Since then, the literature on ecosystem services has strongly expanded, which has also led to a rich debate on the concept, with particular emphasis on methods for assessment and valuation of ecosystem services, but also addressing ethical issues and how the concept can be mainstreamed into policy making (e.g., Cowling et al. 2008, Thompson 2008, Norgaard 2010, Vierikko and Niemela 2016). The United Nations led Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report was a milestone with regard to the latter, as it represented the first ever global assessment of ecosystem services to policy makers."
92,158,0.988,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Another outcome of the chapters and primarily a result of the PINGH structure is an opportunity to advance the focus of global health collaborations and research with students and community partners. One might argue that this type of research already exists within other health-related organizations; however, the types of conversations, projects, and research carried out within PINGH highlight the impact that can happen when the community works with students in the co-creation of the knowledge and research. Take for example the Project Redemption project from Chap. 6, which highlights what can happen when communities that have often been overlooked are included as contributing participants and central to the core theme of the study. In other chapters (see Chaps. 4 or 7), the inclusion of undergraduate and graduate students was purposeful and impactful to not only the students but also provided useful information on potential changes that could ultimately influence how to better integrate students into other programmatic roles of these global health programs. Furthermore, book chapters reveal challenges when working with global partners such as access and transparency of national data or access to other pertinent information. Despite these issues, authors recognized through these types of global health projects, greater awareness and policies (both PINGH and national/regional country policies) could be developed to address some of these limitations that impact programs. Another important issue raised across most chapters was the significance of a robust program design. When programs are strategically developed to include students (graduate and undergraduate), develop and challenge learning, incorporate community voice, and acknowledge critical reflection, there is an opportunity to change the status quo of student learning in global contexts. These components contribute to a learning environment that provides the student and the community with an opportunity to contribute to the learning process and ultimately create an experience that is meaningful to all. In reviewing the system of PINGH and its goals, there were three common themes found in all the chapters. Projects and activities highlighted the elements of a network that values (1) community voice and inclusivity, (2) student engagement and contributions, and (3) faculty and site collaboration."

These two schemes cover a broad spectrum of biological traits but are less likely to be practical for deciphering a specific genetic and developmental architecture of traits. From the perspective of comparative morphology, a specific scheme to comprehend the complexity and diversification of traits needs to be established. How can the genetic and developmental architectures that create various forms by modification of the ground plan be depicted? Considering the experimental facts explained above, two major components seem to be involved: one arises from the original developmental modularity of the ground plan and the other from rewiring the developmental modules of the ground plan. In general, the ground plan is a sum of homologous parts, and it is thought that each homologous part constitutes one developmental module because each part is individually identifiable (Wagner 1989, 2014). An example of the component derived from rewiring the developmental modules of the NGP is the functional modules found in O. excavata leaf pattern (Suzuki 2013). In the present review, I propose a scheme for integrating the genetic and developmental architecture underlying the variations of a theme of the ground plan, termed Body plan Character Map (BC Map; Fig. 3.8c). This scheme describes the core generation process of the ground plan and the reorganization process that transforms it into various designs, which can only be revealed using the morphological approach described in this study combined with molecular data.

In the second half of the nineties, due to growing heterogeneity and fragmentation of the social and urban structure, and the arrival of new lifestyles (of nationals as well as of migrants), Swiss cities started taking charge of the challenges of migrant integration. In order to overcome an ageing foreigners law and diverse understanding of concepts and procedures, the city of Bern decided to elaborate a concept of guidelines and recommendations regarding integration of migrant populations. A large consultation resulted in a widely publicised document compiling recommendations addressing everyone, and particularly institutional actors. The document was meant to inform the population about the position and aims of the city council regarding integration. This way of discussing, negotiating and writing down guidelines supports participation and acceptance through involvement of stakeholders and acknowledges the limits of traditional welfare governance operating by enforceable rules in a field like integration. The fourth and final part of the book (Part IV) is devoted to crosscutting and conclusive issues. A chapter on the dark side of social innovation by Ola Larsson and Taco Brandsen critically appraises the concept and practice of social innovation. Normative assumptions behind research on social innovation tend to obscure the dark sides of the phenomenon, such as failure, political conflict and oppression. One of the aims of the WILCO project was to identify lessons for social policies and ultimately improve social cohesion. Such an optimistic approach should not, however, prevent us from discussing the more disturbing elements that the researchers identified. The final conclusive chapter of the book by Taco Brandsen, Sandro Cattacin, Adalbert Evers and Annette Zimmer, gives an overview of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly in social innovation. It discusses the implications of the findings, for policymakers and professionals as well as the academic research agenda. âGoodâ signifies what innovations can contribute to a societyâs ability to cope with change and, more precisely, to do it in a way that change can is perceived as progress in civility. âBadâ signifies the shortcomings of social innovationsâ especially their limited impact in an overall averse social and policy context. âUglyâ stands for discourses that deal with social innovations as if they were something elseâusually, treating them like market-based products and technologies. On the basis of the overall evidence on the potential and limits of social innovation discourse, the chapter will give a balanced assessment of the state of the art of social innovation and of social innovation research."
223,261,0.988,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Motivation and Opportunity Fazio (1990) describes two modes of thinkingâa spontaneous processing mode based on attitude accessibility, and a deliberative processing mode based on attitude behavior. These modes of thinking are remarkably similar in structure to the RIMâs proposed systems, certain differences in mechanisms notwithstanding. Therefore, the MODE model (Fazio, 1990), which predicts when the deliberative mode will be engaged in processing the possible consequences of behavior, may be applicable to the RIM as well. In this conceptualization, engagement in deliberative processing depends on motivation and opportunity. Motivation in the MODE model is generated by the fear of invalidity (Kruglanski & Freund, 1983), a function of the perceived costliness of a judgmental mistake to the self, whereas opportunity is a function of the available time and resources for processing. Applying this framework to the RIM, one finds that the defined properties of the reflective system are in accord with these predictions. Reflective processing is accompanied by a feeling of subjective effort and so requires motivation, whereas both the reliance on the resources of working memory and the relatively slow speed of the reflective system make it clear that the reflective system can influence behavior only if the opportunity is given. Evidence for this dependence on opportunity exists in many domains. Cognitive load, a manipulation often used to impair deliberative processing, has been applied in various different studies whose results can be explained with the RIM. Selfcontrol (e.g., Lattimore & Maxwell, 2004; Wegner, Erber, & Zanakos, 1993), processing of negated stimuli (Deutsch et al. 2009), social judgments and attributions (Gilbert et al., 1988; Krull & Erickson, 1995; Trope & Alfieri, 1997), moral judgments (Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2008), and general reasoning (De Neys, 2006) have all proven to be impaired by cognitive load in ways"

315,66,0.988,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"els of comparison tend to study various immigrant groups in the same place, either an immigration country or a city.9 These models, which stress the specificities of each group included in the comparison, are most often found in national research. Whilst allowing an in-depth focus at the group level in a specific place, convergent models tend to wipe off the changing historical conditions of social and economic participation for each group in the host countries. Divergent models, on the other hand, study one immigrant group in various destination places, allowing for a focus on contextual factors shaping the opportunities and barriers for integration. In her methodological essay Green explained that âdivergent studies [, which are rare,] locate the explanation of difference at the point of arrival and not at the point of departureâ (1994: 15). The examples cited in this chapter suggest that European data contains a mixture of convergent and divergent models. For the data comparing similar groups across places (such as SCIICS and TIES), the comparative strategy seems to be that of an extensive divergent model of comparison, moving beyond the observation on one specific group across countries and extending it to a certain number of specific groups. For the data comparing different groups across different places (such as CILS4EU and EFFNATIS), we can also talk about an extension of convergent models. The trend towards divergent models of comparison appears to have become more common in European research in the last decade (Ersanilli and Koopmans 2009; Huschek et al. 2010; Fleischmann and Phalet 2012). Two different sets of factors may account for this trend: theoretical and political. On the one hand, the change toward divergent research designs, especially those focusing on the local level, was triggered by the sharp critique of methodological nationalism, âthe assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern worldâ (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002: 302). The nation-state is obviously an important actor in setting out rules and regulations with regard to the entry and settlement of migrants. It should not be ignored when studying migrants and their descendants (Guiraudon and Lahav 2000; Teitelbaum 2001). However, critiques of this viewpoint questioned the ânaturalizationâ of the geo-political frame of nation-states as encompassing societal phenomena in general. In the specific case of the study of migration, it was argued that the focus on nation-states might be counterproductive for understanding migration and integration experiences (Vertovec and Cohen 1999; Bommes 2005). Focus on migration research at the national level also entailed a critique of an undue leveling out of differences within the âimmigration societyâ by its focus on national-level outcomes rather than more refined, and complex, outcomes at a more local level. Moreover, the development of the segmented assimilation theory of Portes and Zhou (1993), which focused on the importance of contexts of reception in shaping integration outcomes among the second generation, and the rise in popularity of transnationalism approaches (Levitt and Schiller 2004; Levitt It is important to note here that in her article, Green discusses convergent models with regard to the city as the chosen place, which aligns quite well with Glick-Schiller and Cagarâs (2009) argument that the city should be the main focal point for studies of integration."
198,6,0.988,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Climate change is one of the preeminent challenges facing the world today. The consequences of climate change manifest themselves in multiple ways, including increased variability and intensity of extreme weather events and sea level rise. We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, and the first ones to feel them tend to be poor people and poor countries that are most vulnerable and have the least capacities to cope with them. The search for solutions to mitigate climate change and to adapt to its consequences is urgent. Rigorous evaluation of policies, programs, and projects can help the international community to identify technical solutions, economic strategies, and social innovations that improve our ability to deal with climate change. This is the focus of the present book. The book has its genesis in the Climate-Eval Community of Practice hosted by the Independent Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility. Its overarching goal is to establish standards and norms, support capacity development, and share good practices in evaluations of climate change and development. In November 2014, Climate-Eval with its partners organized the Second International Conference on Evaluating Climate Change and Development in Washington, D.C. The aim of this event was to promote an interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and methods to evaluate climate change and sustainable development. This 3-day event brought together some 300 leading experts and policymakers in the field and included sessions on climate change mitigation, adaptation, and policy, as well as special sessions such as panel discussions and roundtables. Topics discussed ranged from theory of change approaches to evaluation and institutional capacity; to disaster risk reduction, resilience, and tracking adaptation; to monitoring and evaluation of ecosystem-based and natural resource management interventions and climate change funds. Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development builds upon a selection of the most relevant and practical papers and presentations given at the 2014 conference. Following the conference, the editors and the authors worked closely together to develop the presentations into a coherent set of articles organized around the three main themes of climate change evaluation: policy,"

Are there any differences between the Scandinavian countries in this regard? As is evident from these questions, the study is largely exploratory and has a strong empirical focus. All questions are addressed with a focus on comparisons across the Scandinavian countries and across different institutional sectors. The theoretical inspiration for the study is rooted in the literature on NPM, public steering and governmentânonproï¬t relations. The empirical analysis will be based on data from case studies in two Swedish, two Danish and three Norwegian municipalities. In the ï¬rst part of this chapter, the theoretical background for the study will be presented. Afterwards, the characteristics of the welfare mix in the ï¬eld of schools in the Scandinavian countries will be provided, including a view into the distinct development of alternatives to public schools. After a short presentation of data and methods, the empirical analysis will go deeper into the ï¬eld of primary and lower secondary schools across the three countries, addressing the research questions above. This chapter concludes with a discussion of similarities and differences across countries and types of providers, including possible reasons for and consequences of these differences for future welfare provision in the ï¬eld."

118,663,0.988,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"20.3 Communication on Science and Technology The importance of social aspects in the development and utilization of science and technology has been increasingly recognized not only in the nuclear engineering field but also in other science and engineering fields. The cause for this realization is the increase of social conflicts related to science and technology, such as environmental problems, ethical concerns in frontier engineering (e.g. genetics), etc. [4]. In this context, two cases immediately draw our attention [4]: the study by Wynne [5] on how the general public understands and deals with scientific knowledge about environmental contamination in the vicinity of the Sellafield-Windscale site in U.K., and the circumstances of U.K.âs government response to the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) issue [6]. It is explained, for example, that the âdeficiency model,â which considers that miscommunication and misunderstanding on science and technology mainly rest on the deficiency of the citizenâs knowledge, is not plausible in many cases [5]. Then, not only the importance of the trust in information of science and technology but also the importance of the trustworthiness of an organization which deals with the information are claimed [4]. One of the effective ways to foster the trust and the trustworthiness is mutual communication between citizens and experts, not oneway communication from experts to citizens, such as teaching and enlightening. The mutual communication may include the reflection of public opinion in the development and the utilization of science and technology, public involvement in the decision making process for science and technology issues, etc."
275,236,0.988,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"8.2 Conceptualization of Trust Trust has been studied in a variety of disciplines (including social psychology, human factors, and industrial organization) for understanding relationships between humans or between human and machine. The wide variety of contexts within which trust has been studied leads to various definitions and theories of trust. The different context within which trust has been studied has led to definitions of trust as an attitude, an intention, or a behavior [72, 76, 86]. Both within the inter-personal literature and human-automation trust literature, a widely accepted definition of trust is lacking [1]. However, it is generally agreed that trust is best conceptualized as a multidimensional psychological attitude involving beliefs and expectations about the trusteeâs trustworthiness derived from experience and interactions with the trustee in situations involving uncertainty and risk [47]. Trust has also been said to have both cognitive and affective features. In the interpersonal literature, trust is also seen involving affective processes, since trust development requires seeing others as personally motivated by care and concern to protect the trustorâs interests [65]. In the automation literature, cognitive (rather than affective) processes may play a dominant role in the determination of trustworthiness, i.e., the extent to which automation is expected to do the task that it was designed to do [91]. In the trust in automation literature, it has been argued that trust is best conceptualized as an attitude [58] and a relatively well accepted definition of trust is: â...an attitude which includes the belief that the collaborator will perform as expected, and can, within the limits of the designerâs intentions, be relied on to achieve the design goalsâ [85]."
185,268,0.988,The Essence of Software Engineering,"6 Conclusion The chapter introduced a novel vision of the Deviceless Edge Computing paradigm. In order to clarify some of the most important aspects of this emerging paradigm, we have analyzed the key challenges associated with Deviceless Edge Computing and presented a generic reference architecture of a Deviceless Platform. Moreover, we have presented Intent-based programming model and an approach for automated provisioning of the Edge infrastructure, based on Software-Defined Gateways. We discussed how these two approaches facilitate two main challenges: deviceless application development and automated provisioning and management at scale, respectively. As we have discussed, the presented approaches significantly reduce the complexity related to development and runtime management (e.g., provisioning, deployment, and configuration management) of deviceless applications. However, there is still a long road ahead to fully realize the vision of the Deviceless Edge Computing. In the future, we plan to continue our line of research, by focusing on addressing the most important research challenges such as (1) enabling resource pooling and rapid elasticity, at the Edge, (2) scheduling deviceless functions execution on loosely coupled and scarce Edge resources, and (3) addressing the key governance and security issues related with deviceless applications. To this end, we plan to focus on âfilling the gapsâ in the proposed reference architecture, by developing the required models and platform mechanism.

There is still a lack of transfer from existing scientific knowledge into conservation strategies and measures. Especially, the social effects of climate change and their impact on conservation management are not well addressed, even though they frame its decision context (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). Most of the available concepts and guidelines for the adaptation of conservation management are lacking connection to local strategies and actions. There is an urgent need for more science-practice partnerships to identify strategies that are robust to uncertainty deriving from climate projections and their ecological consequences. In addition, easy applicable tools are needed that provide no-regret options for adaptation, based on available scientific information. The adaptation of conservation management is a huge task and has to overcome multiple challenges on local level: â¢ The lack of resources: local conservation management is chronically scarce of resources like budget and manpower. New challenges like climate change are therefore hard to tackle. â¢ The lack of expertise in adaptation issues: on a local level there might be several experts trained to identifying effects of climate change, but only few are trained in adaptation issues. â¢ The lack of guidance to find suitable data and methods: in the last years an overwhelming amount of data and information on climate change and its effects has become available. A plethora of approaches and data has been published making it hard to identify relevant information and useful methods. â¢ The lack of suitable monitoring methods: signals of local climate change and its effects are hard to distinguish from the noise of natural dynamics. Robust methods helping to disentangle the web of pressures like land use and climate change are still rare. â¢ The lack of management methods: conservation experts in the field need simple, applicable tools and guidance for decision support in everyday management of conservation sites. They need methods to identify climate change related conflicts, to identify robust adaptation strategies, to choose suitable management measures, and to prioritise action. â¢ The lack of tools for communication and awareness raising: effective adaptation of conservation management needs to build public, as well as political, support for local adaptation activities. Tools for communication and participation are needed to foster environmental education, to illustrate effects of climate change, to show the relevance of adaptation measures, to guide autonomous adaptation of other land users, and to include stakeholders and the wider public in the adaptation process. Despite the existing gaps and challenges, local conservation management cannot hesitate to take action and must proceed in the face of considerable uncertainty (Conroy et al. 2011)."

75,371,0.988,"Opening Science : The Evolving Guide on How the Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing","Translating Vision into Practice The developments in recent years have shown that numerous initiatives have emerged in Data Sharing. The hesitation among researchers in many disciplines is met by new strategies that work on barriers such as the lack of incentives. A professionalization of the Research Data Management, which supports scientists in the sharing of their data, is necessary to ensure the permanent accessibility, however. In this context, priority must be given to the structuring and networking of the research data repositories and their long-term financing. A more detailed analysis for the identification and overcoming of barriers to Data Sharing has been created in the framework of the EU-project Opportunities for Data Exchange (ODE).18 This project takes the various players involved in scholarly communication and data management (policy-makers, funders, researchers, research and education organisations, data centres and infrastructure service providers and publishers) into consideration, names variables that have an effect on the sharing and points out strategies for overcoming barriers to Open Access (Dallmeier-Tiessen et al. 2012). Many of the strategies that are outlined show that, to counter the diverse challenges, close cooperation is necessary between the players named above. As an example, the successful implementation of data policies of supporting organizations requires a Research Data Management and infrastructures that support scientists and create a regulatory framework. All of these measures will only lead to success, however, when scholarly societies and other disciplinary players who support the anchoring in the disciplinary communities take part. All players in the scientific process are therefore requested to make their contribution to Open Access of research data. The publication strategies outlined show that there really is a possibility for the anchoring of Data Sharing in the scientific reputation system. Further innovation is desirable, though. The implementation of the increasing demand for Open Science from society19 and academic policy (Kroes 2012), as is assumed, for example, by the federation of national academies ALLEA - ALL European Academies (2012), needs a culture of sharing. The establishment of this culture is a far reaching challenge. It appears that implementation of it can only then be successful when changes are made in the scientific reputation system. Scientific performances should in the future be valued with a ââsharing factorââ that not only judges the citation frequency in the scientific community, but also rates the implementation of sharing of information and knowledge for the good of society. The demand for openness in science is loud and clear. All players in the scientific area should direct their practices to this demand. The publication strategies for research data have up to now been important approaches towards Open Science. The following citation from the ââBerlin Declarationââ (2003) makes it"

49,250,0.988,Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV,"knowledge based on learning from examples. The most common technique of machine learning is neural nets enabling knowledge discovery based on classification of examples. Knowledge representation is devoted towards application of various formalisms (e.g. Petri nets, neural networks, ontologies, first order logic etc.) to achieve the representation of knowledge in a format understandable by humans and machines. When formalized, knowledge can be easily shared among healthcare institutions, various DSS (executable knowledge components) and experts. As mentioned before medical knowledge is rapidly evolving and doubles every few years. This is motivated by research in medical domains and technology advancement (e.g. gene mapping technologies creating vast amount of knowledge about human genome resulting in the new field of medicine â personalized medicine). From the DSS point of view this means updating knowledge base with new knowledge and ensuring the version management of knowledge base. Delivery of knowledge to the user includes recommendations based on the patient data, retrieval of reference information for explanation of recommendations and guidance on how to implement recommended actions. 2.2 Knowledge representation formalisms for DSS There exist several well known âclassicalâ formalisms for knowledge representation and the most of the DSS representations and reasoning about knowledge are based on them. These includes clinical algorithms, mathematical pathophysiological models, Bayesian statistical systems and influence diagrams, neural networks, fuzzy set theory, symbolic reasoning (expert systems, knowledge bases, rules). Another wide spread formalism of knowledge representation is ontology. By definition âan ontology is specification of a conceptualizationâ [17]. This means that ontology is a description of the objects, concepts and other entities (âitemsâ) that exist in area of interest (e.g. cardiology domain) and relationships that hold among them [18]. Ontologies are designed for the purpose of knowledge sharing and reuse and are represented in formal language such as frames, description logic or rules. This makes ontologies suitable for decision support and explanation facilities because its representation allows logical inference (by using for example symbolic reasoning) over the set of objects, concepts and their relationships. ProtÃ©gÃ© is a free, open source ontology editor developed at Stanford University with the possibility to export the designed ontologies into variety of formats including RDF(S), OWL and XML Schema (http://protege.stanford.edu). Ontologies are used to represent clinical practice guidelines in the computable form (computer interpretable guidelines, CIGs). Guidelines contain"

93,98,0.988,Nordic Mediation Research,"In studies of the top-down perspective on the implementation of change, learning could be best understood as adopting new rules, policies or practices (Haavisto 2002). Especially in the context of courts and law, adopting new rules has traditionally been the major form of learning. Learning is regarded as a non-problematic result of pouring the necessary information into those who are to implement it. The bottom-up perspective emphasising the discretion of local implementers, suggests that the implementation process is subject to constant modiï¬cation and adjustments in goals, strategies and practical execution. According to this view, learning seems to be a continuous process of adaptation, where implementers learn to ï¬t the policy to local needs (Haavisto 2002). In addition to adopting and adapting as forms of learning, the implementation of change can be viewed as a process that also contains the questioning of current cultural models and production of novel local solutions. This potential for new and emergent is elementary in the theory of expansive learning (EngestrÃ¶m 1987). In expansive learning, people are not required to adopt change nor compelled to adapt to them. Instead, they initiate and seek new solutions and actively make sense of the situation they are in. Expansive learning is not about choosing between ready-made alternatives, nor merely re-deï¬ning something already known. It involves learning new forms of activity that are not yet there (ibid.). The focus of this article can be described with the following four-square matrix (Fig. 1), where the horizontal dimension concerns whether learning is seen as the appropriation of culturally given knowledge or as the creation of culturally new knowledge. The vertical dimension determines whether we focus on development taking place as top-down or bottom-up. The interest of this article is on the bottomup implementation of changes and on the learning of local solutions that go beyond existing traditions and models. Focusing on the local implementation of changes and the creation of novel solutions raises a more ï¬nessed question about the learning taking place. If the practitioners are creating and learning something that is not yet there, how is the new"
242,18,0.988,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Migration scholarship has been traditionally influenced by a twofold methodological bias inherited from positivist sociology and its epistemological orientations. Until recently, this bias treated the nationstate and the individual as relatively fixed units of analysis and shaped a large core of theoretical explanations about contemporary patterns of internal and cross-border movements (Wimmers/Glick-Schiller 2002). The central focus of migration studies has been the monitoring of stocks and flows of migrants, later extended to their patterns of remittances and their capability of assimilation and social integration in host societies. Refugees have been handled as a separate category, through different procedures of status determination and classification, thus producing the field of refugee studies as a distinct entity. Migration research, by and large driven by policy concerns, is often structured more by ideas concerning what should be rather than what is actually happening and emerging. Assumptions that are disconnected from the social worlds of migration can obscure significant aspects of ongoing social transformations. The intensification of various migratory flows since the 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall and processes of economic liberalization worldwide has posed huge challenges for policymakers and researchers. In particular, the transformation of the state from society-led to market-led, coupled with the rise of social network theories and theories of the in-"

395,34,0.988,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"Workplace safety is a particular form of âorganizational competenceâ. In other words, it is a form of emerging competence sustained in working practices by interactions among various collective actors (Gherardi and Nicolini 2000),2 and various discourses on what constitutes safety. What we call âsafetyâ is the result of a set of working practices shaped by a system of symbols and meanings which orient action but which consist of something more. Safety can therefore be viewed as an emerging property of a sociotechnical system, the ï¬nal result of a collective process of construction, a âdoingâ which involves people, technologies and textual and symbolic forms assembled within a system of material relations. This system of relations is made up of heterogeneous components, and it does not display the traditional distinctions between human and non-human elements, cultural or natural aspects, action and constraints. Rather, all these elements are involved in a constant process of generation called the âengineering of heterogeneityâ (Law 1992). A âsafeâ workplace or a âsafeâ organization are the outcome of the quotidian engineering of heterogeneous elementsâcompetences, materials, relations, communications, peopleâintegral to the work practices. When we consider safety as a social and collective accomplishment, as something that is done with the collaboration of all the practitioners involved in a working practice, then we can say that it has the following characteristics: â¢ It is situated in the system of ongoing practices. It means that âsafetyâ cannot be separated from its practice and therefore we have to consider safe and safer working practices instead of studying, researching and intervening on safety in abstraction from its work context. â¢ It is relational and mediated by artifacts. Safety knowledge always manifests itself in social activities sustained by symbols, technologies and relations; i.e. action is always âmediatedâ. The essential instrument of mediation is language,"
245,678,0.988,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"(4.2) Conceptions of knowledge and knowing. Hofer (2004), Hofer and Pintrich (1997) developed a model that organizes epistemic beliefs in four dimensions, each seen as a continuum between two poles: the certainty of knowledge, ranging from deï¬nitive to evolutionary; the simplicity of knowledge ranging from individual concepts added one to another, to concepts seen to be interrelated; the source of knowledge, ranging from it being transmitted by an external authority, to it being produced by the person him or herself; the justiï¬cation of knowledge, ranging from it being due to an authority, to it resulting from proof via a rigorous procedure. Automatically activated, epistemic beliefs would influence the goals constructed by the learner, the metacognitive processes and the choice of learning strategies (Muis 2007). The learner not only makes judgments about learning (Do I know?), but also makes what could be called epistemic judgments: How do I know? (Hofer 2004). The importance of these judgments can be seen in the trivialization of internet search, where queries using Google are in most cases the ï¬rst step of a literature search (Biddix et al. 2011). The learner is confronted with a multitude of information sources, the reliability of which needs to be assessed. In this regard, (BrÃ¥ten et al. 2005: 154) note that âin open and global information networks, anyone can publish anything, and the difï¬cult task of checking the relevance and accuracy of information traditionally done by publishers, is now transferred to the students themselvesâ. Finally, the analysis in terms of structural equation modelling carried out by Cano (2005) in a survey of 1600 Spanish students conï¬rmed the direct and indirect influence (via learning approaches) of epistemic beliefs on school performance. (5) Personality characteristics. One of the most influential characterisations of personality is the âBig Fiveâ model (Costa and McCrae 1992), so called because it organises personality in ï¬ve traits: extraversion (active, sociable versus silent, shy); pleasantness (nice, cooperating versus nasty); conscientiousness (meticulous, applied versus disordered, distracted); emotional stability or neuroticism (calm, relaxed versus anxious, irritable); openness to experience (openness, curiosity versus conformity, conventional). In a research in the UK with Bachelor students, (Chamorro-Premuzic and Furnham 2008) observed that conscientiousness, and to a lesser extent openness to experience, have a signiï¬cant impact on academic success. The recent meta-analysis of the psychological correlates of academic achievement conducted by Richardson et al. (2012) conï¬rms that conscientiousness is signiï¬cantly associated with academic achievement. In contrast, openness to experience does not seem to exercise signiï¬cant influence. However, to our knowledge these features have not been linked to learning outcomes such as âthe disposition to understand for oneselfâ (Entwistle and McCune 2013). In conclusion, as far as characteristics of students are concerned, it seems necessary to consider a whole range of features related to previous training experience, and the level of knowledge acquired to enter the program. This level can be assessed in various ways on the basis of past academic experience or, more speciï¬cally, via an initial assessment of knowledge about the area to be learnt. In addition, the impact of epistemic beliefs and conceptions of learning on the learning process now seems sufï¬ciently documented through research for us to include them. With regard to"
170,135,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"policy narratives that convey the reasons for decisions being put forward (Bellettini and OrdÃ³Ã±ez 2011). In the case of ICT4D, the broad conceptual frameworks in relation to the development process have been discussed before. However, there is space for developing the theory about ICT policies that respond better to the needs of developing countries. Conceptual research identifies trends and phenomena but does little to identify why or how they happen. Planning research is the category that seeks to explain the factors that cause or hinder a given outcome. This type of research sheds light on what the policy priorities could be and how these could become crucial for the expected outcome. An interesting case of this type of research is Cecchini and Scottâs (2003) which prioritises public policies for ICT4D initiatives to be successful. This type of research frames the possibilities of action for policymakers to consider. Research in the planning category leaves a blueprint of what should be done and in what sequence, at best. The next challenge which policymakers face is actually making a decision and implementing a policy, programme, or such to address the issue at hand. The research for planning refers to the one that identifies the key factors that affect a development outcome. In the case of ICT4D, research that finds key aspects to make a technology useful or an intervention successful would be relevant knowledge for planning. To plan a policy, the debate should focus not only âon what worksâ but also on the factors for success. Is it the capacity to use a technology, its availability, or its price? These questions allow policymakers to focus, from a myriad of options, on those that could have the most impact. Ty et al. (2012), for example, have discussed the use of ICTs for environmental planning. In their analysis, they conclude that it is not only necessary to integrate more data with the use of technologies but that, for it to be meaningful, changes in the planning process must occur. This research could inform policymakers of the need to change internal processes and not only introduce new technology. Instrumental research refers to identifying new actions or reforming current existing programmes. It is probably the most innovative aspect of research for policy. This type of research aims at creating solutions. Considering local context, specific needs, and constraints, it creates options. In this sense it is inventive and creative. Many ICT4D projects could be framed as instrumental research. These projects, however, are usually carried out outside the governmental arena. Research that takes into consideration the limitations, possibilities, and requirements for scaling up could support policymakers to view some of these ideas as valuable policy options. Action research is the fourth proposed category. Its primary focus is changing behaviours or actions through direct interventions. These types of research seek to connect researchers and practitioners directly in solving issues encountered during the implementation of an idea and tweaking issues in the process. These are usually endeavours best carried out in smaller settings with direct and constant interaction between researchers and those involved in the policy (i.e., teachers, bureaucrats, extensionists). For such research to be meaningful, strong links are necessary and researchers become not only observers but participants. In this sense,"

170,92,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"We supplemented this basic construct further by the following commonly shared assumptions: â¢ Communication is a social process. â¢ Communication is the exchange of information or the sharing of knowledge. â¢ The essence of ICT4D is not technological but social; the emphasis should be on the âCâ and the âDâ instead of the âIâ and the âT.â In eAgriculture, for instance, bandwidth may be important but food security far outweighs it. Additional constructs that made up the framework submit that ICT, as a social phenomenon, has the following attributes: knowledge capture, storage, distribution, amplification, interactivity, multidimensionality, multidirectionality, sharing, collaboration, and technological innovation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, individual, organizational, or institutional pivotal actors (otherwise referred to as intermediaries, catalysts, change agents, focal points, or champions) link ICTs to the beneficiary. There are primary, secondary, and higher-order impacts of ICTs through these pivotal actors: â¢ ICTs contribute to natural, physical, financial, human, and social capital resulting in improved livelihood outcomes for individuals and organizations (Flor 2008)."
245,1077,0.988,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"3 Conclusions The Romanian participation at CERN has provided unique opportunities for physics graduate students and has strengthened the scientiï¬c output of the doctoral schools, both qualitatively and quantitatively. By exposing graduate students to forefront achievements in engineering, technology and physics, these international collaborations fostered an unparalleled multidisciplinary environment that is conducive to innovative solutions to the most challenging scientiï¬c problems, as evidenced, for instance, by the two patents obtained by the ALICE Romanian team in 2011. One of the problems faced by the Romanian PhD students working at CERN concerns the criteria used to evaluate their work. These assessment criteria do not reflect the research philosophy of large-scale experimental facilities where the collaborative nature of the research is prominent, and emphasize the signiï¬cance of personal contributions as seen from the number and ordering of authors on a given paper. Moreover, as most assessment criteria concerning PhD students refer solely to the number of published articles, part of their work at CERN remains un-acknowledged. Given the goal of the H2020 programme, to shorten the distance between scientiï¬c research and industrial application as to ensure the transition to a more innovative and competitive Europe, we should broaden our assessment framework such that we properly account for all forms of scientiï¬c output, and try to complement, where possible, the current scientometrics evaluations with expert peer-review. It is our experience that the prescriptive application of strict assessment standards is not fully compatible with supporting the speciï¬cities of each research ï¬eld and does not catalyze creativity and innovation. To foster a creative and innovative environment, we should encourage interdisciplinarity and diversity, and always keep in mind that the core component of the doctoral training is the advancement of knowledge through original research, not for original research, an aspect which seems of second importance in the current discussion on the Bologna process. In other words, the inclusion of the PhD students in research activities is done to build solid research competences and clear transferable skills that are the basis for the future career of the PhD students outside of the academic sector."

Primarily, researchers concentrated on tasks and methods that may promote mathematical creativity and ability in and out of school. Regarding school mathematics, Ferrington proposed that creativity can be developed by asking challenging questions, while Tanaka suggested that asking students to pose problems can be seen as a creative activity. Vilches and Gorriz suggested that open challenges encourage students to create their own innovative product. Furthermore, Mamiy and Mamiy focused on the mathematical circle as a means for developing mathematical creativity. Furthermore, BÃ¡rtlovÃ¡ claimed that teachers can develop studentsâ mathematical abilities out of school by encouraging students to participate in unconventional environments such as interactive science centres. Moreover, Mikaelian presented an approach to aesthetic education in learning mathematics, while Abdounur highlighted the way in which the relationship between mathematics and theoretical music influenced our understanding of important mathematical concepts. Finally, one poster presented by Choe provided insights into South Koreaâs education system and its negative impact on studentsâ mathematical creativity. In the closing session of the TSG, researchers raised questions which are crucial and open to further investigation. They also offered ideas for future research studies and collaborations. Overall, the work of the TSG demonstrated how much research in mathematics creativity has evolved and still how many questions need to be answered. It appears that mathematical creativity is an important topic within the ï¬eld of mathematics education that is worth pursing and has a lot to offer in our highly demanding and rapidly changing world."
344,625,0.988,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"7 From Political Diagnosis to Therapy If policy failure is dominated by knowledge gaps, while biased political incentives have only minor importance, formal political institutions (e.g. constitutional rules like electoral rules or legislative procedures) have little impact on political performance. By the same argument, a simple increase in the political influence of any stakeholder organization will also be ineffective. Furthermore, if neither the policy beliefs of policymakers nor the parameter specifications of scientific models correspond to the true political technology, adequate political knowledge does not yet exist neither in the scientific system nor in political praxis and thus must be created in the political process. Designing effective observational policy learning is facilitated by an effective monitoring and evaluation system. However, even with an appropriate M&E system, observational learning often takes a long time and hence is extremely costly. Therefore, beyond observational learning, communication learning is also important. The latter requires an interactive exchange between scientific modelers, politicians and stakeholders. To facilitate this exchange, innovative communication tools, such as computer-based policy toolkits like CAADP-lab, or participatory policy processes including politicians and stakeholders as well as research and donor organizations are required."

170,172,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"12 Conclusion and Way Forward This study reveals the current progress within empirical description and analysis around measuring the nexus between ICTs and poverty. In looking at the literature, earlier reviews around the theory of ICT and development showed fairly simplified constructions of ICTs (either via access, ownership or usage) without well-measured indicators on the poor. Furthermore, earlier literature before 2002 concentrated on the macro-level of economic change, and less emphasis was placed on understanding the micro-level impact changes on poverty reduction. Research today acknowledges that ICTs could dually serve as tools for both economic development and poverty reduction. Through this current review, one acknowledges that research in measuring poverty reduction at the micro-level has further developed in ICTD literature. Today, the variety of poverty measures being utilised by ICTD researchers appear to be aligned with the current concepts used by poverty experts. For example, both discipline streams are approaching poverty and ICT measurement in multiple dimensions and are attempting to analyse its transitions and impact over time. Despite this congruent nature of contemporary poverty theory and ICT research, there are still few studies within social welfare and poverty research trying to build on the measurement link between ICTs and poverty. With the importance of statistical analysis, less research has been done on ICTs and poverty (or wellbeing) through a participatory perspective. Participatory approaches and subjective wellbeing measures in ICT and poverty studies would add to the knowledge contribution in this field. The incorporation of the participatory methods which substantially involve the participants and where their aspirations and wellbeing are being asked is recommended. Applied techniques and refinement of indices for ICTs and the various poverty composite measures are also necessary to provide realistic recommendations to stakeholders on the future of ICT infrastructure or social policy development. As a way forward, we are far from reaching the end on the war against poverty. Various approaches, interventions and participation would need to coordinate together to reach an end goal of improving the lives of the poor. Developing countries today have learned that national policy requires commitment to finding the ideal balance of inclusive growthâeconomic growth alongside social welfare"
344,258,0.988,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"explain the poor past performance of policy reforms and investment strategies, particularly in the agricultural sector. Most of these studies have offered narratives based on historical accounts, emphasizing the strong role of powerful personalities, vested interests, corruption, and external pressures in influencing policy outcomes (Clay and Schaffer 1984; Juma and Clark 1995; Keeley and Scoones 2003; Young 2005). However, theoretical approaches that analyze determinants of policy processes and their impact on poor political performance also exist. One field of the political economy literature holds that biased incentives are the main source of low political performance. Biased political incentives result from asymmetric lobbying activities (Grossman 1994) or biased voter behavior (Bardhan Mookherjee 2002). Further, Persson and Tabellini (2000) emphasize the role of formal constitutional rules as determinants of politician incentives for choosing inefficient policies. In addition to biased incentives, the lack of adequate political knowledge has also been considered as an explanation for the poor political performance of countries. For example, Beilhartz and Gersbach (2004), Bischoff and Siemers (2011) and Caplan (2007) emphasize the role of biased voter beliefs about policy impacts as a main determinant of inefficient policy choices. Voter beliefs are defined as agentsâ simplified mental models to approximate the complex true relation between policy instruments and induced policy outcomes. The work of Caplan is highly recognized in the public choice literature, as he collects an impressive amount of evidence for persistently biased voter beliefs. Based on his empirical findings, Caplan draws the rather pessimistic conclusion that democratic mechanisms of preference aggregation naturally lead to the choice of inefficient policies. However, beyond voters, politicians and lobbyists may also fail to fully understand the complex relation between policy instruments and desired policy outcomes. Hence, the lack of political knowledge (i.e., biased policy beliefs) is another important cause of policy failure. In response to persisting policy failure in many developing countries, participatory and evidence-based political processes are increasingly promoted as an omnipotent tool/mechanism for guaranteeing unbiased political incentives for political agents and allowing the full use of all available political knowledge at both the academic and practical levels. However, designing such ideal-typical policy processes is challenging in political practice. An applicable model framework must first be developed to not only enable a political diagnosis (i.e., the identification of existing incentives and knowledge gaps) but also allow the development of a political therapy (i.e., the derivation of adequate strategies for reducing the identified political performance gaps). The latter criterion requires quantitative modeling of political decisionmaking and policy learning processes, including the endogenous formation of legislatorâs political preferences and policy beliefs. In a dynamic context, explaining the persistence of a lack of political knowledge requires a further explanation of the reasons for which policy learning fails. In this context, we suggest an evolutionary Computable General Political Economy Equilibrium Model (eCGPE) as a quantitative approach to modeling and evaluating policy processes. This chapter is focused on the derivation of the eCGPE approach, and the chapters that follow use the implementation of the"
13,28,0.988,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Changing the Norm from Within What may a generational and psychosocial study of the social patterns feelings of gender add to the understanding of the social transformation of gender? I will end this chapter with a short discussion of this in relation to three perspectives on change in contemporary feminist theory taken from political theory, poststructuralist/queer theory and practice theory. In contrast to feminist work in the 1970s and 1980s, which put emphasis on structural change, contemporary feminist theories are more oriented towards agency, practices, processes, symbolic power and meaning. With regard to this, my view is that including the feelings of gender would contribute to improving the understanding of how gender norms and practices are both connected with larger social forces and, at the same time, may be transformed âfrom withinâ. Feelings find their ways into peopleâs agencies during their life course and at specific historical times. Political theory works with the assumption that in order to be political, identities must be explicit and articulated, and that political action is characterised by having a collective and public form.

87,150,0.988,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","related to some subjective meaning or intention. Even further, a social action refers to an âactâ which considers the actions and reactions of other individuals. Thus, according to Parsons, the basic elements of a system are âactsâ. An act requires an actor, an end/outcome, a future state of affairs towards which the process of action is oriented and an action situation, which is defined by âconditionsâ of action, and actorsâ âmeansâ, and that allows alternatives or choices. The latter implies that actorsâ individual orientations are relevant. Actions are usually not isolated events but must be seen in relation to the actions of other individuals. Thus, a âsocial system is a system of processes of interaction between actors, it is the structure of the relations between the actors as involved in the interactive process which is essentially the structure of the social system. The system is a network of such relationshipsâ (Parsons 1991[1952], p. 15). One important point is that social systems develop stable patterns that are rather independent from the individual actors. Through stable patterns emerging from repeated interactions, rules or norms evolve. In more complex social systems, such norms become generalised, appear as collectively shared knowledge and form complex normative structures rather independent from individuals. Thus, social systems are emergent phenomena, which are constituted by norms, roles and institutions. From the perspective of an individual, the social systems appear as given structures. Actors will orient their actions not only towards action outcomes, as utilitarian (economic) theories suggest, but actions will also follow a normative orientation taking third-party actions and expectations into account. Parsons thus distinguishes motivational orientations that refer to needs and benefits of individuals and normative orientations. Since there are many possible action situations, actors face the problem to interpret situations, to know, which rules to apply. Therefore, actors must share knowledge and understand signs and symbols, which help to identify the nature and the meaning of situations. These shared knowledge and beliefs and the expressive"

But, it is more research on the various principles and control technologies of environmental problems from the perspective of natural science; it can only tell us the current status of environmental pollution and under such circumstance what technologies to be adopted for governance. Here are two problems: first, environmental pollution is not solely caused due to technical reasons; actually, environmental economics already demonstrated that the root cause is the externality of environmental resource, but people do not thoroughly understand this. Just because of the dual effects of both market failure caused by externality and policy failure caused by inadequate understanding, environmental problems appeared. Therefore, environmental pollution governance should essentially be to correct the market failure and policy failure. Secondly, assessment and measurement of environment must include status, pressure and response, because environmental change is such a dynamic consecutive process, during which, when human activities impose certain pressure on environment, environmental status would change and the society should respond to such change to restore environmental mass or prevent environment from degradation. If the measurement and assessment only covers current status of environment, the dynamic change of environment canât be obtained. (2) Natural resource and environmental economics. It discussed the root cause of environmental problems from the socio-economic perspective, put forward various policies and economic means to control environmental problems, explored the value connotation of environment and proposed different types of methodologies for environmental assessment. But, these analyses must be established on the data of environmental status. So, natural resource and environmental economics need the theoretical support of natural sciences such as environmentology. In addition, although natural resource and environmental economics attempted including environment (resource) into the system of national accounts so as to establish appropriate sustainable development ability evaluation system, there is still no single final conclusion from the existing environment and economic comprehensive accounting; from related research results we observed that there are at least two weaknesses: (1) Simple natural resource accounting or roughly putting natural resource depletion value and ecological environmental degradation value into national accounts. This fails to differentiate economic value and ecological value according to its correlation to economic strength and its essential characteristic; thus confusion of the relationship between economy and environment might occur, which is kind of barrier to the provision of objective, systematic and orderly baseline data for the establishment of policies regarding economy, natural resource, environment and other related price policies. (2) Roughly copying SEEA related concept of natural assets, which might lead to magnified comprehension of natural resource and misunderstanding of it, confused with concepts that are commonly used in economic sphere, such as economic assets and financial assets. Finally, environment and economic comprehensive accounting theory are already mature, but it can only be used to evaluate static regional sustainability, not the dynamic development trends of regional sustainability.

214,466,0.988,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Virtually all discussions of the use of climate data introduce the word uncertainty early in the narrative (in this book, see the fourth sentence of Chap. 1). Uncertainty is perhaps the dominant focus. Uncertainty is present in many forms. As we have discussed, uncertainty can be related directly to initial observations (initial condition uncertainty), to the physical climate model (structural uncertainty), and to future emissions (scenario uncertainty). There is also uncertainty from observations used in evaluation (usually a part of structural or model uncertainty). There is another class of uncertainty about the impacts of the resulting climate projections on the anthroposphere. Impacts of climate change on human systems include impacts on agriculture, built infrastructure, and ecosystems. These impacts are often highly dependent on the local facts and details, including policy and management practices that are in place. There is uncertainty associated with the response of people. The response is often discussed in terms of changes to technology and future energy systems to reduce emissions. This is called mitigation. However, on a local scale, there are decisions about land use, policy, management,"

78,283,0.988,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"environment and, what is more, spontaneous orders evolve through such informational complexity. Although, in his seminal book The Sciences of the Artificial (new ed. 1996), Herbert Simon used to warn that complexity is âtoo general a subject to have much content,â he pinpointed cases where this approach to the complexity of the subject matter can particularly be fruitful: âparticularly classes of complex systems possessing strong properties that provide a fulcrum for theorizing and generalizing can serve as the foci of attentionâ (Simon 1996, p. 181). Here, we can start appreciating how the complexity of ICTs-driven societies affects canonical tenets of legal and political thought, in four different ways. Figure 1 helps me illustrate this informational approach to the complexity of current legal systems. First, the idea of the law as a set of rules enforced through the menace of physical sanctions ( e.g., Kelsen 1949) often falls short in coping with the new legal and political challenges of the information revolution: identity thefts, spamming, phishing, viruses, and cyber attacks have increased over the past decade, regardless of harsh national laws like the US anti-spam act from 2003. Furthermore, a number of issues, such as national security, cyber-terrorism, availability of resources and connectivity, are systemic, that is, they concern the whole infrastructure and environment of todayâs ICTs-driven societies and, thus, these issues have to be tackled at international and transnational levels. Unsurprisingly, national law-making activism is short of breath, and this is why constitutional powers of national governments have been joinedâand even replacedâby the network of competences and institutions summarized by the idea of governance. Leaving aside how this profound transformation affects the sovereignty of national states, much as democratic processes and models of political legitimacy, attention should be drawn to how often the modern stateâs monopoly of power and legitimate violence is over in this context. National sovereign states, although still relevant, should be conceived as one of the agents in âthe formation and stewardship of the formal and informal rules that regulate the public realm,â that is, how Hyden, Court and Mease define the notion of governance (in Grindle 2005, p. 14). Second, the scenario of ICTs-driven societies appears increasingly complex since the quantity of information grows and its theoretical compression decreases (Chaitin 2005). To be fair, this trend is not new: some have summed it up with the very process through which pre-modern communities converted into industrial and ICTs-related societies, up to current post-industrial, or ICTs-driven, societies (di Robilant 1973). Others have traced this complexity back to the emergence of"
274,118,0.988,Firm innovation and Productivity in Latin America and The Caribbean : The Engine of Economic Development,"the Caribbean Community Secretariat (CarICOM) adopted a regional science and technology policy (Nurse 2007); in 2000, it established the Caribbean Council for Science and technology to coordinate and implement this policy; and, in 2007, it formulated a regional framework for action (Nurse 2007). More recently, Jamaicaâs National Council for Science and technology (NCSt) introduced a strategic plan entitled âScience and technology for Socio-economic Development: a policy for Jamaicaâ for 2005â2010, using foresighting techniques to develop a five-year master strategy and implementation plan for information communication technologies (ICts) called âe-powering Jamaica 2012â (NCSt 2005). In other countries in the region, while there are institutions responsible for establishing and implementing national innovation systems, for the most part no formal strategic plans exist. It is not clear how much benefit will accrue to the Caribbean because of innovation, largely because there is a paucity of studies on innovation and its impact on productivity in small island developing states like those in the Caribbean. the few studies tend to group the Caribbean with Latin america, and findings suggest that innovation and productivity are quite low and, indeed, constrain growth (Lederman et al. 2014; Ortiz et al. 2012; Daude and FernÃ¡ndez-arias 2010; IDB 2010). Further, we note that most of these studies use spending on r&D to measure innovation activity though, as argued by Crespi and ZuÃ±iga (2012), in developing countries the link between innovation and productivity is not well established since imitation and technology acquisition may play a more important role than r&D investment. In this chapter we examine the impact of innovation on firm productivity in the Caribbean, hoping to fill existing gaps in the literature. We use cross-sectional firm-level data for the manufacturing sector from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) for 14 Caribbean countries. Using non- and semi-parametric tests, and a set of productivity measures, we find evidence that innovative firms exhibit higher productivity than non-innovative firms. to identify any causal effect of innovation on productivity, we follow Crespi and ZuÃ±iga (2012) and Griffith et al. (2006) and use a structural recursive model that takes into account firmsâ decision to invest in innovative activities rather than simply r&D expenditures. this approach models a knowledge-production function based on how much knowledge output is generated from the innovation investment, then estimates an output-production function in which labor productivity is determined by innovative activity together with other inputs. In using this approach, we experiment with other measures of productivity."

Thus the choice of a representation is always a consequential choice that constitutes the view and access we have to mathematical object. Symbolic entities shared some features with early concrete physical tools, while they also differed from early tools in other respects. Vygotskyâs (1978) famous analysis of this relation was that while tools enabled humans to operate on and exert control over the world, symbolic entities also enabled humans to exert control over themselves and regulate their own internal thinking processes-being a central part of these processes. In coming to operate with tools and symbolic entities, human beings gained enormous new powers. Donald (2001) describes this process as the advent of âtheoretical cultureâ and it is the centerpiece of the Baldwinian interpretation of cultural evolution (Baldwin 1896). With tools, humans encoded processes of labor and craft in physical objects, which afforded (Gibson 2014) the actions that constituted those processes. In this way, tools began to structure human society, so that emerging habits of mind, ways of life, and classes of society were reflected and transmitted in the characteristics sets of tools that supported them. Thus, these extensions to human nature also supported intergenerational development, capturing successful innovations in a transmission medium more flexible and more easily shareable than the biological substrate of DNA. With the symbolic system of written language, communications could be detached from particular interpersonal contacts, enabling new forms of literature, history, science, and philosophy. And with the symbolic system of mathematical discourse, the study of abstract form and structure could take shape and transcend the lives of individual thinkers."

Empirical support is sparse also in longitudinal studies. In particular, most longitudinal studies to date have included limited ranges (e.g., middle childhood or adolescence). In addition, little research has examined the specific relation between self-beliefs and their associated behaviors across time (Davis-Kean et al. 2008). Last, comparative studies focusing on the relationship between self-efficacy and cognitive variables in mathematics education are also rare. To date, most research studies on the sources of self-efficacy have been in the field of mathematics education. In their review of the literature, Usher and Pajares (2008) refer to quantitative and qualitative ways of measuring sources of selfefficacy. The adapted version of the Sources of Mathematics Self-efficacy Scaled developed by Lent (1991, as cited in Usher and Pajares 2008) and his colleagues has been used in many studies. The findings of various studies show that mastery experience consistently emerges as the most powerful source of self-efficacy, while findings for the other three sources have been less consistent. Usher and Pajares (2009) note that these inconsistent results may be due to methodological problems such as poor reliability, aggregated scores that mask information from any one source, or multicollinearity between the sources. Usher and Pajares (2008) state that the sources of self-efficacy function best at appropriate levels of specificity and when they correspond with the self-efficacy outcome they are developed to predict. The research related to collective efficacy has been found to be significantly correlated with group performance and other collective motivation constructs such as group cohesion (Klassen and Krawchuk 2009). Despite the recognized importance of collective efficacy, almost all research is focused on teachersâ collective efficacy beliefs and very little attention has been paid to the collective efficacy of students in mathematics."
271,593,0.988,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"There are a couple of studies in this volume which are insightful in their own terms, but which I have some difficulty in seeing as entirely felicitous analyses of communicative figurations. Perhaps there is a risk at this point that communicative figuration research is encountering a âbandwagon effectâ: the terminological inventory that comes with communicative figurations offers a systematic, heuristic vocabulary that many are tempted to associate their research with, although strictly speaking the theoretical and analytical tools of the figurational approach are not fully compatible with the research question. For instance, in their interesting study of the attempts in the 1950s of Hamburg and Leipzig to brand themselves as urban spaces of identity, in a process of âurban collectivity buildingâ, in Chap. 7, Yvonne Robel and Inge Marszolek recognize that â[â¦] the concept of figuration exhibits a strong bias to the investigation of communicative practices. However, not only individuals are involved in these communicative practices but also collectivities and organizations.â On this basis, they argue that it is justified to ask about the role of the citiesâ media organization for the âcollective processes of identity buildingâ, and their analysis accordingly applies a cross-media critical discourse analysis of the two citiesâ broadcasting and electronic media content, considering significant metaphors which position the cities in different ways as a âbridge to the worldâ (Leipzig) and âgateway to the worldâ (Hamburg). However, my problem is that we are not presented with an actor constellation whose negotiations, contestations and concerted efforts can be said to have resulted in the âcommunicative practicesâ (or simply âcontentsâ) disseminated by the"

Dispositions are especially relevant to the current international governmental climate in which the importance of mathematical literacy to economic well-being is widely acknowledged, with many countries aiming to entice students into STEM careers. Figure 3 shows a strong association between studentsâ reporting of high exposure to a task and their conï¬dence in solving it. Figure 3 also illustrates a general ï¬nding that conï¬dence is higher for solving formal mathematics problems than applied problems, at each level of exposure. One explanation is that solving applied mathematics problems requires both a good understanding of the underlying abstract structure as well the ability to analyze the real-world situationâin other words, it requires the PISA mathematical processes of Formulate and Interpret, as well as Employ.

Park, Oh, and Kwon addressed the analysis of textbooks as an approach in teacher education to bring PSMTs closer to the curriculum and to their future work as teachers. Lin, Yang, and Chang discussed a course in which PSMTs had opportunities to understand studentsâ mathematical thinking, cultivate the competencies of exploration and practice, and develop positive beliefs towards mathematics teaching and learning. In the second session on PSMTsâ knowledge, four presentations focused on teacher education practices related to speciï¬c mathematical content areas and processes. Manouchechriâs study prepared PSMTs to become familiar with mathematical modelling. The study shows that teachers experienced difï¬culty enacting the mathematical practice of mathematical modelling. Lin and his colleagues examined PSMTsâ teaching of mathematical induction in the context of their ï¬eld experiences. JuhÃ¡sz et al. focused on the development of PSMTs content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge in a teacher education course based on problem solving. Finally, Ãlmez, IzsÃ¡k, and Beckmann pointed out that the quantitative deï¬nition for multiplication is linked to PSMTs capacity to visualize the relationships between the multiplier and multiplicand in strip diagrams. Coincidentally, the research threads discussed in PSMTsâ knowledge reflected the same emphases as some of the studies found in the topical survey that the group published (Strutchens et al., 2016). Three presentations were given in the technology focused session. Zbiek discussed the conceptual tools for framing secondary mathematics teacher preparation and technology use. She argued that TPACK (Technological, Pedagogical, And Content Knowledge), long used as a framework for knowledge and recently proposed as an orientation towards technology use, is productively enriched by elaboration. Within this frame, she further illustrated conceptual tools for framing technology, content, and pedagogy. She suggested that PSMTs should encounter multiple forms of technology in all venues of their preparation: content courses, pedagogy course, and practical experiences. Wu examined how PSMTs learn to teach mathematical concepts via a video-based approach. The participantsâ reflection reports documented how they learned from an expert teacher, their peers, and self-reflections. Moreno and Llinares shared PSMTsâ perspectives on the use of technology for supporting mathematics learning. They found that PSMTs perspectives on the use of technology were deï¬ned by the way in which technological resources were used and the nature of the mathematical activity. Two papers were presented at the session devoted to PSMTsâ professional identity. They revolved around two notions related to identity. The ï¬rst one is PSMTsâ self-perceptions and was employed by Hine in his analysis of how PSMTs understand and perceive their âreadinessâ to teach mathematics based on their pre-service education. The second one, employed by Durandt and Jacobs, is PSMTsâ attitudes. The authors investigated PSMTsâ attitudes towards modeling based on their initial exposure to a model-eliciting task.

170,11,0.988,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"The age of globalisation has been defined in terms of access to modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) by some scholars (Hutton and Giddens 2001; Castells 2000; Rantanen 2001). Scholarly debate about the role of ICTs as an agent of social organisation and transformation has raged on before and since, from discussions about the networked information society (Bell 1999; Castells 1996) and consideration about the commercial potential of the technology (Gandy 2002; Shapiro and Varian 1999) to critiques of the systemic divides in organisation, access, use, adaptation and impact (Mansell 1999; Norris 2001; Warschauer 2003). Since these initial considerations, we find ourselves living in a world where ICTs have diffused widely to far-flung corners of the globe and are being deployed to confront some of the worldâs most complex problems. Scholarly debates in domains such as the global digital divide continue, in which some argue that technologies such as mobile phones have led to the expansion of socio-economic opportunity for the developing world (Donner 2008; Waverman et al. 2005), to those who claim that inequalities remain, with resultant limitations on their societal impact (Carmody 2013; Hilbert 2014). We focus here on notions of the impact of ICTs on international development, going beyond issues of access and use, well documented elsewhere. As the current Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approach the initial deadline of 2015, it is timely to take stock of the impact these technologies have had on key development problems. This moment is simultaneously the culmination of the second round of SIRCA II (the Strengthening Information Society Research Capacity Alliance), a capacity-building programme for information society research in the context of development in the Global South. It is then worthwhile too to interrogate the impact of research endeavours on the development process."
143,36,0.988,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Managing the Fine Details of Doing Business in Kenya There are no longer confused arguments about why a country would, or would not, seek an ICT-enabled transformation. As Nagy Hanna in Mastering Digital Transformation: Towards a Smarter Society, Economy, City and Nation explained, it is âthrough ubiquitous connectivity, digitization of content and processes, crowdsourcing, collaborations, tools, knowledge networks, sensors, data capture and sharing, artificial intelligence, and analytics, [that] ICT can help build innovative enterprises, mobilize local knowledge and problem solving, and make global knowledge accessible to all. ICT can network actors and organizations across sectors and regions, build collaborative platforms to co-create development solutions, and enable client-centric service delivery.â To achieve these benefits, there must be good leadership and an enabling dynamic policy environment. Chapter 11, âInside a Policymakerâs Mind: An Entrepreneurial Approach to Policy Development and Implementation,â by the author of the present chapter, offers an analysis of the policy process that led to the ICT boom in Kenya during President Mwai Kibakiâs administration (2003â2013) and of the policy developments that spurred the highly successful innovations in the countryâs ICT sector. The chapter explains the course of establishing the institutions that supported ICT entrepreneurship and describes the process involved in the making of far-reaching policies and analyzes, using three case studies in ICT policy developmentâthe TEAMS fiber-optic cable project, the M-PESA application project, and the Posta land development projectâand discusses their contributions to Kenyaâs ICT boom, arguing that if there is any lesson to be learned from the Kenyan experience, it is that political will is by far the most important aspect of policy development. Countries in the Global South are replete with failed projects, in part because of a lack of political will. The chapter also describes how other factors, such as pro-activeness, innovative outside-the-box thinking, and an appetite for risk, played key roles in the success of the Kenyan ICT transformation process."
38,23,0.988,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"sampling and species identiï¬cation is more cost-effective and situation-appropriate if conducted using local and regional expertise. A more positive view is that networks are the appropriate structure for addressing certain categories of problems, which happen to be pervasive in the modern era. These include complex and interconnected issues (like biodiversity loss) in which there are many affected parties, none of whom can solve the issue by working alone (Kickert et al. 1997). Networks are intrinsically adaptive, arguably more so than top-down structures, despite the apparent power and responsiveness of traditional command-and-control approaches. This paradox is explained by the fact that centrally-directed action is only effective if the goal is clearly deï¬ned, relatively unchanging and shared by all parties. Polymorphous, emerging and shifting objectives are better served by a more devolved approach. Anyone who has been part of a large, hierarchical organisation will know they have inherent inertia. Notable examples of biodiversity networks are the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Species 2000 (Roskov et al. 2013), and World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS; Boxshall et al. 2014; Costello et al. 2014). GBIF is a network of countries and afï¬liated NGOs. Species 2000âs members publish species databases through its website, and WoRMS is a network of over 200 individual taxonomists who edit parts of a common online database. Other forms of partnerships also exist, such as consortium agreements (e.g., FishBase) (reviewed by Costello et al. 2014), but the most enduring initiatives are international. GEO BON is a ânetwork of networksâ. Its parent body (GEO) was formed to catalyse a âcoordinated, comprehensive and sustained Earth Observationâ system in support of informed decision-making worldwideâ. Like its parent body, GEO BON is a voluntary âcommunity of practiceâ that serves to translate user needs in the broad arena of biodiversity (but especially at national to global scales, where the needs are often related to international treaties), into observational products and services, through collaboration between the many existing biodiversity information sources and other Earth observation systems. Biodiversity observation, while intrinsically a collaborative activity, has not always been achieved through networks. Even in the present time, much of the primary work is done within centrally-managed organisations. As the scope of the activity increases and as larger scale drivers of biodiversity change increase in prominence, those organisations are increasingly dependent on the activities of other organisations to effectively detect and attribute biodiversity change. It is possible to imagine a global unitary organisation focussed on biodiversity observations, but it would almost certainly be unachievable in the foreseeable future given issues of national sovereignty and the sheer scale of the task. To address the urgent current needs for increased and shared biodiversity observations, some form of collaborative network seems inevitable. While networks are often presented as a âlow-costâ option involving little more than existing efforts, they come with additional transactional costs which can be large enough to overwhelm the beneï¬ts flowing from collaboration (Costello et al. 2014). Apparently-simple guidelines can avoid this outcome: donât work through a"
212,486,0.988,Life Cycle Management,"The capability maturity model (CMM) concept originates from a quality management maturity grid proposed by Phil Crosby (1979), subsequently developed for numerous functions, such as software engineering, integrated product development, systems engineering and more. The CMMI Institute (cmmiinstitute.com) integrated these models, but they are extremely complex and inappropriate for SME suppliers (Sukhoo et al. 2007). Development of a simpler and more practical LCM CMM is described under Methods. A series of company case studies are then presented to compare the theory of CMMs with the real world practice of LCM. In some cases, the company projects explicitly applied the LCM CMM developed by UNEP/ SETAC. In other cases, the company projects made no direct application of CMM, but were simply efforts to apply LCM principles to address specific objectives. The focus of the case studies is on the change management issues that can promote or inhibit success of company improvement initiatives. These company experiences are then reviewed and reconciled with the LCM CMM concepts to develop a framework that companies can use to tailor LCM to their specific competitive context, environmental constraints and opportunities, and strategic priorities. The basic premise is that a structured approach to help address these softer management issues can be a useful strategy to mainstream LCM in business. Finally, the chapter concludes with recommendations for future research to expand business capacity for LCM and to promote its effective integration into routine business decision-making processes."
234,33,0.988,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"Chapter 4 marks the shift in conceptualisation emerging from both our own evaluation and learning but coinciding with wider policy agenda. The missing piece of the jigsaw it seems was the failure to understand both conceptually and in terms of operational dynamics, the step from training through learning to individual behaviour change. We have learnt that knowledge mobilisation does not automatically derive from learning; knowledge in itself is not empowering and may, indeed, be disempowering. Knowledge mobilisation is highly contextualised and needs to be understood within the frame of wider human resource management systems. In marked contrast to the approaches favoured in health sciences focusing on âsystematic reviewsâ of published research on similar (identical) interventions, we undertook a much broader horizon-scanning research review process. Our aim here was to identify any knowledge or ideas that could facilitate our understanding of the interventionâfailure or systems stasis we were witnessing. Chapter. 4 reviews some of the work we identiï¬ed and its impact on our learning and volunteer deployment model. Chapter 5 applies the newly combined knowledge discussed in Chapter. 4 to two illustrative case studies. As we have noted, interventions in a project like the SVP take place and are modiï¬ed over time. In many ways they represent a simple âtrial and errorâ approach underpinned by intensive grounded research to facilitate our understanding of change processes or change resistance. Tracking the identiï¬cation of a âneedâ and our experience of designing and monitoring the evaluation of that process, in the light of the new knowledge gained through ongoing research review improves our understanding of the complexity of social processes. Chapter. 5 redeï¬nes the objectives of our action-research project from the starting point where we believed we were setting out to capture the ingredients of positive change to one of pro-actively understanding and learning from failure. It attempts, in the context of this potentially debilitating reality, to take stock and identify the characteristics of least harm interventions to chart the next stage of our journey."
212,90,0.988,Life Cycle Management,"In addition to information on environmental and social impacts of their products or processes, a better understanding is necessary of both internal and external stakeholders, the current market conditions and the future opportunities linked with sustainability achievements. Discussion with all relevant stakeholders helps to get information on the legal and other requirements including environmental and social concerns. In addition, such discussion is also important when setting up objectives and targets. Goals to improve productsâ environmental and social performance will also have an effect on customersâ expectations and responses. Once the status overview is performed, then the next step will be to set objectives and targets. The criteria to select possible areas of product improvement are based on the responses from the questions listed in the survey. In some cases, the social and environmental problems identified by an organization may be solved by anotherâs efforts, for example, the invention of a new technology or a supplier phasing out harmful substances due to pressure from other stakeholders. Therefore, the decision on prioritizing areas of concern for LCM initiatives is based on the finding from research on the current situation and knowledge. The following aspects are usually considered in the decision process (Remmen et al. 2007): â¢ Areas of considerable environmental and social impacts along the productsâ life cycle (Relevance). Impacts occurred within the organization facility may be easily identified.

169,460,0.988,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The importance of goals and mental models to decision-making becomes clear if the AM cycle is expanded to try to account for the complexity of the policy world (Fig. 16.3). In the assessment phase, all factors in Fig. 16.2 are used to deï¬ne the problem (usually as a trend) and the pattern of likely causes. From the outset this is complicated by the fact that the nature of the problem itself is in question. Problems may have multiple interpretations, based on conï¬icting values and goals (Weick 1995). Even if the basis of a problem is relatively simple and clear, the goals and mental models of individuals and of the surrounding culture and politics will dominate how it is deï¬ned and interpreted. This is because goals and mental models act like a ï¬lter that determines what information is selected and how it is measured in evaluating policy performance or in decisions as to how policy is implemented. One example of this is the physics of increasing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which is not complex. It can only cause more heat to be retained, and this reliably predicts why the years since 2000 have exhibited the hottest atmospheric temperatures ever measured. Yet many deny the evidence (that climate change exists at all) or the theory that society is driving it by generating more greenhouse gases. Political conservatives, who often ascribe to hierarchist or individualist paradigms, tend to deny climate change theory or evidence. Political liberals, who tend to subscribe to paradigms centered on community (communitarian) and social equality (egalitarian), tend to accept the science supporting climate change theory (Kahan 2008, 2013). However, both conservatives and liberals are equally likely to interpret data ideologically. There is a third, social and political, aspect involved. As Kahan (2013) concludes: â. . .ideologically motivated cognition . . .[is] a form of information processing that promotes individualsâ interests in forming and maintaining beliefs that signify their loyalty to important afï¬nity groups.â Thus, while the perceived political and economic consequences of climate"

Nature-based solutions as social-spatial interventions have a transformative impact in the relations between people and nature. First, nature-based solutions contribute in the mental and physical health and wellbeing of people in cities (Andersson et al. 2015; Ambrey and Fleming 2014, p. 1298; Bratman et al. 2015; Buchel and Frantzeskaki 2015; Carrus et al. 2015). Reconnecting with nature in cities can contribute to social ties, establishment of sense of community and social cohesion (Kazmierczak 2013). Second, nature-based solutions are systemic ways on locally responding to climate change pressures. So far research has focused on the (potential) insurance value of naturebased solutions that revolves around the restorative capacity of these solutions deeming them effective for climate change adaptation and mitigation (Green et al. 2016; Haase et al. 2012; Kabisch et al. 2016; Mullaney et al. 2015; Andersson et al. Chap. 4 this volume). We add to this understanding is that nature-based solutions can have regenerative impact (Carrus et al. 2015, p. 226). We argue that for understanding the impact of nature-based solutions in cities, we need to attend to their social production (Ernston 2013). In this way, we will understand how nature-based solutions as social-spatial settings, they mediate the need and ability of actors and communities to establish a positive dependence of place motivating them to restore it (Tidball and Stedman 2012, p. 297). Third, transition initiatives are instrumental in creating and localizing nature-based solutions, moving from a passive experience âof natureâ to an active experience âwith (making) natureâ. In this way, transition initiatives experiment with nature-based solutions, learn-by-doing on how to adapt them to city-specific and place-specific situations and geophysical characteristics and create new narratives and understandings of their benefits. As thus, nature-based solutions are seeds of transformation of local practice and local space towards more sustainable ones. In line with the above, nature-based solutions as social-ecological settings require social actors and social processes to be implemented in cities. In this chapter we examine the way nature-based solutions scale as a social process that includes transition initiatives driving their social production. Specifically, we examine, how transition initiatives as actor configurations that establish, experiment and localise nature-based solutions shift them from âsolutionsâ to social configurations, making nature-based solutions the new âurban commons of sustainabilityâ and in this way contributing to accelerating sustainability transitions in cities."

38,431,0.988,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"10.2.2 Modelling Across Space and Time, Present to Future Other applications of modelling to policy development, planning and management require explanatory and/or predictive modelling to be performed not only across space, but also across time. The use of modelling to predict potential changes in biodiversity into the future, often referred to as âforecastsâ or âprojectionsâ (Coreau et al. 2009), as a function of ongoing impacts of environmental drivers (e.g., climate and land-use change), has gained particular prominence in recent years (Pereira et al. 2010; Cook et al. 2014). Such modelling poses special challenges, as there is usually considerable uncertainty associated with the future trajectories of relevant environmental drivers, which themselves will be affected by socio-economic events and decisions that are yet to occur, and are therefore highly unpredictable. These uncertainties are often addressed through the use of scenariosâi.e., multiple plausible trajectories for environmental drivers, that account for the reality that not just one, but many, futures are possible (van Vuuren et al. 2012). Model-based biodiversity projections under plausible scenarios of change in key drivers can contribute signiï¬cantly to policy agenda setting, by helping to characterise and communicate the potential magnitude of ongoing change in biodiversity, and therefore the need for action. By extending scenarios to further consider the effects of alternative policy or management interventions, such projections can also play an important role in decision supportâi.e., helping policy-makers, planners and managers to choose between possible actions for addressing the problem at hand, by modelling the difference that each of these alternatives is expected to make to projected outcomes for biodiversity (Cook et al. 2014). As for predictive modelling across geographical space, projections of biodiversity change into the future can be based on either inductive or deductive modelling (Pereira et al. 2010). When inductive models are employed for future projection, these are most often derived from correlative data analysis (i.e., explanatory modelling) of relationships between biodiversity and environmental drivers observed across space alone, rather than across time. Using such models to project changes across time involves space-for-time substitution. This assumes that"

275,22,0.988,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"is heavily concerned with the centre point of autonomy in terms of intrinsic motivation, computational motivation, creativity, freedom of action, and theory of self. Trustworthiness is largely seen as a here as a necessary but not sufficient condition for such agents to be trusted by humans to carry out tasks in complex environments, with considerable implications for the need for controls on agent behaviour as a component of its motivational processes. Sun argues that agents need to have intrinsic motivation, meaning internal motivational processes, if they are to deal successfully with unpredictable complex environments. Intrinsic motivation is required under such conditions because criteria defining agent control cannot be specified prior to operation. The importance of intrinsic motivation in regards to the successful operation and acceptance by humans under conditions of fundamental uncertainty represents a challenge that requires serious redress of familiar but outdated assumptions and methodologies. Furthermore, the ability to understand the motivation of other agents is central to trust, because having this ability means that the behaviour of other agents is predictable even in the absence of predictability of future states of the overall environment. Indeed, the argument is that predictability of the behaviour of other agents through understanding their motivations is what enables trust, and this also explains why trust is such an important issue in an uncertain operating environment. The chapter presents an overview of a cognitive architecture â the Clarion cognitive architecture â supporting cognitive capabilities as well as intrinsic and derived motivation for agents; it amounts to a structural specification for a variety of psychological processes necessary for autonomy. In particular, the focus of the chapter in this regard is on the interaction between motivation and cognition. Finally, several simulations of this cognitive architecture are given to illustrate how this approach enables autonomous agents to function correctly. Merrick et al. discussion on computational motivation extends a very similar argument, by arguing that computational motivation is necessary to achieve open-ended goal formulation in autonomous agents operating under uncertainty. Yet it approaches this in a very different manner, by realising computational motivation in practical autonomous systems sufficient for experimental investigation of the question. Here, computational motivation includes curiosity and novel-seeking as well as adaptation, primarily as an epistemic motivation for knowledge increase. Agents having different prior experiences may behave differently, with the implication that intrinsic motivation through prior experience impacts trustworthiness. Thus trust is a consequence of how motivational factors interact with uncertainty in the operating environment to produce an effect that is not present under closed environments containing only measurable stochastic risk, where essentially rationality and thus trustworthiness is a definable in terms of an optimality condition that means that agents operate without a much scope for exercising choice. The chapter concludes that the empirical evidence presented is consistent with the thesis that intrinsic motivation in agents impacts trustworthiness, in potentially simultaneously positive and negative ways, because of the complex of overlapping and sometimes conflicting implications motivation has for privacy and security. Trustworthiness is also impacted by what combination of motivations the agents employ"

Consequently the focus of the research was mainly the development of new scaling methods (such as Thurstone or Likert Scales or questionnaires) to measure attitude and little attention was paid to theoretical aspects, in particular to the definition of attitude, and to the relationship between attitude and other affective constructs. As Leder (1985, p. 21) underlines: âin many cases, authors either implicitly or explicitly define attitude to mathematics in terms of the instrument(s) used in their research.â At the end of the 1980s, the measurement approach begins to be challenged: several studies show that the correlation between attitude and mathematics achievement is far from being clear. Moreover, the gap between development of instruments and theoretical clarification of the construct began to be considered very problematic, and many scholars explicitly criticized the state, the results, and the trend of the research on attitude: First, the construct of attitude has been vague, inconsistent, and ambiguous. Second, research has often been conducted without a theoretical model of the relationship of attitude with other variables. Third, the attitude instruments themselves are judged to be immature and inadequate. (Germann 1988, p. 689)"

New media have been emerging with an increasing speed: Internet platforms, mobile media and the many different software-based communication media we are recently confronted with as âappsâ. This process is experiencing yet another boost from the ongoing and increasingly fast sequence of technological media innovations. In our modern social world, communication processes take place across a variety of media. As a consequence, we can no longer explain the influences of media by focusing on any one single medium, its content and possible effects. In order to explain how media changes are related to transformations in culture and society we have to take into account the cross-media character of communications. In view of this, the book series âTransforming Communicationsâ is dedicated to cross-media communication research. It aims to support all kinds of research that are interested in processes of communication taking place across different kinds of media and that subsequently make mediaâs transformative potential accessible. With this profile, the series addresses a wide range of different areas of study: media production, representation and appropriation as well as media technologies and their use, all from a current as well as a a historical perspective. The series âTransforming Communicationsâ lends itself to different kinds of publication within a wide range of theoretical and methodological backgrounds. The idea is to stimulate academic engagement in crossmedia issues by supporting the publication of rigorous scholarly work, text books, and thematically-focused volumes, whether theoretically or empirically oriented.

271,563,0.988,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Understanding digital traces as the sequence of âdigital footprintsâ which are left by the use of digital media and services represents quite a new area of media and communication research. At the same time, we can refer this back to more prolonged discussions about whether ânewâ media also require ânewâ methods of research (see for example Golding and Splichal 2013; Hutchinson 2016), and have to contextualize it in the much more far-reaching discussion surrounding âdigital humanitiesâ and its methods (Baum and StÃ¤cker 2015; Gardiner and Musto 2015). As a phenomenon, digital traces have evoked a sophisticated but also controversial methodological discussion (Kitchin 2014). In this respect, we can notice a multiple complexity of the phenomenon. First of all, it is important to be aware that they are more than just (big) data. As âbig dataâ is used as âa catch-all, amorphous phraseâ (Kitchin and McArdle 2016), it provokes substantial discussions about its capacity. Heavily criticized by one group of scholars (boyd and Crawford 2012; Andrejevic 2014), it is regarded as the future of empirical research by others (Mayer-SchÃ¶nberger and Cukier 2013; Townsend 2013). Hence, we follow a different direction while discussing some questions of big data later more in detail. Digital traces are a kind of digital data which become meaningful because this sequence of âdigital footprintsâ is in a technical procedure of construction related to a certain actor or action, typically an individual but in principle also a collectivity or an organization. By such procedures of connecting data with entities of the social world they become meaningful information, and this is the reason why companies and other organizations of data processing are highly interested in this kind of data aggregation in relation to ârealâ people. For the purpose of empirical research, a good starting point is to define digital traces as numerically produced correlations of disparate kinds of data that are generated by practices of individual, collective and corporative actors in a digitalized media environment.1 The complexity of digital traces is reasoned by the variety of their production, but also the variety of possible correlations. Recently, digital traces and related possibilities of data generation became an issue of fundamental critique of social science methods; one that we do not share in detail but have to be aware of. The argument at this point is that with increasing datafication, methods of social sciences increasingly entered a âcrisisâ as digital traces seem to be a much more"

It corresponds to the area of freedom left to human eaters by two sets of physical constraints: biological constraints related to their status as omnivores, which are essential but relatively flexible, and the ecological constraints created by the biotope in which they live, which become economic constraints in the industrialised world and which progressively tend to be reduced due to our technological control of nature (Poulain 2017 [2002]). âFood social spaceâ is in line with the Maussian notion of a âtotal social factâ, that is, which âsets in motion â¦ the totality of the society and its institutionsâ (Mauss 1950). It is possible to distinguish various dimensions of social food space: the edible order, the food system, the culinary space, the consumption patterns, food temporality and the social differentiation space.

193,46,0.988,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"Research agendas on Ukrainian migration remain politicized, even though dominating ideologies of the state have changed drastically. In particular the role of external funding is (though not as severely as in the 1990s) influenced by political developments and institutional power relations. There is no specialized research institution dedicated to international migration and there are very few examples of international collaboration, though this seems hardly surprising in a country where both the authorities and the public perceive a poorly defined migration policy as ânormalâ. Even the establishment of a new State Migration Service has not improved the situation. An example of this failed improvement is the use of such statistics to create policies relating to labour migration and Ukrainian citizens living abroad. Many studies from the past cannot be seen as reliable sources documenting migration. A systematic historical study that examines temporality and its main variable of time is at the heart of prospective research. The historical perspective calls for further research examining the link between the two distinct eras of Ukrainian history and its implications. Taking the historical perspective into account is a field of research that would look at current micro systems or the evolving migration cultures that are emerging in Ukraine.

376,373,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","equilibrium point following disturbance (Holling 1973). In contrast, ecological resilience recognizes that ecosystems may not return to their original equilibrium point, but that they may reorganize around alternative equilibrium points (Gunderson 2000). Resilience is often expressed graphically with âbasin-of-attractionâ or âball-andcupâ diagrams to further clarify this abstract concept. In this graphic representation, the ball represents the structural variables of the system in relation to the controlling variables and feedback mechanisms that are represented by the shape and number of the basins (Beisner et al. 2003; Walker et al. 2012). Engineering resilience emphasizes the depth of the basin which determines the rate of recovery following disturbance. Ecological resilience emphasizes the width of the basin to represent the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand without the ball rolling beyond the rim of the basin (threshold) into an alternative basin. Ecological resilience is most commonly applied to natural resource management where thresholds and the formation of alternative stable states are of major concern. State-and-transition models represent a conceptual advance from the traditional range model that was founded on Clementsian succession by recognizing the occurrence of nonlinear vegetation dynamics and the potential existence of alternative stable states on individual ecological sites. These models were originally introduced as a âmanagement language,â rather than an ecological theory, to organize and interpret rangeland vegetation dynamics. However, the STM framework has become a major tool for interpreting and integrating both management and ecological information. Subsequently, these models are broadly viewed as being supported by ecological resilience and are most appropriately considered equilibrium models because individual states exist with a single basin of attraction and thresholds represent boundaries between multiple equilibrium states. Ecological indicators of state variables, controlling variables, and to lesser extent feedback mechanisms that underpin resilience are used to determine if a state is trending toward or away from pending thresholds (Briske et al. 2008). This information can inform managers of the need to implement actions to modify state resilience to achieve desired outcomes. The adoption of resilience theory has had broad consequences for natural resource management by providing an alternative to command-and-control management. Command and control employs a top-down, regulatory strategy that often ignores variation and the complexity of interactions among ecological and social system components (Anderies et al. 2006). The typical response to uncertainty and surprise is to increase control which often further reduces resilience and moves the system toward pending thresholds (Holling 1973; Holling and Meffe 1996). Management strategies to minimize variability and optimize production efficiency in one portion of the system frequently increase vulnerability in another portion of the system. These top-down management strategies have also been founded on unrealistic assumptions regarding the ability of managers to anticipate and implement actions, often as technological solutions, in time to prevent natural resource degradation or ecosystem shifts to alternative states. In contrast to command and control, resilience-based management recognizes both the inevitability of change and the need for change, such that it seeks to guide change, rather than to control it to maintain a single optimal state.

87,819,0.988,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","conducted from 2001 to 2005 under the auspice of the United Nations. The aim of the MEA was to assess the consequences of anthropogenic changes in ecosystems on human well-being and to provide the scientific basis for needed measures for a sustainable use of ecosystems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The study underscored the global dependency of mankind on nature with ecosystem services as the basis for a healthy and safe life. As about 50% of earthâs land area is strongly affected by mankind (Hooke et al. 2012), land use has enormous effects on ecosystem services and biodiversity. Therefore, in order to cover all relevant environmental impacts of a product or process, land-use aspects that impact ecosystem services and biodiversity ought to be integrated into analysis methods such as life cycle assessment. In recent years, methods for considering impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity have been successfully developed and applied in LCA. Fundamental to integrating effects on ecosystem services and biodiversity in LCA is the concept of occupation and transformation of land use. The term occupation means the situation of a studied patch of land, while it is used. It is assumed that there is no change in ecosystem quality during the entire period of use (e.g. 20 years for a short rotation coppice). Occupation is expressed as the level of ecosystem quality during use compared to a specific reference quality. In contrast, the term transformation defines a change in ecosystem quality of a studied patch that occurs between the initial quality of the ecosystem and the end quality after the use phase ends and the land is regenerated. LANCAÂ® (Land Use Indicator Value Calculation Tool) is an approach to integrate the impacts on ecosystem services into LCA (Beck et al. 2010; Bos et al. 2016). It was developed at the University of Stuttgart, Department of Life Cycle Engineering (Baitz 2002) and has been applied in many projects. In LANCAÂ®, indicator values are calculated that describe the environmental impacts of land-intensive processes on various ecosystem services, which are then integrated into the life cycle assessment.

Complexity has been defined by Kennedy et al. as: âThe interaction of many parts of a system, giving rise to behaviours and/or properties that are not found in the individual elements of the systemâ [4]. Or as Wolfram put it: âIt is possible to make things of great complexity out of things that are very simple. There is no conservation of simplicityâ [5]. Self organisation is defined by Camazine et al. as â... a process in which pattern at the global level of a system emerges solely from numerous interactions among the lower-level components of the systemâ [6]. Features of self organising systems that are essential to emergent behaviour are the existence of: positive feedbackâthat leads to amplification of fluctuations; negative feedbackâto counterbalance amplification and provide stabilisation; multi stabilityâthe coexistence of many stable states; and the existence of state transitionsâleading to dramatic change of the system behaviour, i.e. âbifurcationsâ in behaviour occur when some parameter/s are varied. Goldstein [3] identifies five essential features of emergence: â¢ Radical noveltyânovel behaviour occurs that cannot be predicted. â¢ Coherence or correlationâthe novel behaviour has some level of coherence over time. â¢ Global or macro-level behaviourâcoherence occurs at the macro level. â¢ Dynamicalâthe macro-level, while having some coherence in time, also evolves over time. â¢ Ostensiveâemergent behaviours are recognised ostensively, i.e. by showing themselves. While Goldstein identifies that emergence is inherently unpredictable, Fromm [7] proposes that there are four types of emergence, only two of which are unpredictable. The four types of emergence proposed by Fromm are shown in Table 6.1. Using Frommâs classification scheme, there is a clear gradation in the complexity of systems that display emergent behaviour, from the least complex in Type I, to the most complex in Type IV. The following Sections will examine the implications of emergent behaviour in swarm intelligence systems, specifically in relation to their potential use in autonomous systems.

Studying the transformation of the communicative figuration of the journalism-audience relationship requires a clear understanding of its social factors: the actors involved, their forms of communication (social interaction) and their shared frames of relevance which make up the basis upon which a communicative relationship is moulded and oriented (see Table 9.1). Against the background of the above highlighted body of research and following Hasebrink and Hepp (2016: 4f.), we can identify five general trends in a changing media environment that are of particular relevance for journalism: â¢ The differentiation of media and communicative practices that also provides audiences with new chances to participate. â¢ Increasing connectivity between journalists and their audiences through these media and various technical intermediaries. â¢ The omnipresence of audience feedback and other contributions. â¢ An ever-increasing pace of innovation of media technologies and their use by journalists and audiences alike. â¢ The datafication and monitoring of audience behaviour based on increasingly diverse digital traces such as click rates and social media analytics that reveal information about news preferences, evaluation and engagement. Obviously, these trends (can) have various consequences for journalism in general and for the journalism-audience relationship in particular (Loosen 2016). Here, the concept of communicative figurations helps us to reflect on how the journalism-audience relationship transforms with the changing conditions of media and communications â with respect to the communicative practices that are used by journalists and the audience, and the actor constellations in terms of who participates in the production and dissemination of news with respect to the dominating frames of relevance that characterize this relationship. Therefore, if we very broadly define a point in time as the âpre-internet ageâ (t1) and compare that with âthe internet and social media ageâ (t2), we can trace how the communicative figuration of the journalismaudience relationship has changed over time in terms of the dimensions described â and how it continues to change. With respect to the briefly outlined state of research, we come to the following orienting hypotheses:"

Such research is informative about whether the creativity or scientific thinking label applied to the test is in fact warranted. In the present section, the focus is on the creative product itself.

The most direct form involves the evaluation of a concrete product for its creativity. A second and somewhat less direct form relies on test-takersâ self-reports. The test taker is asked to describe his or her activities and accomplishments that may reflect different kinds of creative production, concrete or abstract, in such domains as science, literature, visual arts, and"

In addition, PD facilitatorsâ learning was identiï¬ed as a new focus of research in the ï¬eld. These studies demonstrated the continued value of foundational, exploratory, development, and design research for growing the knowledge base on mathematics PD. Still, very few studies investigated causal links between participation in PD and teacher or student outcomes. In addition research that examines what it takes to bring these programs to scale on the one hand, and that compares the effectiveness of different mathematics professional development programs on the other, needs further development. Secondary mathematics teachersâ professional development programs in speciï¬c contexts were introduced and discussed in TSG 50. The analysis of sustainable effects is crucial for short-term and long-term programs. The way in which sustainable impacts were researched, the theoretical models and empirical ï¬ndings were discussed. More evaluation and analysis of sustainable impacts are needed in the future, along with sustainability in teacher education. The use of technology in mathematics professional development was also a popular topic in TSG 50. Here foci were on the use of technology as interaction tools in and for mathematics teachersâ professional development, as it provides resources and platforms for teachers at scale; and on digital technology as an interactive way to support mathematics teachersâ learning that has great potential prospect. However, research on the effectiveness of using technology as a mode of interactions is limited. Further research is also needed to understand the possible challenges of the transformation in technology-based programs, such as the design of digital PD to match with the context and needs of teachers, the roles of the facilitators, the specialized pedagogy to conduct digital mathematics professional development, and the utilization of big data in understanding digital PD effectiveness. In conclusion, TSG 50 was a learning space where mathematics professional development programs were overviewed theoretically, using different analytical frameworks, as well as empirically. New programs for secondary mathematics teachersâ professional development in speciï¬c context were shared, including some attention to Lesson study, though less so in the Asian context; and all of these with or without information and communication technology. Presentations explored teacher educatorsâ role and their knowledge and skills promotion within diverse backgrounds; and the impact of sustainability of professional development. Others introduced technology-based professional development programs. Some presenters put forward more research questions, including the prospective of using big data to better understand the effectiveness of teachersâ PD. However, we are still short of evidence-based studies and of tools for measuring and evaluating teachersâ learning. These areas remain a challenge for researchers in this ï¬eld.

42,358,0.988,S-BPM in the Production Industry : A Stakeholder Approach,"8.2.3 Hierarchies and Silos A wide variety of stakeholders may need to interact at different stages of the life cycle of production systems and production processes. They include mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, software specialists, production managers, product designers, shopfloor workers and sometimes clients. Discussing different process designs in terms and models that can be understood by all stakeholders independently of their education and disciplineânamely, by using a common language such as S-BPMâwould certainly be advantageous. However, the main obstacle here is that the local work culture in many companies does not encourage collaborative ways of working. For example, it can often be observed that managers take process design decisions without including shopfloor workers in the decision-making process. In addition, mechanical engineers often devise production systems and processes without consulting with the software specialists implementing associated control systems (Alvarez Cabrera et al. 2010). These two examples refer to cultural issues that can be referred to by the notions of hierarchies and silos, respectively. Companies with a strong sense of hierarchy rarely use management approaches that feature worker participation and empowerment. Silo mentality represents a similar obstacle leading to poor collaboration across disciplines, functional departments and business units. The ground for S-BPM in production seems to be most fertile where companies already have established lean and open organizational cultures. This ï¬nding is conï¬rmed by numerous industry experts viewing Lean Management as a precondition for the successful implementation of Industry 4.0 and smart factories. Regarding process modelling aspects of Lean Management, Kannengiesser (2014) has already shown the consistency of S-BPM with the value stream design (VSD) approach. However, the actual challenge remains for company organizations, namely to keep pace and align with these technical advances and foster a participative, collaborative work culture."

Another aspect relevant to CIR is the organisational one, as it relates to the organisations and institutions that manage the physical components of the systems, i.e. CI operators or owners. It covers aspects such as culture, people, business continuity, risk, and disaster management at the organisational level. This more business-oriented aspect, which we have observed in the Australian national policy, serves as a way to gather all current business practices under one common goal: the operability of the infrastructure under adverse circumstances. The social dimension encompasses population and community characteristics that render social groups either more vulnerable or more adaptable to hazards and disasters. We observe that national resilience policies recently include, except of economic or even environmental aspects, social aspects in their deï¬nitions of resilience as CI are vital for maintaining key societal functions. These refer to the community and highlight how infrastructures contribute with essential services to it, e.g. as discussed in the aforementioned NIS Directive. Overall, a resilience-based approach for CI is an approach that is gradually adopted by nations in order to face the challenges and costs of achieving maximum protection in an increasingly complex environment and to overcome limitations of the traditional scenario-based risk management approach, where the organisation may lack capabilities to face risk from unknown or unforeseen threats and vulnerabilities."
3,65,0.988,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"2.4.1.3.1 Theoretical Background The knowledge integration framework was built off of the knowledge in pieces theory (diSessa, 1988), the anchored instruction framework (The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990), situated learning in collaborative groups (Brown & Campione, 1994; Lave & Wenger, 1991), and research that suggests that learning outcomes in science instruction would be best served when one focuses on a smaller number of core concepts (Bierman, Massey, & Manduca, 2006; Eylon & Linn, 1988). These perspectives are explained in the paragraphs that follow. According to the knowledge in pieces theory, students come to school having developed intuitive theories of how physical objects behave under particular circumstances; some of these mini-theories come close to describing phenomena of interest accurately, while others are farther away from describing said phenomena accurately (diSessa, 1988; Taber, 2008). Such mini-theories are not developed as most theories areâthrough careful reflection on a variety of observations in light of other research and theories. Rather, they are âabstractions from common experiencesââsuch as the idea that force can move objects (diSessa, 1988, p. 3). These mini-theories do not together constitute a larger, more comprehensive theory. Furthermore, students do not have the right pieces of knowledge to together explain how physical objects behave in a scientifically accurate way. Some research has suggested that such incomplete mini-theories do not necessarily prompt the teaching of correct information to replace the existing mini-theories (Spada, 1994). Rather, instruction needs to help fill in the gaps in studentsâ knowledge (diSessa, 1988). In anchored instruction, studentsâ learning is centered in an authentic problem situation, which prompts students to define and pursue learning issues (Bransford,"

The consequences of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea may ultimately be an ecological regime shift â i.e. a situation where the ecosystem shifts from one relatively stable state to another with unknown thresholds between the states â with associated risks of detrimental effects on ecosystem services and an unknown degree of resilience (Ãsterblom et al. 2010; Ãsterblom et al. 2007). Traditionally, the governance approach toenvironmental problems and risks has presupposed that various phenomena in natural systems can rationally be dealt with by straightforward science-based management (Linke et al. 2016). The basis for this view has been a reductionist scientific approach, within an international framework of environmental governance, fragmented into sectors and countries and divided into national and international levels (Mee 2005).

Pedagogic arrangements also need to fit with the view of knowledge held by the curriculum-developer. To this end, curriculum decisions need to be made about: pedagogic approaches and strategies (i.e. observation; coaching; goal-orientated learning; mentoring; peer-learning; simulation; instruction; concept-formation; reflection; meta-cognitive learning; problem-solving and practice); relations between knowledge domains (i.e. traditional/fragmented or networked/fully integrated modes); knowledge, skill or dispositional orientations; knowledge framings; progression and pacing; types of relations between teachers and students; relations between types of learners; spatial and temporal arrangements for learning; formative assessment and feedback processes; and the criteria that can be used for evaluating learning. All these need to be taken into account in translating curriculum knowledge into pedagogic knowledge. Learning aims, objectives and prescriptions, or curriculum standards (i.e. learning objects), are therefore distinguished from these pedagogic approaches and also from assessment arrangements. Frequently, an assessment procedure specifies those knowledge-sets, skills or dispositions that a learner is required to have, and which are expressed in such a way that they can be tested in a controlled environment, such as an examination. The principal problem with assessment procedures of this type is that testing a personâs knowledge, skills and dispositions is likely to have washback effects on the original set. Instead of the assessment process acting merely as a descriptive device, it also acts in a variety of ways to transform the curriculum it is seeking to measure. Washback effects work on a range of objects and in different ways. So, for example, there are washback effects on the curriculum, on teaching and learning, on the capacity of the individual and more fundamentally on the structures of knowledge, though these four mechanisms are frequently conflated in the minds of educational stakeholders. Micro washback effects work directly on the person, whereas macro washback effects work directly on institutions and systems, which then subsequently have an impact on individuals within those institutions and systems. Finally, a learner may have to reframe their knowledge or skill set to fit the test, and therefore the assessment of"
341,318,0.988,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"An inclusive, systemic approach to freshwater governance begins by making the distinction between situation and system; no one governance situation is the same so contextual design and application are needed even if some of the principles and practices employed are held in common across contexts. When individuals, groups, organisations and governments engage with freshwater situations, almost overwhelmingly they bring their historical framing choices to the situation. Too often new terms are quickly adopted uncritically and used in ways that do not make clear the underlying conceptions held by different users of the language â in our research this applies to the concept âsocial ecological systemâ, âcomplex adaptive systemâ and the emerging discourse about natural capital, environmental assets or assetbased management (Coffey 2015). Language and concepts used unreflexively undermine inclusivity by capturing a particular framing at the expense of othersâ framings, or by undermining effective collaboration because people speak at crossed purposes. It is because of the importance of initial starting conditions in a given context, and the need to know what these are, as well as paying attention to what will help create an effective governance performance (Ison and Wallis 2011), that we have devoted considerable attention to framing issues and the role of language in this chapter. In achieving sustained systemic governance, these are important practical considerations, not unimportant theoretical musings! As we noted at the beginning when citing Lakoff (2010), all metaphors bring forth an associated system. In other words, language precedes system; in fact the choice to see a freshwater river as a system is a framing choice â the system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter and in our research, we hope to have presented a narrative that supports our normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance."
376,862,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","was the recognition that rangeland systems are characterized by nonlinear dynamics (Briske et al. 2005; Kefi et al. 2007) and cross-scale processes (Peters et al. 2004) that can produce multiple ecosystem states (Chap. 6, this volume). This change in thinking brought into focus the importance of measuring ecological processes and functions at and across characteristic scales on which they operate (Addicott et al. 1987; Peters et al. 2004; Nash et al. 2014). Rangeland Reform â94 (U.S. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service 1994) was the first attempt by federal agencies in the USA to change how rangeland under Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service (USFS) management would be evaluated since the environmental policies of the 1970s (e.g., Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, National Forest Management Act of 1976, Public Rangeland Improvement Act of 1978 BLM and USFS 1994). Two goals of Rangeland Reform â94 were to bring the two management programs closer together and more consistent in conducting ecosystem management and to accelerate the restoration and improvement of public rangelands to proper functioning condition. The changes brought forth in Rangeland Reform â94 were strongly influenced by the National Research Council (1994) report on rangeland health. Each state developed standards of rangeland health that reflected the need to monitor not just plants important for livestock grazing, but biological diversity, soil stability, hydrologic functioning, energy flow, and nutrient cycling (Veblen et al. 2014). As part of the goal to bring agencies together in their management of rangelands, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, USFS, and BLM entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in 2005 to define and describe rangelands using a standard classification system, ecological sites (Caudle et al. 2013). This resulted in federal and non-federal rangelands being classified using the same process where soils, landforms, and climate describe potential plant communities and their production. This led to common terminology and similar metrics for determining rangeland status and trends. Standardized terms and metrics position land managers to take advantage of new technology that cross-cuts management and political boundaries through remote sensing and database access (Chap. 9, this volume). Technological advances in the past quarter century have dramatically increased efficiency of monitoring data collection and analysis as well as opened new possibilities for synoptic rangeland monitoring. The development of robust mobile computing technologies has encouraged electronic capture of data in the field, reducing the potential for recording and transcription errors. The ubiquity and reliability of global positioning system (GPS) technologies not available two decades ago makes it easy to accurately locate (and relocate) monitoring areas. Also during this time period, many of the imaging sensors and analytic techniques that have made remote sensing a staple part of monitoring were developed. The changes described aboveâtheoretical, policy, and technologicalâhave had a significant impact on how rangelands are monitored and how those data can be used for management decision-making. The following are some of the major conceptual advances to rangeland monitoring from the last 25 years."

Partnering in the form of public-private partnerships occur to provide specific services âin the realms of public health, development and environmentâ (Borzel and Risse 2010, p. 120; Healey 2015). Partnering allows collective learning and tackling inequality in place-based projects via new actor collaborations (Devolder and Block 2015) and for seeking resources to sustain the initiative itself (Healey 2015, p. 111; Sagaris 2014). The majority of research writings on impact of transition initiatives to sustainability transitions focused on site-specific impact and majorly under-examine the impact in context dynamics including governance. In our conceptual framework we include two mechanisms to describe and capture the way transition initiatives play out with the city context dynamics: Embedding and Instrumentalising. Instrumentalising is tapping into and capitalizing on opportunities provided by the multi-level governance context of the city-region in order to forge resources for the continuity of the operation of the initiative. Chmutina et al. (2014) note that the ability of transition initiatives to capitalize on opportunities also relies on the existence of âopennessâ situations within multi-level governance for change and for empowering transition initiatives. Acquiring resources is vital for sustaining the activities of the initiative that can also include regeneration of deprived areas (Fraser and Kick 2014, p. 1447; Healey 2015, p. 115) and for growing beyond a âtalking shopâ (Forrest and Wiek 2015). Embedding is the alignment of old and new ways of doing, organizing and thinking in order to integrate them into city-regional governance patterns. Bussu and Bartels (2014) point at embedding engagement and conflict resolution practices from community to the city governance and as a way of âformalizingâ community projects and participation methods (also addressed by Barr et al. 2011). Embedding involves the alignment of efforts, strategies and agendas/goals between transition initiatives and local government across scales (Horsford and Sampson 2014, p. 961; Garcia et al. 2015). Embedding is enabled by the recognition from the public sector to alter practices and be more responsive and receptive/dialectic to innovative practices coming from other actors (Boyer 2015, p. 322; Healey 2015; Healey and Vigar 2015; Frantzeskaki and Kabisch 2016). Overall, embedding captures the extent to which transition initiatives strategically shape the context in which they operate (Moss et al. 2014)."
244,282,0.988,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","In work reminiscent of the earlier work of Green and Lord, Gitomer and Yamamoto (1991) described HYBRID (Yamamoto 1989), a model that incorporates both LT and LC components; these authors, however, defined the latent classes by a cognitive analysis of the understanding that individuals have for a domain. Yamamoto and Everson (1997) also published a book chapter on this topic. Bennett et al. (1991) studied new cognitively sensitive measurement models, analyzing them with the HYBRID model and comparing results to other IRT methodology, using partial-credit data from the GRE General Test. Works by Tatsuoka (1990, 1991) also contributed to the literature relating IRT to cognitive models. The integration of IRT and a person-fit measure as a basis for rule space, as proposed by Tatsuoka, allowed in-depth examinations of items that require multiple skills. Sheehan (1997) developed a tree-based method of proficiency scaling and diagnostic assessment and applied it to developing diagnostic feedback for the SAT I Verbal Reasoning Test. Mislevy and Wilson (1996) presented a version of Wilsonâs Saltus model, an IRT model that incorporates developmental stages that may involve discontinuities. They also demonstrated its use with simulated data and an example of mixed number subtraction. The volume Test Theory for a New Generation of Tests (Frederiksen et al. 1993) presented several IRT-based models that anticipated a more fully integrated approach providing information about measurement qualities of items as well as about complex latent variables that align with cognitive theory. Examples of these advances are the chapters by Yamamoto and Gitomer (1993) and Mislevy (1993a). Bradlow (1996) discussed the fact that, for certain values of item parameters and ability, the information about ability for the 3PL model will be negative and has consequences for estimationâa phenomenon that does not occur with the 2PL. Pashley (1991) proposed an alternative to Birnbaumâs 3PL model in which the asymptote parameter is a linear component within the logit of the function. Zhang and Stout (1997) showed that Hollandâs (1990b) conjecture that a quadratic form for log manifest probabilities is a limiting form for all smooth unidimensional IRT models does not always hold; these authors provided counterexamples and suggested that only under strong assumptions can this conjecture be true. Holland (1990a) published an article on the sampling theory foundations of IRT models. Stocking (1990) discussed determining optimum sampling of test takers for IRT parameter estimation. Chang and Stout (1993) showed that, for dichotomous IRT models, under very general and nonrestrictive nonparametric assumptions, the posterior distribution of test taker ability given dichotomous responses is approximately normal for a long test. Chang (1996) followed up with an article extending this work to polytomous responses, defining a global information function, and he showed the relationship of the latter to other information functions. Mislevy (1991) published on randomization-based inference about latent variables from complex samples. Mislevy (1993b) also presented formulas for use with Bayesian ability estimates.

And then, by measuring the four properties quantitatively, comprehensive coordination of those researches can be achieved. Energy model analysis using mathematical programming is an effective tool measuring 4Rs (robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity) quantitatively. Then, in this paper, the authors try to present quantitative analytical framework to discuss possible appropriate measures to implement seismic resilience into electricity supply system, using simple energy model analysis. The energy model used in this paper is a dynamic power generation planning model, which incorporates the modelling of some measures in accordance with 4Rs and assesses optimal capacity expansion strategy under successive nuclear power plantsâ shut-down risk. It must be understood that the output of the energy model analysis should not be like the future prediction. Its major concern is not to forecast a likely future image of the energy system, but rather to derive a normative future image of the system through the comprehensive incorporation of forecasted future parameters and scenarios. The goal of this paper is to stimulate discussions about seismic resilience enhancement by the normative image obtained through energy model analysis and present its usefulness in that it can provide quantitative suggestions."

Henrietta Moore (1995) provided a more sensitive approach in her book, A Passion for Difference, which has inspired empirical field research in many countries, such as some in Latin America (Zuckerhut et al. 2003). Analysis of the potentials and challenges is required on different levels to recognise and understand the scope of action available (Teherani-KrÃ¶nner 1989, 2008b). It is not the gap approach, but rather a positive evaluation of local capacities that could lead to a more balanced structure in the future. Discovering such scope of actions is a prerequisite for improving the quality of life and livelihoods in rural and urban areas. Without it, neither food security nor rural development can be achieved. This is an important aspect of a sustainable development process that will enable the overlap of ecological, economic, and social welfare dimensions within a community. Hence, we must seek a relational gender approach (see Chap. 9 in this publication) rather than a dual construction."
164,362,0.988,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","To close this chapter we want to re-emphasize the complexity and plurality of the types and magnitudes of the causal relationships between poverty and environmental degradation. The wide array of relationships between LD and poverty were confirmed by literature review, where it is difficult to find an empirical based consensus on the nature of the links between the two. The breadth of the nature of povertyâLD linkages can be explained by several factors. First, there are several feedback and synergistic effects between the different causal factors of LD, therefore the true impact of poverty on LD cannot be captured in a bivariate analysis. Second, there are feedback effects between poverty and LD that make it harder to determine the direction of the causality. Finally, the institutional framework within which land users operate and make their land management decisions can supersede the impacts of poverty on LD. This was clearly exemplified by case studies in Niger and India. All of these empirical findings were shown to be independent of the cost effectiveness of SLM practices (Nkonya et al. 2011a), and are echoed in the theoretical literature on poverty and growth and their links to environmental degradation. The existence of an EKC has been debated at length. Bulte and van Soest (2001) showed that under imperfect labor markets, the combined income and substitution effects of rising resource prices can lead to an allocation of farm labor that is either consistent with the EKC hypothesis or not, depending on the choice of environmental degradation indicator. Poverty as well as LD can be accounted for using a wide variety of indicators, the choice of which will influence the understanding gained about any particular linkage, which can differ vastly across regions and countries. A global and inclusive definition of poverty is inevitably linked to a general concept of well-being and welfare. There are currently no established indicators at the global-level that fully capture the variability in human well-being. Well-being is partially attributable to the state of the environment. This can be captured to some extent by global indicators such as genuine savings (Aglietta 2010), which adjusts the savings rate for the depletion of natural resources in particular. However, as noted in Nkonya et al. (2008), LD is a form of âsquanderingâ that is not addressed by any current frameworks and indicators of well-being, not even in measures of genuine savings. This needs to change, because productive land is a global public good that is increasingly under pressure to deliver the required ecosystem benefits to support a growing world population, sparking increasing competition over its ownership (Deininger and Byerlee 2011).

376,453,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The richly interconnected view of resource systems in an SES stands in opposition to strategies that attempt to reduce system complexity by focusing on only a small number of target resources, species, or indicators as is typical of maximum sustained yield and steady-state natural resource management (Holling and Meffe 1996). History has shown that these types of management strategies are often ecologically unsustainable because of unrecognized slow system change, sudden unpredicted disturbance, and/or unknown interconnections. On the social dimension, these approaches often fail as a result of an inability to understand what people want from natural resources, a lack of capacity to govern human resource use, and the broad perception of an accompanying policy or distribution of benefits as unjust. Given the evolving nature of complex adaptive systems and their lack of predictability, much of the work on SESs in rangelands and elsewhere focuses on developing responsive policy and governance that supports system resilience (e.g., Walker et al. 2004; Armitage et al. 2009) rather than attempting to provide specific and relatively inflexible resource management prescriptions. Social groups do not maintain consistent or uniform relationships with their surrounding environment, but change in either social or ecological patterns cannot necessarily be attributed to a corresponding driver in the other system (Vayda and McCay 1975). Resource management and governance policies must therefore monitor and be responsive to ecological and social processes that may or may not create new drivers of change within the SES. It is the inclusion of both ecological and social variables within the frame of analysis that makes the SES framework useful for management. Changes in the price of beef or altered land tenure policies, for example, have to be considered alongside fluctuations in climate and vegetation composition when planning management actions or policies for a rangeland SES. Problems that cross scales or levels within SESs can prove challenging for two reasons: perception and communication. First, the occurrence of a phenomenon at one level must be perceived as having been caused by a driver at another level. Second, that observation has to be communicatedâpersuasivelyâto the person or organization capable of solving the problem, and that person or entity has to decide to address the problem. Solutions involving changes in policy need to be effectively communicated to the affected population, ideally with buy-in from the affected populations. The perception problem can be met with a combination of thorough cross-scale monitoring and diverse information networks. Communication problems require adaptations to governance structures and strategies that facilitate information sharing and learning across sectors and hierarchical levels. An increasing number of groups, such as the Sustainable Rangelands Roundtable (http://www. sustainablerangelands.org/) and the California Rangeland Conservation Coalition (http://carangeland.org/) in the USA, are devoted to encouraging this type of communication about rangelands and range management. Inclusion of various stakeholders in goal-setting, planning, monitoring, research, data interpretation, and decision making is one way that managers can create"

We urge the research community to adopt a situational approach to the study of fear of crime. We would encourage the use of such an approach both to explore the technological possibilities of employing an ESM methodology, and to provide relevant theoretical explanations when fear of crime is examined. Improved understanding provides a basis for better solutions, which may in turn have practical implications for the development of safer urban communities."
209,24,0.988,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"How might we move forward to develop more useful and integrative theories of public engagement that more effectively advance a science of public engagement? In our prior work (PytlikZillig & Tomkins, 2011), we have suggested that it would be useful to (1) analyze public engagements by inventorying their commonly varied features and hoped for outcomes; (2) broadly consider a variety of existing theories from a wide number of fields ranging from psychology to political science, to communication, and more; (3) narrow our focus and use experimental methods to carefully and systematically vary a subset of engagement features that (a) are purported as most important to achieving public engagement outcomes and (b) have strong connections to other existing theories; and (4), across multiple studies, systematically measure the impacts of those experimentally varied features on both the outcomes and potential explanatory mediators while also exploring potential moderators of the effects. This is the approach we therefore applied in the present work."

The main SoS concepts are modelled within the âSoS Evolutionâ package of our SoS proï¬le. Figure 4 shows the âevolutionâ Stereotype as a Block of a BDD, aiming at describing an SoS change. In our conceptual model we envision two different types of evolution: â¢ âmanaged_evolutionâ - Process of modifying the SoS to keep it relevant in face of an ever-changing environment. Examples of environmental changes include new available technology, new business cases/strategies, new business processes, changing user needs, new legal requirements, compliance rules and safety regulations, changing political issues, new standards, etc. â¢ âunmanaged_evolutionâ - Ongoing modiï¬cation of the SoS that occurs as a result of ongoing changes in (some of) its CSs. Examples of such internal changes include changing circumstances, ongoing optimization, etc. An SoS evolution has a âgoalâ, improves the âbusiness valueâ by means of the exploit of âsystem_resourceâ and can be affected by the environment. Evolution is achieved by modifying CSs and consequently the whole SoS."
376,645,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The conceptual underpinnings for AM are simple; there will always be inherent uncertainty and unpredictability in the dynamics and behavior of complex ecological systems, yet management decisions must still be made. The strength of AM is in the recognition and confrontation of such uncertainty. Rather than ignore uncertainty, or use it to preclude management actions, AM can foster resilience and flexibility to cope with an uncertain future, and develop management approaches that acknowledge inevitable changes and surprises. Since its initial introduction, AM has been hailed as a solution to endless trial-and-error approaches to complex management challenges. However, it does not produce easy answers, and it is appropriate in only a subset of management problems. Clearly AM has great potential when applied appropriately. A prime example in rangeland management is PBAs, now established throughout the Great Plains. Rangelands in general are appropriate for application of AM because of the ability to model system dynamics (state-and-transition models), identifiable management units across large areas, clear management objectives (e.g., maintain native grasses), and reducible uncertainties related to management impacts. Adaptive management may be the best way forward for improving how we approach rangeland management, but will require more than most current applications of the strategy. In particular, in order to account for coupled human and natural systems, AM will require (at a minimum) legal reform (Craig and Ruhl 2014), integration with adaptive governance (Folke et al. 2005), and accounting for scale and cross-scale interactions (Garmestani et al. 2013). If these steps are taken, perhaps then AM will fulfill its promise for rangeland management. Acknowledgements This research was supported in part by an NSF IGERT grant, DGE-0903469, and the August T.

277,85,0.988,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"are the EUâs main sources of legitimacy, with both sources stressing a particular kind of rationality and relying on particular types of expertise. Indeed, in a regulatory system like the EU it is to a large extent knowledge rather than budget that is the critical resource in policymaking (Majone 1996, quoted in Radaelli 1999: 759). While (scientific) knowledge that can provide such technocratic legitimacy need not be quantifiable, quantitative knowledge arguably has a much greater persuasive power than narrative knowledge, as numbers convey a sense of authority and objectivity that more qualitative forms of knowledge fail to convey (Espeland and Stevens 2009: 416â422). There is also a peculiar aesthetics around numbers and their capacity to condense complex social phenomena into individual, easily comprehensible indicators. The surge of knowledge production on migration in and by the European Union has to be understood in this context (see also Boswell 2009). It is this story that will be the focus of this chapter. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: in the next part we will provide a brief history of data collection on international migration in Europe. A major focus in this part will be on the evolution of the Statistics Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 862/2007), which is arguably one of the cornerstones of migration statistics policy in the EU. In the part that follows we will discuss the use of migration-related data in Europe for international comparative research with a focus on the categories used in statistics to identify migrant populations and the usefulness of social indicators for migration policymaking. In the final part of this chapter we will see that, though social indicators may be very useful for comparative research, certain limitations exist when it comes to comparing concrete policies and their effectiveness. This is not only because certain differences in definitions and data collection tend to persist, but also because the major political responsibilities for migrant integration, the main theme of this book, still rest with the member states, and not with the EU. Notwithstanding considerable efforts by the EU to achieve more coordination in the field of immigrant integration member states continue to differ significantly in their approaches to this issue."
341,129,0.988,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"It is clear that the level of state intervention that the developmental state paradigm requires contradicts neoliberal theory. However, discourses about the developmental state would not have been topical still today had it not been for the failure of neoliberal policies to bring about sustained development, particularly in Africa. Sindzingre (2004) points out that the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 has been interpreted by mainstream analyses as a confirmation of the irrelevance of the developmental state concept as well as the fragility and limited developmental character of its ingredients. We argue that this concept remains seminal and important for understanding the determinants of the economic failures of other developing countries, as well as the possible exportability of its ingredients to other historical and economic contexts, such as sub-Saharan Africa. The economic stagnation of subSaharan Africa and the failure to develop effective water governance systems may indeed be interpreted as a consequence of common characteristics and constraints of its states, in terms of history, economy, global integration and political economy rather than failure of the developmental state model."

284,246,0.988,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"the development of scientiï¬c interdisciplinary analysis. More and better participation, and a substantial improvement in training, are a priority for all governments. This aspect was particularly stressed at Rio+20. Environmental governance of the land, patrimonial accounts, environmental assessment of investment projects, evaluation of environmental impacts, strategic environmental assessments and so forth are emerging as important alternatives. According to ECLAC (2010:140), âTerritorial heterogeneity in Latin America calls for selective and targeted strategies. Local development, understood as a bottom-up process, mobilizes endogenous potential to build territories that are better able to create and drive their own capacities.â The objectives of the National Environmental Governance Project in each country must reverse the process of poverty generation and, in turn, give more momentum to tasks already under way to directly improve the situation. Habitat improvement and policies to combat environmental degradation are systematically integrated with the possibility for a better life. In addition, the use of unusual environmental policies in Latin American countries â such as tax policies, credit, tariff or integration â all signify that there is a long way to go. While these ideas are technologically plausible, and are also key for the sustainability of the planet, it is worth reiterating critical doubts that arise from both historical experience and theory. They question the ability of the current model of accumulation and the political regime of domination to advance socioeconomic and environmental sustainable development, without signiï¬cant changes. The historical scenario seems to prolong an insurmountable contradiction between the interests to produce, distribute and consume, and the need to ensure social and environmental human life. Therefore, a greater organization and activity of environmental social movements emerges as a possible alternative. An organizational form for sustainable development within environmental governance involves a holistic view, a direct relationship between research and action. It is a combination of the short, medium and long term, and of a generally high level of participation among civil society and social movements. It proposes implementing the necessary changes and taking actions that can lead to more successful forms of environmental governance and a better quality of life. Economic understanding must be open to all necessary actors, which requires reformulating the conditions for recovery and reproduction of capital with ecological, economic, social, technological and political implications. Only then do the desired reduction of poverty and reconciliation with nature truly begin."
151,8,0.988,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"International concern in scientific, industrial, and governmental communities over traces of xenobiotics in foods and in both abiotic and biotic environments has justified the present triumvirate of specialized publications in this field: comprehensive reviews, rapidly published research papers and progress reports, and archival documentations. These three international publications are integrated and scheduled to provide the coherency essential for nonduplicative and current progress in a field as dynamic and complex as environmental contamination and toxicology. This series is reserved exclusively for the diversified literature on âtoxicâ chemicals in our food, our feeds, our homes, recreational and working surroundings, our domestic animals, our wildlife, and ourselves. Tremendous efforts worldwide have been mobilized to evaluate the nature, presence, magnitude, fate, and toxicology of the chemicals loosed upon the Earth. Among the sequelae of this broad new emphasis is an undeniable need for an articulated set of authoritative publications, where one can find the latest important world literature produced by these emerging areas of science together with documentation of pertinent ancillary legislation. Research directors and legislative or administrative advisers do not have the time to scan the escalating number of technical publications that may contain articles important to current responsibility. Rather, these individuals need the background provided by detailed reviews and the assurance that the latest information is made available to them, all with minimal literature searching. Similarly, the scientist assigned or attracted to a new problem is required to glean all literature pertinent to the task, to publish new developments or important new experimental details quickly, to inform others of findings that might alter their own efforts, and eventually to publish all his/her supporting data and conclusions for archival purposes. In the fields of environmental contamination and toxicology, the sum of these concerns and responsibilities is decisively addressed by the uniform, encompassing, and timely publication format of the Springer triumvirate: Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology [Vol. 1 through 97 (1962â1986) as Residue Reviews] for detailed review articles concerned with"

At design time the identiï¬cation of causal loop in the lower levels of the hierarchy, enabled by the support for simulation through model execution, is a mandatory step to identify possible emergent behaviors at the higher levels, that may lead, also in future evolution of the system of systems, to a violation of system requirements. A correct representation of the environment is necessary. Global time Awareness and monitoring are fundamental to early detect and to contain the effect of detrimental emergence phenomena at run time. The main beneï¬ts of the AMADEOS approach can be easily seen in the results from the simulations: The AMADEOS architectural framework and associated tools allow an SoS architecture to be comprehensively designed and a simulation extracted that can be tested. This allows system architects to quickly test hypothesis regarding future systems and determine what attributes will lead to advantageous or poor results."

However, these sustainability challenges are wider than ecology.

231,756,0.988,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"This chapter presents a review of what is known about the impacts of climate change on the biota (plankton, benthos, ï¬sh, seabirds and marine mammals) of the North Sea. Examples show how the changing North Sea environment is affecting biological processes and organisation at all scales, including the physiology, reproduction, growth, survival, behaviour and transport of individuals; the distribution, dynamics and evolution of populations; and the trophic structure and coupling of ecosystems. These complex responses can be detected because there are detailed long-term biological and environmental records for the North Sea; written records go back 500 years and archaeological records many thousands of years. The information presented here shows that the composition and productivity of the North Sea marine ecosystem is clearly affected by climate change and that this will have consequences for sustainable levels of harvesting and other ecosystem services in the future. Multi-variate ocean climate indicators that can be used to monitor and warn of changes in composition and productivity are now being developed for the North Sea."

The researches neither consider the long-term potential impact of environment, especially natural environment, or the follow-up influence on competitiveness by environment improvement after adoption of environmental protection; instead, the researches emphasize the economic effects of environment and neglect its social and cultural impacts. In fact, either discussion of competitiveness apart from environment or vice versa would be segmented discussions.

151,11,0.988,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"The ultimate role of publishing scientific research is to enhance understanding of the environment in ways that allow the public to be better informed. The term âinformed publicâ as used by Thomas Jefferson in the age of enlightenment conveyed the thought of soundness and good judgment. In the modern sense, being âwell informedâ has the narrower meaning of having access to sufficient information. Because the public still gets most of its information on science and technology from TV news and reports, the role for scientists as interpreters and brokers of scientific information to the public will grow rather than diminish. Environmentalism is the newest global political force, resulting in the emergence of multinational consortia to control pollution and the evolution of the environmental ethic.Will the new politics of the twenty-first century involve a consortium of technologists and environmentalists, or a progressive confrontation? These matters are of genuine concern to governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. For those who make the decisions about how our planet is managed, there is an ongoing need for continual surveillance and intelligent controls to avoid endangering the environment, public health, and wildlife. Ensuring safety-in-use of the many chemicals involved in our highly industrialized culture is a dynamic challenge, for the old, established materials are continually being displaced by newly developed molecules more acceptable to federal and state regulatory agencies, public health officials, and environmentalists. Reviews publishes synoptic articles designed to treat the presence, fate, and, if possible, the safety of xenobiotics in any segment of the environment. These reviews can be either general or specific, but properly lie in the domains of analytical chemistry and its methodology, biochemistry, human and animal medicine, legislation, pharmacology, physiology, toxicology, and regulation. Certain affairs in food technology concerned specifically with pesticide and other food-additive problems may also be appropriate. Because manuscripts are published in the order in which they are received in final form, it may seem that some important aspects have been neglected at times. However, these apparent omissions are recognized, and pertinent manuscripts are likely in preparation or planned. The field is so very large and the interests in it are so varied that the editor and the editorial board earnestly solicit authors and suggestions of underrepresented topics to make this international book series yet more useful and worthwhile. Justification for the preparation of any review for this book series is that it deals with some aspect of the many real problems arising from the presence of foreign chemicals in our surroundings. Thus, manuscripts may encompass case studies from any country. Food additives, including pesticides, or their metabolites that may persist into human food and animal feeds are within this scope. Additionally, chemical contamination in any manner of air, water, soil, or plant or animal life is within these objectives and their purview."

Large-scale surveying as well as public engagement are central to Hubbubâs work in this domain. (4) Focusing on cartographies of rest, to ask both how particular spaces get imagined as noisily restless, and what kinds of technologies we can bring to bear on how those spaces are actually experienced. Researchers are using sociological and anthropological methods to investigate these questions, as well as experimenting with self-tracking devices that will draw together physiological, phenomenological, and geographical data. One of the foremost intellectual preoccupations of Hubbub is an interdisciplinary attention to the brain and mind at rest. This attention has roots in the previous collaborative work of Daniel Margulies, Jonathan Smallwood, and FC (Callard et al. 2013; Callard and Margulies 2011, 2014; Callard, Smallwood, and Margulies 2012), which has spiralled in and out of cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and the history of science â and which is being extended, empirically and conceptually, in Hubbub. Meanwhile, preoccupations and priorities from other disciplines and disciplinary debates, as well as from other modes of inquiry, have gradually come into view. This latter category, for instance, includes a collaboration involving Charles Fernyhough (CF), Simone KÃ¼hn (SK), Russ Hurlburt and others, which we discussed in Chapter 2 (in the section on âCo-organizingâ). This research, which brings together phenomenologically rich data from Descriptive Experience Sampling, and cognitive neuroscientific data on research participantsâ brain states, so as to elicit, capture, and visualize âinner experienceâ (KÃ¼hn et al. 2014), has brought to visibility compelling insights and empirical findings that offer new ways of understanding the brain and mind âat restâ. Among these insights is an investigation of the limitations of common ways of investigating âspontaneous thoughtâ and âinner experienceâ (e.g. those that rely on respondent questionnaires), as well as the need to attend more carefully to phenomenological experiences of mental and bodily ârestâ (or lack of rest) while in the scanner (KÃ¼hn et al. 2014). CF, meanwhile, directs another large interdisciplinary project (Hearing the Voice). There are not only substantive intersections between the two networks of collaborators, but Hubbub, as it took form on paper as a grant proposal, was â happily â able to draw on some of the interdisciplinary methods and structures that were already being tried out within Hearing the Voice."

It starts with two papers dealing with different possibilities of applications and extensions of the PD framework in community assessments, area comparisons and long-term monitoring of biodiversity changes. In chapter âUsing Phylogenetic Dissimilarities Among Sites for Biodiversity Assessments and Conservationâ, Dan Faith details one possible extension of the PD family of measures, the Environmental Dissimilarity (ED) methods. While PD assumes that shared ancestry accounts for shared features among taxa, ED attempts to account for shared features through shared habitat/environment among taxa, thus including those shared features not explained by shared ancestry. With some graphical examples Dan shows how ED works. Further, he synthesizes a set of ED-based measures. These include ED complementarity measures designed with the similar aim of calculating and predicting features gains and losses as we gain or lose areas in conservation planning. He concludes by indicating that ED methods appear to offer a robust framework for global assessments and for long-term monitoring of biodiversity change.

With spatiality being understood as describing actorsâ corporeality, this new perspective raises the question about the role that this spatiality and the ways of coping with it play in co-determining the shaping of sociocultural realities. In this context the ways in which people act over distance are profoundly important. Distance is understood in both a social and the physical sense. According to TÃ¶nnies (1887/2001), it is regarded as a core element of the difference between community and society. Consequently, the concept of societyâspace relationships includes consideration of the ways to cope with oneâs spatiality and, hence, with spatial distanciation as constituent of society."
346,93,0.988,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","2013a). The case of post-genocide Rwanda further demonstrates that peace and stability are not sufficient elements for a favourable context for conciliatory textbook work. A democratic political environment, where textbook work can rely on open and unrestricted public and scholarly debate, is equally crucial for new educational materials not to convey a highly problematic âhegemonic historyâ. furthermore, experiences around the world, for instance in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, point to the constraints exercised on conciliatory textbook work by the political contingency of regime change, notably the coming to power of conservative parties. In the case of Northern Cyprus, political change marked a return to ethno-nationalist history textbooks after a short-lived introduction of more conciliatory materials that had been promoting a sense of common identity (Evripidou 2010). Another significant factor affecting these initiatives relates to the nature of broader educational policies and structures in which they are embedded, specifically the extent to which these policies are conducive to intergroup integration or segregation. In Bosnia, Cyprus, Israel/ Palestine and Lebanon, for instance, where formal history curriculum and textbook revision has been (tentatively) undertaken in the wake of peace processes, such educational policies and structures appear to have severely undermined efforts to harmonise history teaching and reconcile conflicting narratives through textbooks. Here, sectarianism continues to be pervasive within the context of highly segregated education systems, pointing to the obstinacy of competing group narratives in such contexts (Nasser and Nasser 2008; Torsti 2009; Van Ommering 2015; Zembylas 2013). If it is true that the existence of supportive institutional structures, and particularly of institutional rapprochement, is likely to provide a favourable context for conciliatory textbook revision, formal TJ processes may lend unique opportunities for this purpose. As highlighted by emerging research advocating for crafting stronger connections between the fields of education and TJ (Cole 2007; RamÃ­rez-Barat and Duthie 2015), there is considerable value in seeing post-conflict textbook revision anchored in a TJ framework, particularly so within the context of the work of official truth (and reconciliation) commissions (TRCs). As part of their mandate, truth commissions are expected to produce a public record of historical injustice and abuse, including their causes, scope, dynamics and consequences, through investigation that typically relies on statement-taking from victims, perpetrators and witnesses (Hayner 2002)."

274,47,0.988,Firm innovation and Productivity in Latin America and The Caribbean : The Engine of Economic Development,"In the second part of the chapter, the authors empirically examine the effects of ICT adoption on innovation performance and labor productivity. The analysis shows that the impact of ICTs on innovation may be conditioned by several characteristics internal to the firm as well as external, such as the linkages with strong external organizations and network externalities. The authors show that using broadband is positively and significantly correlated with the probability of product and process innovation in firms. However, when they single out the different possible uses that a firm can make of broadband, the results begin to differ. First, using the internet to perform research is positively and significantly related to innovation, but no other uses are related to innovation. Second, the combined use of broadband for different activities matters and has a significant impact on innovation on top of the effects of using the internet for research. This is to say that simple access to ICTs is not enough to foster firm innovation. Technology needs to be used adequately to exploit its full potential. In addition, other variables are associated with a higher probability of innovation, such as firm size, human capital, and openness to export markets. This latter result confirms the evidence obtained in different contexts by Crespi et al. (Chap. 2) and Montalbano et al. (Chap. 9). Using a CobbâDouglas production function, the authors show that using broadband also has a positive effect on labor productivity, and that this result is robust when controlling for endogeneity. When testing for the effect of the different kinds of internet uses, research loses its significance, perhaps due to the time lags between investments in broadband and the related research and the ensuing productivity effects. However, the simultaneous use of the internet for various activities and overall broadband adoption retain their positive influence on productivity. The lesson to be derived from this chapter is that ICT adoption and diffusion should receive special attention within the broader perspective of innovation and innovation policy."

In the next chapter, Chap. 8, Thomas Wiedmann considers the environmental and social impacts of the increase in global trade experienced during recent decades. He discusses how, for example, todayâs longer and increasingly complex global supply chains make it more difficult to connect the environmental impacts of production to the final consumer of the goods and services. In addition to discussing developments in analytical tools and data requirements, Wiedmann also discusses the broadening of indicators. He reviews how studies now extend beyond the traditional analysis of carbon emissions, to include other environmental indicators such as land and water use and, importantly, social indicators such as child labour, which extend the analysis into the âSocial equityâ lobe of Fig. 1. The chapter by Angela Druckman and Tim Jackson (9) follows neatly from Thomas Wiedmannâs Chap. (8), as it takes the concept of âfootprintingâ, which Wiedmann applies to trade, and applies it to household consumption. Both approaches are based on consumption perspective accounting, which uses whole systems, life cycle thinking to attribute all impacts along supply chains to final consumers. Druckman and Jackson review the determinants of the carbon footprints of Western households, the composition of average household footprints, and also discuss the rebound effect. They conclude that while it is vital to address the systems of provision of food, energy, housing and transportation, structural income growth presents a key challenge and that we should seek solutions that provide low carbon lifestyles with high levels of well-being. Once again, âdevelopmentâ must not to be equated with economic growth. In Chap. 10 Marlyne Sahakian picks up on the importance of the structure of the economy and the well-being it provides by introducing the concept of the social and solidarity economy, fully embracing the âSocial equityâ lobe in Fig. 1. As noted above, a high quality of life is the objective, not just economic activity as measured by GDP. The concept is people centric: it aims to place service to communities ahead of profit and embraces the notion of reciprocity. Examples of activities of the social and solidarity economy include social entrepreneurship, crowd funding, fair trade, community currencies and some forms of peer-to-peer sharing. Many of these activities are niche: they are often at the grassroots level operating at the margins of the dominant capitalist economy. Hence, to make progress, the issue of scale is, she says, the greatest challenge. Importantly for this book, Sahakian analyses the linkages between the social and solidarity economy and industrial ecology and finds many synergies. She also, however, notes a tension that is a challenge for the future, whereby industrial ecology generally prioritises the environment, whereas the social and solidarity economy prioritises people. In the terms of Fig. 1, a genuine balance must be found between the âEnvironmental compatibilityâ and âSocial equityâ lobes. In Chap. 11, Megha Shenoy focuses attention on developing countries â the âglobal Southâ â and so returns to the original focus of sustainable development. The holistic approach of industrial ecology can provide a valuable platform on which to develop strategies and policies for sustainable development. In turn, the development of industrial ecology thinking should be informed by experience in the"

They also helped to ensure that research results were acceptable and directly beneficial to the target community. A key project output was the development of a participatory tool, âMpangâameâ, a simulation game that helps stakeholders identify and reflect on appropriate actions for better NRM practices. At the local level, the game was disseminated to schools, vocational institutions, local government leaders and policymakers within various fora. At regional and international levels, the game was disseminated at meetings for AFROMAISON partners and NRM stakeholders in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mali, South Africa, Tunisia, as well as to graduate students in France, on special request from university administrators. Other dissemination channels included articles published in the International Journal of Innovation Sciences, book chapters, brochures, leaflets and the project website. According to Arseni Semana, principal investigator of AFROMAISON in Uganda, the main challenges that the project encountered were related to the attitudes of the communities (CAAST-Net Plus 2014, p. 32). There was slow adoption of integrated NRM practices mainly because of the commercial culture that has emerged within the beneficiary communities. NGOs facilitate communitiesâ participation in NRM planning and implementation. As a result, it is almost impossible to engage the communities without attaching a monetary incentive. Private sector involvement is still minimal and participating private sector players are mainly informal and micro. Nonetheless, the project held a consultative meeting between the ministries of agriculture, animal industry and fisheries, and water and environment to enhance policy level integration of NRM using tools from the research. This constitutes a more valuable, critically reflective account of the relationship between the projectâs outputs and outcomes, and one which integrates key contextual factors to explain the barriers and constraints to achieving the intended impacts. Overall, we a found that statements of âintended impactâ are often more akin to aspirations expressed by project designers and managers. In most cases, these aspirations do little more than offer rhetorical support to wider climate and development targets, such as the MDGs. As such, there is generally no explicit explanation of how these impacts canâeven theoreticallyâbe achieved. Instead, there is a significant level of assumed attribution; that is, broad statements about how the research projectâs focus relates to the wider issues and how it contributes knowledge necessary to tackle these challenges vis-Ã -vis the stated aims and objectives."

In this paper we therefore try to shade a light on collaborative process where social scientist and engineers come to work together (more than side to side) in order to seek determinants of successful collaborations. The paper focuses on an historical case: the (so called) Swiss Cheese Model of accidents. Since the early 1990, the Swiss Cheese Model (SCM) of the psychologist James Reason has established itself as a reference model in the etiology, investigation or prevention of industrial accidents. Its success in many ï¬elds (transport, energy, medical) has made it the vector of a new paradigm of Safety Science: the organizational accident. A comprehensive literature review of Reasonâs work leads us to consider the SCM as the result of a complex (and poorly documented) collaboration process between the ï¬elds of research and industry; human sciences and engineering sciences. In a dualistic premise where research and industry would be two entities interacting but still separable, this collaboration would be understood as the appropriation of research work by the industrial world. However, the complexity of the genesis of the SCM forces an overcoming of this dualism to bring out a process of âco-productionâ of knowledge. As part of this research, the two main âfathersâ of the SCM: James Reason (psychologist and theorist of human error) and John Wreathall (nuclear engineer) where interviewed by the author. These meetings shed a new light on a proliï¬c era for the Safety Sciences ï¬eld. We therefore hope to keep from a retrospective bias that tends to smooth and simplify facts. This chapter deals with the induced effects of the collaboration between a psychologist and an engineer in terms of models production. In the ï¬rst section, we briefly present the two âfathersâ of the SCM and the social and historical context in which their collaboration took place. In the second section, we focus on the effects of this collaboration over their intellectual and scientiï¬c productions. Note that prior knowledge of the SCM, its theoretical foundations and its main uses is requested (see, for example LarouzÃ©e et al. [2])."

Combining qualitative and quantitative data makes it possible to generate complementary sets of data that will lead to new explanations of statistical results and more accurate theoretical explanations (Mason 2016; Bohnsack 2008). The use of the life course approach framework combined with mixed methods appears fruitful in revealing the variety of life trajectories that unfold among descendants of immigrants and in identifying the mechanisms shaping their trajectories as well as the crucial moments that might become turning points in their lives. Applied in cross-national comparisons, mixing methods can also help to unveil the links between the macro and micro levels, going further in sociological explanation.

This new approach suggested that learning is more than the acquisition of knowledge, and includes peripheral participation and active involvement in the practice (Lave and Wenger 1991). However, this approach only considered the transfer of existing knowledge and did not consider CoPs as a platform for innovation, problem solving or as a potential driver of change (Ãsterlund and Carlile 2003). In the same year as Lave and Wenger proposed their new approach, Brown and Duguid (1991) also used the phrase âcommunity of practiceâ. This work was based on data from Julian Orrâs earlier studies of Xerox photocopier repairmen and aimed to show how informal groups generate solutions to work-related problems (Brown and Duguid 1991) although, Orr did not use the phrase âcommunity of practiceâ, preferring to use the term âoccupational communityâ (Cox 2007). The study observed how knowledge was better created and transferred through the sharing of experiences and collective problem solving activities, compared to the more traditional learning processes of expert instruction and manuals. Brown and Duguid suggested that knowledge and learning, were embedded in social practices and extended the concept of CoPs to include them as a tool for resolving work-based problems (Brown and Duguid 1991), as opposed to Lave and Wengerâs concept that focused only on the reproduction of existing knowledge (Cox 2004). Although the term âcommunity of practiceâ was used by both Lave and Wenger (1991) and Brown and Duguid (1991), a rigorous formal deï¬nition was not offered. This was mainly due to the different interests and viewpoints of the studies and those involved (Cox 2005). However, Wenger (1998) ï¬nally deï¬nes CoPs as, âa group that coheres through sustained mutual engagementâ on an âindigenousâ (or appropriated) enterprise, and creating a common repertoireâ. Wenger expanded on the initial concept of CoPs (Lave and Wenger 1991), from a theory of learning to a knowledge management strategy and discards the concept of legitimate peripheral participation in favour of social identity and trajectories of participation (Wenger 1998). The study focused on the formation and management of CoPs across organisational boundaries to enhance performance, and states that it is through the common understandings of an activity involving large amounts of interaction and problem solving, that relationships are built and CoPs are established (Wenger 1998). Over time, the interpretation of a CoP moved from a descriptive concept (Lave and Wenger 1991) to a more prescriptive application provided by Wenger et al. (2002), who redeï¬ned CoPs as, âgroups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basisâ. Wenger provided a guide for the formation and management of CoPs to enhance performance and drew together ideas put forward in previous works while focussing on the value of the CoP as a knowledge management tool for innovation and problem solving, where the purpose is to learn and share knowledge and not speciï¬cally with accomplishing a common task (Cox 2005)."

I note the rationale for this bookâspecifically that it allows me space to explain the theoretical background of scaffolding and to explore the theoretical implications of a meta-analysis of computer-based scaffolding in STEM education that I completed with colleagues. I also posit instructional scaffolding as an intervention that extends studentsâ capabilities as they engage with the central problem in problem-centered instructional approaches. I note the difference between one-toone, peer, and computer-based scaffolding, and articulate that in this book I synthesize research on computer-based scaffolding in STEM education. Finally, I outline the structure of the book. Keywords Computer-based scaffolding Â· Meta-analysis Â· Problem-centered instruction Â· Scaffolding Â· STEM education"

Hence HRI research needs to span a number of domains well beyond engineering, including psychology, cognitive science, and communications, among others. Natural language. The authors of the DSB report hold that âNatural language is the most normal and intuitive way for humans to instruct autonomous systems; it allows them to provide diverse, high-level goals and strategies rather than detailed teleoperationâ (DSB 2012, p. 49). Hence, further development of the ability of autonomous weapons systems to respond to commands in a natural language is necessary. Multi-Agent Coordination refers to the distribution of tasks among multiple robots, with either centrally planned or directly negotiated synchronization. This sort of collaboration goes beyond mere cooperation because âit assumes that the agents have a cognitive understanding of each otherâs capabilities, can monitor progress towards the goal, and engage in more human-like teamworkâ (DSB 2012, p. 50)."
134,173,0.988,Curriculum Reform in The European Schools : Towards a 21St Century Vision,"We conclude this book by examining the values of the European Schools System and how these are and can be translated into pedagogic practices. We have already suggested that the system has a framework of values: the eight competences. The rationale, therefore, for the curriculum is and should be that it conforms to these eight competences, leading to the European Baccalaureate: communication in the mother tongue; communication in foreign languages; mathematical competence and basic competences in science and technology; digital competence; learning to learn; social and civic competences; a sense of initiative and entrepreneurship; and cultural awareness and expression. What these competences fundamentally embrace is a set of European, anti-nationalistic and cosmopolitan values, and the sense of supporting the views of marginalized students, teachers and parents in order to develop an appropriate pedagogy to allow an inclusive sense of citizenship (Banks 1997, 1998, 2004). What has happened all too frequently in the history of the European Schools System is the development of a set of inclusive values that can genuinely address the problems of modern education systems, and at the same time, a set of pedagogical values and strategies that are not fit for this important purpose."
306,5,0.988,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","Another area of research has been the understanding of three-dimensional ï¬gures by children. It has been associated with criticism of the fact that dealing with solids takes place on higher levels of learning geometry. This goes against the natural way of discovering the world by children, which is made up of three-dimensional objects. Much of the space in this survey has been dedicated to research related to regularities in geometry. This seems reasonable, as so far patterning in geometry has been treated superï¬cially, mainly to determine whether a child can note suggested regularity. Researchers are of the opinion that the functioning of children in a world of regularity is important for not only their general mathematical development but also their geometrical. In the research on childrenâs understanding of regularity, one can distinguish a number of issuesâfrom the very fact of their perception of regularity by creating arrangements of surfaces to geometrical relations hidden in mosaics. Following Steen (1990), mathematics is actually seen as a âsearch for patternsâ: âIt is natural to try to ï¬nd the most effective ways to visualize these patterns and to learn to use visualization creatively as a tool for understandingâ (p. 3)."

It allowed researchers to become aware of aspects of the beneficiariesâ lifestyle that the technology and training activities they offered were likely to change. This is often lacking in traditional adaptation M&E, which is usually based on biophysical performance indicators. Thus, pre-identifying domains of behavioral change has added value to the quantitative biophysical performance indicators. The results clearly showed that if the CCAFS program resulted in successful adaptation of farming systems and production technologies to changing climatic conditions, farmers would put in place changes in domains including partnership, knowledge, practices, organization, and food security. This was consistent with expectations as adaptation is a process, and the development of adapted farming systems and production technologies requires communitiesâ members to continuously improve knowledge, work in partnership and an organized manner, adopt new practices and (thus) enhance their food security."

Such approaches, they suggest, would help to directly meet the needs of institutional decision makers and policy makers. As well as offering new ways of eliciting student feedback, new technologies have the potential to have an even more fundamental effect on teaching and learning interactions in higher education. In their chapter, Charlier, Cosnefroy, JÃ©zÃ©gou and Lameul examine the factors that shape the quality of learning in digital learning environments, and the further research that is needed in order to further develop our understanding of the ways in which students engage with these environments. They argue that in order to understand the quality of learning environments, we need to examine the individual characteristics of the students who are learning within them, how these relate to the characteristics of the digital learning environment, the ways in which the students and the digital environments interact with each other, and the learning outcomes that students achieve through their engagement with the environment. The assessment of learning outcomes is the focus of the chapter by Coates. He argues that, despite the importance of assessment outcomes in providing essential information about what people have gained through their engagement with higher education, assessment practices have remained largely unchanged for a very long time. As such, Coates argues that assessment is the ï¬nal frontier in higher education and examines the barriers to the transformation of assessment practices. These include the lack of training of academic staff in assessment and the lack of a professional assessment community. In order to transform assessment, Coates argues that there is a need to embrace new technologies and for changes to institutional management. He also argues that it is likely to require external intervention, either through policy instruments or the involvement of commercial enterprises in assessment practices. These are clearly radical and controversial proposals, which would fundamentally alter assessmentâs relationship with teaching and learning processes in higher education. Where one stands on these issues will be informed by oneâs position on the purposes of higher education, and the relative importance of the development of student understanding versus the certiï¬cation of this understanding that we discussed earlier. Assessment of student learning is certainly an area where no easy solution exists and further research and policy discussions into the matter are needed. An important purpose of higher education is the inclusion of non-traditional students in a university education. In their chapter, StÄnescu, Iorga, GonzÃ¡lez Monteagudo and Freda examine an approach to involving non-traditional students in higher education. They carefully deï¬ne non-traditional students and argue that an approach focusing on the Narrative Mediation Path (NMP) can support these students in making their transition to higher education. They present an evaluative study of the NMP that, they argue, suggests that it supports students in developing their reflexive competence during a formative experience which enables them to better adjust to their university context. They argue that the changes in the meanings that students attached to their university life involved a closer sense of social connectedness and a reduced sense of alienation, isolation and vulnerability in the face of the academic challenges."

In addition to NQFs, other regional approaches and frameworks are being put in place, such as the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and other collective initiatives, including the Transnational Qualifications Framework, which operates across Commonwealth of Learning Small States (Commonwealth of Learning 2010). Since the shift in many countries towards qualifications based on learning outcomes and competences has important implications for RVA it might be useful to examine the subtle variations in the use of the notion of learning outcomes and the manner in which they manifest themselves at different levels (Brockmann et al. 2011a).

There are many important attributes (e.g., business, societal, legal) to investigate in CPSoSs, but this chapter focuses on behavioral attributes, i.e., on interaction relations among architectural elements of CPSoSs. The architectural elements in CPSoSs are: the Itom [27] as the unit of interaction, the CS as a computing component that interacts physically and digitally with its environment, and the environment of CSs that enables the interactions among CSs. An Itom is an information atom comprising of data and explanation in an atomic unit. The environment of a CS consists of all entities that have the capability to interact with the CS.

346,395,0.987,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL COGNITION AND HISTORY TEACHING A range of potentially relevant and established social psychological theories can be identified as relevant to history teaching in a divided society, including social categorisation and Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1986), stereotype threat (e.g. Steele 1997) and attribution theory (Heider 1958). Categorisation has been dubbed âthe cognitive foundation of all forms of prejudiceâ (Brown 2010, p. viii). Using an information processing analogy, one of the prime strategies used for the purpose of avoiding information overload is categorisation, which allows us to understand the environment rather more easily than if we had to evaluate each stimulus individually to identify it. Categorisation in terms of social cognition, then, is nothing more than the brain taking useful short cuts to understanding. Yet this universal cognitive process has huge implications for those teaching in subject areas such as history, because of its close associations with prejudice via stereotyping and with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), which has been widely applied to research in NI. Social Identity Theory research over the last three decades has produced evidence of potential interest to teachers of history and other disciplines where identity issues may be significant. It is now well established that individuals simultaneously hold multiple social identities, may develop new identities and can embrace superordinate identities. In NI, the possible utility of a Northern Irish superordinate identity for reducing sectarian attitudes has long been discussed (Trew 1998). Recent census data (NISRA 2011) indicate that this identification is on the increase although it must be remembered that those espousing a Northern Irish identity might still simultaneously maintain a strong affiliation to traditional British or Irish national identities. As a result of research in contested spaces, it is argued that a âhotâ rather than a banal form of national identity (Billig 1995) is actively constructed (Stevenson and Muldoon 2010) although as Skey (2009) points out these are neither fixed nor discrete, and Jones and Merriman (2009) have suggested âeveryday nationalismâ as an alternative, more dynamic term combining banal and hot elements. In such circumstances, it is clear that the same contextual information (such as historical events) may be construed by different groups (including political actors) to support"
314,71,0.987,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"is associated with different categories of adopters, some being innovators (immediate adopters of a new technology) and others being laggards (last group to adopt a new technology). The product life cycle theory, thus, regards young people as innovators and early adopters while the elderly are regarded as laggards. From the 1980s, researchers began to question the applicability of the traditional product life cycle because of its rigid assumption regarding the âSâ shape which could not match empirical data in many cases. In this view, researchers such as Lambkin and Day (1989), Bayus (1988) started to extend the traditional product life cycle through diffusion models. Foster and Rosenzweig (2010) argue that a farmer makes a decision to adopt technology if the technology is expected to stay profitable and if it is available and affordable. In this context of profit maximisation, Sunding and Zilberman (2000) and Pingali et al. (1987) further demonstrate how farm size restricts technology adoption in a profit-maximising problem. However, farmers may choose to adopt a technology in anticipation of future benefits even if it is not currently profitable (Smale et al. 1995). Many studies have, however, been done to investigate the factors explaining agricultural technology adoption rates despite having scanty literature in Zimbabwe. Plenty of literature on agricultural technology adoption is available in many countries, with developing countries recently contributing a significant share of the literature (Diagne and Demont 2007). These empirical findings reveal that adoption of agricultural technologies relies on farmersâ perceptions about the technology (Rogers 1962) and further classify drivers of technology adoption into farmersâ socio-demographic factors, institutional forces and farmersâ economic status (Doss et al. 2003). In some cases, drivers of agricultural technology adoption have been categorised as market motivations (profit and risk), bio-physical drivers and farmersâ preferences (Pattanayak et al. 2003). Technology adoption has been defined either as continuous or discrete variable in these studies (Doss et al. 2003). However, in many cases it has been considered as a discrete variable because of the complexities involved when measuring it as a continuous variable, especially in African agriculture where farmers rarely keep records of input purchases. The evidence produced by Pattanayak et al. 2003 meta-analysis indicates that over 95% of the 32 reviewed studies on agro-forestry technology"
244,736,0.987,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","There can be no doubt that the field dependence-independence construct has faded from view, but this in no way implies that the broader domain of cognitive styles has correspondingly declined. More recently, Kozhevnikov (2007) offered a review of the cognitive-style literature that envisions the future development of theoretical models incorporating neuroscience and research in other psychological fields. Thus, the style label has been attached to research on decision-making styles (e.g., Kirton 1989), learning styles (e.g., Kolb 1976), and thinking styles (e.g., Sternberg 1997). Possibly, the dominant approach at present is that of intellectual styles (Zhang and Sternberg 2006). Zhang and Sternberg view intellectual styles as a very broad concept that more or less incorporates all prior concepts characterizing stylistic variation among individuals. This view will undoubtedly be reinforced by the recent appearance of the Handbook of Intellectual Styles (Zhang et al. 2011). It is dubious, however, that so broad and diverse a field as stylistic variation among individuals would be prepared to accept such an overarching concept at the present stage in its history."

This phenomenon is usually referred to as emergence. Thus, systems thinking provides a huge potential for transdisciplinary research as it offers options to connect phenomena of different kinds. Usually, this connection implies a hierarchy in the sense that systems are constituted by elements, which are of a different kind. The connection is referred to as âstructural couplingâ. Emergent systems are structurally coupled with the entities, on which they are built. Structural coupling describes a nondeterministic relationship, in which the emergent system does not recognise the existence of the lower-order entities. For example, the human consciousness and cognitive abilities are based on neurobiological processes. However, what we think is independent from the neurobiological processes (nondeterminism) and, at the same time, our consciousness is unable to observe that the neurons of our brain are working (Fig. 4.2). For the study of wicked problems in bioeconomy, such a system understanding is relevant as it enables people to connect the material phenomena related to bio-based technologies (e.g. bioinformatics resulting in the possibility"

In this context, effective solutions based on bottom-up decisions and actions need to complement the existing top-down measures. The publications in this series embody those goals by crossing traditional divides between different academic disciplines, the academic and non-academic world, and between local practices and global effects. Each publication is structured around a set of key everyday activities. This brief considers issues around the essential activities of Working, Housing and Urbanizing, as fundamental for survival and will complement the other publications in this series.

264,550,0.987,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"Theory Traditions in German-Speaking Countries In the 70s and 80s, teacher education was established at universities, and scientiï¬c media and a scientiï¬c society in mathematics education were founded in the German-speaking countries. This raised the issue of how to develop mathematics education a scientiï¬c discipline. At about the same time, the question of how far the didactics of mathematics already had developed as a scientiï¬c discipline was intensively discussed. Referring to Kuhn and Masterman, Burscheid (1983) used a four-stage model to identify the developmental stage of the scientiï¬c discipline. Critical reactions from Steiner (1983) and Fischer (1983) required more focus on the needs of mathematics education itself. Since the development of any scientiï¬c discipline is deeply intertwined with its theoretical work, there was a need to clarify what kinds of theories were adequate for the discipline. This was done by Jahnke (1978) and Bigalke (1984), who proposed the Sneed and StegmÃ¼llerâs concept a suitable theory concept for the ï¬eld: A theory in mathematics education is a structured entity shaped by propositions, values, and norms about learning mathematics. It consists of a kernel that encompasses the unimpeachable foundations and norms of the theory and an empirical component that contains all possible expansions of the kernel and all intended applications that arise from the kernel and its expansions.

Lee now comments on an expanded role of mechanics in the area of constitutive theory which forms an adjunct to the âbasic lawsâ: It seems to me that an important part of the development of Applied Mechanics has been concerned with the formulation of constitutive relations to express force-deformation properties of materials, i.e., the basis for valid stress and deformation analysis beyond the yield (plasticity), plastics (polymer fluids and solids), rubber elasticity and even heavy gases. This supplies the basic physical information for nonlinear ï¬nite deformation continuum mechanics. Such questions play a role in current research and fall outside applying the fundamental principles of mechanics."

Whether or not these hopes and expectations come to fruition is harder to ascertain, as they depend both on the values and strategies of change agents and on the impact of context on these social innovations, which can often only be verified in retrospect. Thereby we have tried, first, to avoid working with a normative concept that is imposed on social processes from a purely academic perspective and second, to take account of the fact that innovations are processes with future directions and meanings that depend on many factors. Furthermore, we have avoided assuming an inherent link between social innovation and specific organisational forms such as âsocial enterprisesâ or an individual character or attitude represented by the âsocial entrepreneurâ (for an overview on this perspective, see the contributions in Nicholls 2006). The link between social innovations and organisational forms should be an empirical question, not a presupposition."

How can we describe the dynamics of the organization school as a communicative figuration and what are the interrelated aspects of educational governance? Although schools have a shared frame of relevance and a similar actor constellation, the process of organizing is rather different. We assume that communicative practices as well as differences in the media ensemble play an important role. This can only be answered on an empirical basis by comparing distinct school systems."
277,549,0.987,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"17.1 Introduction The aim of this book has been threefold: first, to describe the evolution of research-policy dialogues on migrant integration in Europe at different levels â the local, the national and the EU level; secondly, to find patterns of convergence and divergence in this development; and third, if we see such patterns, to explain why these appear. In our search for patterns and explanations, we come back to the conceptualisation discussed in the introductory chapter. There we formulated three basic empirical questions: (1) What forms of research-policy dialogues do we find empirically? (2) What type of knowledge is brought into these dialogues? (3) What use is made of that knowledge? We are also interested in the interrelationship between our three major concepts: research-policy dialogue structures, knowledge utilisation and knowledge production. These influence one another, and this generates questions such as: how do specific dialogue structures affect knowledge utilisation, and vice versa? Do certain forms of knowledge utilisation lead to specific dialogue structures? What are the effects of dialogue structures on knowledge production, and do certain forms of knowledge production lead to specific dialogue structures? And to what extent are"
323,56,0.987,Satellite Earth Observations and Their Impact on Society and Policy,"The three substantive sections of this book contain a series of chapters that explore methodological issues relating to the development of policy-relevant satellite observations in a number of issue areas, the organization of agencies engaged in this work in both national and international settings, and the coordination and governance of Earth-observing systems to maximize their contributions to solving a range of environmental problems. Part II on A Study on Methods for Assessing the Impact of Satellite Observations on Environmental Policy (Japan) describes the work of the Japanese Policy and Earth Observation Innovation Cycle (PEOIC) project. It includes a case study of the roles that satellite observations have played in supporting efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer. Part III turns to national and regional experiences in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In addition to the experiences of NASA, ESA, and JAXA, it includes assessments of the UK Earth Observation Policy, the French Earth Observation Strategy, the Chinese Earth Observation Programme, and a speciï¬c case on greenhouse gas observation from space. Part IV deals with international initiatives and efforts to use satellite observations in coming to terms with issues of international signiï¬cance. Speciï¬c topics include the experience and plans of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Space Forum and GEOSS. Applications considered relate to the uses of satellite observations in dealing with matters of public health, the implementation of REDD +, and other global initiatives relating to the protection of forests and wetlands. Part V on Prospects and Conclusions includes chapters that are more forward-looking regarding the roles of satellite observations in solving large-scale environmental problems. Chapter 16 focuses on future directions in institutional and organizational arrangements. It includes an analysis of whether there is a need to move toward the development of an arrangement that can be characterized as an âEarth observation regime complexâ or an Earth observation component in various"
87,113,0.987,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","âDiscourseâ has originally been used as a concept for sequential analysis of the flow of conversations. Then, the concept has become a much broader interpretation by the work of Michel Foucault (a French philosopher, 1926â1984), who defined discourse as âsystems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speakâ. Foucault traced the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimisation and power, emphasising the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault argued that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects and a practice through which power structures are reproduced. Thus, power and knowledge are interrelated, and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power. Foucaultâs analysis has inspired discourse analysis in many fields, and it has become an integral part of political analysis in particular through the work of Maarten Hajer (a Dutch political scientist). He defined a policy discourse as ensemble of ideas, concepts and categories through which meaning is given to social and physical phenomena. It is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of practices. In a policy arena, different, competing policy discourses may be identified. A policy discourse is produced and maintained by a discourse coalition, a group of actors that, in the context of an identifiable set of practices, shares the usage of a particular set of story lines over a particular period of time (Foucault 1981; Hajer 1995). In EU and in German political discourses, sometimes the idea of a knowledge-based"

This could be a new basis of a more comprehensive inclusion of persons in the process of self-optimization of a production system."
298,30,0.987,The Globalization of Science Curricula,"Linked to the rising influence of international large-scale assessments is âpolicy borrowingâ, where countries adopt education reforms and policies that have been successfully implemented in other countries, typically high-performing jurisdictions. There has been a suggestion that the rate of policy borrowing is increasing over time, and that this is directly affecting national education policies (Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2009). This increase in policy borrowing is perhaps unsurprising, as international assessments facilitate comparison between countries and provide evidence for the most successful and high-performing countries (as measured by the assessment). In addition to policy borrowing and international large-scale assessments, Astiz et al. (2002) outlined the global trend towards greater emphasis on standardization, achievement and assessment in science and mathematics curricula. This has been achieved through approaches strengthening school accountability and is also contributing to greater convergence of curriculum goals in different countries. However, despite the wide range of forces driving globalization in science education and curricula, there are other factors that are counteracting or mediating the rate of globalization in this area. One of the most important counteracting factors is local culture. For example, research comparing science teaching in Grade 6 classrooms in Australia and China highlighted the impact of culture on curricula and educational practices in these countries (Tao et al. 2013). The study found that the contrasting cultures and education philosophies in Australia and China had an impact not only on classroom practices but also on how education reforms are enacted. For example, in China, despite reforms to the science curriculum to give a greater emphasis to constructivist approaches, the research identiï¬ed resistance to these reforms, with traditional teaching approaches (such as the memorization of facts, reading books and watching teachers conduct experiments) still the dominant approach to science teaching in many schools. Clearly, even if the intended science curricula in different countries or jurisdictions may be becoming more globalized, this does not necessarily mean that the implemented science curriculum experienced by students becomes more closely aligned. The misalignment between countriesâ intended and implemented science curricula and the complex interplay between central and local forces is not limited to China. Astiz et al. (2002) identiï¬ed similar issues in Spain and the United States. In Spain, a common curriculum is speciï¬ed by central government, but this curriculum is then adapted and interpreted locally in the different regions of the country."
183,35,0.987,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"1.6 Conclusion Social impact requires the successful implementation of a technology at a large scale. In this respect, developing a sustainable business model is crucial. De Jaeger et al. (2017) argue that the underlying challenge when it comes to ensuring a high impact depends on the development and successful implementation of a robust innovation/entrepreneurship ecosystem, the cooperation of all stakeholders, and sufficient resources. Innovation must also be linked to national and institutional systems, e.g., when developing medical technologies, the Ministry of health should be a key partner from the onset. The challenge consists in considering all of these factors simultaneously; by not doing so, the entire arch of technology development could run the risk of collapse due to a single factor (e.g., financial sustainability or socio-cultural acceptability) not being adequately addressed. It is for this reason that universities have a key role to play in supporting the path to innovation and entrepreneurship education, with outcomes that impact society at large. Human-centered design is the core of development engineering that aims to scale for impact by incorporating development goals, constraints, and opportunities (Levine et al. 2016). Development engineering is based on the belief that innovative technologies have the potential to improve life in low-income communities by incorporating insight from the social sciences throughout technological innovationâfrom prototyping to production at scale. 7 http://observers.france24.com/en/20161110-togolese-invent-3d-printer-waste."
112,194,0.987,Designing Sustainable Energy For All : Sustainable Product-Service System Design Applied To Distributed Renewable Energy,"This section discusses the concept of human-centred design as the process puts the user at the pinnacle of all design activities. This process is referred to as human-centred because it starts and end with the people one is designing for. The human-centred design process encourages the concept of designing with users rather than designing for users. The process commences by probing the needs, interests and behaviours of the users affected by the problem by listening and understanding their real needs. Human-centred approach contribute to innovation in design, increase productivity, improve quality, reduce errors, improve acceptance of new products and reduce development costs. This approach to design and development aims to make products, services and systems more useful, usable, pleasurable and cherisable. Some designers in new emerging economies have not yet embraced this approach in their practice, resulting in products, services or systems that do not respond to userâs social, physical, emotional and cultural needs. Despite the advantages offered by this approach, it also has some limitations that need to be taken into consideration at the conceptual design stages. In this chapter, the authors opted to use the term human-centred design instead of user-centred design because the former suggests a concern for people, while the latter suggests a limited focus on peopleâs roles as users. Human-centred design is a methodology that puts users at the centre of the design process. It is an approach based on the needs and interests of users with special attention to making products, services or systems usable and understandable. Human-centred design is based on the premise that design is meaningful only when the focus of its activities and outcomes accommodate the largest possible number of people inclusive of their diversity [83]. It focuses on how people actually interact with speciï¬c products, services and systems, and designed environments, rather than prioritising the product form and appearance. IDEO [47] deï¬ne human-centred design as a process and technique that create new solutions (products, services, systems, organisations, environments and modes of interaction) for the world. Human-centred design is an approach for designing products, services and systems, which are physically, perceptually, cognitively and emotionally intuitive [42]. Furthermore, the authors argues that the approach goes beyond the designâs traditional focus on the physical, emotional and cognitive needs of users, and encompasses social and cultural factors. From these varied deï¬nitions, it is proposed that human-centred design is a multidisciplinary approach which is driven"

Analysis of the interaction between social and biological determinants of behavior emphasizes better understanding of the complexity of the human brain in action thanks to: â¢ Coequal contributions of emotions and affects towards normal brain functioning regarding the âhigherâ and âlowerâ cognitive functions built into human neurophysiology â¢ Brain relation to body in biological psychiatry thanks to embodiment, embeddedness, enactivism, extended cognition, and situatedness â¢ Importance of âbeing in relationâ for reasonable neural functioning, especially in terms of social relationships for the human brain from birth until death â¢ Computational neurosciences taking into account information integration theory Large prospective datasets of patients with Alzheimerâs disease (AD) allow us to construct advanced brain models of (physiologically) healthy subjects and patients with AD (with pathophysiological changes occurring over time). Despite the huge amount of information taken into account and efforts of scientists, the aforementioned models are still regarded as inadequate. Their limitations are: lack of scaling (i.e., they are single-scale) and lack of reflecting the complexity and interdependence of brain changes at different levels (molecular, cellular, tissue) [49]. We should take into consideration that changes in a patientâs brain may take place much earlier than visible symptoms and diagnostic outcomes. Thus early diagnosis providing datasets for early changes within the central nervous system may be difficult to obtain. MR elastography (MRE) varies for a healthy brain, but is regarded as a reliable marker of neurodegenerative disease (e.g., dementia) [35]. Rapid development of artificial stimulation techniques (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) both in clinical practice and cognitive neuroscience research requires development of a completely novel family of computational models of such phenomena [47]."

However, providing an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of each country of interest would not be a practical way to contribute to this dialogue. Such a comprehensive approach would be unwieldy. Instead, we shall focus on a small group of topics that promise to be of strategic value in the on-going discussion about how RVA might best link up with broader objectives of both developed and developing countries. For the purposes of this study the following areas of analysis are highlighted as useful starting points for sharing learning across the North and the South, and between developed and developing countries: 1. The strategic value of RVA (legislation, policy objectives for sustainable development, stakeholder involvement). 2. The features of best practice and of the quality of processes and mechanisms to be employed. 3.

In principle, there are no major technical obstacles for implementation and integration of the whole architecture. However, in addition to the technical issues, new processes and work methods may require an even greater effort. This study has practical implications in industry and implications in PLM and engineering design research. This paper shows how novel technology can be utilized in industry and how it might enable business model innovations related to individual product upgrade services. However, this also requires a holistic and humanistic approach, taking into account processes, organizations, networks, leadership and ways of working. This paper contributes to research by discussing the closed-loop PLM concept, involving virtualization of PSS development and upgrading product individuals in MoL and EoL lifecycle phases. Connection to Product Avatars and the Industry4.0 concept was also discussed, from the perspective of the virtualization of product individuals and the enrichment of the digital 3D model, with knowledge from the middle and end of life phases. How VE and AR contribute to PLM was also discussed, in this context. In a more philosophical way, the value of the UIW-approach can be explained with the notion of âBounded Rationalityâ (Simon 1995). It means that human rationality is bounded by the very narrow focus of human attention. Because design is a process of searching, discovering the right goals, and ï¬nding information about constraints and available alternatives, it is highly valuable if we can extend the focus of designers and help then to see the right goals and choose the right alternatives. In the PLM and product development context, it must be understood that all stakeholders are also designers who not only contribute to the technical solution, but also to each otherâs success and well-being. This can also be understood with the shared value approach (Porter and Kramer 2011), which emphasizes a ï¬rmâs opportunity to better utilize skills, resources, and management capabilities in order to better understand customers and mechanisms that influence productivity and success, both from economic growth and social progress perspectives.

This latter aspect is relevant for the study of intergroup relations, because depending on the particular historical narratives that are endorsed, people may position themselves favourably or unfavourably towards the presence of others. These historical narratives are socially shared as they are expressed in public and political discourses (Ashmore et al. 2004; Psaltis 2012, 2016). In these discourses, the collective past is often reconstructed and used flexibly to fit the interests of the present (Lowenthal 1985a, b). That is, strategic representations of group history are often employed in politics to justify present arrangements (Reicher and Hopkins 2001). The historical perspective to group dynamics has been integrated to social psychological research. There is, for instance, a considerable body of research on how representations of historical wrongdoings of ingroups, such as slavery, colonialism and genocide, impact current intergroup relations via group-based emotions (Branscombe and Doosje 2004; Doosje et al. 1998). Group-based emotions refer to the emotions that people can feel on account of their ingroupâs behaviour towards others, such as guilt or shame, even when not personally involved in this intergroup conflict. Most studies within this line of research have examined whether experiencing group-based emotions for historical wrongdoings impacts attitudes towards the harmed outgroup. Several studies show that feelings of group-based guilt for past ingroup atrocities are related to reparation and compensation intentions towards the harmed outgroup in the present (e.g. Brown and Cehajic 2008). A related body of research has examined how group members, despite not being directly harmed, regard themselves as victims of past group conflict (i.e. collective victimhood), and how this impacts intergroup relations (Bar-Tal et al. 2009). furthermore, studies by Liu and colleagues (e.g. Liu and Hilton 2005; Liu and LÃ¡szlÃ³ 2007; Sibley et al. 2008) examined how representations of national history guide current sociopolitical attitudes, such as support for military action, and legitimation of social inequality (Sibley et al. 2008). Importantly, these social representations also hinder the development and attainment of some central historical thinking skills (Seixas 2004) like historical significance, change and continuity, cause and effect and historical empathy (PÃ¡ez et al. 2017, pp. 491â510; Psaltis et al. 2017). we argue that something that is missing from the above line of research is the study of historical narratives of intergroup conflict in relation to a basic ingredient of reconciliation which is trust given that trust"

The middle ground between the two extremes is occupied by the idea of âquasiâ, âcriticalâ, or âecologicalâ sustainability. It builds upon the principle of prudence and puts critical levels or critical boundaries, for example, of the Earth systems into the middle of thinking (for an explanation of such critical boundaries see, for example, Steffen et al. 2015). Such thresholds should not be exceeded and, for example, a substitution of natural capital by man-made capital has to be well justified. To achieve this, a mixture of the three strategies might be needed but the technological feasibility and the socio-political enforceability of these strategies is uncertain."
346,451,0.987,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","of this work was that the use of three heuristics would significantly improve evidence evaluation on the part of the high school students. The first heuristic was defined as corroboration or the act of comparing documents with one another. The second one, sourcing, was defined as the act of looking first to the source of the document before reading the body of the text. The last heuristic is contextualization considered as the act of situating a document in a concrete temporal and spatial context. These and related ideas produced the development of educational programs like Reading like a historian (wineburg et al. 2011), which has had an enormous impact on schools in the USA and other countries.7 The approach developed by wineburg and colleagues (Nokes 2017; wineburg et al. 2010) emphasized both reading and writing as essential cognitive abilities related to the specificity of history as a discipline and tend to use the term historical thinking as the initiatives leaded by Seixas also do (see http://historicalthinking.ca/ and also https://sheg. stanford.edu/). In both cases, the emphasis has been on the cognitive activity of student as a learner of historical knowledge. This underlying idea can be also found on related efforts as the work of vanSledright (2010). But there are also interesting efforts which emphasized the idea of the student as a social learner from an interactionist point of view. In a European context, van Boxtel and van Drie (2017) have developed a fruitful instructional initiative through a dialogical framework. They consider learning as entering into a community of practice (Lave and wenger 1991) and achieving specific concepts and procedures. from this point of view, the historiansâ practice is also based on a dialogical activity. The work by van Boxtel and van Drie stems from the abovementioned contributions about fostering historical thinking and also emphasizes the use of documents and evidence. However, based on Bakhtinâs ideas (1981) about the nature and importance of dialogue, they think that historical expertise is not only based on individual cognitive operations, such as the sourcing, corroboration and documentation related to historical text inquiry. for them, it is also essential to consider dialogical activity, mostly in relation to multiple views on both historical narratives and concepts. Therefore, they confront students in the classrooms with a number of dialogical activities in which they have to compare and evaluate different views on the same historical issue. More specifically, these activities have to do with asking historical questions, connecting events, developments and actions through a historical"
198,467,0.987,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract This chapter focuses on the evaluation of adaptive capacities of community-level human systems related to agriculture and food security. It highlights findings regarding approaches and domains to monitor and evaluate behavioral changes from CGIARâs research program on climate change, agriculture and food security (CCAFS). This program, implemented in five West African countries, is intended to enhance adaptive capacities in agriculture management of natural resources and food systems. In support of participatory action research on climatesmart agriculture, a monitoring and evaluation plan was designed with the participation of all stakeholders to track changes in behavior of the participating community members. Individualsâ and groupsâ stories of changes were collected using most significant change tools. The collected stories of changes were substantiated through field visits and triangulation techniques. Frequencies of the occurrence of characteristics of behavioral changes in the stories were estimated. The results show that smallholder farmers in the intervention areas adopted various characteristics of"
284,209,0.987,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"principles for sustainable mining development (MMSD, 2002; ICMM, 2003). However, only one of ICMMâs 46 subprinciples refers to the responsible consumption of water and energy in mining. In the reference cases studied, the relevance of the consumption of water and mining is a theme of a âhigh levelâ and experts. It does not, however, seem to be picked up by other social actors. Similarly, references to water and energy consumption in the mining and environmental legislation of the countries studied are scarce (OCMAL, 2012). In the rules and regulations for environmental evaluation and monitoring, these issues are of secondary importance. In short, the analysis of institutional discourses elucidates the importance of the principles and good practices driven by transnational companies. They emphasize the role of international ï¬nancial agencies and institutions, such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC, 2012), and principles of environmental evaluation and report, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, 2011) and BellagioSTAMP (IISD and OECD, 2009). This study underlines the existence of basic social representations that favour environmental considerations. The interviewed actors in the four countries were asked about the environment, climate change, development models and the relationship of man with nature. They responded in a few typical patterns that show their views on water and energy consumption. Some stress the role of policies of social and environmental responsibility of the mining companies and institutions, reï¬ecting inï¬uential discourses at local and international levels. The alternative discourses, which oppose mining projects, resort to interpretational codes derived from a radical reconceptualization of the consumption of water and energy. They focus on their uses, meanings and valuations as associated with the notions of justice, and social and environmental rights. The statement against which interviewees had to declare their preferences is taken from the mainstream discourses in public policy, saying that â âSustainable developmentâ in the context of my countryâs needs would be an economic growth model that mitigates negative environmental and social impacts.â8 The responses were primarily âstrongly agreeâ, which dominated among senior public ofï¬cials and businessmen, and âdisagreeâ, which dominated among environmentalists and (college-educated) experts. We should take note of the emphasis on the idea of economic growth in this proposal, although it is certainly moderated by the idea of mitigating environmental and social impacts. Our results indicate that the concepts associated with growth that"
167,493,0.987,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"How can we use an intersectional approach to illuminate social, political, and environmental developments taking place in the Arctic? In my own work on the Arctic I use both a intersectional and a security analysis approach. Both concepts are actively present politically and socially across the region, and they are intimately tied to environmental use (or exploitation) and change. The term security invokes power, whereby the utmost priorities of the person, state, social group are linked to the survival of values and practices for the future (Hoogensen GjÃ¸rv 2017). Many are quite familiar with the narrower, militarized understanding of security that focuses on the use of the military for purposes of defending one actor, the state, from existential threat (Walt 1991). However, when we think in terms of actors more broadly, and diverse practices to ensure survivial (and the diverse ways in which survival is understood), a much more complex analysis results. Through intersectional analysis, it is possible to best understand the dynamics and tensions between priorities and perceived futures for the Arctic. This can be exemplified with the concept of âhuman securityâ which has been increasingly employed in Arctic research to articulate linkages between individual and community values and prerequisites for survival, and political and social policy. Human security was popularised in the 1994 United Nations Human Development Report, expanding the notion of security to include dimensions of food, health,"
275,448,0.987,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"15.2.2 Previous Work on Cognitive Architectures It has been suggested [30] that cognitive theories (including computational cognitive models) should be developed that satisfy multiple criteria, in order to avoid theoretical myopia. There have been steady developments of generic computational cognitive models, that is, cognitive architectures, for the past three decades since that seminal suggestion. Early cognitive architectures often took the form of production systems and were (more or less) concerned with various psychological phenomena [20]. However, other forms of cognitive architectures have also been developed over the years â they may be in the form of a connectionist model, a constraint satisfaction network, a hybrid system of different models, and so on. Some of them may be more concerned with applications to building artificial systems than capturing and explaining empirical psychological phenomena. Computational cognitive architectures provide the best hope for integrated systems that incorporate not just cognitive capabilities, but also motivation, emotion, personality, and many other capacities and capabilities needed for an autonomous agent. In particular, computational cognitive architectures based firmly on psychological data and findings and thus well-grounded empirically can be especially illuminatingâ they provide a glimpse into how human minds work, for example, in terms of the interaction between cognition and motivation, as well as their interaction with the environments (simple or complex). The human mind provides the best example of a truly autonomous intelligent system, and thus can lead to better understanding of intelligence and autonomy. Such cognitive architectures, like humans on which they are based, are capable of being truly autonomous, because they include a wide range of cognitive, motivational, and other capabilities and these capabilities function together to cope with different tasks and environments. Let us look into three examples, in chronological order."

234,192,0.987,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"CONCLUSION The research review work that formed the basis of this chapter was entered into following our growing realisation grounded in evidence gained from in-depth qualitative research, that many if not most of the interventions utilising professional volunteers as knowledge brokers have largely failed to generate visible and sustainable impact on health systems. Or, put more simply, training Ugandan health workers has failed to translate into evidence of individual behaviour change. The exploration of other research marked an attempt to answer the âwhyâ question and, if necessary change our methods of intervention. All of the approaches reviewed here offer important insights and we would not wish to privilege any disciplinary or theoretical approach but rather to identify those aspects that we feel are most applicable. Recent studies applying the COM-B model to an evaluation of behaviour change in CPD interventions in low-resource settings concluded that âNone of capability, opportunity or motivation were found to predict either behaviour or behavioural intentionâ (Byrne-Davis et al. 2016: 68). The authors suggest that this may reï¬ect the fact that the validation of these tools took place in âresource-rich, high-income environmentsâ which may âreduce the applicability of some behaviour change theories to this [low resource] contextâ. Having said that, the other theories reviewed here have not attempted empirical veriï¬cation remaining at âideasâ stage. Our empirical work conï¬rms the importance of the three components of the COM-B approach: namely of capabilities, opportunities and motivations. However, it rather turns the equation on its head"

These and many others are all global challenges with environmental and resource dimensions. Increasingly, people and organizations are using Earth observations and scientiï¬c information about the Earth to gain insights on and inform their policy and management decisions related to these challenges. Along with numerous organizations globally, NASA has been a key contributor to the wealth of data and information about the Earth and its processes. In addition, NASA has helped advance global knowledge about effective ways to apply the data and information across sectors and thematic areas. There are countless examples on how organizations have and are using Earth observations to support speciï¬c analyses, decisions, and associated actions. Many of these examples have been qualitative and anecdotal. The substantiation of Earth observation beneï¬ts in societal and economic terms poses key challenges, yet this quantitative substantiation is of strategic importance to the Earth observation community as it expands efforts to inform decisions. It is at the heart of the value proposition. In addition, it comes at a time when there are increasing efforts to encourage greater integration of the social and economic sciences with natural sciences as well as global efforts to use data and indicators to address sustainability. This chapter describes NASAâs work to enable uses and applications of Earth observations, as well as efforts to quantify the socioeconomic impact and showcase the overall value of space-based observations."
334,210,0.987,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"success, finding for example that groups which use violence, groups with singleissue demands, and well-organized groups have a higher likelihood of success than other groups. Though Gamsonâs meta-study has been perennially contested (Giugni 1998; Giugni et al. 1999), it nevertheless continues to highlight the difficult task of analyzing movement outcomes. This chapter is located at the intersection between social movement studies and research on migration and deportation. Deportation and anti-deportation protests have been increasingly investigated in scholarly research in recent years. However, only few of these studies have investigated the outcomes of anti-deportation protests. Even fewer have referred to empirical research on this issue from a comparative perspectiveâa research gap that motivated this trilateral comparative project. After presenting some studies on anti-deportation protests, we discuss selected social movement studies that address the question of movement outcomes in order to identify different explanations for success. Our case-study data then prepares the ground for our empirical analysis of mechanisms favoring success. While some studies on anti-deportation protests focus explicitly on explaining the success or failure of such protests, others tackle the issue more implicitly. Based on a comparative analysis of deportation practices in Germany and the United States, Antje Ellermann (2005, 1219) identified differences in the âcapacity of bureaucrats to implement contested deportation ordersâ due to shifting interests of policymakers at various stages of the policy process: [A]s policy moves from legislation to implementation, public attention changes its focus from the benefits of deportation to its costs, with important consequences. As public attention shifts, so do the incentives of state actors. This â¦ unstable nature of state actorsâ incentives threatens to undermine the stateâs socially coercive capacity.

An insight gleaned from the chapters by Sivesind and Segaard and Saglie is how marketisation, national legislation and regulation are important drivers behind changes in the welfare mixâthe composition of public, for-proï¬t and nonproï¬t providers. In this chapter, I am concerned with how the users of services funded by the public sector are affected by the different providers in the welfare mix. By taking the perspective of the citizen, I document through a comparative case study analysis how the institutional sector of the provider and the use of policy instruments have relevance at the ground level of services. A fundamental principle in western understandings of democracy is that citizens are different in all sorts of ways, and that these differences are H.S.

192,63,0.987,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"In order to discern the philosophemes and imperatives (S1) which structure scientific discourse (S2), we must step outside of the normal scientific discursive mode and analyse scientific discourse from an oblique perspective (Zwart 2017c). The idea that there are multiple types of discourse was already apparent in Freudâs preface to Dora, as we have seen, where Freud at a certain point steps outside the psychoanalytical mode of writing (the case history mode) to comment on his own work from the perspective of academic, professional discourse, as a universitytrained expert (S2). Likewise, in order to discern the basic dialectical structure of scientific discourse, we must move from the discourse of the professional expert (the scientific researcher: S2) to psychoanalytical discourse. In order to come to terms with phenomena of integrity and misconduct in science, we must step outside normal science discourse, adopting an oblique perspective, a psychoanalytic stance. The axis of attention takes a quarter turn. Instead of on the objects of research (molecules, elementary particles, historical archives, artworks, election polls, and so on) we assess research practices from a slightly tilted, oblique perspective. Instead of on the object-pole (molecules, microbes, model organisms, etc.), the focus is rather on the subject-object interaction: on the researcher (the research team) at work, on the interrelations between experimenters and their targets, âobserving the observerâ, as Bachelard (1938/1949, p. 13) once phrased it, following the discourse of academic experts with evenly-posed attention (âgleichschwebende Aufmerksamkeitâ; Freud 1912/1943), and from a critical angle: a position which is comparable to how psychoanalysts keep track of the analysandâs discursive flow. At a certain point, somewhere in the stream of discourse, a specific metaphor, concept or confusion may light up, triggering our attention, catching the philosophical or psychoanalytical ear, so that a shift towards a more active, Socratic mode of listening is indicated, prompting questions and dialogue. The intentio obliqua has a long history which goes back to medieval scholasticism. Thomas Aquinas already stated that, whereas human understanding is predominantly directed towards external reality, critical reflection on human understanding requires a change of perspective, an intentio obliqua (Schmidt 1966). By opting for an oblique perspective, a diagnostics of contemporary knowledge can be achieved: a critical assessment of the way contemporary research allows nature or social reality to emerge. This means that, rather than in protons, mitochondria, microbes, ethnic prejudices or political preferences, philosophers are interested in the Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ïâdimension: the words or signifiers that are actually used to bring such items to the fore. Bachelard once argued that, in terms of competence, philosophers have but one: âthe competence of readingâ (1948, p. 6). Not only in the sense that they are"

Van Ameron (2002) similarly reported from her study of Dutch students that nudging 11-year-olds to use symbolic formulas is not productive, not even if it is done in a tentative and well-considered way. While technology was not a major component of much of the early-days research in Early Algebra, there were a few exceptions. For example, the research of Ainley (1999) and Ainley et al. (1998) showed that spreadsheets, with their algebra-like notation and graphing facility, can be quite productive with 8- to 11-year-olds as a tool for emergent algebraic reasoning.

271,591,0.987,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"(52) It is an interesting insight that the full cross-media potential of the young peopleâs available media ensemble is almost neutralized by the normative pressure within the group to use one form of media: Facebook. Chapter 4 by Sebastian Kubitschko takes figurational analysis into the area of civil society organizations, as he analyzes the German national hacker organization The Chaos Computer Club as a communicative figuration. The research question, how does the Chaos Computer Club communicatively construct media technologies and infrastructures as a political category in its own right, aims to understand how one of the worldâs oldest and largest hacker organizationâs âpolitical engagement today relies on a wide range of practices related to media technologies and infrastructures and, at the same time, continues to be oriented towards larger publics as well as âtraditionalâ centres of political powerâ (82). The methodological design takes the form of an extended case study that brings together data from 40 face-to-face interviews with Club members and participant observation of internal and public gatherings, contextualizing these with insights from a wide range of media discourses (such as the Club magazine, its official Twitter account, mainstream media coverage of prominent hacks). The analysis uses the figurational lens to create historical insights about the organizations changing actor constellations, communicative practices and political frames of relevance, showing how the organization has been a transformative force, achieving and maintaining socio-political influence through its media ensemble and its cross-media communicative practices. More generally, the analysis shows how communicative figurations can be a useful sensitizing concept for structuring an empirical analysis that maps the communicative context around a politically oriented organization. Chapter 9 by Leif Kramp and Wiebke Loosen takes us into the realm of the national public sphere, as they use the figurational mindset in the service of substantiating media-related cultural transformations in a diverse, cross-media news ecology. The complete figurational mindset is encapsulated in a visual model (208), as they explore how journalistic role conceptions are being adapted to a transforming news landscape. Here journalists are struggling to find their professional feet on the continuum from traditional legacy news media ideals of gatekeeper and watchdog, to the more participatory, dialogic ideals of a platform-diverse news universe increasingly colonized by social media and the âomnipresence of audience feedbackâ (206). Drawing on previously conducted"
191,320,0.987,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Parallel Processes One of the fundamental ideals behind the model of Barnahus is to facilitate multiagency collaboration and efficiency considered essential for the successful handling of cases concerning child sexual abuse. Research indicates that this has been successful to some degree (Kaldal et al. 2010; FriÃ°riksdÃ³ttir and Haugen 2014). It is generally accepted that in most cases of suspected child sexual abuse in Iceland, the CWS starts the assessment of the childâs safety and living conditions, and the police begin the investigation of the alleged sexual abuse. Our research suggested that the different agencies did not in general have a comprehensive knowledge of the parallel processes and many lacked sufficient knowledge of each otherâs roles and responsibilities. This may serve to hinder efficiency and necessary collaboration serving the needs of the child. It is well established in research how lack of knowledge of each otherâs values and roles and the competing interests of different professions is likely to hinder effective collaboration (Sloper 2004), as well as how shared views and integrated knowledge and working methods provide a"

(2012). In recent years a number there have been some attempts to build network models of the economy that can account for the fat tails in the distribution of the growth rate of national output. This literature has been motivated by the inability of traditional DSGE models to account for such fat tails (see Ascari et al. 2015). Acemoglu et al. (2012, 2017a) have analyzed production networks where the aggregate effects of idiosyncratic shocks depend on both the initial distribution of shocks and the structure of the network.2 Anthonissen (2016) considers dynamic versions of similar economies. Thurner et al. (2012) show how leverage, through bankruptcies, can exacerbate volatility. There is also a growing related literature that develops agent-based models to study the relationship between financial markets and the macroeconomy. Ashraf et al. (2017) integrate a banking sector with an agent-based economy where the source of turmoil is the market for goods. In contrast, in our work we view the financial sector as the one being responsible for the amplification effects on shocks. Battiston et al. (2007) consider the propagation of bankruptcies in production networks while the source of system risk in Geanakoplos et al. (2012) is the housing market. For an empirical investigation of the relationship between the macroeconomy and systemic risk, see Giglio et al. (2016). Lastly, our work is related to a very large literature that uses network analysis to address issues related to systemic risk in banking systems. The interested reader is referred to the literature reviews on this subject by Acemoglu et al. (2017b), Babus and Allen (2009), Bougheas and Kirman (2015), and Glasserman and Young (2016)."

106,147,0.987,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Relations of Inference (Yellow Coding) Before any evidential structuring and reasoning approach can be incorporated within an application design, it is imperative to understand how the users in the target domain think and reason. This has been researched by Wong and Kodagoda (2016) and their results can been expressed as a sense-making triangle (see Fig. 8.2) which encompasses of three interlinked triangles. The inner triangle is the inference-triangle and describes the process of inference making as a combination of deductive, inductive and abductive processes. Each inferential process type is interlinked and a combination of factors, such as the userâs experience, domain and situation knowledge as well as the availability of information, determines which inferential process type will be at the forefront of the userâs thinking and reasoning. The second triangle is the anchoring-triangle and describes the sense-making process in terms of anchoring, laddering and associative questioning (Wong and Kodagoda 2016). Gerber et al. (2016) added the third insight-triangle, by describing the role that intuition and leap-of-faith plays, in highly uncertain environments, in order to gain insight. All three triangles work together in a complex combination of processes and sequences and forms an integral part of the tacit processes of human thinking and reasoning.

242,267,0.987,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract Since the late 1990s there has been a rising trend of Vietnamese women migrating to neighbouring countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and China) for marriage. Previous studies of such cross-border marriages have emphasized either issues of choice and agency for women, or their poverty and victimhood. This chapter analyses this trend along the lines of the debate on the East Asian model of welfare and family policy, with case studies in Taiwan and South Korea. It views commercially arranged transnational marriages (CATM) as an institution that connects changing gendered regimes of social reproduction at the sending and receiving ends. Mediated by a combination of asymmetrical relations â gender, class, age, ethnicity, and national belongingâ this institution operates in a transnational space through which material and symbolic resources are circulated. These in turn construct subjectivities and identities for participating actors. There is a dimension of trans-masculinity embodied in the practices of CATM and this requires further exploration regarding informed consent and the rights of its users. Beyond this, CATM should be further analysed in the context of changing family welfare and intergenerational care as gendered regimes, and such an analysis should also address how households adapt and devise new strategies to sustain and reproduce themselves economically, socially, and culturally. Such an understanding can help open the research agenda on social policy and rights and provide a regional perspective.

346,392,0.987,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","HISTORY TEACHING AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS Attention has been frequently drawn to the negative use of history in conflict situations. The promotion by a dominant group of a partisan historical narrative has often been used to support an ideological position which bolsters that groupâs political control at the expense of those deemed âsuspectâ or âinferiorâ (Bush and Saltarelli 2000; Smith and Vaux 2003; Davies 2004; Cole 2007). History teaching has thus often been associated with shaping the development of particular forms of national identity, particularly in newly independent states (e.g. korostelina 2010). Consequently, history teaching is highlighted as an aspect of educational policy, which needs to respond positively if sustainable peace is to be achieved (Smith and Vaux 2003; Cole 2007). Therefore, educational reformers in contested contexts have acknowledged that reaching consensus on an agreed common narrative is highly problematic and instead have argued for history teaching which adheres to the subjectâs disciplinary process, thus giving students access to the provisional and contested nature of historical knowledge (McCully 2012). Drawing on the work of the Schoolsâ Council History Project (Shemilt 1980) established in the 1970s, it is argued that a history curriculum that opens the past up to the consideration of different interpretations, provided that these are underpinned by valid historical evidence, can provide a greater understanding of the nature of conflict and challenge prevailing ideological certainties, which are often biased in divided societies. It can open up possibilities for greater mutual understanding by acquiring insight into the thinking of the âotherâ and develop critical faculties, which, in turn, might help move society beyond conflict, thus contributing to reconciliation. However, the advocacy for enquiry-based multi-perspective history has tended to run ahead of research studies that confirm its efficacy in bringing personal and group transformation. This may result from a conviction by progressive educators that a constructivist approach, where students actively engage in historical enquiry, analysing, evaluating and interpreting sources in order to develop historical interpretations, offers a clear pathway in situations where emotive positions are deeply held, whether in favour of or against biased conclusions. However, there is a small body of empirical research with young people that does (tentatively) indicate positive outcomes from an enquiry approach (Barton and McCully 2005, 2010, 2012; Goldberg 2013; kolikant and Pollack 2015)."
214,486,0.987,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"One way of describing the philosophy of a climate model is that a global climate model bounds each and every process by physical laws, starting from the conservation of energy and mass. From this constrained set of budget equations, combined with different representations of the processes (like condensation in clouds), complex results emerge. But these results have to be compatible with the physical laws (like conservation of mass, or the equations governing fluid flow on a rotating sphere). The emergent complexity is a reflection of reality. The physical laws behind climate models are well known and observed. The most recent ânewâ theories are well over 100 years old. They are also the same physical laws that govern many other ï¬elds of science and engineering. The description of the motion of fluids in the atmosphere and ocean are the same equations used to build numerical models of how an airplane will perform. The equations that govern the flow of energy in the climate system from the sun, through the atmosphere to the earth, and then back are the same equations describing how cellular phones and radios work."
73,103,0.987,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"urban design and governance approaches through corporate endeavour, aid and development programmes, planning/management education and training, and the recent proliferation of city twinning, partnership and network arrangements have substantially reduced some of these traditional differences. It is now becoming increasingly necessary to transcend the traditional historicospatial analytical and âplanning ghettosâ that, for instance, have largely restricted the ï¬ourishing research and increasingly sophisticated understanding of PUI interactions and their livelihood implications to the global South. Economic change, not least the suddenness and depth of the credit crunch and consequent global recession since 2008, together with ecological and environmental concerns for sustainability, local resilience and self-reliance, and increasing vulnerability to the impacts of GEC, strongly suggest that peri-urban dynamics, environmental sustainability, livelihoods and food security are becoming central concerns worldwide. Therefore, many of the traditional concerns of peri-urban âdevelopmentâ research and planning in the global South can and should provide lessons for (post-) industrial cities in countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the transitional economies struggling to adjust to rapidly changing circumstances in the context of rigid or outdated planning legacies on the urban fringe or in the Zwischenstadt (e.g. Audirac 1999; Jones 2000; Bunker and Houston 2003; Sieverts 2003; Busck et al. 2006; Gallent et al. 2006; McFarlane 2006; QvistrÃ¶m 2010, 2013; Ravetz et al. 2013). Most existing forms of urbanism are morphologically, functionally and environmentally unsustainable under current conditions. They also face profound challenges in overcoming the obstacles to becoming more resilient cities capable of absorbing climatic, economic, environmental and demographic shocks while also addressing structural inequities and injustices. There has been renewed recent interest in urban history over the very long durÃ©e (e.g. Taylor 2012), deriving at least partly from new archaeological work referred to below and also from a desire to understand urban environmental legacies that might be relevant to current sustainability and resilience concerns, including landmark contributions by Douglas (2013) and Elmqvist et al. (2013a). In this context, it is also noteworthy that such research has to date not generally identiï¬ed historical analogies with present-day issues at the urban fringe or through peri-urban interfaces or transition zones. That is the ï¬rst objective of this chapter, as an aid then to transcend the diversity of current institutional and planning settings and processes in order to identify appropriate principles for addressing the dynamic challenges of such zones to promote adaptive and transformative urban sustainability and resilience."

By raising such questions, the biographical approach is perfectly suited to track the impact of social inequality and the constraints and restrictions it imposes on the transition into adulthood for second-generation residents down to the level of individual experiences, strategies and sense-making."

The main purpose of the TSG was to better understand conditions and constraints on the teaching and learning of measurement in international contexts, and to consider some possible changes.

223,298,0.987,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"How to Define and How to Obscure Knowledge One may question whether sociological or economic accounts of the knowledge society need to define knowledge. As soon as they do, however, quite different views surface. The best examples (also in the sense of solid, not simply deficient considerations) are found in the classical theories on the topic. Drucker (1969), probably the first writer to offer a conception of the knowledge society, was brief in definitional matters. Using an approach that has since become widespread (outside philosophy), he also made a specific point: âKnowledge, that is, the systematic organization of information and concepts,â¦ makes apprenticeship obsolete. Knowledge substitutes systematic learning for exposure to experienceâ (p. 268). In context, Drucker focused even more on issues of application: Knowledge is analyzed as crucial in increasing the productivity of labor. Four years later, Bell (1973) highlighted the opposite side when he noted a ânew centrality of theoretical knowledge, the primacy of theory over empiricismâ (p. 343, his italics). Accordingly, basic science is the main reference when he defines knowledge as âa set of organized statements of facts or ideas, presenting a reasoned judgment or an experimental result, which is transmitted to others through some communication medium in some systematic formâ (p. 175). This definition has remained popular in descriptions of the recent, computer-based take-off of the knowledge society (see Castells, 1996, p. 17, for example). But the focus on explicit statements cannot account for a central novelty that characterizes the work of contemporary knowledge workers or symbol analysts (Reich, 1991)âthe importance of situated problem-solving, which demands capacities of embodied or organizational knowledge. Such a capacity is probably at stake when Willke (1998) tries to define knowledge in structures where it matters ânot as truth but as a resourceâ (p. 161): âWhereas information designates systemically relevant differences, knowledge originates when such information is embedded in contexts of experienceâ (pp. 161â162, my translation).1 Unlike the standardized situations Drucker had in mind, this experience presumably affords more than textbooks can convey. Historical differences set aside, the given examples seem to offer three systematically distinguishable accounts of knowledge: 1. Knowledge as a systematic set of applicable recipes 2. Knowledge as an organized body of theoretical statements 3. Knowledge as a developed capacity of situated problem-solving These accounts do not necessarily constitute or presuppose different concepts of knowledge. Maybe they are really only about different contexts in which knowledge matters and thus give different perspectives on the same thing. But if there should"

Interestingly Tertiary contradictions represented the lowest (5) level of occurrences of all the contradictions. This is similar to instances in the literature where for example a study by Rauf and Al Ghafees [58] indicated that most organisations do not follow any agile method completely. They adopt a mix of agile practices and traditional approaches. This could be indicative of signiï¬cant Tertiary contradiction where the âold mode of operation is rebelling against the new oneâ [49]. Similarly, case study analysis of agile implementations, undertaken by Rose [60] indicates that some organisations embrace agile principles without the wholesale abandonment of the already established traditional approaches. His research also noted that there was some symbolic re-labelling of some traditional elements using agile terminology. He notes that this was detrimental to moving forward with agile approaches as labelling acts as a departure point for organisational transformations and notes that âthe path to innovation is not navigable when labels do not accurately reflect either the status quo or the transformed stateâ [60]. Such maneuverings can be viewed from a Tertiary contradiction perspective and as Rose [60] indicates there is a further opportunity for research. Of particular interest would be an understanding as to why the occurrence of Tertiary contradictions is low in comparison with the Primary & Secondary contradiction. Is it because software teams are unaware of what âculturally more advanced formsâ of agile practice are?"
36,886,0.987,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"purposes, most measures are commonly based on self-reporting (or interviews) through questionnaires with scaled responses. Good questionnaires can gather information on knowledge, values, attitudes, opinions, behaviors, facts, and other information and have been increasingly used in ecology and conservation biology to assess stakeholder opinions and perceptions of and behaviors toward species or issues of conservation concern (White et al. 2005). Although many of us have designed and given questionnaires to or interviewed stakeholders, robust design that can evaluate the values and attitudes behind behaviors and provide an unbiased assessment of the behaviors themselves requires substantial preparation. Central is a solid theoretical understanding of social psychology and psychometrics and design considerations. For example, questionnaires need to quantify and maximize validity (does the questionnaire or âinstrumentâ measure what it intended to) and reliability (does the instrument consistently or accurately measure what it is intended to measure). The procedure for sampling the target population (e.g., random, systematic, comprehensive) needs to be considered as does nonresponse bias, to name but a few factors. Measuring behavior through self-reporting or interviews can be particularly tricky if the behavior is illegal or contravenes a social norm (socially disapproved or inappropriate). Respondents may not tell the truth or may skip the question, compromising data validity (King and Bruner 2000). This is key if the prevalence of particular behaviors (such as hunting bats) is the end point of the study and is even more pertinent if the study aims to assess whether attitudes are good predictors of behavior (e.g., St John et al. 2011). Recent applications of sensitive question tools from human health research (e.g., condom use in HIV research) to conservation ârule breakingâ provide much higher reporting of illegal activities than conventional approaches (St John et al. 2013; Nuno and St John 2015). If non-sensitive characteristics (attitudes or demographics) can predict sensitive behaviors, then the identification of the target audience for intervention is greatly facilitated (St John et al. 2013). Scientists are rarely trained in appropriate social science methodologies and indeed may come at human studies from a very different philosophical perspective that can influence our understanding and interpretation of social science data and conclusions (Moon and Blackman 2014). As emphasized in the introduction, we should be collaborating directly with social scientists (Mascia et al. 2003; Sandbrook et al. 2013; St John et al. 2014), but a good introduction to methods is given in Newing (2011)."
317,45,0.987,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"these issues comes from research that has analyzed the forms and functions of mathematical activity in remote, indigenous, non-Western cultures where no systematic transmission in school prevails. Illustrative for this perspective is are Saxeâs (2015) in-depth analyses of the Oksapmin numeration system based on body parts and of how certain changing socio-economic conditions (such as increased participation in economic exchanges involving currency) lead to important adaptations in that system. A second perspective involves analyses of informal mathematical practices that are embedded in speciï¬c out-of-school activities and contexts that may be contrasted with âschool mathematics,â as in the famous pioneering study of Brazilian street venders (see Nunes 1992). Continuing efforts have further contributed to our insight into the forms and social functions of mathematical activity demonstrated by people in varied out-of-school or, more speciï¬cally, work contexts such as carpet laying, interior design, retailing, restaurant management, dietetics, newspaper selling, nursing, banking, and architecture. These everyday math studies show that these forms and functions of mathematical activity are quite different from those of school mathematics, as they are âembodied in expressive forms and bodily modalities, distributed to other people and technologies, and are embedded in the language of the localsâ (Reed 2013, p. 75). While many of these analyses have focused on how people perform certain tasks, others have focused more on the mathematics learning processes in those out-of-school environments, showing that mathematics learning is certainly not limited to acquisition of the mathematical knowledge and skills passed down by mathematics teachers to individuals via school, but that it occurs as well during participation in cultural practices as people attempt to accomplish pragmatic goals. More speciï¬cally, these studies contributed to the view of mathematics learning in many of these out-of-school environments as âa centripetal movement of the apprentice from the periphery to the center of practice, under the guidance of those who are already masters in that practiceâ (Presmeg 2007, p. 444). Many of these analyses of out-of-school mathematical practices and learning environments involve more or less explicit contrasts between doing and learning mathematics in these out-of-school contexts versus formal school contexts, glamorizing the former as more âauthentic,â âmeaningful,â âflexible,â and/or âeffectiveâ than the latter. However, during the past decades, better understanding of the similarities and differences between these different contexts of mathematical (learning) practices has increasingly discouraged researchers and educators from making caricature-like characterizations of these different contexts of mathematical practices and, consequently, oversimpliï¬ed recommendations for implementing features of these informal mathematical practices into mathematics classroom contexts. Second, researchers have analyzed peopleâs use of their mathematical knowledge and skills acquired in one context when functioning in the other. This analysis can be done in both directions. As far as the transition from school to out-of-school mathematics is concerned, many researchers have documentedâfor elementary school up to universityâ (traditionally schooled) learnersâ difï¬culties in spontaneously and efï¬ciently"
376,497,0.987,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","State and transition models (STMs) were conceived as a means to organize and communicate information about ecosystem change as a basis for management. While some authors regard âthe state and transition modelâ as a specific theory about how ecosystems respond to disturbance (see review in Pulsford et al. 2014), we take the view that STMs are not a theory per se, but are a flexible way of organizing information about ecosystem change that may draw on a wide range of concepts about ecosystem dynamics (Westoby et al. 1989). The value of STMs for rangeland managers is in fostering a general understanding of how rangelands function and respond to management actions, thereby leading to more efficient and effective allocation of management efforts. The fundamental idea is simple (see the Caldenal STM at http://jornada.nmsu. edu/esd/international/argentina). Vegetation, a commonly used indicator of ecosystem conditions, is described according to discrete plant communities (such as an open Prosopis caldenia forest with grassy understory). In doing so, we develop a logic for distinguishing different communities so that stakeholders can communicate effectively about them. Next, we describe the multiple plant communities that can occur on a particular site. The key problem in this step is to define the characteristics of the âsiteââits climate, soils, and topographic position. Otherwise we might conclude erroneously that a set of plant communities are alternative states of a specific site when in fact they exist on different sites. Finally, we identify the R.

Second, these people do not float in a global space, but need to touch ground from time to time (Ley 2004). An analysis of transnationalism as an everyday phenomenon needs, therefore, to take into account the localities where the social practice that constitutes these relations and communications across borders, takes place. Locality therefore represents, on the one hand, the social context in which migrants and other transnational actors are rooted, and it stands, on the other hand, for the nodes of the networks (Gielis 2009). Some authors have called such places translocal because they are meaningful owing to their connection across national borders (Brickell and Datta 2011; Smith 2011). Third, these localities need to be connected somehow to become translocal. Such connections have been addressed conceptually through the study of networks (Featherstone 2007; Featherstone et al. 2007). Fourth, the spatial formation that is constituted through the networks of people and places and the practices that maintain them have been termed transnational social spaces (Pries 2008; Faist 2009). Transnational studies confront researchers with a social phenomenon that is complex, because it is, on the one hand, spatially disrupted, and on the other hand, highly connected in social terms. Researchers have developed various approaches to deal with this complexity. One of the earliest and most cited is the notion of multi-sited research that was discussed prominently by Marcus (1995). The idea of following people, things, metaphors, stories, biographies, or conflicts has been used in various studies in the field of transnational migration (Amelina 2010; Sinatti 2011). Nevertheless, some scholars criticize that these research strategies are seldom truly multi-, but rather, double-sited and that it seems impossible to conduct an equally intensive ethnography in multiple sites (Hage 2005). The problem of conducting parallel ethnographies has, for instance, been addressed by Mazzucato (2010: 206) with her âsimultaneous matched samples.â While being resource-intensive, the advantage of conducting research simultaneously at two sites by two connected groups of researchers provides accounts of simultaneity that cannot be apprehended otherwise. Other researchers, such as Tarrius, have stressed the aspect of movement and created a moving ethnography (Tarrius 2000; Tarrius 2002). This leads also to mobile methods: â[A] mobile ethnography involves travelling with people and things, participating in their continual shift through time, place and relations with othersâ (Watts and Urry 2008: 867). The âmoving territoriesâ Tarrius (2001) evokes, point towards the tensions that lie at the heart of research on transnationalism: the ambivalence between fixing people and places (territories) and their constant movement. All these approaches have in common, that they obtain rich data by a variety of methods. The research strategy we are presenting here is also a mixed-methods approach that bridges the spatial disruption and grasps the notions of movement and fixity that are always competing in these studies. A comparison with items measuring the characteristics of social networks in quantitative household panel data exemplifies the reasoning behind our approach. Of course, social capital as a resource and social network data have also gained importance in recent years in quantitative research. For instance, the Swiss household panel, includes a variety of items to grasp the extent of a householdâs network and can be used for analysis of social support (see for instance Bachmann 2014). However, the data are unsuitable for our question for"

Virtual communities offer opportunities for enhancing an immersive approach to Israel education. The Israel experience is a significantly new Jewish educational framework. As in all education, the educator is a seminal force in the realization of the educational vision. Keywords Connectedness â¢ Immersive â¢ Oeuvres â¢ Virtual communities â¢ The Israel experience The relational approach to Israel education is rooted in two educational perspectives, sometimes regarded as contradictory, but which we regard as complementaryâthe humanist and the culturalist. The humanist approach teaches us that the person is the focus of education, and the culturalist approach teaches us that cultures are shaping forces of who we are and what we might become. A synergistic view of these two perspectives suggests an all-encompassing Israel education which is nourished by a culture, while, at the same time, focused on the person.

78,388,0.987,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"This critical accompaniment of ICTs can only take shape in concrete practices of design, use, and implementation, in which human beings can get critically involved in how technologies mediate their existence. A critical use of information technology then becomes an âascetic practiceâ, in which human beings explicitly anticipate technological mediations, and develop creative appropriations of technologies in order to give a desirable shape to these mediations. At the same time, the design of information technology becomes an inherently moral activity, in which designers do not only develop technological artifacts, but also the social impacts that come with it. And policy-making activities regarding the implementation of new technologies then become ways of governing our technologically mediated world. Let me return to one of the examples I gave at the beginning of this contribution in order to elaborate how this critical accompaniment of technologies could be a fruitful form of ethical and political reflection on technology. As indicated above, one of the most salient aspects of Google Glass is its impact on interpersonal relations. The âdoublingâ of the relations between humans and world that it brings about adds a second layer to the communication between people, which remains invisible to the other person. When two people meet, they cannot see which information the other has available about them. Googleâs search engine might reveal private information on the basis of face recognition software, or it might confuse the person with somebody else. Because this parallel information is only available for the person wearing the device, an asymmetry comes about that makes open communication impossible and that radically transforms the character of public space and public life."

Safety researchers, clinicians and managers took the concepts, techniques and methods from industrial safety and applied them to healthcare. These included a stronger emphasis on the role of latent organisational conditions which led to the development of methods of incident analysis derived this model (Vincent et al. 1998, 2000). Increasing attention was also given to human factors and ergonomics, following the success in improving interface and equipment design in industry, the use of information technology and a scientific approach to working conditions, stress and fatigue management (Bates 2000; Sexton et al. 2000; Carayon 2006). Accreditation and certification built on this new knowledge in requiring hospitals to establish risk management programmes and new patient safety indicators. Safety and risk management acquired a much higher profile and many new initiatives were developed across the healthcare system, but the impact on the safety of patients remained uncertain (Pronovost et al. 2006; Wachter 2010). The lack of clinical engagement was a major concern with patient safety remaining the province of enthusiasts and specialists â a curious situation given that safety, considered in terms of personal accountability, is perhaps the dominant concern of clinicians in their day-to-day work with patients."
98,162,0.987,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","A review of the literature on TSIs on human resources and community by KamerÄde (2015) reveals the complexity of assessing the impact of the third sector at different levels. Indeed, impacts can be, first, assessed in terms of the consequences of voluntary participation for individuals involved in TSOs. The same literature review (KamerÄde 2015) concludes that evidence from a range of studies in different disciplinary fields suggests that the third sector makes an important impact; however, this impact is not equally accessible or widespread. The presence of TSOs is not an easy or straightforward solution for inequalities in participation and representation, or social integration problems, as their effects again vary between different social groups and types of organizations. This literature review highlights the unequal distribution of positive effects on individuals of participation in TSOs. More specifically, individuals who already have better wellbeing and health, and higher social trust, are more likely to be involved in the third sector, which, in turn, contributes to better health and wellbeing. In addition, individuals and groups who have fewer resources or who are already less advantaged in society are less likely to become involved in voluntary associations to promote their interests, satisfy their needs or make changes in policy favorable to them. Moreover, the effects of voluntary participation are gendered and can vary by age, employment status, income, type of association and type of involvement. In some cases, for particular groups, involvement in voluntary associations can have negative consequences. This review points toward a major methodological issue plaguing TSI studies: many studies rely almost exclusively on analyses of cross-sectional data where volunteering and its hypothesized impact have been measured simultaneously. Although these studies provide valuable empirical evidence that is an important link in a chain of causal reasoning, in many of these studies, the causal relationships often have been assumed rather than demonstratedâin important part, because of the absence of data enabling the use of adequate methods for demonstrating the causal relationships."

In sum, this includes both arguments for an increase of social capital, as well as a decline. However, the unidirectional perspective of how a changing media environment influences social structures is short sighted in that it is rather a mutual dependency. It is likely that the social context also has an influence on media use and media-related communication. Based on these lines of reasoning, we developed five research questions to investigate the figurations of networked media collectivities and tested them based on networks of four German school grades encompassing 335 students. The research questions address the three defining features of a communicative figuration: the communicative practices, the frames of relevance and the constellation of actors. RQ1 concerned the communicative practices of todayâs adolescents. Our results show that the instant messaging service Whatsapp is used nearly every day by most of the participants. Whatsapp and related issues were also the topic adolescents talked most about in person. YouTube, TV, Instagram, Facebook and video games were both less used and talked about. Based on these data, it was also tested whether frequencies of mass media use and interpersonal communication about these contents are correlated with each other and therefore define a frame of relevance for adolescents (RQ2). The respective results show that media use and media-related communication are strongly correlated on the level of the various media types. Hence, this supports the general idea that media use provides sources for interpersonal communication. Finally, we addressed the actor constellation of the communicative figuration by analyzing the friendship networks and the networks of interpersonal communication about TV, YouTube and gaming (RQ3), the structural correlation among the communication networks (RQ4) and their correlation with the friendship network (RQ5). The friendship network hereby serves as a proxy for social capital. The respective results show that media in fact seem to serve as a resource to create and maintain social ties, since people with a similar intensity of media use are more likely to communicate about the respective media compared to dissimilar others. This is also supported by the findings regarding the positive structural correlation between the different networks (RQ4). This finding supports our assumption that the figuration of networked media collectivities should be"
141,2,0.987,Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems: Foundations â A Conceptual Model and Some Derivations: The AMADEOS Legacy,"Next, a rich conceptual model of generic systems-of-systems, divided into ten viewpoints, is developed. The conceptual model is supported by a SySML proï¬le, covering the ten viewpoints. Especially interesting and innovative parts are the representation and use of time in the SoS time package and the handling of emergence in the SoS emergence package. As additional material, a three-level architecture description framework for generic systems-of-systems â again well implementing the ten viewpoints â is presented, which can be used in a commercially available graphical tool. This part greatly helps the understanding of systems-of-systems development and documentation. One of the very strong points of this book is the presentation of time and synchronized timing in systems-of-systems. This aspect has not been covered with sufï¬cient theoretical rigor in the existing literature. Topics are global time base and resilient clocks â presenting both innovative research and an excellent tutorial. Many systems-of-systems are not static, but must adapt to changing requirements, be it changing business requirements or in response to changing environmental or operational parameters of the constituent systems. Timely adaptation of systems-of-systems requires a property that is called dynamicity. A theory â based on autonomic computing â and implementation patterns for coping with dynamicity are presented. This volume is on a research and technology level and throughout the book, interesting and illustrative examples can be found. The book grew out of a sequence of EU-funded projects of which the described project AMADEOS was the culmination. Most of the book shows an admirable maturity, both of the material and the presentation, and is certainly a source of much more fruitful research. I wish the reader as much satisfaction in reading this rewarding book as the authors had during writing it! September 2016"
192,337,0.987,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Solar quite convincingly explains how, as a young researcher, Michael Beard had been an isolated, introverted, highly committed, hyper-individual quantum physicist. As an ageing scientist, however, his situation has completely changed. A new arena of âconverging researchâ has emerged, in the intermediate zone between nano-technology, photovoltaics and climate politics. From the 1950s onwards, physicists (with their high-tech contrivances and advanced mathematics) migrated towards the life sciences, employing their powerful physical technologies to understand and mimic the basic processes of life. Artificial photosynthesis, as a sub-field of biomimesis (i.e. the use of biotechnology to mimic living nature on the molecular level), is an exemplification of this trend. Thus, the epistemological backdrop of the narrative is a transformation that is actually taking place in laboratories world-wide, where biotechnology is evolving into bio-mimesis, i.e. mimicking (âcopy-pastingâ) nature on a molecular scale (Church and Regis 2012; Zwart et al. 2015; Blok and Gremmen 2016). In principle, this biomimetic turn entails a positive ambition. The aim is to develop technologies which, although highly advanced, are nonetheless more sustainable and naturefriendly than the technologies which humankind managed to produce so far. Indeed, artificial photosynthesis basically aims to see plant leaves as biological factories from which human technology still has a lot to learn in terms of efficiency, sustainability and circularity. Nature is the paradigm, the teacher (natura artis magistra) for molecular life scientists and bioengineers, notably on the quantum or nanoscale. The down-side is that there is a lot of investment, prestige and politics involved in this type of research, so that it runs the risk of becoming tainted by privatisation, commercialisation and politicisation. This transformation (presented in Solar as an emerging scientific-industrial ârevolutionâ, p. 36, p. 211, p. 336; as a ânew chapter in the history of industrial civilisationâ, p. 293) is quite credibly reflected in the novel, and it is clear that author Ian McEwan has conducted a considerable amount of preparatory research.1 Although Beard is said to hold âan irrational prejudice against physicists who defected to biology, SchrÃ¶dinger, Crick and the likeâ (p. 121), he basically follows in their footsteps, moving from âpureâ quantum physics2 to âappliedâ molecular life sciences research. Yet, the most dramatic discontinuity in his career is not the shift from basic physics (studying photons and electrons) to biomimesis, but from original research"
247,23,0.987,Humanities World Report 2015,"the training humanities scholars provide to their students, who go into the job market across a wide range of professions. Contribution to other disciplines: humanities research feeds into other fields, most obviously the social sciences, but also into medicine, computer science and engineering/design. Innovation: the humanities deal with questions of motivation, organisation and action, which are essential components of creativity and entrepreneurship, and so the humanities promote a culture of innovation. Critical thinking: it is of the essence of the humanities to develop critical thinking. This is epitomised by the Socratic tradition in philosophy, but by no means confined to that discipline. Personal and spiritual development: humanities research can enhance oneâs personal and spiritual wellbeing through the study of different texts and traditions â religious, philosophical or spiritual. Aesthetic appreciation: literary research, art history and musicology promote aesthetic discrimination, enhancing the appreciation and enjoyment of artistic works. We argue that this list represents a plausible taxonomy of the most prominent attempts to articulate the value of the humanities around the world. It is, of course, possible to classify the value of the humanities at different levels of generality. At the very general end of the spectrum one hears claims such as âthe humanities make us humanâ. At the other extreme one might take examples from a particular discipline that have led to some benefit or other, e.g. philosophical research in bioethics. But we think that dividing the terrain at an intermediate level of specificity (as above) will bring clarity to a topic often marked by excessive abstraction and hyperbole. Our purpose is not to advocate any of the values in particular; it is to describe and analyse them and to offer some critical reflections. We also wish to show how support for these values is weighted differently around the world. The list is based on research from a number of different sources:"
277,554,0.987,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"17.2.2 Knowledge Utilisation The empirical cases brought together in this book all draw on Boswellâs distinction between instrumental and symbolic modes of knowledge utilisation (Boswell 2009; see also Chap. 2 in this book). Instrumental knowledge utilisation refers to the use of knowledge directly in order to rationally adjust policy outputs, as is assumed in the term âevidence-based policymakingâ. This function of knowledge is found regularly in different phases of the policy cycle: either at the stage of conceptualising and framing new policies, or, more often, in developing concrete instruments for existing policies and in monitoring and evaluating policy action. In recent years, this instrumental and evaluative use of research has become clearly visible at the EU level. This may be to compensate for the fact that the European Commission has only limited competences in this policy area, so that its credibility depends on its ability to mobilise relevant knowledge and instruments. The same phenomenon may be observed at the local level, where a systematic exchange of experience and good practice in using policy instruments has become a major element of knowledge utilisation. Nevertheless, the other mode distinguished by Boswell, symbolic knowledge utilisation, appears to have gained in importance. This refers to more indirect ways of using knowledge, either in substantiating already-decided policy choices or in legitimising policy actors. The chapters on countries that do have a longer policy tradition in the field of migrant integration confirm such symbolic use of knowledge. This becomes evident, for example, in the selective use of research-policy dialogue structures and their products by policy actors, as a good number of governmentinitiated expert commissions have experienced (see also Boswell and Hunter 2014). Such specific use of knowledge can be facilitated by specific structures that produce knowledge, for example within ministries that set up their own in-house research departments. Local authorities may do the same. Some of the contributions to this book suggest that we should go beyond Boswellâs conceptualisation, for two reasons. First, Boswellâs distinction between instrumental and symbolic use of knowledge suggests that these two exclude each other. In reality, however, the same input of knowledge may have an instrumental and a symbolic function at the same time, or such input may have a symbolic function initially, and later become instrumental as well. This has been observed in the analysis of several consultative expert commissions in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Secondly, Boswellâs dichotomy seems to exclude a situation where no use at all is being made of knowledge, even if it is produced at the request of policymakers and funded by them. In her chapter on Austria Borkert observes the phenomenon"
165,350,0.987,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"The previous chapter established that the difference of means framework for measuring segregation makes it possible to investigate segregation in a single city using individual-level models of residential attainment. The discussion in this chapter reviews how this approach can be extended to investigate ecological (i.e., aggregatelevel) variation in segregation across cities and over time using multi-level models of individual residential attainments. The key is that ecological variation in segregation can be investigated by assessing how the effect of race on segregation-relevant individual residential outcomes is conditioned by time and/or city characteristics. A central advantage of this approach is that it permits researchers to also include relevant non-racial social and economic characteristics in the micro-model. This allows effects of community characteristics to be estimated at the âzero orderâ level or ânetâ of controls for non-racial factors. It also can help overcome the risk of errors of inference that are likely to occur in aggregate-level analyses that attempt to control for relevant individual-level social and economic characteristics using aggregate-level indicators of group disparity on these variables."
87,155,0.987,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","The circulation media used are oral communication in meetings, written documents, maps, images or calculations produced by the participants. The use of these media can be very demanding for some, who âin their worldsâ apply different media or media in a different way. Due to the diversity of viewpoints and ways to use media, there is a considerable chance that communication might fail. Project participants may not understand each other and get frustrated or conflicts may evolve. This interpretation of a transdisciplinary project gives some hints, what kind of issues should be addressed and how results should look like. Firstly, the group has to acknowledge and accept the differences. The process is about understanding the diversity of viewpoints, knowledges, languages and motivations. After the project, everybody will return to his or her own world and must live with the outcomes. Thus, solutions must be designed in ways that they create connectivity between formerly separated worlds, without changing (too much) the worlds (business people will continue to seek for profit, academics for higher reputation and policymakers for voters) (cf. Sect. 4.4). Summarising, it can be concluded that systems theory is a powerful and extremely productive conceptual approach in the sense that it set manifold impulses for the creation of linkages and the integration of knowledge among various disciplines and groups of professional actors. Hence, systems theory is considered as a key ingredient. Systems-theory-based conceptual frameworks can provide a solid basis to interand transdisciplinary research. In the next section, we demonstrate how system concepts are applied in interdisciplinary research practice, making use of two prominent examples."
185,126,0.987,The Essence of Software Engineering,"To summarize the general rules and principles illustrated here: Essence distinguishes between elements of health and progress versus elements of documentation. The former is known as alphas while the latter is known as work products. Each alpha has a lifecycle moving from one alpha state to another. Work products are the tangible things that describe an alpha and give evidence to its alpha states; they are what practitioners produce when conducting software engineering activities, such as requirement specifications, design models, code, and so on. An Activity is required to achieve anything, including progressing Alphas and producing or updating a Work Product. Activity spaces organize activities. To conduct an activity requires specific Competencies. Patterns are solutions to typical problems. An example of a pattern is a role, which is a solution to the problem of outlining work responsibilities. (continued)"
3,132,0.987,Instructional Scaffolding in STEM Education : Strategies and Efficacy Evidence,"the transformation of education from a didactic process of information transfer to one of construction of knowledge. In this chapter, to provide context and to help the reader understand the seeming dichotomy of learning goals of scaffolding, I first situate scaffolding relative to the calls for the enhancement of content knowledge and higher-order thinking skills in the NGSS (Achieve, 2013; Krajcik, Codere, Dahsah, Bayer, & Mun, 2014; National Science Board, 2010) and the Common Core State Standards (McLaughlin & Overturf, 2012; National Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council of Chief State School Officers, 2010). Second, I expand on the intended learning outcomes of scaffolding. Variation in intended learning outcomes of scaffolding largely aligns with differences in the theoretical underpinnings of scaffolding, which were discussed in Chap. 2: âInstructional Scaffolding: Foundations and Evolving Definition.â I also explore if the effectiveness of scaffolding varies according to intended learning outcome, as informed by the meta-analysis results. Just as it is important to consider intended learning outcomes, it is also important to consider how learning is assessed (Belland, 2012; Belland, French, & Ertmer, 2009; Furtak & Ruiz-Primo, 2008; Messick, 1989). Indeed, one is often advised to consider assessment before even designing objectives and instructional materials/strategies (GagnÃ©, 1965; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). By considering how scaffoldingâs influence on cognitive outcomes varies according to how it is assessedâat the concept, principles, or application level (Sugrue, 1995)âone can see if scaffolding as a whole delivers stronger impacts on content learning or various types of higher-order thinking skills. It is important to consider this alongside the intended learning outcome, as (a) just because an intervention is designed to increase content learning or higherorder skills does not necessarily mean that it does, and (b) just because scholars claim that scaffolding is intended to help students enhance their skill in a particular area does not always mean that the learning is being assessed at that level. In this chapter, I discuss these ideas, and present meta-analysis results comparing scaffoldingâs impact according to intended learning outcome and assessment levels."

As of this writing, the Dempster et al. (1977) article had more than 45,000 citations in Google Scholar. Also falling under causal inference was Rubinâs work on matching. Matching was developed to reduce bias in causal inferences using data from nonrandomized studies. Rubinâs (1974b, 1976a, b, c, 1979) work was central to evaluating and improving this methodology. Besides landmark contributions to causal inference, continued development of IRT was taking place. Apart from another host of papers by Lord (1970, 1973, 1974a, b, 1975a, b, 1977), several applications of IRT were studied, including for linking test forms (Marco 1977; see also Carlson and von Davier, Chap. 5, this volume). In addition, visiting scholars made seminal contributions as well. Among these contributions were ones on testing the Rasch model as well as on bias in estimates (Andersen 1972, 1973), ideas later generalized by scholars elsewhere (Haberman 1977). Finally, this period saw Karl JÃ¶reskog and colleagues implement confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the LISREL computer program (JÃ¶reskog and van Thillo 1972) and generalize CFA for the analysis of covariance structures (JÃ¶reskog 1970), path analysis (Werts et al. 1973), simultaneous factor analysis in several populations (JÃ¶reskog 1971), and the measurement of growth (Werts et al. 1972). Their inventions, particularly LISREL, continue to be used throughout the social sciences within the general framework of structural equation modeling to pose and evaluate psychometric, psychological, sociological, and econometric theories and the hypotheses they generate."

Theoretical and contextual considerations impact, then, on how elements of teaching and learning are realised. Acknowledging this allows the identification of a number of learning models: assessment for learning, observation, coaching, goal-clarification, mentoring, peer learning, simulation, instruction, concept-formation, reflection, metacognitive learning, problem solving, and practice. And each of these in turn is underpinned by a particular theory of learning. What this means is that any model of learning that is employed is constructed in relation"
170,14,0.987,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"influence on the broader practices and policies of the day, a view echoed by others (Elder et al. 2013). One conclusion was that the âSIRCA programme is moving towards a roadmap for navigating the tortuous route from research to impact via practiceâ (Harris and Chib 2012, p. 9). The attempt to improve methodological rigour via programme activities and mentoring nonetheless left us short of demonstrable compelling evidence of socio-economic impacts, despite providing a range of lessons and research findings shared with the broader community, i.e., academic impact. A key barrier in bridging these two sets of impact, i.e., socio-economic and academic, identified by Harris and Chib (2012) was in the differential processes, skill sets and motivations required of researchers trained in academic investigation. A series of measures were proposed, including greater engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, development of fresh skill sets, a reorientation of internal systems and incentives and production of a different range of outputs. While I recognise the inherent contradiction of reporting on the impact of ICTs on broad measures of development in yet another (hardly a different output) academic publication, this volume is nevertheless a result of the exhortations to ourselves in the previous avatar of the programme. The SIRCA II (the Strengthening Information Society Research Capacity Alliance) programme was born in 2011, continuing research capacity-building efforts focused on the information society with an expanded global scope, establishing connections between African, Asian and Latin American researchers. The mentorship model evolved from the original hierarchical knowledge delivery model to emphasise the aspect of bidirectional collaborative learning and experience-sharing for both established and emerging researchers. Finally, to manage the complexities of a programme with global reach, SiRC partnered with the University of Western Cape (UWC),1 South Africa, and Instituto de Estudios Peruanos (Institute of Peruvian Studies-IEP), Peru, allowing collaboration with my co-editors, Julian May and Roxana Barrantes, based at these respective institutions."
331,30,0.987,"The Economics of The Audiovisual industry : Financing Tv, Film and Web","The perimeter of cultural industry The need to measure the impact of cultural production, both in terms of social dimensions and economic nature, has persuaded academics to explore the taxonomic features of cultural sectors. Prior to every kind of analysis, it is necessary to identify those sectors and activities to include in the perimeter of cultural industry. Theories based on the economic value, in particular those connected to the âinstitutional valueâ, do not exclude cultural aspects; however, they link the âintrinsic valueâ to the conception of creativity, including in the perimeter of cultural industry, both cultural and macroeconomic features. Consequently, a fundamental difference between the European and the American approach must be stressed: while the first one is focused on the creative industry, the second one concentrates on the creativity of single employees. The evolution of the interpretation guided both approaches to the achievement of an expanded vision of cultural industryâs perimeter. According to the European approach, the perspective is based on the evidence that products fulfilling primary functions can contain elements of creativity. The American perspective is based upon the idea that creative professionals work also in other industrial sectors, not necessarily included in cultural industry. In both approaches, anyway, creativity is linked to the construct of intellectual property. This overview is synthesized in the definition of creative industry provided by the UK Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) in 1998: creative industries âhave their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual propertyâ. Whichever is the aspect we are focussing on, the importance of the industry, or the role of employees, the creativity rate of a product is defined â mainly â as the ability of the product itself to be the outcome and to represent the expression of the originality, talent and technique of its creator. This does not depend on the economic value; nonetheless, the economic exploitation of the product does not prevent the presence of a creative feature. The originality of this approach is based upon its ability to combine cultural and economic value. It is possible owing to the conception of creativity. Every product characterized by a creative feature, even with primary functions and having an economic value, can be considered as a cultural product; therefore, the productive sector it belongs to is the cultural one. This explains how, and why, along with sectors historically considered to"
232,263,0.987,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"For the researcher, the value of the cultural object lies in its symbolic speciï¬city. By highlighting what is âbuiltâ, the object creates a synergy between cultural references. Its analysis makes it possible to access social representations in ways that do not involve interviews or surveys. The object has a dual role, notably in terms of structuring day-to-day conversationâobjects feed discursive dynamics and stimulate the production of new representations. Regarding the nuclear industry, the production and circulation of content is a battleground that the groups involved in the controversy must conquer. While the use of military terminology may seem excessive, it is not possible to orient decisions and actions without ï¬rst changing the representations that are associated with them. Therefore, how the sector is represented can, depending on the societal context, become a fundamental issue in drawing up energy policy. Content analysis, however, should not be at the expense of a more aesthetic approach to representations. The iconic and narrative dimension of the object (through the formalization of content), is a major contributor to the constitution of knowledge and understanding the world. Furthermore, the study of forms (in the broadest sense), is useful in identifying which of the elements created by an event lead to rupture or continuity in the representation of reality. In this respect, French documentaries about Fukushima constitute a coherent corpus that can be used to analyze the impact of the disaster on representations."
99,292,0.987,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Finally, many governance concepts still imply a central role for decision-making by powerful elites. Yet, if top-down and bottom-up initiatives are to be reconciled, public policies should be less about imposing change and more about preparing it through experiments and pilots. These should be designed to learn from social competences, accumulated through the change makers that have invented and carried them through (Then and Mildenberger 2014). In the debates on the persistence of hierarchy (Lynn 2011) and new forms of governance that are sensible for this challenge, some have labelled such an approach âdemocratic experimentalismâ (Sabel 2012). Nudging change and preparing reform in this manner should be higher on the policy agenda. These critical remarks point towards the conclusions of the second part of this chapter, which discussed how social innovations change once they become part of a local welfare system and spread from one place to another. Specifically, it focused on how diffusion of social innovations in local welfare is qualitatively distinct from the diffusion of other types of innovations. Typical of social innovations is their strong link to specific contexts. Exactly because they evolve within social relationships and rely upon the collaboration of various different actors, they are relatively hard to transplant from one context to another. Furthermore, those who invented a new local social innovation are often not primarily interested in diffusion since they were originally motivated to solve a local problem. This is a fundamental difference with innovations in a business context because there the objective is to spread products as far and wide as possible. The process of winning importance also appears to be different from the marketing of innovative products and purposeful mainstreaming by policymakers and administrators. Theoretically, one would expect the bottleneck in social innovation in a complex field such as welfare to be flaws in adaptation processes, but this does not appear to be the case in practice (as compared, for instance, to the diffusion of governmental innovations). One possible explanation is that social innovations tend to have a strong bottom-up element that allows them to evolve organically, with large contributions from local people and voluntary organisations. This is part of a transformative process prior to the adoption of an innovation that changes local social relations, for instance, by giving the voluntary sector a greater role in shaping local services. The actual innovation is just the final stage of this process and not necessarily the most important part of it. The findings point towards a bias in the research on diffusion. It tends to emphasise the adoption of an innovation, failing to cover the process of transformation in social relations that occur ahead of adoption. By implication, it overstates the role of organisations involved in the direct transfer of innovations (particularly professional networks) and underestimates the role of actors involved in the wider process of local transformation, including citizens and voluntary organisations. Arguably, the cumulative effect of small initiatives is of far greater importance to society than the few examples that achieve wider and more visible impact. In any case, research on social innovation should not restrict its focus on success (in the sense of being taken up and mainstreamed). Where social innovations survive in more difficult environments, their impact on mainstream welfare is more indirectâ as one element in a cultural turn that may be quietly successful in the long run, even if many innovations fail at the first attempt."

Implicit in many ethical approaches to technology, and especially regarding invasive technologies like ICTs, after all, is the model of a struggle between humans and technologies (see also Verbeek 2013).

264,132,0.987,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"published a topical survey (Cai, Mok, Reddy, & Stacey, 2016) that provides further detail on the issues raised in this chapter. Here, we have summarized four lessons that international comparative studies provide for improving studentsâ learning, and we suggest directions for future work to expand the scope of research and build up capacity in international comparative studies. In the past several decades many international comparative studies of mathematics have been conducted, ï¬rst to examine differences in mathematical proï¬ciency and later to examine dispositions among students from different countries and understand the influence of factors such as curriculum, teacher preparation, the nature of classroom instruction, home and school resources, and context, including parental involvement and the organizational structure of education. We use the phrase âinternational comparative studiesâ to refer to studies involving at least two countries (using âcountryâ loosely to include signiï¬cant parts of countries), with the intention of making comparisons at the country level. Other names in the literature include cross-national and cross-cultural studies. We include in our deï¬nition studies that are small and large, qualitative and quantitative, and initiatives of government or individual researchers. With this deï¬nition, we see international comparative studies in mathematics evolving from informal observations to rigorous measurement of the outcomes of schooling, and from the examination of factors that contribute to performance differences to the generation and testing of theories and policies. Current international comparative studies range from small-scale studies involving a few classes with in-depth analyses to large-scale studies like TEDS (M), TIMSS, and PISA that have upwards of half a million participants and multiple measured variables. International comparative studies in mathematics have provided a large body of knowledge about how students do mathematics in the context of the worldâs varied educational institutions. In addition, they examine the cultural and educational factors that influence the learning of mathematics and help identify effective aspects of educational practice in homes, classrooms, schools, and school systems. Examining the learning of mathematics in other countries helps researchers, educators, and government policymakers to understand how mathematics is taught by teachers and how it is learned and performed by students in different countries. It also helps them reflect on theories, practices, and organizational support for the teaching and learning of mathematics in their own culture. Stigler, Gallimore, and Hiebert (2000), themselves researchers conducting international studies, explain the value of this research on trends over time and context in a more nuanced way: We may be blind to some of the most signiï¬cant features that characterize teaching in our own culture because we take them for granted as the way things are and ought to be. Cross-cultural comparison is a powerful way to unveil unnoticed but ubiquitous practices. (pp. 86â87)"
223,66,0.987,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Regionalizations and Regions of Meaningful Geographical Realities The programmatic research areas concerning meaningful geographical realities are derived from the three already mentioned types of action theories: instrumentally rational, normative, and meaning oriented. Depending on research interests, empirical investigations might focus on socioeconomic aspects (consumptive-productive types of world incorporation), sociopolitical aspects (political-normative types of world incorporation), or sociocultural aspects (informative-significative types of world incorporation). Everyday actions feature all three dimensions simultaneously. In addition, each of these dimensions is interpreted differently by different subjects; that is, it is idiosyncratically relevant to oneâs actions (see Table 2.2). Therefore, geography turns into everyday geographies. Research on the economic type of world incorporation revolves around three main questions: (a) How do producers bring under their control the raw material used in the production process and the labor force? In other words, how do they relate to the world (or bind the world to themselves)? (b) How do consumers decide what to buy? That is, under which conditions and with which medium or resources do they make which decisions? (c) What is the relationship between the productive and consumptive types of world incorporation? Production-related types of world incorporation involve, first, deciding on a site or location at which to produce. Such decisions are typically made by drawing on the locational focus of production-related activities and commodity flows that are directly mediated by the body. Decisions on where to produce and on the corresponding arrangements generated as a result of such decisions are elements of economic world incorporation. They are always tied to allocative resources and the notion of metric space. The analytical lens of world incorporation (everyday actions yielding multiple everyday geographies) enables one to describe systematically the establishing of global relations pertaining to productive types of world incorporation, especially in times of digital or virtual capitalism, when capital accumulation no longer requires activities involving the body or other matter. In addition, the perspective of world incorporation makes it possible to analyze the varying capabilities of control over resources, material goods, means of production, and the resulting power and power relations.

Even so, little is known about the ecological effects of microplastics within freshwaters [10]. For example, while microplastic-associated microbial (bacterial, archaeal, and picoeukaryotic) assemblages are likely to profoundly influence the distribution, impacts, and fate of these pollutants, research into this topic has focused on marine environments [11â13]. In streams and other habitats, biofilms1 are primary sites for carbon and nutrient transformations and form the base of food webs, contributing to local and global ecosystem functioning [14]. As they are also essential to pollutant biodegradation, an improved knowledge of microbial-microplastic interactions is required to predict the environmental impacts of plastic debris [15]. Investigating this topic could inform the development of solutions to manage plastic pollution by determining how it affects processes including microbially mediated primary production and interactions between plastic-associated (âplastisphereâ) taxa and other organisms [11, 12, 16, 17]. It could also lead to insights concerning the biodegradability of plastic litter and facilitate the development of new approaches to plastic disposal and/or recycling [18]. Freshwater and marine habitats share a number of features, but there are also differences between them that may affect the development and activities of plastisphere consortia. To facilitate investigation of this topic, findings based on marine plastisphere research are compared with those available for freshwaters. Following an assessment of recent discoveries concerning the formation and distribution of plastic-associated biofilms, our knowledge concerning their ecological roles and ability to drive processes including polymer biodegradation is considered. Finally, some of the main knowledge gaps in plastisphere research are discussed and used to highlight methodological advances in microbial ecology that could be used to improve our understanding of microbial-microplastic interactions."
216,311,0.987,Advances in Production Technology,"15.1 Introduction The design and operation of product development processes are typical problems in engineering domains and quality management. In order to guarantee the efï¬cient and effective realization of products various methods and tools have been developed and established in the past. Nevertheless these methods where usually designed to ï¬t engineer-to-cost strategies for cost efï¬cient products. Recent success stories of companies in different industrial sectors have proven, that engineer-to-value strategies can lead to an even higher proï¬tability of products due to higher margins when combining value and cost orientation (ISO/IEC: 15288:2008; Schuh 2012). The two levers for engineer-to-value product management are illustrated in Fig. 15.1. One of the major key elements for a successful introduction of engineer-to-value product management is the introduction and consideration of human factors. Therefore the integration of the customer in product development processes and the detailed analysis of the customer perception are essential (Brecher et al. 2014). The aspects concerning the role of customers in the product development will be presented in the ï¬rst and second chapter of this paper. The third chapter will change the focus on the company perspective and will discuss new approaches and possible solutions how to develop products in a more efï¬cient and human oriented way."

171,55,0.987,Global Business Strategy : Multinational Corporations Venturing into Emerging Markets,"This book is a summary of theoretical ideas and case studies for corporations in developed countries, including Japan, for designing strategies to maximize opportunities and minimize threats in business expansion into demerging countries. The case studies featured here focus on Asia, including China and India, and use examples of Japanese manufacturers. The examples from China and India are used because of their geographical proximity to Japan and the importance of these two countries in the twenty first century as economic powerhouses in the world economy. However, the theories on global business strategy within this book are, of course, useful when considering business in other developing areas such as Russia, Eastern Europe, or Central and South America. Japanese companies were used as a starting point to acknowledge how Japanese global corporations, which had conquered the global high-tech product market, should meet the challenges of a new era in developing countries. As stated previously, we have stretched the limits of a product model in which âhigh-quality products sell,â with one solution to this problem being strategic concepts based on service models (i.e., a customer value model). Accordingly, this book contemplates manufacturers in developed countries with relatively high levels of technology. Our main objective is to provide suggestions about requisite technological capability and technology management strategy to respond to the expansion of new markets and the rise of companies in developing countries. This book deals with macro issues when considering global strategies at a company-wide level. Thus, more practical issues such as the optimum solution to labor issues in China and India or transfer pricing for ROI in local markets are not covered here. However, important issues that develop when pursuing global business are touched upon as much as possible within the case studies to provide a âboots-on-the-groundâ perspective. This book is divided into two sections: the first half deals with global business strategy and the second discusses the fundamentals of strategic planning. Chapter 2 provides an overview of corporate strategy theories and proposes a framework to deepen the understanding of global strategy that acknowledges national barriers. Chapter 3 gives an overview of world economic environment and its long term transition. It is shown that developed country centered world in 1990s becomes to be a divided world between developed and developing economies in 2030. Chapter 4 focuses on the contrasting examples of China and India and examines the strategies"

SETSâs are created, ordered and stabilized through human decision-making and (often) conscious creation of regime structures. Searching for more efï¬cient technologies and more effective economic incentives is not enough when looking for sustainability solutions. It is the institutional setups and sociocultural frameworks that deï¬ne the purpose for which technologies and economic instruments are used. Here is where we ï¬nd the root causes of trends. Incentives and technologies mostly function as accelerating or balancing feedback, but not in themselves as game changers. This is why the multi-phase concept as I posit it here gives the sociocultural anchoring of alternative proposals and pioneering solutions a crucial role in all phases of transformation. In the amended MLP it is the purple and blue arrows that make the link. They indicate how mind-sets mediate between agents and structures and how the dominant paradigm functions as a reference framework for justiï¬cations and narratives of change. The big arrow on the right hand side of the graph also shows, however, that each individual is constantly involved in shaping the future paradigm. By providing reason, opinions, arguments and experiences as well as non-verbal reactions and behavior we can all participate in paradigm shifts and thus in changing reality. Polanyi demonstrated this link in his account of the Great Transformation. The classical economic paradigm played a crucial role in making todayâs default solution the growth-ï¬xated development path. This paradigm survived over two centuries of criticism by amending itself into a neoclassical version. But today its basic assumptions are challenged from so many angles and the institutional solutions and processes based on it deliver so many crises that the time is ripe to shift from diversiï¬ed irritation to unifying consolidation: which insights on human needs and natural resource reproduction in todayâs scientiï¬c debates could become the foundational ideas of a new development paradigm?

191,207,0.987,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Childrenâs Memory Development After children have disclosed the abuse, their memories of the event become very important if the case is going to court. Basic and applied research into childrenâs memory development has been crucial in helping police and social welfare workers to conduct better child investigative interviews. Different factors influence a childâs experience of an abusive event, and knowledge about how children encode, store and retrieve stressful events from the past is of vital importance (e.g. Lamb et al. 2011). Indeed, we all depend on our memory when we need to answer questions about experiences. Memory is believed to be a multiple system composed of encoding arrangements or subsystems, storage and information recovery (e.g. Baddeley et al. 2011; Tulving 1985). In the past two decades, there has been growing consensus that memory is not a unified ability but rather a set of dynamic, integrated systems (e.g. Squire 2004). The study of childrenâs memory and factors influencing childrenâs memory performance have been studied within a broad context in the past several years and is influenced by enhanced knowledge about cognitive maturity such as the development of language, perception, recognition and encoding (e.g. Lamb et al. 2011). Most theories distinguish between explicit and conscious memories, and memories not accessed by conscious recall (Goswami 2008). Autobiographical memory involves explicit memories of specific times and places in an individualâs past (Fivush 2011) and depends on several factors such as language ability, neural structures, socio-emotional components, attachment orientation and cognitive development (Bauer and Fivush 2010). Differences in autobiographical memory across age groups have an important impact on memory capacity in terms of the memory retrieval strategies"

Indeed, factors other than ânational culturesâ â in particular the character of political debate and the nature of the policy sector â appear to have more influence on the actual take-up of expert knowledge. The chapter draws on the three-way typology of the functions of knowledge to make sense of cultures of knowledge use in two organisations dealing with immigration and asylum policy: the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF â Bundesamt fuer Migration und Fluechtlinge); and the UK Home Office, especially its Borders and Immigration Agencu (previously the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, and now renamed the UK Border Agency). In Sect. 2.2, I provide a brief sketch of the two organisations, setting up a number of expectations about cultures of knowledge use. In Sects. 2.3 and 2.4, I explore whether these expectations are met through analysing patterns of knowledge use over the period 2000â2004."

Recent studies treating themes embedded in WID, WAD, and GAD suggest that elements of all three are useful for the question at hand (Chithtalath 2006). What might have been Boserupâs response? First and foremost, she was versed in both normal science and critical theory. While her professional lens was large, she remained firmly anchored in science and attempted to enlarge or expand economic analysis rather than replace its science base with alternative explanatory perspectives. Boserup explicitly recognized the role of societal structures in the development process. She differed from WAD and GAD positions, perhaps, in that she viewed structural change as taking place over the long term and as endogenous to the development process: âstructures change under the influence of other structures although they may be resistant to such changes for shorter or longer periods, and are changing only when the pressure is strong or persistentâ (Boserup 1999, p. 58). Boserup encouraged economic develop research to incorporate this broader and historical view, even providing a framework for it (Boserup 1996)."

This level of analysis has supported our ability to design very practical evidence-based interventions. This concept of bounded rationality (in the economic model) is perhaps far more relevant than the architects of these papers anticipated. One of the limitations of the papers, perhaps reï¬ecting the level of abstraction, is the lack of attention to conï¬ict and power: the possibility of multiple realities and parallel organisational cultures. Corruption is systemic in Uganda especially within the public sector; it can be described as a culture. It is pervasive and starts from the very top of organisations and the systems within which they are based and operates through powerful, organised syndicates. Health workers (and patients) are acutely aware of its existence, the personal beneï¬ts that derive from it and the profound risks associated with challenging it. It is interesting to note the reference by MuÃ±oz et al. to the entrepreneur as a âdestabilising agentâ (2011: 199). âDestabilisingâ in this context could imply creative disruption triggering innovation (in the right direction). Alternatively, or simultaneously, it could refer to the impact of corruption. This detailed (tacit and explicit) knowledge of how corruption works at every level and in every decision necessarily shapes both imagined realities and action plans. In this sense, there may be two parallel systems operating in marked tension with each other within a health facility or authority. Chapter 3 has discussed the impact of corruption on professional volunteers and their relationships with Uganda health workers identifying the dynamics of power and hierarchy (positionalities). None of the theories reviewed pays explicit attention to these dimensions of context. Interestingly it is often the lack of knowledge on the part of foreign agencies and individual volunteers rather than their superior clinical knowledge that limits impact and generates unintended consequences.23 Of course, corruption pollutes not only organisations but also the wider system that nurtures it, fundamentally weakening a sense of identity with the state at national or local level and also with âleadersâ (at every level). Whilst we can identify closely with the concept of âaction planningâ as a vehicle for the exercise of individual agency based on the recombination of disparate knowledges, we have some concerns that the emphasis in the material reviewed, perhaps reï¬ecting the business/private sector context, fails to explain inaction or stasis. Or, situations when human action, qua rational, as MuÃ±oz and Encinar (2014a: 75) put it, could amount to non-decisions or inaction. On a practical level, it may prove impossible to imagine returns on an investment (in training, for example,"

The research methodology also varies according to the discipline with which the contributors are familiar and their focus on more empirical or theoretical discussion. However, what permeates these diverse chapters is the firm conviction that dialog and negotiation are the key to providing a reconciliation process for the conflicts and confrontations resulting from co-mingling of those with various cultural and historical backgrounds. In order to provide a space in which the dialog and negotiation take place, mere tolerance towards other peoples with diverse cultures is not enough. Critical insight directed toward the concept of culture itself, which is often mistakenly assumed to be rigid and inflexible, is additionally required. It is questioning the assumption of stable cultural bases that enables us to propose what multiculturalism in the 21st century might mean not only to those who formulate migration and language policies, but also to those who reside in the Asia-Pacific region negotiating between conflict and coexistence in the circumstances of an increasingly globalizing world."

For example, if a proposal is advanced to dam a river to produce power, citizens need to be able to weigh the proposed benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore, they need to be able to judge the extent to which an arguerâs stakeholder position influences his/her biases, and by consequence, his/her claims and evidence advanced in support of his/her position. As part of this process, they need to be able to evaluate the credibility of evidence, something with which K-12 and college students often struggle (Britt et al., 2014; Nicolaidou et al., 2011). 4.2.1.4.2 Engaging in the Culture of STEM Key to helping students engage in the culture of STEM is helping them learn the iterative nature of STEM, as well as the importance of modeling, argumentation, and epistemology. 4.2.1.4.2.1 Iterative Nature of STEM Engaging students in the culture of STEM does not mean getting students to engage in the âscientific method,â as the latter is in fact heavily simplified (Abd-El-Khalick, 2012; Lawson, 2010; Tang, Coffey, Elby, & Levin, 2010). STEM professionals do not always start an investigation with a hypothesis, but often engage in an exploratory investigation to identify pertinent variables or to simply observe and describe a system (Franklin, 2005; Klahr & Simon, 1999; Lawson, 2010). For example, exploratory investigations helped scientists uncover the phenomenon of gene expression (Franklin, 2005). Such exploratory studies often do not involve a control condition, and yet they can lead to very important scientific discoveries, and guide further inquiry (Klahr & Simon, 1999). That is, they can indicate and lead to descriptions of important phenomena. As such observations accumulate, STEM professionals can begin to build theory to explain the phenomena. Further investigations can explore whether the new theory explains and predicts other instances of similar phenomena (Klahr & Simon, 1999; Lawson, 2010). This accumulation of studies along a line of inquiry does not proceed in a linear manner. Rather, it proceeds in fits and startsâin a very iterative manner. Students should have the opportunity to experience the iterative nature of STEM (T. S. Kuhn, 1996; Lammi & Becker, 2013; Nersessian, 2008). The iterative nature holds at its core theory; theory drives the creation of problem representations (modeling; described below), the design and conduct of investigations to understand problems further, the creation of claims, and backing claims with evidence (argumentation; described below) (Giere, 1990; Klahr & Simon, 1999; Nersessian, 2008). The initial model of a problem situation will necessarily be idealized; it can be improved through such processes as establishing limiting cases (Nersessian, 2008), reacting to phenomena that cannot be sufficiently explained through existing theory (Klahr & Simon, 1999) and engaging with other STEM professionals who often apply different perspectives to problems (Giere, 1990). Not all citizens will engage in the entire process of model-building, but they need to understand the process such that they can engage in authentic scientific discourses centered on locally relevant scientific problems (KolstÃ¸, 2001; Sadler et al., 2007)."
16,366,0.987,"Autonomous Control For a Reliable internet of Services : Methods, Models, Approaches, Techniques, Algorithms, and Tools","In this sense, elasticity mechanisms automatize the process of reconfiguring virtualized resources, mostly at infrastructural levels, at runtime with the goal of sustaining offered Quality of Service (QoS) levels and optimizing resource cost. Due to its usefulness, there are many works that have addressed issues related to elasticity [23]. However, most of them discuss elasticity in specific environments, such as Cloud systems in centralized, large-scale data centers (e.g., [46]), edge/fog-based systems (e.g., [54]), network function virtualization (NFV) (e.g. [67]), except a few works that consider Internet of Things (IoT) Cloud systems, e.g., [70]. In this chapter, we investigate how distributed systems can be efficiently executed in the emerging context resulting from the convergence of IoT, NFV, edge systems, and Clouds. More precisely, our goal is to survey elasticity needs, mechanisms, and policies for geo-distributed systems running over multiple edge/fog1 and Cloud infrastructures. Furthermore, we present several design patterns that help to efficiently decentralize and coordinate the elasticity control of such systems. The main contributions of this chapter are the following: â We present how the emerging computing paradigms and technologies help to realize elastic systems, which can execute with guaranteed QoS even in face of changing running conditions. â We survey the key elasticity properties and techniques that have been presented so far in the related literature. Specifically, we survey the approaches that enable elasticity at different stages of the system life time, distinguishing between design-time and runtime. â Motivated by the scalability limitation of distributed complex systems, we propose different coordination patterns for decentralized elasticity control. The latter represent architectural design guidelines that help to oversee large scale systems with the aim to improve performance and reliability without compromising scalability. â We describe the main challenges of nowadays systems so to identify research directions that are worth of investigation, in order to develop seamlessly elastic systems that can operate over geo-distributed and Cloud-supported edge environments. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we provide an overview about elasticity. In Sect. 3 we briefly present the large-scale distributed systems we focus on in this chapter, that is systems of IoT, NFV and Clouds and discuss their elasticity coordination needs. In Sect. 4 we provide an overview of optimization approaches used to take elasticity choices. In Sect. 5 we present some design patterns that can be used in distributed edge Cloud environments to coordinate elasticity decisions in a decentralized fashion. In Sect. 6 we discuss some research challenges for elasticity control. We conclude the chapter in Sect. 7 with some final remarks."

Describing the state of the art, Aiken (1970, p. 592) states, âThe major topics covered were: methods of measuring attitudes towards arithmetic and mathematics, the distribution and stability of mathematics attitudes, the effects of attitudes on achievement in mathematics, [and] the relationship of mathematics attitudes to ability and personal factors.â"

The success of the network clearly rests in the hands of all participants as well as the leadership. It is clear from the chapters that each project had a clear focus and goal that contributed to the success and helped to reveal potential areas of growth for PINGH members. As an organization designed to support multiple partners, it is clear that the structure encourages bilateral and multilateral programming to bring about informative and transformative changes to students, professionals, and most importantly to the global health community (see Fig. 8.1). When examining the overarching structure and role of PINGH, it is an organization that can fill multiple gaps in the academia and the global health network. By providing educators, students, and the community with a framework, PINGH places value on the role of global health. A structure that supports ideas fosters collaboration and stimulates new avenues for existing, and emerging scholars situates the complexity of global health and the importance of cooperation and connectedness in addressing some of lifeâs most challenging health issues. In light of this, what follow are a series of recommendations to continue to strengthen the existing partnerships of PINGH and develop more sustainable long term collaboration: â For data collection and collaborative efforts with multiple partners, a multipronged strategy should be pursued in which large-scale surveys could be conducted by several institutions, providing greater opportunities for students, agencies, and the community at large. The greatest promise lies in research that has a longitudinal structure and includes avenues for exploring resources ranging from regional data to national data that are amenable to community-level analyses. â Due to the importance of enhancing studentsâ learning and advancement, greater avenues should be created to include students in the inclusion of projects to enhance both technical and leadership skills. Based on the projects that included students, there should be greater structures put in place to support their academic and research development further supporting them with experiences that have value beyond the classroom. â The PINGH network should establish a technical team that assists the leadership team in further highlighting the global health research efforts.

Intertwined with the study of the ways in which these processes are engaged in are the two main mathematical content areas of generalized arithmetic (i.e., number/quantity, operations, properties) and functions. The monograph highlighted how the ï¬eld of early algebra has gradually come to be more clearly delineated since the early 2000s, bringing with it more comprehensive views and theoretical framings of algebraic thinking. Thus, the contents of the monograph set the stage for TSG 10 contributors to link their newest work to the advances of the fairly recent past, as well as to signal further evolution of the ï¬eld. One of the many interesting aspects to emerge during the four main sessions of the ICME-13 Topic Study Group 10 was the attention paid to the key notion of structure. For example, Blanton emphasized four essential practices that characterize early algebraic thinking: generalizing mathematical structure and relationships, representing mathematical structure and relationships, justifying mathematical structure and relationships, and reasoning with mathematical structure and relationships. Steinweg pointed to four key ideas of algebraic thinking: pattern structures, property structures, equivalence structures, and functional structures. Mason argued that looking at something structurally is an often-overlooked aspect of algebraic thinking and can be encouraged by offering a partial generalization or a very general statement and then giving students the opportunity to specialize. Malara illustrated how students can learn to gradually represent and express structural aspects of number in transparent, non-canonical ways, aided by collective confrontation in class. Carraher emphasized the affordances of the N-number line representationâa representation that is especially rich for helping young students focus on the structure of numbers and the relation between one number and its neighboring number. Structure is clearly one of the central pillars in the development of early algebraic thinking. Kaput (2008), one of the pioneers of the Early Algebra movement, included within his three main strands related to algebraic thinking: âalgebra as the study of structures and relations arising in arithmetic.â But, as some of the TSG 10 presenters argued, the work of noticing underlying structures is not necessarily straightforward. In the language of Radford (2011, p. 23), âthe awareness of these structures and their coordination entail a complex relationship between speech, forms of visualization and imagination, gesture, and activity on signs.â Furthermore, âthe mathematical work of teachers in pressing students, provoking, supporting, pointing, and attending with careâ (Bass & Ball, 2003, p. vii) is critical to the development of young studentsâ awareness of structure. As pointed out by Schifter in her TSG presentation, if teachers understand mathematics as procedures for calculating and solving problems, they must widen their view to include looking for and examining structure, and as well, according to Hunter in her TSG presentation, learn to recognize the inherent algebraic structure of number. While much of the pioneering work in early algebra has focused on the process of generalization, several TSG 10 presenters at ICME-13 pointed out that what it is that is generalized in much of early algebraic thinking and activity are the structural"
77,185,0.987,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Cultural (Health) Capital Theory Recent theoretical developments have aimed to underline the structural dimension of health and health care habits. A central element is the conceptualization of social position. Scholars have argued that in current post-industrial societies, stratification is not driven by social class alone (Clark and Lipset 2001). As a result of better labor conditions, increasing wages, and disposable time, consumption patterns have gained importance (Bogenhold 2001). Therefore, the explicit inclusion of cultural capital in explanatory approaches to social inequality in health and health behavior has been advocated, rather than deducing it from general measurements of socioeconomic status (SES), such as social class and income (Abel 2008; Abel and Frohlich 2012; Shim 2010). Bourdieu (1986) described how inequality could be reproduced by the interplay of three different forms of capital: economic, social, and cultural. He further identified three different forms of cultural capital: objectivized (e.g. books, artefacts, paintings), institutionalized (e.g. education, job title) and the embodied state incorporating mind and body (e.g. values, skills, knowledge). When applying Bourdieuâs (1986) general notion of cultural capital to health and health care research, what is termed cultural health capital can be defined as comprising âall culture-based resources that are available to people for acting in favour of their health. In its incorporated form it comprises health-related values, behavioural norms, knowledge and operational skillsâ (Abel 2008, p. 2). This form of cultural capital becomes directly relevant to health through the adoption of healthy lifestyles, such as engaging in preventive care (Abel 2008; Abel and Frohlich 2012; Phelan et al. 2004; Shim 2010). Analogous to life course research, a longer view of an individualâs life is taken when elaborating on how cultural health capital develops. It has been argued that the health-relevant knowledge and skills used to lead healthy lives start accumulating in childhood and this proceeds over the life course through repeated contacts with health care providers and lifelong socialization (Abel and Frohlich 2012; Mirowsky and Ross 2003; Shim 2010). Cultural health capital theory highlights that peopleâs behavioral options and preferences are structurally constrained and unequally distributed between social groups (Abel 2008)."

This is achieved via exploration of scientific research focused on the topic, either as a central object of enquiry or as part of wider investigations in which the issue is brought up as a relevant factor. Special attention is paid to the large-scale geographic variation of energy poverty in Europe, as well as the manner in which this diversity is subsequently reflected at the level of nations, regions and particular demographic groups. I also discuss the driving forces of energy poverty within particular spatial contexts; and in an effort to move beyond the traditional geographic focus of energy poverty researchâthe UK and Irelandâthe chapter first systematically overviews the development of a debate focusing on different parts of the European continent and its immediate neighbourhood. I then review evidence about patterns of energy poverty at a variety of spatial scales. Keywords Energy poverty â¢ Energy vulnerability â¢ Material deprivation â¢ Uneven development â¢ Europe"

Results of the study will be used to design Bhutanâs SLM strategies to achieve its 2020 Vision of Peace, Prosperity and Happiness of the Bhutanese people by enhancing their traditional values and improving their standard of living and environmental sustainability (RGoB 2002). Based on the economic analysis, the study would also identify priority investments with the highest economic beneï¬ts for the country. Furthermore, the analysis will allow the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) to mainstream SLM in its ï¬ve-year planâs programs and provide budgetary support on a priority basis. The next section summarizes Bhutanâs opportunities and challenges related to SLM. A brief discussion about the study background and approach is provided to set the stage for subsequent sections. This is followed by a discussion of Bhutanâs land cover change trends and major biophysical characteristics. Analysis of soil erosion using the SWAT model follows the Land Use Change section. Using data collected by the renewable natural resource (RNR) household survey conducted in 2009, the study then analyzes land management practices and the drivers of adoption of SLM practices. This is followed by the economic analysis of the SLM practices at a national level. The ï¬nal section concludes the study and gives policy implications."
271,145,0.987,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Taking into account both the deep embeddedness of hacker cultures in the evolution of computerized society and the concrete case of the Chaos Computer Club, it becomes clear that acting on media technologies and infrastructures entails a wide set of activities: it manifests itself not only in form of direct engagement with technical devices and systems, but also occurs through interaction with different actors, through articulating viewpoints, through sharing knowledge and experiences in different circumstances. As has been argued in this chapter, to understand the way the Club has gained recognition as a trustful actor that has something valuable to say about the role media technologies and infrastructures play in society, it is beneficial to investigate the communicative figurations within and surrounding the hacker organization. By investigating the constellation of actors, the frames of relevance and communicative practices, the chapter shows how the CCC thematizes media technologies and infrastructures as sites of an active political struggle in their own right. Doing so not only allows conceptualizing the relations between hacking and the communicative figuration within the Club as interlocking arrangements but also points towards a dynamic that has been described as a spiral of legitimation. This denotes the process through which the CCCâs engagement is acknowledged and stabilized (or denied and destabilized) over time. While the Clubâs current role as a trusted civil society organization strongly relates to internal figurations, it is likewise related to the public discourse surrounding media technologies and infrastructuresâ role as an ever more important part of the social world. By bringing these two dimensions together and by considering time as a critical component, it is possible to further understandings of organizational actorsâ ability to co-determine political arrangements."

Indeed, all across human history and geography, people have perceived, lived, used and explored marine resources in coastal lagoons and bays, estuaries and shores, which conducted to changes in those habitats and their natural populations. Consequently, coastal communities changed their values and perceptions of the sea, as well as their way of living and of using natural resources. Thus, advancing change within any civilization does not occur in a vacuum, but rather must evolve out of the given circumstances and discourses that prevail. For instance in western civilization, we cannot think of culture without considering the context in which products and goods are produced, mediated, and consumed over time. Thus, aquaculture as culture exists in relationship to broader societal discourses that evolve across different scales, from interpersonal and group relationships to mainstream media discourses (Bell-Jordan 2008; Fiske 1987; Rosteck and Frentz 2009). New aquaculture industries, especially in rural areas, should strive to integrate into the cultural fabric of the local community (Burbridge et al. 2001). This is paramount consideration, i.e. if an aquaculture industry develops successfully in a region or community that has previously been dominated by other types of industries, it can alter the very image of what the region, community and its inhabitants âisâ. This can be because the base economic activity has been a fundamental factor for the identity of the community and its inhabitants, be it ï¬sheries, tourism, agriculture or something else. It can be because aquaculture introduces new and very visible landscape elements, and a third possibility is that in-migration substantially alters the cultural mix in the community population. Furthermore, gender issues, like the opportunities for increased women participation and responsibility in the labor market through aquaculture development may gain more prominence. However, this seems to primarily have been an issue for developing countries (Veliu et al. 2009; Ndanga et al. 2013). How aquaculture development and planning processes are organized may also affect learning among and between stakeholder groups. Leach et al. (2013) examine qualities in aquaculture partnerships in the US that enhance knowledge acquisition and belief change, and these include procedural fairness, trustworthiness among participants, diverse participation and the level of scientiï¬c certainty. Their work also indicate that knowledge acquired through collaborative partnerships make the participants primed to change their opinions on science or policy issues.

42,79,0.987,S-BPM in the Production Industry : A Stakeholder Approach,"claim has passed through, typically being of relevance for involved stakeholders. The information modelâs attributes are ï¬lled with information elements over the life cycle time of the artefact. In Cohn et al.âs approach (2009), artefact instances can be generated in state-based way, as instances interact through message passing as they transition between states. The artefact-based business operation model is thus being termed actionable. Speciï¬cations can be used to automatically generate an executable system based on various, accumulated kinds of data corresponding to the stages in a business entityâs lifecycle. Clustering data based on a dynamic entity that moves through a businessâs operations is in contrast to decomposing business entities, as it avoids isolated data manipulations. Moreover, it facilitates the use of representations, as the authors state âit enables strong communication between a businessâs stakeholders in ways that traditional approaches do not. Experience has shown that once the key artefacts are identiï¬ed, even at a preliminary level, they become the basis of a stakeholder vocabulary. Artefacts enable communication along three dimensionsâ (Cohn and Hull 2009): â¢ Lifecycle dimension, as âstakeholders who focus on one part of a lifecycle are better equipped to communicate with stakeholders focused on another part. All are talking about the same overall artefact and can conï¬dently discuss attributes that are shared or produced in one part of the lifecycle and consumed in anotherâ (ibid.) â¢ Variationsâ dimension, as âstakeholders from multiple geographies could understand similarities and differences between their respective operations by comparing them to the commonly held artefact modelâ (ibid.) â¢ Management dimension: âCommunication between stakeholders at different management levels is enhanced because the artefact approach naturally lends itself to a hierarchical perspectiveâ (ibid) Hence, we can conclude that evolving element and relation categories are of beneï¬t for developing a stakeholder-oriented modelling and analysis approach (cf. also Salovaara and Tamminen 2009). The presented approach of Cohn and Hull (2009) may be mapped to S-BPM as follows: Data and their manipulation process map in S-BPM onto business objects and within certain subject behaviours. In S-BPM, there is not an overall deï¬ned data manipulation process, instead data may be changed by different subjects depending on the deï¬ned âcreate-read-update-deleteâ operations for the dedicated subject (operation). Finally, an S-BPM model deï¬nes the exchange sequence of data embodied in certain message exchanges."

170,118,0.987,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"2 Existing Frameworks to Analyse ICT4D Research ICT4D research has been under self-scrutiny since its inception. As a result, a variety of authors have focused on finding ways to conceptualise, find categories, and identify gaps in research. An overview of these existing categorisations and reviews reveals the underlying assumptions in ICT4D research. Walsham and Sahay (2006) want to make sense of the landscape of literature on ICTs and development categories that could also guide a future research agenda. Their study concludes that this area of research has matured since 2000 when their survey began in terms of theories, methodologies, and results. In the survey, they are able to classify research into four major foci of inquiry. The first line of work centres on the contribution of ICTs to development. Within this category is the work related to the link between technologies and economic and social development in specific countries or domains. The second line seeks to understand cross-cultural working through the use of ICTs. Articles in this category pinpoint the challenges of collaborating internationally and transferring technologies. A third category of work focuses on local adaptation of technologies. How this adaptation takes place, the role of globalisation, and the challenges faced by those who act as brokers in these processes are some of the questions which articles in this category respond to. Finally, the fourth category of research focuses on particular groups which they describe as those âoutside the margin of the digital divideâ or those that have the least contact with technology."

These barriers make it clear that a dedicated framework is required for the publication of research data. The conception and implementation of such a framework is being increasingly discussed under the Research Data Management term.10 The aim is to develop organisational and technical measures to ensure a trustworthy infrastructure for permanent integrity and re-use of data. The centre of attention hereby is the operation of information infrastructures, such as research data repositories, in which research data can be permanently stored. To make reuse of the stored data possible, the Research Data Management framework must ensure that the data are described via metadata. Documentation of the instruments and methods used to obtain the data is necessary for reliable re-use of the data, for example. Such an enhanced documentation of data is often a time-consuming task that is competing with many other activities on the researchers priority list. Further to this, in many disciplines there are no standards in which the data can be described. Recently, it can be observed that libraries, data centers and other institutions are increasingly collaborate and begin to build up information infrastructures to support scientists in the handling of their data and so also to promote Data Sharing (Pampel et al. 2010; Osswald and Strathmann 2012; Reilly 2012). Van der Graaf and Waaijers (2011) have formulated four central fields of action for the realization of a ââcollaborative data infrastructureââ which enables the ââuse, re-use and exploit research data to the maximum benefit of science and societyââ. Incentives must be given to stimulate Data Sharing (1); in addition, the education and training of scientists and service providers on and around the handling of data must be intensified (2). Further to these the authors point to the importance on the structuring and networking of research data infrastructures that serve for a permanent and reliable data storage (3) and point out the challenge of the long-term financing of these infrastructures (4)."
198,58,0.987,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"emissions can be measured through technical processes, there is no similar measurement for adaptation. No single indicator for adaptation will suffice. We argue that adaptation has at least three distinct dimensions: (1) changes in social and economic development that ensure that the outputs and outcomes are sustainable from a climate change perspective; (2) preparedness for and dealing with natural disasters that may increase in intensity due to climate change; (3) resilience of populations and societies to tackle unexpected changes in the natural environment that they are living in. The first dimension increasingly overlaps with mitigation action. While mitigation may be primarily directed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the micro-macro paradox establishes clearly that for these actions to be ultimately successful, systems need to change and become environmentally sustainable. This is the route towards durable emission reductions, and it is also the route towards increased adaptive capacity. For this reason we see an increasing use of the same transformative mechanisms for adaptation as for mitigation. Adaptation and mitigation are two different but linked dimensions in social, economic and environmental sustainability. Adaptation concerns the ways in which the social and economic domains are âreadyâ for change in the environmental domain, and includes resulting actions. Mitigation focuses on one particular way society and the economy use natural resources and aims to make this use environmentally sustainable. Adaptation perspectives in mitigation often are termed âclimate proofingâ of actions; ensuring that the mitigation interventions will be resilient against climate change. Both adaptation and mitigation ultimately require action that transforms the interaction between the social, economic and environmental domains. One of us argued that sustainability is fundamentally an adaptation issue (van den Berg 2014, p. 34â35): âachieving a sustainable balance among civil society, the economy and the environment will require constant adaptationâ. In this light we include some of the evaluative evidence on adaptation in our discussion of transformative action."

244,842,0.987,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","empirical challenge. We can have confidence in claims that have survived all serious challenges. To the extent that an alternate proposal is as plausible, or more plausible, than a proposed trait interpretation, we cannot have much confidence in the intended interpretation. This notion, which is a fundamental methodological precept in science (Popper 1965), underlies, for example, multitraitâmultimethod analyses (D. T. Campbell and Fiske 1959) and the assumption that reliability is a necessary condition for validity. As a result, to the extent that we can eliminate alternative interpretations of test scores, the proposed interpretation becomes more plausible, and if we can eliminate all plausible rivals for a proposed trait interpretation, we can accept that interpretation (at least for the time being). In most assessment contexts, the question is not whether an assessment measures the trait or some alternate variable but rather the extent to which the assessment measures the trait of interest and is not overly influenced by sources of irrelevant variance. In their efforts to develop measures of various traits, ETS researchers have examined many potential sources of irrelevant variance, including anxiety (French 1962; Powers 1988, 2001), response styles (Damarin and Messick 1965), coaching (Messick 1981b, 1982a; Messick and Jungeblut 1981), and stereotype threat (Stricker 2008; Stricker and Bejar 2004; Stricker and Ward 2004). Messick (1975, 1989) made the evaluation of plausible sources of irrelevant variance a cornerstone of validation, and he made the evaluation of construct-irrelevant variance and construct underrepresentation central concerns in his unified model of validity. It is, of course, desirable to neutralize potential sources of irrelevant variance before tests are administered operationally, and ETS has paid a lot of attention to the development and implementation of item analysis methodology, classical and IRTbased, designed to minimize irrelevant variance associated with systematic errors and random errors. ETS has played a particularly important role in the development of methods for the detection of differential item functioning (DIF), in which particular items operate inconsistently across groups of test takers while controlling for ability and thereby introduce systematic differences that may not reflect real differences in the trait of interest (Dorans, Chap. 7, this volume, 1989, 2004; Dorans and Holland 1993; Holland and Wainer 1993; Zieky 1993, 2011). Trait interpretations continue to play a major role in the interpretation and validation of test scores (Mislevy 2009). As discussed earlier, trait interpretations are closely tied to domains of possible test performances, and these domains provide guidance for the development of assessment procedures that are likely to support their intended function. In addition, trait interpretations can be combined with substantive assumptions about the trait and the traitâs relationships to other variables, thus going beyond the basic trait interpretation in terms of a domain of behaviors or performances to an interpretation of a theoretical construct (Messick 1989; Mislevy et al. 2002)."
161,224,0.987,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"the healthcare system in China (Chib, Si, Hway, & Phuong, 2013), who utilized mobile phones to negotiate professional relationships depending on the social capital therein. While such a Western theory could well describe the phenomenon encountered, the Chinese cultural concept of guanxi provides far greater explanatory power and deeper insights. We ï¬nd that guanxi relations describe the power hierarchies of rural barefoot doctors vis-Ã -vis their urban counterparts, who as the insider network, have greater medical knowledge, access to health resources, and comprise the formal healthcare information system (HIS). Rural doctors then utilize mobile phones in a parallel guanxi system using their existing social networks. The Chinese concept of social relations thus provides us insights into barriers faced in implementation of HIS. Further, the concept can be incorporated into program design for interventionary programs that minimize top-down centralized control in favor of more participatory designs that give voice to the margins. The implications from the cautionary tale of guanxi mimics the recommendations of Watkins and Baulch (Chap. 4) to pay attention to the sociocultural contexts of mHealth implementations. In Chap. 7, Chen examines mHealth apps, having gained popularity in China with the proliferation of smartphones, and ï¬nds that levels of app integration into lifestyles and perceptions of the role of apps vary between users. Users have differing comfort levels and knowledge of how the apps work, leading to different usage patterns. In the intrapersonal sphere, while some users appreciated how apps gave them greater control over their health, others were worried about being over-dependent on apps. In the social sphere, mHealth apps gave users a sense of belonging to a larger community with similar health pursuits, but also caused some to feel lonely as apps facilitated exercise conducted in isolation. Chen proposes that app developers take into consideration how to empower users to feel in control of their health regime, and integrate them into a larger health community through social features in the app. KrÃ¶mer (2016) argues that few mHealth projects have applied the theoretical concept of empowerment, with existing theories relating to either personal or psychological motivations. There is an opportunity to develop culturally relevant theorizing to integrate empowerment with social influences from a Chinese (Asian) perspective. In conclusion, one might very well ask whether the âhard scholarly evidenceâ, the lack of which our editors lament, has been indeed discovered. We would do well to pause before making judgments about evidence of impact, given the range of illustrations available, and the respective lenses that varied stakeholders will use to examine the evidence base. The contribution of this volume is to argue for the application of a sociocultural structural lens to issues of power within complex and variegated societies which applies beyond that of the mHealth domain. This set of empirical and conceptual contributions provides such a lens, allowing us to shift the needle just that bit forward. This collection is exemplary in bringing a range of (new) voices in mHealth in Asia to the fore. The discipline can only gain from the increased research capacities and the growing body of sophisticated analysis and evidence."

20,119,0.987,"Communicating, Networking: Interacting: The International Year of Global Understanding - IYGU","environmental risks). Whilst some scholars have contested the reliability of public knowledge in ensuring effective public awareness, lay epidemiology becomes a new discourse in exposing conceptions (and misconceptions) about health and disease and provides clues as to what kind of public health intervention is necessary (Laverack 2009). This is made possible by the prevailing use of social media of Twitter, Facebook and other social blogs which has fostered a new socio-political culture of sharing. Another key opportunity is the use of social media in enhancing community preparedness for health disasters. In the ï¬rst place, the use of geographic information system (GIS) becomes more prevalent in constructing necessary knowledge for emergency medicine. The Ready New York initiative was developed by the New York City Government in allowing residences to develop their own plans of evacuation in cases of natural or human-made disasters (Zarcadoolas and Pleasant 2009). Cromley and McLafferty (2012) point to the geospatial mode of health communication which can allow health authorities, community leaders and residents to identify the possible âhotspotsâ for critical intervention. For example, the US Department of Homeland Securityâs Science & Technology Directorate, capitalising upon the proliferation of smartphones and other GPS technologies, has introduced the Social Media Alert and Response to Threats to Citizens (SMART-C) programme. The programme, accordingly, âaims to develop citizensâ participatory sensing capabilities for decision support throughout the disaster life cycle via a multitude of devices (such as smartphones) and modalities (MMS messages, Web portals, blogs, tweets, and so on)â (Adam et al. 2012, p. 92). At the same time, the use of online virtual gaming is popularising emergency health knowledge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently made use of Zombie Preparedness to create a virtual community for engaging public in developing emergency preparedness (CDC 2015). The third opportunity is the usage of new media in different health campaigns can equip community members for enhancing linguistic and knowledge capacities. Although the traditional printed media has a relatively long history in contributing to the success of many health campaigns, the new media provides a more dynamic and robust way of engaging a wider scope of audience. Yan Tianâs study on the impact of Web 2.0 arrives at the conclusion that the media has a positive impact on the audienceâs understanding about issues related to organ donation (Tian 2010). Donorsâ families, recipients and activists are able to make use of the digital media platform such as YouTube for disseminating the medical knowledge and beneï¬ts of organ donation (ibid). Meanwhile, new media has been argued to have played a crucial role in the promotion of sexual health (Guse et al. 2012). The ability to identify the health risks associated with unsafe sexual practices has accordingly been enhanced with the digitalisation of health communication (ibid). On the whole, all these three opportunities have pointed to the fact that the role of the new media in promoting public health goes beyond passive acquisition of health-related information; instead, it points to the possibility for a decentred, non-hegemonic way of disseminating and expanding the existing body of health knowledge."

With the aid of the research partners in this larger project and an agreed-upon research protocol, we reviewed existing literature and conducted interviews to identify national and regional conceptualizations of the third sector and its component parts in five sets of European regions,4 assessed them against a potential consensus definition of the third sector flowing out of broader work and literature, and then analyzed the resulting observations to find whether common understandings could be discerned in these conceptualizations and manifestations.

I concentrate on three approaches that posit assumptions about this relationship: (a) the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991), (b) the theory of unconscious thought (Dijksterhuis & Nordgren, 2006), and (c) the option-generation framework (Kalis, Mojzisch, Schweizer, & Kaiser, 2008)."
244,833,0.987,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","Adequate sampling of the trait domain requires a clear definition of the domain, and ETS researchers have devoted a lot of attention to developing a clear understanding of various traits and of the kinds of performances associated with these traits (Ebel 1962). For example, Dwyer et al. (2003) defined quantitative reasoning as âthe ability to analyze quantitative informationâ (p. 13) and specified that its domain would be restricted to quantitative tasks that would be new to the student (i.e., would not require methods that the test takers had been taught). They suggested that quantitative reasoning includes six more specific capabilities: (a) understanding quantitative information presented in various formats, (b) interpreting and drawing inferences from quantitative information, (c) solving novel quantitative problems, (d) checking the reasonableness of the results, (e) communicating quantitative information, and (f) recognizing the limitations of quantitative methods. The quantitative reasoning trait interpretation assumes that the tasks do not require specific knowledge that is not familiar to all test takers and, therefore, any impact that such knowledge has on the scores would be considered irrelevant variance. As noted earlier, ETS has devoted a lot of attention to developing assessments that reflect traits of interest as fully as possible (Lawrence and Shea 2011). Much of this effort has been devoted to more adequately sampling the domains associated with the trait, and thereby reducing the differences between the test content and format and the broader domain associated with the trait (Bejar and Braun 1999; Frederiksen 1984). For example, the âin basketâ test (Frederiksen et al. 1957) was designed to evaluate how well managers could handle realistic versions of management tasks that required decision making, prioritizing, and delegating. Frederiksen (1959) also developed a test of creativity in which test takers were presented with descriptions of certain results and were asked to list as many hypotheses as they could to explain the results. Frederiksen had coauthored the chapter on performance assessment in the first edition of Educational Measurement (Ryans and Frederiksen 1951) and consistently argued for the importance of focusing assessment on the kinds of performance that are of ultimate interest, particularly in a landmark article, âThe Real Test Bias: Influences of Testing on Teaching and Learningâ (Frederiksen 1984). More recently, ETS researchers have been developing a performance-based program of Cognitively Based Assessment of, for, and as Learning (the CBALÂ® initiative) that elicits extended performances (Bennett 2010; Bennett and Gitomer 2009). For CBAL, and more generally for educational assessments, positive changes in the traits are the goals of instruction and assessment, and therefore the traits being assessed are not expected to remain the same over extended periods. The evidence-centered design (ECD) approach to test development, which is discussed more fully later, is intended to promote adequate sampling of the trait (or construct) by defining the trait well enough up front to get a good understanding of the kinds of behaviors or performance that would provide the evidence needed to draw conclusions about the trait (Mislevy et al. 1999, 2002). To the extent that the"
223,24,0.987,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Recent Developments in Decision-Making Theories and Geographies of Science: Improvements in the Understanding of Relations Between Knowledge, Action, and Space In proposing to use theories of heuristics13 and nonrational tools, Gigerenzer and his collaborators have introduced a concept they call ecological rationality (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011; 2015; Gigerenzer & Selten, 2001; Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002; Samuels & Stich, 2015; Todd, Gigerenzer, & ABC Research Group, 2012). Unlike rational choice theories, heuristic theories of decision-making are concerned with psychological realism relating to the capacities and limitations of actual humans and emphasize the importance of a specific context, frame, or environment and focus on the performance of actors in the external physical and social world (Buskens, 2015, p. 903; Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, pp. 911â912; Hertwig & Herzog, 2009; Lindenberg, 2013; Todd & Gigerenzer, 2000). In a world where not all risks are known and where optimization is not feasible, ânonrationalâ tools such as heuristics are neededâ¦[N]onrational theories apply to âdecisionmaking under uncertainty,â where not all alternatives, consequences, and probabilities are known or knowableâ¦Rational theories, in contrast, are tailored to situations where all risks are known. (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 911) The study of the ecological rationality of heuristics,14 or strategies in general, is a framework to study performance in the external world: A heuristic is ecologically rational to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of the environment. Heuristics are âdomain-specificâ rather than âdomain-generalâ; that is, they work in a class of environments in which they are ecologically rational. Heuristics provide not a universal rational calculus but a set of domain-specific mechanismsâ¦, and have been referred to collectively as the âadaptive toolboxâ. (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 912) âA heuristic is not per se rational or irrational; rather, its rationality depends on the match between the architecture of the tool and the structure of the environment in which it is employedâ (Hertwig & Herzog, 2009, p. 668). âAn inferential or judgmental strategy is ecologically rational if it is accurate and efficient on the sorts of tasks that were important in the environments in which we evolvedâ (Samuels & Stich, 2015, p. 722). âA heuristic is a strategy that ignores part of the information, with the goal of making decisions more accurately, quickly, and frugally (i.e., with fewer pieces of information) compared to more complex methodsâ (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 913). âA heuristic is ecologically rational to the degree that it is adapted to the structure of the environment. Heuristics are âdomain-specificâ rather than âdomain-generalâ; that is, they work in a class of environments in which they are ecologically rational. Heuristics provide not a universal rational calculus but a set of domain-specific mechanismsâ (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2015, p. 912)."

The ecosystems should face and overcome all inevitable difficulties inherent in the evolutionary process. Productivity is related to the way in which the work is accomplished with the least waste of time and effort. The ecosystem should add value through innovation, management of resources and cost control. Lastly, niche creation represents SECO features that encourage and support diversity among the different species in the ecosystem. The ecosystem should provide the structure for creating new features over time, increasing the diversity among SECO membersâ products [11]. Campbell [5] introduces three views to classify the features of a SECO: technical, business and social. The Technical View presents the architecture and approaches to implementing software. The Business View captures business strategies at play in the ecosystem. In some cases, organizations will be in direct competition and making decisions on release dates and licensing in response to the actions of others within the ecosystem. The Social View captures relationships among humans: developers, users, managers and other participants. SECO health should not be evaluated only by considering metrics. Practices also aid in understanding a project and its evolution with greater fidelity. They provide clear goals and forms to assess a good working performance to achieve a successful end [12].

97,502,0.987,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","in Rio 1992, the idea of employing natural elements to substitute and complement man-made infrastructure and production systems is a rather recent development. During the last decades, there has been more and more research focusing on NBS (see as a general introduction ten Brink et al. 2012). At the same time there is an increasing interest on the political level (a prominent example provides the latest EU research strategy; see EC 2015). Nature-based solutions are multifunctional, i.e. they deliver manifold services at the same time. For example, an urban park is not only a place of recreation for people (and sometimes a touristic factor) but also a corner-stone for (urban) biodiversity. The park is providing cooling effects important for reducing heat stress induced by climate change, relieving public sewerage infrastructures in case of heavy rainfall by providing natural seepage, filtering particular matters and dust and reducing noise of, e.g. traffic, and is contributing to climate change mitigation via carbon sequestration of its vegetation. While on the one hand, the multifunctionality of NBS promises high social return on investments, since they simultaneously address several societal goals, it is on the other hand hard to develop financial arrangements for their realization, since their superiority only becomes visible if all services are considered. Sectorial returns, e.g. in terms of noise reduction, are often falling short of benefits provided by technical and grey infrastructure solutions such as noise-insulating walls. While there is yet lacking a clear definition (Potschin et al. 2015), the idea of employing nature to satisfy human needs has attracted both conservation experts such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2016) and major infrastructure investors such as the World Bank (2008). The expert group of the âNature-Based Solutions and Re-naturing Citiesâ of the European research programme Horizon 2020 defined NBS as actions inspired by, supported by or copied from nature; [â¦] [that] use the features and complex system processes of nature, such as its ability to store carbon and regulate water flows, in order to achieve desired outcomes, such as reduced disaster risk and an environment that improves human well-being and socially inclusive green growth (EC 2015, p. 24). The concept therefore aims at satisfying human needs by utilizing (cultivated and humanly formed) natural systems. Regarding the urban environment, the idea is to foster multifunctional green spaces, green roofs, roadside greeneries, etc. to improve human health and human well-being. There are potential similarities and overlaps to concepts such as the âecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem-based adaptation/mitigation and green and blue infrastructureâ (EC 2015, p. 24). Thus, many different aspects have been addressed from various perspectives; at the same time, however, many details have not been clarified yet. For an actual implementation, financing aspects are certainly among the issues which are of utmost importance. While we assume that there is no easy blueprint, one-size-fits-all solution, we aim at elaborating on the issue from a perspective of public finance and public choice. Hence, our basic premise is that, in urban areas, public bodies are central actors that provide the required investments for the implementation of NBS. The goal of this chapter is therefore to clarify how cities and municipalities may leverage required investment volumes for NBS. Focussing on municipal actors, the chapter serves three purposes:"
278,100,0.987,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment: What Is It and What Are Its Challenges? Jeroen GuinÃ©e Abstract Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) has developed fast over the last three decades. Today, LCA is widely applied and used as a tool for supporting policies and performance-based regulation, notably concerning bioenergy. Over the past decade, LCA has broadened to also include life cycle costing (LCC) and social LCA (SLCA), drawing on the three-pillar or âtriple bottom lineâ model of sustainability. With these developments, LCA has broadened from merely environmental assessment to a more comprehensive life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA). LCSA has received increasing attention over the past years, while at the same time, its meaning and contents are not always sufficiently clear. In this chapter, we therefore addressed the question: what are LCSA practitioners actually doing in practice? We distinguished two sub-questions: which definition(s) do they adopt and what challenges do they face? To answer these questions, LCSA research published over the past half decade has been analysed, supplemented by a brief questionnaire to researchers and practitioners. This analysis revealed two main definitions of LCSA. Based on these two definitions, we distinguished three dimensions along which LCSA is expanding when compared to environmental LCA: (1) broadening of impacts, LCSA = LCA + LCC + SLCA; (2) broadening level of analysis, product-, sector- and economy-wide questions and analyses; and (3) deepening, including other than just technological relations, such as physical, economic and behavioural relations. From this analysis, it is clear that the vast majority of LCSA research so far has focused on the âbroadening of impactsâ dimension. The challenges most frequently cited concern the need for more practical examples of LCSA, efficient ways of communicating LCSA results and the need for more data and methods particularly for SLCA indicators and comprehensive uncertainty assessment. We conclude that the three most crucial challenges to be addressed first are developing quantitative and practical indicators for SLCA, life cycle-based approaches to evaluate scenarios for sustainable futures and practical ways to deal with uncertainties and rebound effects."
193,333,0.987,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"Scholars based in Europe have an intuitive sense of the importance of Ukrainian migration, perhaps because of the sheer number of people leaving Ukraine and heading to Western and especially Southern Europe, but those based in the United States are often asked: Who cares about Ukraine? There are three analytical reasons why migration scholars in particular should be interested in the Ukrainian case. First, as a still newly independent post-Soviet country, Ukraine is undergoing dramatic changes, including an economic transition from socialism to capitalism, the production of a new gendered order, and heightened processes of nation-state building. In the context of mass emigration, these complex processes of gendered economic change and nation-state building are occurring transnationally, challenging previous analytical frames characterized by methodological nationalism. Second, Ukraine draws our attention to the limitations of describing migration streams as either circular or permanent, challenging us to use migration patterns as our unit of analysis. The concept of migration patterns brings the sending country into our discussions and analyses of migrant practices and meaning-making in receiving countries. Finally, Ukraine challenges prevailing understandings of the relationship between a sending state and its emigrants. The Ukrainian case highlights that sending states have a more nuanced understanding of different migration patterns, which can have differential effects in the sending country. In these three areas of theorizing, the Ukrainian case pushes forward the boundaries of migration studies. Ten years after the Orange Revolution described in the vignette at the beginning of this chapter, Ukraine is once again, through protests known collectively as Euromaidan, struggling to define itself as an independent country with a unified national identity. The current events in Ukraine are dramatic and include the ousting"

These vacillations created in fact at least three competing (though not simultaneous or equally supported by authorities) curricular approaches for teaching the history of the IsraeliâPalestinian conflict: the later official approach, which stressed a single clear narrative, with a conventional textbook-oriented teaching, and a stress on in-group (Israeli) righteousness; the empathetic dual-narrative approach, which stressed perspectivetaking and nonjudgmental acknowledgment of both sidesâ narratives; and the educational reform for higher-order thinking approach, which stressed critical disciplinary thinking and engagement in historical controversy evaluating and synthesizing conflicting historical accounts of both sides. The above curricula demonstrate different features of engagement with the past, which should lead to different effects according to research on collective narratives and intergroup conflict. The official single narrative appears to replicate tendencies for self-justifying and exonerating cognitions and for intergroup attribution bias, which protract and normalize conflict (Bar-Tal and Halperin 2011; Doosje and Branscombe 2003; Roccas and Berlin 2015). The empathetic dual-narrative approach creates conditions for mutual affirmation and for intergroup empathy, reducing competitive victimhood and rejection of threatening out-group perspectives and promote reconciliatory attitudes (ÄehajiÄ-Clancy et al. 2011; Vollhardt 2013). The critical disciplinary thinking approach is assumed to curb bias and exonerating cognitions (Roccas et al. 2006), help learners take a critical stance to self-legitimizing narratives, and promote ability to contain complexity and disagreement (McCully 2011). Comparing the Effects of Competing Curricula of Conflict This variety of teaching approaches offered an opportunity for tracking the effects of teaching the history of intergroup conflict in a comparative empirical method. Using the competing curricula, three parallel teaching units were created, focusing on the JewishâArab war of 1948 and the birth of the Palestinian refugee problem (âIndependence warâ in Israeli terminology and the âNaqbaâ [catastrophe] in Palestinian terms).

Even when focusing only on UN partnerships, Carmen Malena notes that âReviewing the literature and talking to UN and civil society representatives quickly reveals that there is little common understanding regarding the meaning of partnershipâ (Malena, 2004). 4. The âideal typeâ as a method for defining social scientific concepts is commonly ascribed to Max Weber. Social reality is usually so complex and varied that no conceptual apparatus can do it justice. Nevertheless, Weber argued, social scientists should define clear concepts that try to capture important similarities of phenomena and thus facilitate analysis and enquiry. Cf. for example, KÃ¤sler (1995), pp. 229â34. 5. Cf. the so-called Bali guiding principles (available at http://www.un.org/esa/ sustdev/partnerships/bali_guiding_principles.htm, last accessed 27 August 2009) and the CSD 11 decision (Commission on Sustainable Development, 2003). 6. âUnter âPublic Private Partnershipsâ verstehen wir Entwicklungspartnerschaften mit der Privatwirtschaft: Die Partnerschaften bestehen aus gemeinsam finanzierten Projekten von Unternehmen und entwicklungspolitischen Institutionenâ (Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Technische Zusammenarbeit, 2004). 7. The concept of corporatism has changed over time, sometimes creating confusion as to its exact meaning. Williamson (1985b), for example, provides a comprehensive discussion of the concept of corporatism and distinguishes three different usages of the term as a body of prescriptive economic and social thought, as a practice of a range of authoritarian regimes and as an analytical tool to examine the relations between organised groups and the state in liberal democracies. 8. Philippe S. Schmitter, a leading contemporary theorist on corporatism, for example, reflects the ambiguous connotations of the term when he states that âCorporatism, either as a practice in political life or as a concept in political theory, has always been politically controversial. It has been heralded as a novel and promising way of ensuring harmony between conflicting social classes. It has also been condemned as a reactionary and antidemocratic formula for suppressing the demands of autonomous associations and movementsâ (Schmitter, 1995, p. 309). 9. This argument has been made most explicitly for partnerships operating at the international or transnational level by Marina Ottaway. To her, recent trends suggest that corporatist solutions at the global level are on the rise. Analysing the historical track record of corporatism, she comes to the conclusion that the main danger of corporatism as implemented in nation states, namely the emergence of authoritarianism, is not a risk at the global level. Yet she still concludes that corporatismâs costs exceed it benefits: âAnd this is what corporatism has always done: it absorbs groups that challenge the status quo in the political system, where they can have some impact on policy reform but are neutralized as vehicles for radical changeâ (Ottaway, 2001, p. 280). For the local level, Vivien Lowndes has emphasised that partnerships have the same shortcomings as the traditional corporatist model. Cf. Lowndes (2001). 10. Cf. Saul (1999). 11. The argument has been made most powerfully for NGOs operating at the transnational or international level. Thus, for example, Anderson and Rieff criticise the standard account of transnational NGOs as constituting âglobal civil societyâ and"

Against the backdrop of communicative practices of moralizing relating to different types and forms of social evaluation, their commingling with aspects of deliberation and the visible reflection and argumentation of norms and valuesânot at least the verbal deconstruction of populist metaphors by some bloggersâwe propose a concept of deliberating beyond the pure ideal-type of just and interest-free speech without power plays and strategic communication. This matches the current status quo of deliberation research which refers to practices of bargaining, promising, story-telling, even of threatening (cf. Schaal and Ritzi: 2009; BÃ¤chtiger and Wyss 2013). Similarly, Mansbridge (2015: 14) highlights citizensâ moralizations as âcompatibleâ with public deliberation. Complementary to such findings concerning mixtures of communicative practices in deliberation research, in our own research we mostly identify intermingled processes between real type-deliberations and real type-moralizations. Correspondingly, we conclude that social research on public debates cannot neglect neither moralization nor deliberation as crucial concepts to rethink social communication and to describe dynamics and negotiations in public debates profoundly. In this context, further reflection is required on the theoretical and empirical conceptualization of moralization and deliberation as a kind of continuum of two intermingled but also differentiated modes of communication and complementary sets of communicative practices."

Kingston and Holland (1986) compared equating errors using IRT and several other equating methods, and several equating designs, for equating the GRE General Test, with varying results depending on the specific design and method. Eignor and Stocking (Eignor and Stocking 1986) conducted two studies to investigate whether calibration or linking methods might be reasons for poor equating results on the SAT. In the first study they used actual data, and in the second they used simulations, concluding that a combination of differences in true mean ability and multidimensionality were consistent with the real data. Eignor et al. (1986) studied the potential of a new plotting procedures for assessing fit to the 3PL model using SAT and TOEFL data. Wingersky and Sheehan (1986) also wrote on fit to IRT models, using regressions of item scores onto observed (number correct) scores rather than the previously used method of regressing onto estimated ability. Bejar (1990), using IRT, studied an approach to psychometric modeling that explicitly incorporates information on the mental models test takers use in solving an item, and concluded that it is not only workable, but also necessary for future developments in psychometrics. Kingston (1986) used full information FA to estimate difficulty and discrimination parameters of a MIRT model for the GMAT, finding there to be dominant first dimensions for both the quantitative and verbal measures. Mislevy (1987b) discussed implications of IRT developments for teacher certification. Mislevy (1989) presented a case for a new test theory combining modern cognitive psychology with modern IRT. Sheehan and Mislevy (1990) wrote on the integration of cognitive theory and IRT and illustrated their ideas using the Survey of Young Adult Literacy data. These ideas seem to be the first appearance of a line of research that continues today. The complexity of these models, built to integrate cognitive theory and IRT, evolved dramatically in the twenty-first century due to rapid increase in computational capabilities of modern computers and developments in understanding problem solving. Lawrence coauthored a paper (Lawrence and Dorans 1988) addressing the sample invariance properties of four equating methods with two types of test-taker samples (matched on anchor test score distributions or taken from different administrations and differing in ability). Results for IRT, Levine, and equipercentile methods differed for the two types of samples, whereas the Tucker observed score method did not. Henning (1989) discussed the appropriateness of the Rasch model for multiple-choice data, in response to an article that questioned such appropriateness. McKinley (1989b) wrote an explanatory article for potential users of IRT. McKinley and Schaeffer (1989) studied an IRT equating method for the GRE designed to reduce the overlap on test forms. Bejar et al. (1989), in a paper on methods used for patient management items in medical licensure testing, outlined recent developments and introduced a procedure that integrates those developments with IRT. Boldt (1989) used LC analysis to study the dimensionality of the TOEFL and assess whether different dimensions were necessary to fit models to diverse groups of test takers. His findings were that a single dimension LT model fits TOEFL data well but âsuggests the use of a restrictive assumption of proportionality of item response curvesâ (p. 123)."
78,303,0.987,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"todayâs cyberspace, e.g., David Postâs republican institutions that shall respect the equal worth of all individuals, it is admittedly an open question how such institutions should be built, and even conceived of (Post 2009; Solum 2009; Reed 2012; etc.): yet, the paper has shown how often the efficiency and legitimacy of traditional hard and soft-law tools of governance depend on what scholars present as ânetwork effect.â Legislators, policy makers and, generally speaking, governance actors shall preventively understand the political, legal and economical relevance of what spontaneously emerges and evolves onlife, namely that which we discussed above in Sect. 4. On the other hand, what is specific of todayâs onlife governance revolves around the role of game designers. In addition to the debate on the institutional issues of current governance, and how its traditional hard and soft law-tools should be distributed among political authorities, societal actors, and economic players, such as lobbies and stakeholders, the challenges of the information revolution have induced complementing such tools, e.g., guidelines and best practices, through the mechanisms of design, codes and architectures. This new scenario affects basic pillars of the law and democratic processes, by reshaping the balance between resolution and representation, much as the right of the individuals to have a say in the decisions affecting them. Here, the three levels of analysis discussed above in Sect. 5 are critical. When the aim is to broaden the range of peopleâs choices, so as to encourage the change of their behaviour, such design policy is legally and politically sound: this approach to design prevents threats of paternalism that hinge on the regulatory tools of technology, since it fosters collective and individual autonomy. Likewise, the aim of design to decrease the impact of harm-generating behaviour through the use of digital airbags, such as security measures or user friendly interfaces, respects collective and individual autonomy, because this approach to design does not impinge on peopleâs choices, no more than traditional airbags affect how individuals behave on the highways. Yet, to complement the hard and soft-law tools of governance by design entails its own risks, when the aim is to prevent harm-generating behaviour from occurring. Although many impasses of todayâs legal and political systems can properly be addressed by embedding legal safeguards into ICT and other kinds of technology, there are several legal, ethical and technical reasons why the use of allegedly perfect self-enforcing technologies raises serious threats of paternalism and, even, of authoritarianism. Whether DRMs, automatic versions of the principle of privacy by design, three-strikes approaches, Chinaâs âGreat Firewall,â or Western systems of filters in order to control the flow of information on the internet, the result is the modelling of individual conduct. As game designers dealing with the challenges of the information revolution, this paper suggested why governance actors ought to consider the use of self-enforcing technologies as the exception, or a last resort option, to minimize the informational entropy of the system or, vice versa, to promote its flourishing and that of its informational objects. What is at stake here is âcomplex,â because the legal and political challenges of the information revolution often concern the whole infrastructure and environment of peopleâs interaction. Recent statutes, such as HADOPI in France, or DEA in UK, show how new ways of protecting citizens even against themselves do materialize."
143,323,0.987,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"The central goal of the chapter is to shed light on the evolution of Kenyaâs ICT ecosystem and ask âWhat are the barriers to and enablers of growing an ICT ecosystem in a resource-scarce context?â Using Isenbergâs framework of entrepreneurship ecosystems (2011), my research, conducted in Kenya in the fall of 2013, highlights a set of barriers and enabling processes necessary for the maturation of Kenyaâs ICT ecosystem. Based on these, I propose a model that explains ICT ecosystem emergence in resource-scarce contexts. The chapter ends with specific recommendations that tackle the current barriers in an effort to move ecosystems beyond their nascent phase. Research into such an endeavor can deduce pivotal policy prescriptions that account for context and stage. The chapter will therefore conclude with suggestions for further research."
302,371,0.987,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"1 The Social-Ecological Risk Perspective: Addressing Global Risks A common risk definition is that âthe term âriskâ denotes the likelihood that an undesirable state of reality (adverse effects) may occur as a result of natural events or human activitiesâ [1]. A classical risk analysis calculates the possibility of an adverse event and the potential damage, for instance, an assessment of ecotoxicity of hazardous substances based on dose-response relationships. For âglobal risks,â also termed systemic risks, classical risk analysis is not so easily applicable, since the characteristics of âglobal risksâ comprise complex cause-effect linkages, which are not fully known, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in assessing the risk. For this reason, consent to risk management strategies is difficult to obtain [2, 3]. Who or what can be âat riskâ? In social-ecological risk research, risks to humans and biophysical entities (e.g., biocoenoses, ecosystems) are considered. The causes of risks mostly lie in human activities, since many natural resources and biophysical processes are influenced by societies [4]. In social-ecological risk research, it has become clear that assessment of the risk alone is not sufficient for management and policy decisions [5]. It is also important to consider the risk perception and concerns of different interest groups [6]. In the case of complex risks which are accompanied by uncertainty, it is important to define the degree of tolerability and acceptability in order to find management strategies acceptable to all interest groups [7]. Therefore, a prerequisite for risk management and related policy-making is not only scientific evidence but also an agreement of the different interest groups on how to understand, interpret, and value the evidence. Hereafter, we will outline the characteristics of global risks from a socialecological perspective and present four arguments framing microplastics as a global risk. (a) Global risks are not produced by an extreme event or a disaster but are created in modern societies as a side effect of an âeveryday modeâ of systemâs operation [8, 9] and regulation of the supply system [4]. From this understanding, we derive our first thesis, arguing that the risks of microplastics are produced as an unintended side effect of everyday operations in modern societies. (b) Global risks are complex; thus, no clear evidence of a cause-effect linkage exists or can be proven, due to âintervening variables,â âlong delay periods between cause and effect,â or âpositive and negative feedback loopsâ [10]. These and the state of ânot knowingâ [8] contribute to a high degree of uncertainty regarding effects, especially in terms of scope and time. Thus, we"
28,279,0.987,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"To return to specifics, we see that self-cutting is both a residual and a newly emergent category. It is understood â gradually and unevenly â as a method of affective self-regulation rather than social communication. This opens the way to neurological explanations of the behaviour. This happens because neurological explanations focus upon the individualâs nervous system as a privileged site of understanding. The reason that it is only a small step from âindividual tensionâ to âneurochemistryâ is that both approaches, or concepts, take the individual at their starting points. A communicative attempt, in contrast, focuses upon a social situation in which various people are embedded. However, even this contrast has recently become unstable, as there is work that investigates the âneurology of social cognitionâ as well as sociological work on the discipline of neuroscience (upon which this book has drawn).11 However, the point stands that internal emotional turmoil maps much more easily onto neurological understandings than does psychosocial communication. Although the neurochemistry of complex behaviour is widely acknowledged to be in its infancy (a claim also made in the mid-1970s), there are a number of guiding principles that underwrite these perspectives. Regardless of the particular system or neurotransmitter that is implicated, these sorts of studies are all based around the assumption that neurochemistry is at the root of the behaviour, and operates prior to culture, and is indeed, outside culture. As Hilary and Stephen Rose argue with respect to molecular biology: âAgain and again the molecular biologists leading the sequencing [of] the human genome [between 1990 and 2013] claimed that the completed genome would constitute human identityâ. They add that âThe neurosciences have not been left behind; their claims to explain selfhood, love and consciousness as located in certain brain regions ... have been articulated in a string of popular booksâ.12 Given the audacity and ambition of these claims, it is unsurprising that neuroscience and neurobiology are increasingly utilised to investigate the (comparatively modestsounding) self-cutting-as-tension-release in order to reveal its neurological basis. Michael Simpson is among the first to speculate upon a biological basis for the behaviour of self-cutting in 1976, but he is notably cautious in ascribing the behaviour any secure biological basis.13 In 2001, Fiona Gardner (a psychoanalytically trained therapist) writes in a cautious and equivocal vein about âself-harmâ:"

The need to further extending life-cycles could also be caused by environmental motives, driven by user requirements or societal push. Inherently long system life-cycles and the push for further life cycle extension motivate the need for repeated system upgrades. Within each cluster the viewpoints of a broad range of actors, such as design engineers, service personnel, sales staff, managers, decision makers, and end users, were taken into account to create comprehensive systems views. The broad scope of the study allowed for applications supporting both a horizontal integration, i.e., through the life-cycle, and vertical integration, i.e., âshop-floor to top-floorâ. In addition, the collaboration between research and practice as well as between seemingly unrelated industries proved beneï¬cial and provided new viewpoints to identiï¬ed problems (Fox and Groesser 2016). This observation is in line with previous research supporting the hypothesis that good ideas emerges from the intersection of diverse social worlds, i.e., across âstructural holesâ in knowledge networks (Burt 2011). The research setting, including the six industry clusters, different research targets and multiple actor viewpoints, provided the material to study applications on two different levels: ï¬rst, on a generic level to analyse commonalities across the clusters and conceptually develop the UIW-approach for dealing with shared issues. And second, on a cluster-speciï¬c level to analyse individual use cases to provide bespoke solutions based on the tools and methods of the UIW-framework. This two-level approach was designed to ensure the applicability and practice-orientation of the UIW-approach and the transferability of speciï¬c solutions to other industries facing similar challenges."
170,305,0.987,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"This chapter critically examines the underside of the Philippine Information Societyâthe cybersex phenomenon. In looking at cybersex, we take stock of the Philippine ICT frameworkâs aim of building âa people-centered, inclusive, development-oriented Information Societyâ through the state promotion of Filipinos as âworld-classâ workers and citizens. We also look at how the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 complements this state policy aspiration. We argue that the cybersex phenomenon illustrates how institutional development strategies propelled by ICT could inadvertently exclude already marginalized sectors of society. We use the perspective of affective labour to argue that because ICT-led development failed for these sectors, the response is an illegal service industry that also makes use of, if not feeds off, the same technological infrastructure largely supported by foreign capital. Cybersex is a potent example of how the marginalized learn to transform conditions of exclusion and illegality into creative, practical, and thus, productive strategies of survival. Cybersex is not the solution to achieving a decent quality of life, but the existence and persistence of this phenomenon signifies that the Stateâs vision of ICT for development is not living up to its promise of socioeconomic upliftment. Through the institutionalized uses of technology, a culture of creative ICT use is constrained rather than promoted. Cybersex thus foregrounds some problematic ramifications of the present ICT framework and the institutional mechanisms supporting it. It puts to question the goal of inclusive development in Philippine ICT policymaking and legislation, hinting at the risks and repercussions of creating an âInformation Societyâ under the neoliberal market"

198,197,0.987,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"This evaluation has shown the importance of developing an appropriate analytical framework, well suited for the scope and complexity of the object of evaluation. The analytical framework and evaluation approach used for the UNEP Climate Change Sub-programme Evaluation, combining three interlinked areas of focus (strategic relevance, sub-programme performance and factors affecting performance), five concentric units of analysis (UNEP as a whole, sub-programme, component, country and project) and a Theory of Change approach, allowed the evaluation team to cover the standard evaluation criteria in a comprehensive but concise manner, remaining strategic and without drowning in the details. The ToC approach helped making a credible assessment of UNEPâs contribution towards impact, sustainability and up-scaling, but did not allow this contribution to be quantified. In other words, the evaluation could not determine to what extent higher-level changes beyond stakeholder capacity (direct outcomes), such as changes in environmental management practices or greenhouse gas emissions, could be attributed to UNEPâs efforts alone, and which changes might have happened anyway. In any case, a credible attribution of impact at the sub-programme or sub-programme component level would have been impossible without extensive impact assessments at the country or project level, which are currently not available in UNEP and could not have been realistically built into the sub-programme evaluation framework. There appears to be a trade-off between the time that is invested in quality assurance and stakeholder involvement during the evaluation process, on the one hand, and the up-to-dateness of information provided and sustained stakeholder interest in the evaluation, on the other. Strong internal stakeholder involvement during the inception and data collection and analysis phases of the evaluation through interviews, discussions, surveys and commenting on intermediate products,"
99,286,0.987,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"The literature also pays much attention to obstacles to diffusion that result from the nature of the innovation itself. In line with Rogersâ work (1962), it suggests that the more complex innovations are (in terms of goals, assumed causalities, effects) the harder it gets to take them from one place to another. The more resilient the destination context (e.g. due to the strength of a dominant discourse or top-heavy regulation), the less likely it is to succeed. Transfer success also depends on capacity and resources available. The empirical results of the WILCO project show that the same applies to social innovations. Even though there is an already burgeoning literature on innovation transfer, questions about what is specific about the diffusion of social innovations remain. Non-technical and non-market-based innovations are generally more diverse in terms of organisational properties or lifestyles compared to technical innovations designed for mass markets. Yet, to be fair, the difference is not always as drastic as the one between a cell phone and a new mode of participation in urban planning. Many new mass products are sold with varieties that allow marketing geared to the different tastes of consumers in different cultures and regions. Still, the differential impact of âlocalâ as compared to âglobalâ features remains an important topic for research to investigate what is specific for social innovations. Spreading Rather Than Being Sent: The Opaque Nature of Diffusion Processes When the process of diffusion is studied across a wider range of cases, the senderreceiver metaphor quickly becomes unsatisfactory as, however bad the connection, however confusing the conference call, one usually knows who is at the other end of the line. Not so for diffusion because the process is so hard to trace. Johnson dealt with the difference between areas such as the business sector, where innovations can be formalised, sold or withheld by license, and the often taken-for-granted fact that most social innovations develop in the public realm where they are basically free for use (2010, p. 240 f.). However, one of our case studies (Ewert and Evers in this chapter) shows that in the social realm there is also a tension between diffusion by innovation as an âopen sourceâ and diffusion channelled by competition. Projects and organisations such as Lok.aMotion, dealing with innovative concepts for community development and community-based business in Berlin-Kreuzberg, must act under conditions of âco-ompetitionâ where cooperation and competition merge. They often feel that their concepts are not simply taken up, but âstolenâ. This dilemma is hard to overcome because cases where a clear origin and âauthorâ of a social innovation can be identified are hard to find. Many of the case studies presented in this book are innovative in the local place where they crystallise but resemble concepts and ideas elsewhere. This holds true for quite a number of innovations presented in this book: the essentials of work integration enterprises and the variant discussed with examples from Nijmegen, the prevention visits for improving local child protection in MÃ¼nster (Walter and Gluns) or the housing revitalisation schemes from the outskirts of Lille (Fraisse). These are varieties within a national or international innovative stream and orientations. The fact that respon-"

The participation of farm households in public actions aiming to mitigate or adapt to the impacts of climate change depends on the willingness of these households to participate. Our research can also contribute to the interpretation of the results of climate change models that may have a good overall geographic perspective but may miss the heterogeneity that exists at local levels. The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical background for the determinants of individual climate change perceptions and adaptation behavior. Section 3 describes data collection and Section 4 describes the methodology. Section 5 reports some descriptive results as background information. Section 6 discusses results of our models.

245,570,0.987,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"Understanding student learning and development has, for a long time, been a domain of psychological strand in educational research. A large body of research has examined the ways in which students learn and the factors that lead to high quality learning outcomes (Biggs and Tang 2011; Entwistle 2009; Kolb 1984; Tinto 1975). This research has also explored the connection between learning and self-regulation in higher education (Zimmerman and Campillo 2002), and motivation as an essential dimension of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman and Campillo 2002; Zimmerman and Schunk 2001). The basic proposition in this literature is that learning takes place in a system of reciprocal causal relations between studentsâ unique personal characteristics, such as cognitive skills, and emotional dispositions, and environmental factors, which come directly from the educational environment, as well as from broader context including socio-economic background, former educational opportunities and achievements, various support systems (from parents, peers, school, etc.). Whilst the impact of the educational environment is recognized, the main focus is on the ways in which students take charge of their own learning processes. For example, the theoretical model by Zimmerman (2002) includes three distinct phases and their underlying self-regulatory processes which are then cyclically repeated as student approaches learning tasks. The forethought phase includes task analysis and self-motivation beliefs (such as outcome expectation, self-efï¬cacy and goal-orientation). Performance phase includes self-control (including time management, help-seeking, etc.) and self-observation (metacognitive monitoring). The self-reflection phase contains self-judgment and self-reaction, both of which then feed again into the forethought phase of another or simultaneous learning process. On the other side of this tension is the sociological literature which has over the last twenty years focused on the influence of the educational programs and extracurricular life along with the broader institutional characteristics on student learning and development (Pascarella and Terenzini 1991, 2005). This literature draws a causal link between student engagement in educationally-purposeful activities and student learning, retention and success in higher education (Astin 1993; Kuh 2001, 2003, 2005; Kuh et al. 2005, 2010). The argument goes that almost any type of student involvement in college positively affects student learning and development (Astin 1993). The sociological literature is based on the premise that higher education institutions shape student development, both in terms of knowledge and skills, but also their values and attitudes. Hence, speciï¬c institutional interventions are sought to improve the effects of institutions and programmes on student learning and development. Sociological literature on the effects of higher education on students unravels the contextual factors in student learning which go beyond the classroom or even campus environment. They try to capture studentsâ socioeconomic background and the different capitals (cultural, social, and ï¬nancial) students possess, as well as developments and norms in the broader socio-economic and cultural environment in which higher education is embedded. This research opens a way to the questions of what higher education is for, the desired learning outcomes, and how to prepare students not only for their future professions (and often multiple, highly diverseâin location and in discipline or sectorâprofessions), but also"
271,42,0.987,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"and Gogolok in this volume). Reflecting both these aspects, across the variety of possible consequences we can assume that differentiation might result in an optionality (Rusch 2006) of ways of use. These can be related to processes of individualization (Hasebrink 1999) and, following from this, contingency within and across social domains and related questions of inequality and power. This can have various further influences on the segmentations, exclusions and divides articulated in a specific social domain (van Deursen and Helsper 2015; Nieminen 2016). For example, an increasing number of media as contents and technologies might weaken (as our preliminary research shows) the binding power of communicative practices within communities (Marszolek and Robel 2016), and the variability of possible contacts might increase (Friemel 2013). This may be especially discussed in relation to internet-based contact platforms, which are understood as supporting âweak tiesâ instead of âstrongâ relations within the direct living environment (Wittel 2008; Rainie and Wellman 2012: 131â134). The media environment of deep mediatization is characterized by the trends of an intensified connectivity. By connectivity, we primarily mean the interconnectedness of various media owing to their digitalization and the infrastructure of the internet. This is the case for âoldâ media such as television and the digital press, but increasingly and with reference to personal communication for ânewâ media such as online platforms and mobile phone applications. As a consequence, there is a close relationship between more recent processes of mediatization and globalization (Krotz 2008). A characteristic of contemporary everyday life is our ability to socially connect globally, across various media, if we want to. But, ââconnectivityâ does not necessarily mean âsocial connectednessââ (van Dijck 2013: 4). Increasing media connectivity can result in a spatial extension of processes of construction (Wessler and BrÃ¼ggemann 2012: 119â136; Hepp 2015: 13â18), and through that social domains can extend and their borders become blurred. This might âdisembedâ (Giddens 1990: 20) social processes being maintained across large distances. For example, it can become easier to build networks for learning over long distances (Thomas and Brown 2011: 53; Ito et al. 2009: 213), popular cultures can exist transnationally (Buckingham and Kehily 2014) and whole organizations or networks of organizations can be built up across various locations (Breiter 2003; Ribes et al. 2013; Lammers and Jackson 2014: 33â47; Jarke 2015)âall of this held together by technologically based communication.

This seeks to develop technical fluency (spelling, grammar, syntax), to analyze and create texts in different genres (reports, letters, stories, poems, etc.) and to relate texts to social, historical and cultural contexts. Progress consists in being able to handle more challenging texts in more sophisticated ways. If you change âtextsâ to âtasksâ, the top-level goals for mathematics are much the same. We have recently come to develop a framework that looks in more detail at tasks in terms of the primary purposes of the learning activity they support, the genres of student activity that the task demands, and the type of product that results from the student reasoning involved. It is summarized in Table 1. In the UK, the US and many other countries the ï¬rst row, facts and procedure development, is dominant in assessment and in many classrooms.

38,51,0.987,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"The question of where to measure ecosystems and ecosystem variables for an analysis at a particular scale calls for a âsampling frameâ that is strategically located across the globe, continent, country or region. The use of remotely-sensed land cover maps provides the ï¬rst part of the picture of habitat change. It will therefore be an important tool for reporting change. In addition to the overview of structural ecosystem change provided by repeated habitat maps there is a need for statistics on change and a need for monitoring of ecosystem processes. Here the question of where to measure becomes critical. For many purposes, such as consistent input to climate impact models, or reporting towards the Aichi targets, standardised frameworks and methods are required among different studies or countries to enable integration of data and reporting. The development and adoption of harmonised methods is a complex and difï¬cult process, because ecological data collection tends to be coordinated at the regional or national level, following country speciï¬c methods, classiï¬cations and priorities. It is made more difï¬cult by the long-term nature of the data: it may not be possible to harmonise data from old studies, and those responsible for the collection and curation of long-term records are typically reluctant to change their methods in substantive ways. Ecosystems can be as extensive as the entire arctic tundra, or as small as a particle of soil. They are thus understood to exist at multiple scales. This means that choices have to be made on the scale at which monitoring should be carried out. Mapping ecologically homogenous regions across the planet to select monitoring sites has been accomplished through a process of eco-regionalisation as in the WWF global ecoregions map. However, this and most other approaches rely heavily on expert judgement for interpreting class divisions. This makes it difï¬cult to ensure reliability across the world and limits their use in scientiï¬c analysis. The Global Environmental Stratiï¬cation (GEnS) is the ï¬rst high-resolution global bio-climate stratiï¬cation derived from multivariate statistical clustering (Fig. 2.1). The GEnS also provides sufï¬cient detail to support the design of regional monitoring programmes that can be nested within the global network. A cost-efï¬cient and data-effective selection of sites for data collection should be based on a stratiï¬ed random selection procedure for the whole land surface of the target area. The GEnS (Fig. 2.1) is a way to provide a common global framework for positioning ï¬xed monitoring stations, the development of LTER sites as well as for stratiï¬ed random sampling and global statistics (Metzger et al. 2013a). The GEnS consists of 125 strata, which have been aggregated into 18 global environmental zones. The stratiï¬cation has a 30 Arcsec resolution (equivalent to 0.86 km2 at the equator).

Collaborative research between materials science and information science is growing actively, creating new trends in materials science and engineering. Areas utilizing âbig data,â generated by experiments and computations to accelerate the discovery of new materials, key factors, and design rules, have rapidly progressed. Data-intensive approaches are indispensable in advanced materials characterization. âMaterial informaticsâ is the central paradigm in this new trend. An essential subset is ânanoinformatics,â which focuses on the nanostructures of materials, such as surfaces, interfaces, dopants, and point defects. Experimental and computational techniques to characterize and gain quantitative information about nanostructures have signiï¬cantly advanced, enabling nanoinformatics to play a critical role in determining material properties. Most of this book is derived from the collaborative research projects supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientiï¬c Research on Innovative Areas âNano Informaticsâ from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS). This ï¬ve-year project, which was launched in 2013, aims to accelerate the exploration of frontiers in materials science and promote the integration of information and utilization of accumulated knowledge regarding nanostructures for the design and innovation of actual materials. Project researchers represent diverse disciplines, such as materials science, applied physics, solid-state chemistry, catalytic chemistry, and information science. In addition to those working in the collaborative program, three research groups actively working on data-centric materials science were invited to contribute to the book. With their participation, the subjects in the book are well balanced. This book is composed of three parts. The ï¬rst part reviews the ideas and tools of materials informatics as well as actual applications of machine-learning techniques for materials problems.

This is important so that the right type of data is collected. At the same time, students need to understand that not all problemsolving strategies need to involve the use of mathematics. Rather, attempting to see where the presented problem and an idealized, qualitative model depart from each other is a viable problem-solving strategy (Nersessian, 2008). 4.2.1.4.1.3 Interpret Data and Other Information Appropriately Students need to be able to analyze data in a systematic manner, but also realize that the job is not done until such analysis is interpreted in light of a theoretical framework (Giere, 1990; National Research Council, 2012). This is important because many individuals have the mistaken impression that scientific investigations always take place in a theoretical vacuum. To the contrary, theoretical frameworks always drive the design, conduction of, and interpretation of the results of research (AbiEl-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011; Ford, 2012; Giere, 1990; D. Kuhn, 2010). For example, theoretical frameworks can influence the choice of problems to investigate and the selection of variables on which to focus in an investigation (Lather, 2012; Miles & Huberman, 1984). Furthermore, knowing that differences in property A are statistically different between two objects means little without interpreting the finding in light of a theoretical framework. This is important both as something to do when investigating scientific phenomena, but also to remember that other scientists themselves do this when investigating scientific phenomena (Abi-El-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011; Giere, 1990). 4.2.1.4.1.4 Arrive at Reasonable Conclusions Much of arriving at reasonable conclusions involves interpreting findings in light of a theoretical framework (Abi-El-Mona & AbdâElâKhalick, 2011). But it also involves actively searching for conflicting findings in the literature. For K-12 students, the literature includes books, interviews with experts, and Internet resources. K-12 students need to be able to reconcile conflicting findings to arrive at reasonable conclusions. This can involve looking for what the preponderance of studies show, privileging findings from more reputable sources, considering limitations and delimitations of studies, and synthesizing different elements of findings to create a cohesive whole (Britt et al., 2014). This is a challenging activity for such students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011), who often are blinded by my-side bias (Britt et al., 2014; D. Kuhn, 1991; Stanovich & West, 2008). 4.2.1.4.1.5 Engage in Scientific Discourse Patterns Students also need to know and be able to apply and interpret patterns of STEM discourse, including explanations (Britt et al., 2014; Sandoval, 2003) and persuasive and dialectical argumentation (Bricker & Bell, 2008; Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958). Behind all scientific explanations are theories, data, and/or biases. Students need to be able to recognize such, both as they"
347,292,0.987,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"There are two central spheres for the governance of chemicals in the marine environment within Europe of relevance for the Baltic Sea region: chemicals policy that takes a market perspective and environmental policy that is based on, for example, aquatic parameters which aim to protect health and the environment (Karlsson et al. 2011). Within the market sphere of chemicals policy, substances have been classified and further regulated in the EU since the 1960s. Over time, a strong risk-based foundation has emerged, implying that unacceptable risks must be proven in comprehensive assessment before risk reduction measures could be motivated. The ultimate manifestation of such a view is the Technical Guidance Document (TGD) of the EU, comprising thousands of pages of instructions for scientific risk assessments (see, e.g., ECB 2003), which is applied by experts in various advisory and"
282,250,0.987,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"40. Witte and Reinicke (2005), p. 63, for example, analyse the following motives for companies to engage in partnerships in decreasing order of importance: showing good corporate citizenship, increasing reputation, individual leadership, improving the investment market and meeting government requirements. According to Reich (2002), governments mainly engage in partnerships because they recognise that they need partners to address crucial public policy problems. Companies, by contrast, are suspected to pursue various objectives including future profits and markets, control over international agendas, tax deductions or subsidies for new products. For a more detailed account of the motives of governments, including local governments see, for example, Collin (1998). 41. As mentioned earlier, accountability to mission is a fuzzier concept than accountability for complying with rules or financial accountability. As a result, there are no strict âstandardsâ governing the development of mission statements, neither for partnerships, nor for NGOs. There are, however, numerous handbooks providing relevant advice. Radtke (1998), for example, advises that mission statements should describe the purpose of the organisation, its contribution to that goal and the values guiding its work. Bryce (1992) recommends that missions should be so clearly defined that they can be applied to all NGO activities. Drohan (1999) emphasises that mission statements are working documents that require continued attention. Ingrim (1990) stresses that all those connected with the organisation should understand its mission and that the mission statement should serve as a guide for planning. For a more detailed annotated bibliography relating to NGO missions and visions see, for example, http://www.centerpointforleaders. org/toolkit_biblio_vision.html, last accessed 27 August 2009. 42. Logical frameworks and results chains are crucial elements of results-based management strategies. These management strategies are broadly applied in bilateral and multilateral development agencies and are increasingly adopted by other organisations working in the field of development. Results chains link short-term outputs to medium-term outcomes and long-term impacts. Thereby, they show how individual activities contribute to the achievement of broader development goals. The logical framework is a tool to help results-based planning which links the different levels of objectives and goals to information on how the objective can be measured, how relevant information can be obtained and what external factors could intervene. The handbook and âhow-toâ literature on results-based management is vast. For a brief bibliography on logical frameworks see, for example, den Heyer (2001). UNDP has compiled a short bibliography on resultsbased management (Evaluation Office, 2002, pp. 110â11), as has the Canadian International Development Agency (Results-Based Management Division, 2000, pp. 135â8). 43. Edwards and Hulme, for example, emphasise the difficulty of measuring the performance of NGOs: âA great part of the dilemma faced by GROs [grassroots organisations] and NGOs lies in the nature of the work they do and the messy and complex world in which they do it â measuring performance in relation to the kind of development subscribed to by most NGOs is an extraordinarily difficult task, particularly in relation to âempowermentâ and other qualitative changesâ (Edwards and Hulme, 1995, p. 11). Similarly, Slim (2002) stresses the difficulties of implementing social and environmental accounting practices in NGOs. For the public sector, GÃ¶ran Arvidsson has articulated the problems of efficiency and effectiveness-focused performance evaluations as follows: âPublic activities have intrinsic values which cannot be expressed in terms of economic"
78,145,0.987,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"I begin by discussing three challenges we take to define our Onlife context. I first show how these challenges have been prefigured and addressed in prior philosophical developments, including phenomenology, virtue ethics, Kantian ethics, and others. This discussion then introduces us to the primary features of and contrasts between: the more individual sense of rational-autonomous selfhood characteristic of high modern Western thought, and; more relational senses of selfhood in both historical and contemporary contexts and theories (Bakardjieva 2005). These two notions of selfhood are further illuminated by considerations of embodiment and developments in contemporary philosophy and Internet Studies. This brings us to the core point: the shift from more individual towards more relational selves in contemporary âWesternâ societies, as manifest first of all in our changing practices and theories of âprivacy,â risks a shift towards more hierarchical social structures and non-democratic politiesâand thereby away from high modern democratic processes and norms, including equality and gender equality (Bakardjieva 2009) . I then examine how far democratic processes and norms can be nonetheless preserved Onlife, drawing on notions of hybrid selves, âpartial privacyâ and âcontextual privacyâ (Nissenbaum 2010) and âsubactivismâ (Bakardjieva 2009). By contrast, emerging Confucian democracies, as resting on strongly relational conceptions of selfhood, appear to directly threaten commitments to equality and gender equality. These theoretical and empirical findings highlight the urgency of our contemporary choices regarding media usages. Specifically, where writing and the skills of literacy-print (as the communication modality of high modernity, in contrast with the secondary orality of electric media in general and online communication in particular) are historically correlated with high modern notions of individual"
344,256,0.987,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"1 Introduction A paradox of low political performance exists in many countries (i.e., suboptimal policies persist despite the existence of specific policy instruments that could generate more desirable outcomes). For example, many developing countries that continue to depend largely on agriculture, particularly countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, underinvest in this sector. Especially in areas of public investment that have high returns in terms of growth and poverty reduction, such as agricultural research and extension, public investments remain below the optimal level (Fan and Rao 2003). Accordingly, in addition to an understanding of socioeconomic responses to new policies, avoiding suboptimal agricultural policy choices requires an understanding of the underlying political processes. An improved understanding of the policy process, including the relevant political institutions and their link with the overall political economy, is essential to determining how the participation of stakeholder groups and the use of credible scientific evidence can be promoted in the design and implementation of efficient, pro-poor agricultural strategies. Filling this gap can help identify practical solutions and tools for reducing political performance gaps and facilitate the implementation of improved policies for reducing poverty and promoting growth. However, policy processes are complex and dynamic by nature; these processes involve multiple actors (i.e., individuals and organizations) and are defined by national political, social, cultural and institutional realities (e.g., constitutional rules), bureaucratic structures and capacities, and the informal participation of stakeholder organizations. Few studies have explicitly mapped these processes to"
224,319,0.987,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"poorly understood and insufficiently addressed (cf. Buvinic and King 2007), much has changed over the last half-century in how the subject is approached. When Ester Boserup first illustrated the mutual relationship between the status of women and development, the Millennium Development Goals did not exist to support her claims. This did not dissuade her from arguing that understanding the role that women play within a society is essential to understanding the overall development of that society. She showed that besides womenâs reproductive work, the agricultural labour performed by women is especially crucial to societiesâ economic development (Boserup 1970, 1986, see also Chap. 8 by Ringhofer et al. in this volume). Boserup integrated these deliberations into her multidisciplinary approach cutting across issues of population, agriculture, and technology (see Boserup 1970, among others). Ester Boserupâs theory was unique given the manner in which she integrated women into her fundamental theory of economic change. Her model has stimulated a number of research initiatives and international declarations on the status of women. In fact, her scholarship laid some of the groundwork for the inclusion of equality between men and women throughout the MDGs. Although it is not always cited, Boserupâs model continues to be highly influential in the discourse on women and development within the concepts of gender and development (GAD) and even gender mainstreaming. In a contribution for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Buvinic and King (2007) illustrated the relationships between gender equality and economic performance, arguing that âleveling the field of opportunitiesâ through greater gender equality would have impacts at the household, economy and market, and society levels and thereby enhance aggregate economic performance both in terms of poverty reduction and economic growth. We understand the hypothesis put forth by Buvinic and King as an expression of Boserupâs theories on the relationships between the status of women and development and therefore use it as a reference to test this proposed relationship in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. In Fig. 11.1, we have sketched out the framework of our analysis. We use the UNâs Gender Inequality Index (GII, data source: UNDP 2010) as an indicator reflecting the degree of gender inequality. This indicator covers three dimensions: reproductive health, labour market, and empowerment. These"
219,1091,0.987,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Conceptual Basis The conceptual framework of the case study follows the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) conceptual framework presented in Chap. 2 and in Nkonya et al. (2013). The major characteristic of this framework is that it seeks to apply the Total Economic Value (TEV) approach in the assessment of the costs of land degradation, which implies that the ELD conceptual framework seeks to incorporate the value of not only provisional ecosystem goods and services into its analysis (e.g. crop yields and livestock products), but also of the value of indirect ecosystem services such as supporting, regulating and cultural services (e.g. carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling), option values, as well as non-use values. The elements of this conceptual framework are described in detail in Chap. 2. The ELD conceptual framework divides the causes of land degradation into proximate and underlying, which interact with each other to result in different levels of land degradation. Proximate causes include biophysical factors and unsustainable land management practices, whereas underlying causes include socio-economic and institutional factors such as land tenure security, access to markets, population density, poverty and others (Chaps. 2 and 7)."
264,825,0.987,Proceedings of The 13Th international Congress On Mathematical Education : Icme-13,"skill transfer, teachers, literacy/language aspects of applied math tasks, inter/national surveys) inform our thinking about the conceptualization, teaching, learning, or assessment of mathematical literacy? Given such results, should mathematical literacy be directly taught, or be integrated across curriculum subjects, and how? Or can it emerge as a by-product of teaching âregularâ mathematics? What evidence do we have about possible (re)solutions? Papers and discussions related to these themes were intended to stimulate discussion about key directions for future research related to mathematical literacy. Overall, our TSG included two invited plenary presentations followed by two discussant reactions, eight regular (invited) papers and six short oral communications, nine posters, and extended general discussions during all sessions which were moderated by the team members. Invited plenary papers were presented across the ï¬rst two sessions. The ï¬rst plenary, presented by Geiger, Goos & Forgasz, followed from their (Geiger, Goos, & Forgasz, 2015) editing of a ZDM Journal issue focused on mathematical literacy. This plenary provided a historical overview of the range of terminology and the capabilities and facets commonly associated with these terms. As such, this provided participants with an introduction related to the ï¬rst theme, and an anchor for a range of submissions related to this theme. Among these related papers, North used Dowlingâs theorizing of âgazeâ to consider what a mathematical literacy gaze might be comprised by, and linked his theoretical development to a discussion of possibilities and critiques related to the Mathematical Literacy curriculum in use in the South African post-compulsory phase. Vohns discussed possibilities and avenues for the development of reflective knowledge within mathematical learning, and arguing that this would be important to fulï¬lling requirements for a mathematically literate orientation. Developing notions of particular topics within the broader notion of mathematical literacy were seen in Engel, Gal & Ridgwayâs incorporation of citizenship into earlier work focused on statistical literacy with attention to âcivic statistics, and also in Chenâs attention to spatial literacy. Askew, in his discussant response to Geiger et alâs plenary presentation, presented a range of alternatives for thinking about the relationship between mathematics and mathematical literacy, and raised attention to how tasks and how responses to tasks were evaluated often embodied different conceptualizations of this relationship. His presentations also raised questions about whose responsibility it is to develop some aspects seen as central to conceptualizations of mathematical literacy (e.g., interpretation, critical reflection) that seem to fall outside some conceptualizations of mathematics. In Session 2, Klieme presented a plenary input drawing from his experience within the PISA Mathematical Literacy international assessment analysis team. He focused particularly on the somewhat under-emphasised aspect of comparisons of learning environments across participating nations. In his presentation he shared both the ways in which learning environments were conceptualized within the PISA data gathering process (based on âOpportunity to Learnâ, âTeaching Practicesâ and âTeaching Qualityâ), and cross-cultural comparisons that were possible to draw from their dataset. Of particular interest in his presentation was evidence of the"

We choose this framing because of experiences of confusion around the concept social-ecological system, especially as to how boundary judgements (to the system) and relational dynamics are understood. Our framing choice does not treat a social-biophysical system as a single entity or system, but as a relational dynamic between two systems mediated by human-invented institutions (rules of the game) and technologies. This framing is also an act of inclusion as it recognises the systemic, relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments as well as distinct relational dynamics within a social and a biophysical system (Figs. 9.3 and 9.4); situational framing sets the key initial starting conditions which give rise to inclusivity, or not. Within our preferred framing, concerns like âbiodiversity conservationâ are means of influencing the unfolding dynamic between the social and the biophysical through the design and use of new institutions that serve human purposes in relation to conservation, e.g. the institutional forms of âecosystems servicesâ if they become widespread are likely to have a major impact on this unfolding dynamic (Ison 2011). Framing choices and awareness need to operate at multiple levels and in relation to situations and practices. We have outlined our framing preference for the situations that have to be governed â structurally coupled social-biophysical systems. However, how these might be governed requires another framing choice â here our preference is to see governance situations as akin to âwicked problemsâ or situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, interdependencies, and multiple perspectives where what is at issue has to be constructed by concerned stakeholders (Ison et al. 2007, 2015a). Thus, what is, or is not, inclusive is related to the locked-in historical features of a situation that can create pathway dependencies and to initial starting conditions associated with a new issue or an emergent concern or crisis. As practice in relation to situation unfolds, there are multiple opportunities for being inclusive or not. Here we outline three matters that if not understood can affect inclusivity."
161,11,0.987,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"diabetics in rural Java prompted the emergence of new kinds of communicative practice, speciï¬cally health-related texting among diabetic women, government health workers and volunteer assistants enabled by widening handset and network availability. Using a culture-centred approach, data collected via ï¬eld-based interviews found that some of the rural women participants developed new personal communication strategies for promoting health and well-being, both of themselves and their families. Pitaloka claims that this level of behavioural change demonstrates local agencyâan outcome often desired by communication for development projects. In Chap. 5, Watkins and Baulch use a communicative ecology framework (Watkins, Tacchi, & Kiran, 2009) to investigate the use of media technologies by outreach workers in the HIV/AIDS sector in Bali and Makassar, Indonesia. Their qualitative study found that the everyday uses of mobile phones by the outreach workers were very much disconnected from face-to-face and paper-based systems for testing, treating and reporting on people living with HIV/AIDS by which the national HIV strategy of Indonesia is being executed. The authorsâ ï¬ndings suggest that âorganicâ encounters and informal mobile adoption by both health workers and clients are likely to precede formal mHealth interventions at some sites. Drawing on their interviews with the outreach workers, they demonstrate how these encounters can work to establish new layers of complexity to existing patterns of inequality in access to health services. The ï¬nal two chapters of this book take a wider and more critical view of the evolving mHealth landscape alongside the broader ideological shifts that affect discourses of health. In Chap. 6, Dutta, Kaur-Gill, Tan and Lam argue for more critical scrutiny of the part played by mobile devices in the shift for responsibility for health management from states to individuals. This can be seen in the growing use of ï¬tness apps and devices by individual consumers, which speak to attendant processes around the commodiï¬cation of health. Dutta et al. point out that mHealth scholarship is sorely missing a robust theoretical framework for examining the broader power structure in which mHealth discourse unfolds. The authors also provide a critical literature review which shows that claims for the efï¬cacy of mobile phones in improving health outcomes are âempirically emptyâ due to a striking lack of evidence. Rather, claims for the success of mHealth: â¦have more to do with health-related ï¬nance and time-saving outcomes than health outcomes per se. For example, there are few pre-test and post-test studies to show how mHealth directly improves the health of a community. In this sense, the methodological base for claiming effects is fairly weak (see Sect. 5.1)."

No objective measure of sustainability was used in the three resulting scenarios, with More and Less Sustainable being determined solely with reference to BAUâthere is therefore no suggestion that the More Sustainable future would actually achieve sustainability. Scenario development focused on adopting an interdisciplinary approach covering key elements of the biophysical environment as well as changes in livelihoods, education, economics and governance both locally and internationally. The approach adopted involved close collaboration with stakeholders and the project team with a view to developing both qualitative narratives and quantitative scenarios for the evaluation of management interventions. As such, scenario development involved four main stages: (i) identification of key issues of relevance to stakeholders, (ii) qualitative narratives for the three baseline scenarios to 2050, (iii) quantification of the narratives for baseline scenarios and (iv) identification and evaluation of management interventions (Fig. 9.2). The four stages of scenario development were conducted as part of an iterative process with six national level stakeholder workshops held over the period from October 2013 to May 2016, as outlined in Chap. 10. Identification of key issues and downscaling of the SSPs into the three socio-economic baseline scenarios (stage 1) and the development of the qualitative narratives (stage 2) are outlined with further description in Chap. 10. Stages 3 and 4 are described in 9.4.1 and 9.4.2. A series of interviews were held during 2012 and 2013 with relevant stakeholders, primarily at the national level, with a view to determining Baseline Scenarios"
42,273,0.987,S-BPM in the Production Industry : A Stakeholder Approach,"related to safety, stress level, health and rhythm within the company and working time. A good working relationship facilitates problem solving for workers who can perceive and communicate useful changes in the workplace. Making the working environment efï¬cient and effectual is the natural consequence of a way of working in which both communication and a solid trust system could become the key element of a positive organizational strategy. Saving time and positive economic results are the most important objectives in every company. However, these goals have to be shared by all the different levels of the company organization. Starting from these assumptions, the methodology is based on three main pillars: 1. People 2. Company processes (both organizational and industrial processes) 3. Tools (IT tools, ERP systems and the like) These three pillars can be, respectively, supported by three types of activities that complete and strengthen each other: â¢ Proper speciï¬c training â¢ Ad hoc consultancy â¢ IT tool implementation. These basic activities have to be instantiated based on the actual needs of each company. By applying the methodology, we have learned that these three activities need to be balanced in order to make interventions on the company effective and efï¬cient. Such a balance can be reached only by connecting people, the organizational system and IT solutions, i.e. providing training activities, on-the-ï¬eld consultancy and adequate solutions in terms of products and services. Training activity alone, indeed, is perceived as lacking of practical implications. On the other side consultancy and support activity alone lack awareness and answers to the many different daily problems oriented to peopleâs autonomy. Using tools and technologies helps reducing activities timing and costs. By looking at the case as a whole, beyond this general lesson, few concrete lessons can be learnt for each of the three aspects. [People] Involving users from the beginning of the project increases their willingness to participate. The people-centred approach adopted from the initial phases on and the involvement of the workers in the analysis and design phases supported the project participation in terms of motivation and commitment. Both Company B management and workers declared that such an active involvement allowed creating something actually useful and helpful for their daily working experience. [People] Formative and case evaluation complement each other. Formative and case evaluations are useful for a twofold purpose: (i) supporting the system development and iterative reï¬nement; (ii) user-centredness. On the one hand, they provide an effective means to support the development process, starting with the design of the system until iterative reï¬nements. Since the perception a developer"

This kind of works analysis aims to highlight the real-world work situation in production and in training, in order to identify the multiple horizons of the training situations to be deï¬ned: âtraining for what?â, âtraining how?â, âwhat device(s)?â, âfor what purposes?â (Olry and Vidal-Gomel 2011), considering working conditions for training to be learning conditions for trainees (Chatigny and VÃ©zina 2008). More speciï¬cally, this works analysis method provides the identiï¬cation and analysis of characteristic situations of action (Daniellou 2004) in order to recommend training objectives (Olry and Vidal-Gomel 2011) by formalising baseline professional knowledge (SamurÃ§ay and Rabardel 2004) as well as didactic transpositions (SamurÃ§ay and Rogalski 1998). This refers to identifying the differences and similarities between these two types of situation from the point of view of the activities deployed, those which cannot be deployed, and those which it would be recommended to deploy in order to improve trainee learning and the development of their activity. The analysis of these differences might direct training course design and anticipate the modiï¬cations of the activity of trainers and trainees, and its conditions of realization.

Secondly, asking questions that prompted communities to think about what it means to be more resilient, is not only a way to ascertain how the project has helped improve understanding, but is also key to enabling this resilience. And thirdly, by asking communities âwhat else is needed?â beyond project activities to date helps to inform the details of subsequent activities, and also helps to inform how and what changes to look out for as measures of community-defined success. This example also illustrates that there are practical limits to the âidealâ evaluation process but that it is possible to usefully draw on key principles to inform the approach to evaluating a CCA practice. There were practical limits to full application of a right-based approach, and the extent to which children themselves are included in the development of the approach and the analysis and articulation of learnings. There were also limits to what âcan be known or found outâ through an evaluation about causal relationships between activities and outcomes, when there are a myriad of interacting factors at play. It was nevertheless particularly useful to use the projectâs general theory of change to guide the evaluation, but allowing flexibility for the specific links and relationships â such as how knowledge, combined with formal and informal communication activities would assist communities to advocate for change and influence practice and policy â would emerge. In practice, we developed strong team and organisational partnerships between the NGOs and research organisations involved in the evaluation and the project, which proved particularly valuable given the type of project and the project context. Whilst not âdevelopmental evaluationâ to its full extent â researchers were not embedded in the team on a continuous basis â the approach was far from the âconventionalâ end of the research spectrum where external groups of academic researchers seek out an existing applied project in order to test or calibrate a model or theory. The process involved joint learning and reflection from both implementing and research organisations throughout the project. The project was adjusted in real time to integrate lessons learned from the evaluative research; concurrently, the evaluative approach itself evolved to reflect lessons from the projectâs activities on the ground. Embedding research within practice â in the inherently uncertain context of supporting a community to adapt to climate change â provided new pathways for realising and sharing learnings from the ground, to achieve better adaptation outcomes.

Rather, given the enormous changes reshaping core facets of higher education, and pressures and prospects surrounding assessment, it is more likely that the âtransformational momentâ has yet to come. As this chapter portends, however, with the right investment and intellect the revolution may be closer than ever. This chapter provides contemporary insights into the assessment of higher education learning outcomes, surveying recent progress and clarifying prospects for further transformational advance. It begins by recapping rationales for reforming this facet of higher education. It then takes stock of progress through an evaluative review of several prominent assessment initiatives. While far from exhaustive, this review highlights the broad scope and pretext for growth. Two subsequent sections help channel future energy. First, using risk-assessment logic, the chapter reviews what would appear to be the major change blockers. Second, a broad cost/beneï¬t logic is deployed to identify speciï¬c options for development. With these analyses to hand, the chapter concludes by advancing a program of assessment redesign, and sketching initial tactics for its development. Assessment is a broad area, and this analysis could be progressed in a variety of ways, so it is helpful to clarify scope and assumptions. The term âassessmentâ is interpreted very broadly as involving the measurement, reporting and interpretation of student learning and development. The analysis embraces formative and summative assessment, and ranges from in-class to cross-national practice, but emphasis is placed on formal assessment that is relevant to establishing the quality of individual learning. The analysis is pitched to be policy relevant regardless of whether local or large-scale practice is being addressed. Attention is focused speciï¬cally on assessment, rather than on a host of surrounding activities such as curriculum design, quality assurance or funding, though these are undoubtedly relevant and must be factored into any extended analysis. As these introductory remarks convey, the chapter adopts a critical stance in which it is assumed that assessment must be improved. It is assumed that the continued use of proxy measures for outcomes like statistics on graduate employment or further graduate study, or the use of qualiï¬cation/organisation-level accreditation in place of robust measures of individual competence, is unsatisfactory (for analysis see: Coates 2010). The analysis is driven by a general desire to improve both the quality and productivity of education. To strengthen higher education, it is assumed that assessment must be done better and more efï¬ciently, and it is assumed transparency plays an important role in this. Throughout this chapter, mention is made to âroutineâ, or âconventionalâ, or âtraditionalâ assessment practice. This refers to a vast range of activities which are helpful to clarify at the outset given that this chapter is framed as a critique. Broadly, such assessment can be caricatured as involving academics working alone, and within single institutions to produce technically non-validated assessment materials that map to arbitrary parts of the curriculum of a single subject. Such assessment might be delivered in formats and practices unchanged for many decades, scored normatively by different markers without rubrics or training, analysed using basic additive methods, adjusted to ï¬t percentile distributions, then reported"

These numbers are used for input-output analysis (the Leontief model), which is a basic method of quantitative economics that presents macroeconomic activity as a system of interrelated goods and services. OFNs allow us not only to apply mathematical modeling of imprecise or ambiguous data but also simultaneously portray more information than could be presented by real numbers. It is shown based on the Leontief model, where at the same time the current level, the forecast level, and the level of change of the final demand or the production level can be determined. The example shows that use of OFNs in economic modeling can simplify and deepen the economic analyses."
216,291,0.987,Advances in Production Technology,"14.1 Motives for Integrating Human Factors in Production Engineeringâthe Challenge Production systems are not like they used to be. The 21st century will confront enterprises and manufacturing companies with completely novel generations of technologies, services, and products based on computer technologies (Schuh and Gottschalk 2008; Schuh et al. 2009). In order to meet competition on global markets and to ensure long-term success, the companies need to adapt to shorter delivery times, increasing product variability and high market volatility, by which enterprises are able to sensitively and timely react to continuous and unexpected changes (Wiendahl et al. 2007). One of the major cornerstones to meet these challenges is the implementation of digital information and communication technologies into production systems, processes and technologies, which allow novel developments by combining the physical world and fast data access and data processing via the Internet (Industry 4.0). Another major cornerstone is to understand the impact of the human factor and to integrate human factors knowledge seamlessly in the technology development cycle, thus moving from traditionally purely technical systems into socio-technical systems. In the next decades new generations of technology systems and products have to master fundamental societal and technological challenges (Wilkowska and Ziefle 2011). This includes the impact of the greying society, with an increasingly aged work force, but also short technological life cycles triggered by fast changing technological systems and the question in how far diversely skilled workers might learn and adapt to the increasing complexity of systems (Ziefle and Jakobs 2010). Although the crucial potential of usable products that are appropriate for a diverse user group, recognition of the importance of diversity is only slowly influencing mainstream technology development practise. New approaches integrate users as a valuable source for new ideas and innovations (end-user driven innovation cycle) and integrate their knowledge as an integral component into the technical development (Franke and Piller 2004). User communities are a signiï¬cant source for innovation and provide market insight before launching an innovative product (Fredberg and Piller 2011). For high-wage countries, which are characterized by competitive production systems and a high pressure to succeed, it is more than high time to integrate human factors knowledge as a natural and expert source of information into the technology development and processing. We conclude that these challenges can only be addressed if methods from production engineering are âreinventedâ and combined with methods from the social sciences. Only a holistic inter- and transdisciplinary methodology will be able to address the changing production processes and changing workforce, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of companies in high-wage countries (Calero Valdez et al. 2012)."
365,715,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Abstract To support countries implementing CSA solutions, the Economics and Policy Innovations for Climate Smart Agriculture (EPIC) group at FAO uses a methodology based on building a solid evidence base. The knowledge gained from datasets that combine household, geographical and climate data helps design policies that enhance food security and climate resilience while also taking advantage of mitigation opportunities to obtain financing. Appropriate application of CSA principles depends on specific conditions that vary between and within countries. Demographic, environmental, economic and institutional factors are all important determinants of the effectiveness of any particular policy. This chapter builds upon econometric results obtained from previous analyses by developing a conceptual model that introduces the temporal aspects of household vulnerability. The method is based on a factorial design with two vulnerability levels (high and low) and two production methods (conventional or business as usual, and improved agricultural management with high CSA potential). Farms are classified into groups based on cluster analysis of survey data from Zambia. Results provide a baseline consisting of probability distributions of yields, labor use, cash inputs and profit for each of the four combinations of vulnerability level and production system. This is useful for stochastic dominance analysis, but additional work is required to incorporate the temporal aspect of the problem. The chapter identifies data gaps and additional analyses required to capture the spatio-temporal aspects of household vulnerability and adaptive capacity."

He renamed the model the Intercultural Development Continuum (IDC), which currently describes ï¬ve consecutive and distinctive orientations of intercultural awareness and competence. In Table 1 an overview of the developmental orientations identiï¬ed in the IDC are given. The related IDI is a psychometric self-assessment instrument and repeatedly has seen conï¬rmatory testing on content validity, cross-cultural validity and reliability (Hammer 2011). The IDI measures how a person perceives the own level of intercultural competence (PO), and the actual development orientation (DO), indicating the real level of intercultural competence. The orientation gap (OG) is the difference between the PO and the DO scores. According to Hammer et al. (2003), an orientation gap larger than seven IDI points indicates a person does not have a realistic perception of the own level of intercultural competence. The IDI includes the ability to insert customized questions."

The control center N-USOC9 is part of a distributed network of small control rooms operating individual equipment onboard the ISS.

The research engineers at N-USOC can be seen as a form of lab technicians, helping researchers transform ideas into workable experiments, testing and verifying equipment and procedures before the seeds are sent to the IS. Then they monitor the experiment as it is conducted.

87,175,0.987,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","Interdisciplinary integration raises the issues of the compatibility and connectivity of disciplinespecific knowledge. Integration in this sense has to be seen in both directions. On the one hand, a joint definition of âstudy objectsâ and scientific models is required, which goes beyond disciplinary perspectives. On the other hand, the new knowledge has also to be transferred back into disciplinary discourses. Similarly, the integration of research results comprises, in one respect, summarising and validation of case specific knowledge with regard to problem under investigation. The evaluative focus from such a perspective is on usability. In another vein, scientists have to, at least partly, retransfer the new knowledge in discipline-specific context. This requires the identification of generalisable, nomothetic parts of knowledge (Lang et al. 2012). Research outcomes of transdisciplinary research (concepts, methods and products) are evaluated from two different perspectives. Firstly, outcomes are assessed with regard to their usability, their practical relevance. Local actors care for their case and not for any general knowledge. To solve the problem âin principleâ would not be acceptable to the audience and the local actors who push the case. Thus, each case has its individual value, because the involved"

77,18,0.987,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"et al. 2007; Graham 2002; Kuh et al. 2003). These models anticipate different patterns and therefore help clarify the mechanisms through which individualsâ multiple trajectories interact. The critical period model assumes that part of the differences in health observed across social groups is explained by exposures occurring in specific periods of development. Deprivation, illness, divorce, risk behaviours (for example smoking, unbalanced diet) are such exposures. Because of their timing, hitting individuals in those critical periods of their life course, these events might lead to irreversible damages or diseases (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Marmot and Wadsworth 1997). At first, critical periods have been chiefly related to the biological, cognitive and psychosocial development during foetal life, infancy and childhood. The biological programming hypothesis formulated by David Barker (1997) suggests that poor nutrition during foetal life is associated with increased risk of diseases in adult life. Consequently, authors have suggested that other critical periods for psychosocial and social development may be important for health. Examples include entry into the labour market, leaving the parental home, establishing oneâs own residence, the transition to parenthood, job insecurity, or exit from the labour market (Bartley et al. 1997). In this volume, the chapter by Johnson et al. dedicated to body size and cardio-metabolic health examines the influences on trajectories of critical periods and transitions, occurring both at the biological and behavioural level. Since social scientists consider that the term âcritical periodâ primarily resonates with biological determinism, they prefer the notion of âsensitive periodâ (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002; Bornstein 1989; Halfon and Hochstein 2002), or âtime associated vulnerabilityâ (Wadsworth 1999). These propose a less deterministic model, where an exposure in a particular period of the life span increases the risk of but does not necessarily result in irreversible damage. The pathway model hypothesises that the effect of early disadvantage is indirect (Graham 2002). It highlights the different factors, such as lifestyles, educational achievement, social class, health behaviours that can act as mediators between early life social situations and adult health. For example, childhood adversity might restrict educational opportunities which in turn restrict socioeconomic wealth and resources, which in turn influence health behaviours, resulting in poorer health in late life. This model considers that the effect of early life factors on health later in life can be modified to some extent by circumstances occurring at various life stages (Power and Hertzman 1997). The metaphor of the domino aptly summarises the pathway model, also called the âtriggerâ model. The accumulation model suggests that life course exposure to adverse environmental and socioeconomic conditions and to health damaging behaviours accumulate over time. Two main fields can be identified: first, the accumulative risk model examines the sum of adverse exposures and risks in the lives of individuals and how these have an increasing influence on health outcomes over time. Second, the cumulative advantage and disadvantage model considers that those with advantaged origins tend to experience subsequent advantageous life course trajectories (OâRand 1996, 2009), resulting in increasing differences with underprivileged groups over time (Dannefer 2003). This model emphasizes how advantaging or disadvantaging"
395,35,0.987,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"and the discursive practices in which action and interactions are made accountable to oneself and to the others. Everyday safety is based on the use of discursive and material artifacts which embody not only practical knowledge and experience but also the history and social relations implicit in the mediating artifact. It follows that safety is performed in, by and through social relations, which are relatively stable and have the capacity to deploy a variety of heterogeneous materials in support of working practices. â¢ It is always rooted in a context of interaction, and it is acquired through some form of participation in a community of practice. The idea that safety knowledge is inextricably bound up with action suggests that we should discard the prejudice that practical knowledge is an inferior form of knowledge. Safety knowledge is competence-to-act, and as such it is primarily tacit and taken for granted, as well as being deeply rooted in individual and collective identity. It is tied to particular circumstances, like for example the need to repair breakdowns in the meaning system on which action is based, or the effort to transfer such competence outside its context of origin. Therefore, safety learning does not consist of the appropriation or acquisition of pieces of knowledge, instead it is viewed as the development of situated identities based on participation, within a community of practice (Lave and Wenger 1991; Wenger 1998). A key element for interpreting safety knowledge in organizations thus is the process whereby novices become part of professional âworldsâ, become competent in mastering the jargon and the micro-decisions in the system of social practices which regulate participation in situated working practices. â¢ It is continually re-produced and negotiated, and hence it is always dynamic and provisional. The overall picture, therefore, is one in which safety knowledge is no longer conceived as a stable entity that can be situated in individuals or groups, in technologies or rules; it is instead processual knowledge (knowing) emerging from actions and in constant evolution. Safety knowledge is a provisional and performed set of associations among heterogeneous materials; it is therefore the outcome of a âdoingâ which uses as its resources for action such diverse materials as people, technologies, textual and symbolic forms assembled within a social context characterized by the presence of multiple collective and individual actors occupying speciï¬c power relations. Safety knowledge is sociomaterial and it is the local product of a craft, based on knowledge resources âdisembeddedâ from their original context and made available through their transformation, legitimization, institutionalization and circulation. However, these resources are then re-embedded in other contexts, in a process which constantly alters both knowledge and the local context of action. In summing up, we may say that the engineering of heterogeneous elements involves an effort to integrate modes of action proper to several working practices in the organization and sustained by members who, in that they are engaged in different practices and in different communities of practice, deal with safety in different ways. âSafety knowledgeâ therefore takes the form of a âculturalâ competence able to influence the style and manner in which meaning and value are attributed to events"
128,160,0.987,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"which are relevant for research on solidarity. We label the first one as a thesis about the consequences of the level of social capital. According to this argument, the more dense and diverse the social networks of an individual are, as well as the more trusting a person is, the more prone he or she is to get involved in cooperative behavior (Coleman 1988) andâconsequentlyâin solidarity action. The second stance may be labeled as a thesis on the consequences of the type of social capital. It assumes that the type of structural and normative elements of social capital affects individualâs propensity to engage in solidarity action. Two types of social capital are differentiated in this context. The so-called bonding or thick social capital is based on relatively homogenous relations with family and friends. It entails strong norms of mutual support and thus might be exclusive. It is claimed that, for example, closed self-help groups may be based on this type of social capital and due to the effects of this form of social capital is named by some authors an âinwardlookingâ social capital. Extreme form of this asset is close to traditional familialism (Banfield 1967; Portes 1998). On the other hand, the so-called bridging social capital, based on horizontal, crosscutting social networks and values of openness and generalized trust, positively contributes to social cooperation and public good at a systemic level (Putnam et al. 1994; Granovetter 1973). When explaining causal mechanism which constitutes relation between social capital and solidarity action, a more general framework of its role in shaping political participation may be referred to. Following van Stekelenburg and Klandermans (2013), three mechanisms arising from diverse components of social capital may be pointed to in this regard. Firstly, the structural element of social capital refers to whom people can reach in actions of political participation. For example, engaging time to support the rights of refugees living in the camp in oneâs country may result from personal networks to volunteers already engaged in helping this group. Secondly, the relational component of social capital refers to informational, physical and emotional incentives toward solidarity action. Thus, the bigger and more diverse oneâs personal network is, the more information one has about, for example, significant adversity that other people are experiencing, methods of action to engage in help, possibilities to pool resources for action. Finally, the cognitive element encompasses shared representations, interpretations, systems of meaningâit may lead to consciousness raising or shaping oneâs political beliefs. This aspect of social embeddedness contributes to individualsâ beliefs about whose and which"

212,522,0.987,Life Cycle Management,"Access to (elementary) education is a human right and technical and professional education shall be made generally available and equally accessible to all according to article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN 1948). Education is also a fundamental determinant not only of health, demographic trends and individual income, but also of a countryâs aggregate level of economic growth (IIASA 2008) and thus provides the most promising route toward sustainable development. Furthermore, the authors consider that education at all levels â from primary school via university to lifelong learning â is crucial to improving the understanding and minimization of environmental and socio-economic impacts. Thus, further promotion of life cycle sustainability management (LCSM) â which follows a holistic approach for better informed decisions â is paramount. LCSM is a powerful approach that has been recognized by multinational companies for the last decade. It helps to structure decision-making processes to follow a life cycle perspective in business and industry across an ever-increasing number of organisations in industrialized countries. In response to the need for improved understanding and technical skills on LCSM, a number of life cycle-focused initiatives worldwide have incorporated capacity-building in their missions.1 To illustrate this development, it is worth highlighting the work of the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. It establishes the strengthening of LCSM/LCA capacities worldwide. Since its creation in 2002, more than 30 training events in about 18 developing countries (Sonnemann et al. 2015) have been organized, not to forget the support of the life cycle management (LCM) capability maturity model (CMM) implementation in developing countries between 2012 and 2013 (Swarr et al. 2015a, b).

356,189,0.987,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Multi-criteria Recommender Systems In traditional recommender systems, the utility function considers only one criteria, typically a global evaluation of resources or a valuation from the user. Depending on the systems under consideration, the utility function may be a valid approach though it is rather limited, since the utility of a given element for a particular user may depend on multiple factors. Taking this into consideration, in the past few years the study of multicriteria recommender systems has increased (Lakiotaki et al. 2008, 2011; PlantiÃ© et al. 2005). Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a very mature and active research area (Figueira et al. 2005).

323,48,0.987,Satellite Earth Observations and Their Impact on Society and Policy,"System of Systems (GEOSS), and a number of other initiatives. The earliest efforts of multilateral coordination in remote sensing were with meteorological satellites. The WWW, the principal activity of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), is a cooperative program for collecting, processing, and disseminating meteorological data from satellites and other sources, aiming to maximize the utilization of meteorological data from satellites. The Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) meets annually to coordinate technical standards among satellite operators. Intergovernmental agencies afï¬liated with the UN play a signiï¬cant role in these initiatives for multilateral coordination of Earth observation and research for the protection of the environment. Among these are the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), which studies physical aspects of climate change, and Future Earth, which operates under the auspices of the International Council for Science (ICSU). The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the UN Educational, Scientiï¬c, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the WMO also help in planning these international research efforts. Funding agencies, such as the International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research (IGFA) and what is now known as the Belmont Forum, also play an important role. To respond to the need for long-term climate monitoring, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) was established as a user-driven operational system capable of providing the comprehensive observations required for monitoring the climate system; detecting and attributing climate change; assessing impacts of, and supporting adaptation to, climate variability and change; application to national economic development; and research to improve understanding, modeling, and prediction of the climate system (GCOS 2016).6 The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) is a permanent global system for observations, modeling, and analysis of marine and ocean variables to support operational ocean services worldwide (GOOS 2016). A central purpose of these research programs is to inform and influence national policies and international agreements on environmental management. In the ï¬rst instance, coordination is a matter of avoiding unnecessary duplication of efforts and ensuring that there are no gaps in coverage regarding key roles played by satellite observations. At the same time, it is important to agree on rules and procedures (e.g., format standardization, data principles, and sometimes joint program planning), allowing for healthy competition among Earth-observing programs to encourage the flow of innovations that can expand the capacity of space agencies to play constructive roles in dealing with a variety of environmental problems. Coordination is also a matter of linking the contributions of a variety of Earth observation instruments, including ocean buoys, meteorological stations and balloons, seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, remote-sensing satellites, computerized forecasting models, and early warning systems (Group on Earth Observations 2008).

21,95,0.987,intertwingled : The Work and influence of Ted Nelson,"Managing research data is similarly a problem of defining and maintaining relationships amongst multi-media objects. Research data do not stand alone. They are complex objects that can be understood only in relation to their context, which often includes software, protocols, documentation, and other entities scattered over time and space [8]. The need to model these complex relationships stimulated technical research in persistence, identity, and linking of research objects [4, 26, 28, 38]. These approaches build uponâand are limited byâthe technical capabilities of the World Wide Web. As research data become valued as objects to be maintained, reused, and repurposed, many stakeholders are coming together to address questions of linking, identity, and stewardship. These concerns cross boundaries of scholarly communication, computer science, publishing, research funding, libraries, archives, data repositories, and education [8, 9, 13, 34]. Breakthroughs on these data problems may contribute to understanding hypertextuality, and vice versa."
342,3,0.987,Semiotics in Mathematics Education,"Over the last three decades, semiotics has gained the attention of researchers interested in furthering the understanding of processes involved in the learning and teaching of mathematics (see, e.g., Anderson et al. 2003; SÃ¡enz-Ludlow and Presmeg 2006; Radford 2013a; Radford et al. 2008, 2011; SÃ¡enz-Ludlow and Kadunz 2016). Semiotics has long been a topic of relevance in connection with language (e.g., Saussure 1959; Vygotsky 1997). But what is semiotics, and why is it signiï¬cant for mathematics education? Semiosis is âa term originally used by Charles S. Peirce to designate any sign action or sign process: in general, the activity of a signâ (Colapietro 1993, p. 178). A sign is âsomething that stands for something elseâ (p. 179); it is one segmentation of the material continuum in relation to another segmentation (Eco 1986). Semiotics, then, is âthe study or doctrine of signsâ (Colapietro 1993, p. 179). Sometimes designated âsemeioticâ (e.g., by Peirce), semiotics is a general theory of signs or, as Eco (1988) suggests, a theory of how signs signify, that is, a theory of sign-iï¬cation. The study of signs has long and rich history. However, as a self-conscious and distinct branch of inquiry, semiotics is a contemporary ï¬eld originally flowing from two independent research traditions: those of C.S. Peirce, the American philosopher who originated pragmatism, and F. de Saussure, a Swiss linguist generally recognized as the founder of contemporary linguistics and the major inspiration for structuralism. In addition to these two research traditions, several others implicate semiotics either directly or implicitly: these include semiotic mediation (the âearlyâ Vygotsky 1978), social semiotic (Halliday 1978), various theories of representation (Goldin and Janvier 1998; Vergnaud 1985; Font et al. 2013), relationships amongst sign systems (Duval 1995), and more recently, theories of embodiment that include gestures and the body as a mode of signiï¬cation (Bautista and Roth 2012; de Freitas and Sinclair 2013; Radford 2009, 2014a; Roth 2010). Components of some of these theories are elaborated in what follows. The signiï¬cance of semiosis for mathematics education lies in the use of signs; this use is ubiquitous in every branch of mathematics. It could not be otherwise: the Â© The Author(s) 2016 N.

(2015) and Skovsmose and Greer (2012). Looking into the future much more is on its way. Let me just refer to some doctoral studies in progress that I am familiar with. Ana Carolina Faustino addresses dialogical processes in primary mathematics education. Not least inspired by the work of Freire, dialogic education has developed with many references to adult education. However, Faustino is going to rework the very conception of dialogue with particular reference to younger children. Amanda Queiroz Moura investigates mathematics education for deaf students. This brings her to address particular aspects of inclusive education as well as of dialogical education, and in this way to provide new dimensions to the discussion for mathematics education for social justice. JoÃ£o Luiz Muzinatti works with middle class students, and through different mathematical projects he is challenging a range of assumptions and preconceptions that dominate middle class discourses. Thus Muzinatti formulates new concerns of critical mathematics education. Guilherme Henrique Gomes da Silva addresses afï¬rmative actions. He investigates the different components of such actions, emphasising that afï¬rmative actions also must address the very educational format of university studies. This way da Silva brings a new speciï¬city to the discussion of afï¬rmative actions. We always have to remember that much research in mathematics education is not presented in English, but in other languages. The same applies to critical mathematics education. Here one ï¬nds important contribution in Portuguese as, for instance, Biotto Filho (2015), Marcone (2015) and Milani (2015). (See also, Skovsmose 2001, 2007, 2008; Valero and Skovsmose 2012.)"

After a dramatic interruption due to the Second World War, mathematicians were again involved in instances of reforming. In many countries, the ideas and principles of the so-called New Math were shared. We can recognise a common interest in reforming curricula, which may be related to the impact of a new generation of mathematicians on the reorganisation of mathematics initiated by the Bourbaki Group. Thus, although the concrete results of the New Math movement were very different in various countries, a common feature was that substantial innovation entered into school practice through the active involvement of eminent ï¬gures such as Gustave Choquet and Jean DieudonnÃ© in France, Emma Castelnuovo in Italy, and Hans Freudenthal in the Netherlands. Castelnuovo is an interesting exemplar of actions coming from inside the school, showing how the particular structure of the Italian school system could allow innovation coming from teachers. In the context of this reform, new perspectives developed that moved the focus of reflection from issues concerning mathematical content and its organisation in an appropriate curriculum to issues concerning the description and explanation of the learning and teaching of mathematics, giving birth to a new scientiï¬c discipline, the didactics of mathematics, that rapidly developed through active international interaction. In some cases, for instance in France and Italy, it is possible to recognise again the strong influence of the mathematicians community, since the ï¬rst generation of researchers in the didactics of mathematics consisted for the most part of academics afï¬liated with mathematics departments. This observation does not ignore the existence of a recurrent tension between mathematicians and researchers in mathematics education. In summary, some common features that can be considered the core of the European tradition of didactics of mathematics can be directly related also to the uninterrupted and fruitful commitment of mathematicians to educational issues and in their intent to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics. An example is the strong role that proofs and proving have in all European traditions."

In fact, UCD and Agile show some complementary aspects: on the one hand, UCD does not address how to implement the software, while Agile provides large ï¬exibility in accommodating changing requirements; on the other hand, Agile does not directly address user experience (UX) aspects, although valuing customer involvement in the development process. However, even though the integration of UCD and Agile appears promising, it also presents some issues and no fully satisfactory approach to it has been found yet. In particular, three communication breakdowns [4] hampering such integration have been identiï¬ed [5], namely a variable interpretation of user involvement, a mismatch in the value of documentation, and a misalignment in iteration phases. In this paper, we reï¬ne this framework by discussing a new case study looking at the practices of a software and interaction design company. To support our analysis, we deï¬ne the main actors involved and how they are mutually linked in a communication network, comparing the latter with the one resulting from the case study presented in [5].

This is possible because they have internalized the system so thoroughly that they are able to mentally simulate it as a dynamic ï¬eld of potential, enabling them to engage in âwhat-ifâ interactions of an exploratory, conversational form. In mathematics, this ability is particularly powerful, because of the dependence on representations that we have described above. We will describe several classes of technology environments that provide dynamic and/or socially-distributed interfaces with important representational systems in mathematics. These environments offer the potential for learners (even very young learners) to enter into a relationship with those systems, which we describe as co-action. We argue that the experience of relationships of co-action with mathematical structures can contribute to a transformative educational program. Of course, we do not argue that a technology that opens a possibility for co-action is sufï¬cient in itself to give learners access to mathematical understandings that were the hard-won rewards of a lifetime of study for mathematicians of the past. However, we do suggest that carefully planned educational experiences with such environments can remove barriers to broader participation in a culture of mathematical literacy and fluency. Extreme care is necessary here, as the long history of teaching and learning with static representations should not be ignored in the work to envision its future successor. Instead, we must proceed by pondering how digital and socially distributed representations of mathematical entities can contribute in new ways to genuine mathematical understanding. We see digital and shared representations as capable of adding dimensions to static representational systems and further improving the cycle of: exploration, conjecture, explanation, and justiï¬cation. Moreover, as educational systems incorporate such environments and experiences, traditional pathways of learningâwill gradually give way to new cultural and institutional structures that realize the potential of these innovations. In the sections below, we give two brief examples of co-action, one emphasizing dynamic representations, and the other highlighting socially distributed representations."
224,267,0.987,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"I think the basic gender differentiating perspective of Ester Boserup has been very fruitful for various pathways of engendering farming systems in addition to what can be called âfemale economyâ or âthe economy as a gendered structureâ (Cagatay et al. 1995). However, many arguments that refer to the âevolutionaryâ or factororiented analytical approach in addition to the lack of analysis of structural and power relations have been raised. The main critique of Boserupâs approach in the early 1980s (BenerÃ­a and Sen 1981) was directed at the neoclassical foundations as they lacked theoretical considerations and a foundation from a feminist and social science point of view. My view is that all of the debates resulted in very productive advancement in theoretical, empirical and activist work. The term âinvisible womanâ, which showed the marginalisation of womenâs activities in modernisation processes (commercialisation/market integration), was introduced by the first gender adviser of the World Bank (see Scott 1979) following Boserupâs work. This position was created in 1977 and was the starting point of transnational gender development policies (Lachenmann 1996) that have likely led to âmainstreaming genderâ, which is seen as requisite condition in development agencies and programmes. However, it has given transnational womenâs and feminist movements the opportunity to enter the transnational public sphere and pursue political and methodological struggles about âengendering developmentâ (Lachenmann 2008a). The appropriation of respective terms shows the loss of the meaning of the âempowerment of womenâ, a term that was introduced by DAWN Development Alternatives for Women for a New Era. The classical âWomen in Developmentâ and the later marginalised âGender approachâ have not led to fundamental changes (Molyneux and Razavi 2005). However, they have allowed for the engendering of debates and policies about gender orders, relations, constructs. Thereby, Boserupâs seemingly static concept of âwomenâs role in developmentâ, which is often still used without taking into account power relations and only looking at a quasi-natural division of labour, has been overcome. The first concept of âstrengthening womenâs role in developmentâ perpetuated this âsystem of ignoranceâ. The scapegoat of feminism"
166,38,0.987,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"4.2 Interdisciplinarity and the Need for Transparency At the start of this chapter we noted two defining features of the LIVES research programme besides the shared substantive goal of investigating the experience of vulnerability at different stages and key transitions of the life course. These features were its interdisciplinarity â both within and across the various individual projects involved â and a predominant emphasis on quantitative methods. Yet while the overriding methodological approach of the LIVES projects relies on survey data collection, variations in implementation can be observed as a result of deeply entrenched, unique methodological traditions of the different disciplines involved. Each discipline has its own toolbox, which is not purely technical but also acts as a lens through which to look at social phenomena, and to produce, manipulate and interpret data. Such âtraditionsâ are apparent when reading different journals,3 but most of the time they manifest themselves as strong but implicit rules governing the conduct of research within a given scientific field. In this book, as in the LIVES project more generally, there has been no attempt to obviate this reality. As a result of varied disciplinary priorities, the various projects described have inevitably paid more or less attention to different sources of error in their data, or emphasised different notions of quality over others. One example of this concerns measurement, where it is not just that the questions asked of respondents in different disciplines can differ, but also that the priorities, in terms of design, can vary: for example, psychologists tend to privilege âvalidatedâ scales, often long, while sociologists tend to favour shorter multi-item measures. Similarly, the way in which household income is considered will often be different in economic models where exact values are seen as important, while in other"
209,20,0.987,Deliberative Public Engagement With Science : An Empirical investigation,"The importance of context for public engagement has been extolled in the political science and STS (science, technology, and society) literatures (Delgado et al., 2011; Delli Carpini et al., 2004). In some ways, however, context seems to be a scapegoat for âinconsistent results.â That is, the argument goes like this: Context must matter, because studies that analyze, compare, and even pit one type of engagement against another, in various contexts, find inconsistent results. Indeed, some studies, mostly conducted in health policy contexts, have compared deliberation, education-only, and measurement-only control groups or survey, interview, or discussion procedures. These studies often find greater change in knowledge and/or attitudes when deliberative methods are used instead of other methods (Abelson et al., 2003; Barabas, 2004; Carman et al., 2014; De Vries et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011). However, other studies, such as Denver, Hands, and Jonesâs (1995) study of deliberative poll participants in the UK, find no change in knowledge or attitudes, and yet others suggest deliberation may facilitate the biased strengthening of pre-existing attitudes (Kahan, 2012; Sunstein, 2002). Even within our single program of research, which used highly similar methods, measures, and participants, we found inconsistent results from one study to another, as we describe in later chapters. For the most part, it is still unclear whether the differences in results that come from diverse studies in the field are due to process differences such as variation in the operationalization of âdeliberationâ or whether studies are truly illustrating effects due to the context in which the processes are used or whether the effects are simply unstable and difficult to consistently achieve. Regardless, letâs assume context does matter: âcontextâ still doesnât provide a very informative explanation for different results. Findings that effects vary across studies and contexts beg for an answer to the question: Why? And âwhyâ questions in turn beg for analyses of âhowâ and the use of methods that can test causal processes. Experimental studies of public engagement that use random assignment and control groups, especially those that connect features-processes-outcomes, are increasing but still relatively rare (Carman et al., 2013; Friess & Eilders, 2015). Such studies can, however, be very fruitful and enlightening. For example, relating to the knowledge increases commonly found during engagements, a deliberative experiment by Muhlberger and Weber (2006) found that knowledge gains were more likely due to reading the materials, with no additional knowledge gains attributable to the deliberative discussion. In a later study, Esterling, Neblo, and Lazer (2011) used experimental methods to compare deliberative discussion that included online discussion with oneâs political representatives, with an information-only group, or a true control group (receiving no information). In contrast to the Muhlberger and Weber study, their methods found deliberative discussion participants gained more knowledge than either the control or information-only groups. But they also showed the increased knowledge was likely due to seeking out policy-relevant information outside of the experiment. This suggests their participants were motivated to appear"

245,585,0.987,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"globalization in education policy have largely been a consequence of the OECDâs activities. Its powerful discourse began to influence education in the mid-nineties further to the increasing visibility and credibility of its work on cross-national, comparative educational indicators and statistics (Martens and Wolf 2009). Nowadays, the OECD appears as a trend-setter with an authoritative voice in education policy. In this respect, scholars (Amaral and Neave 2009; Martens and Wolf 2009) have referred to its mode of governance as âopinion formationâ. Grek (2010) claims that the OECD established their authority through the generation and management of sophisticated knowledge, ever more determinant for the orientation of education policy, giving birth to the so-called knowledge politics. She further argues that the policy agendas of the EU and the OECD have been converging, in a union cemented by knowledge and mutual policy learning. The result has been a growing alliance between these two influential actors operating in the European education space, constructing policy problems together, articulating and diffusing new norms and principles (Grek 2010). Both the EU and the OECDâs role in shaping education, its goals and its organization is already acknowledged in policy circles. Their role is mediated by a powerful discourse of globalization, more political than educational, which constructs solutions, produces new conceptual categories or redeï¬nes older ones (Lawn and Lingard 2002). The two organizations also coincide in their modus operandi (Amaral and Neave 2009; Grek 2010). In the absence of enforcement tools over member states, persuasion through discourse, networking, soft law and indirect approaches are employed to summon policy consensus and shape opinion favourable to policy-in-the-making when legislative action is not an option (Amaral and Neave 2009). In the following, attention turns to the emergence and the construction of teaching and learning as a policy problem. An analysis of relevant policy documents has been undertaken in search for the contexts in which teaching and learning has been mentioned, its dimensions, the rationales invoked and the suggested recommendations. Teaching and learning has evolved from a topic of little signiï¬cance in the early days of the Bologna Process to a forefront concern and a dimension deemed crucial for the success of the intended reforms. The chapter sets out to explore its ascendant trajectory and the likely reasons behind it. It argues that the evolution of this policy issue has increasingly reflected the discourse promoted by the European Commission and by the OECD, resulting in the subordination of teaching and learning to the imperatives of globalization and economy. Under a logic of utilitarianism, performance and efï¬ciency teaching and learning is exhorted to align to market needs and to develop employability/entrepreneurship."
365,520,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Abstract The predicted effects of climate change call for a multi-dimensional method to assess the performance of various agricultural systems across economic, environmental and social dimensions. Climate smart agriculture (CSA) recognizes that the three goals of climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience must be integrated into the framework of a sustainable agricultural system. However, current methods to determine a systemsâ ability to achieve CSA goals are lacking. This paper presents a new simulation-based method based on the Regional Integrated Assessment (RIA) methods developed by the Agricultural Model Inter-comparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) for climate impact assessment. This method combines available data, field- and stakeholder-based surveys, biophysical and economic models, and future climate and socio-economic scenarios. It features an integrated farm and household approach and accounts for heterogeneity across biophysical and socioeconomic variables as well as temporal variability of climate indicators. This method allows for assessment of the technologies and practices of an agricultural system to achieve the three goals of CSA. The case study of a mixed crop livestock system in western Zimbabwe is highlighted as a typical smallholder agricultural systems in Africa."

140,98,0.987,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Burnes & Cook (2013) have written an extensive review of âï¬eld theoryâ research by that name. A broader framework, however, placing ï¬eld theory in a larger social science context, would be highly desirable. Only a few generations ago, about all that existed of âpolitical scienceâ was what we now call leadership theory, public policy and administration, and political philosophy. Psychology was dominated by the psychoanalysis schools inspired by Freud and behavior conditioning theories of Pavlov and Skinner. Crowd psychology, especially mob psychology (Le Bon) hinted at a crude form of ï¬eld theory. But so far as I can see presently, it was the insight of Adam Smith and the dynamic âinvisible handâ of the market place (the idea that the behavior of individuals and communities in interaction had a dynamic of their own that needed to be understood as distinct from individual psychology or crowd dynamics), that ushered in a third âlevel of analysis,â the system level. Today, of course, there is wide acceptance of the insights by Singer (1961) and othersâ that at least three analytic levels (individual, organizational or bureaucratic, and systemic) are needed in international relations theory, each with their own structures and functions. But even today, there is no systematic effort to integrate them into a multi-level theory, not to mention to follow the work of Richardson to examine longer term multi-nation dynamics. In this context of inchoate theory development, Rudyâs ï¬eld theory transcends earlier efforts in relative clarity and comprehensiveness."
223,84,0.987,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"perspectives. In modernity it is also recognized that there is not just one single type of rationality but different types, which cannot be reduced to each other. Each type determines its own principles. Developing Kantâs ideas about theoretical, practical, and aesthetic rationality further, Habermas (1984) paradigmatically distinguished between cognitive, moral, and aesthetic rationality. Habermas built not only on Kantâs work but also on that of Max Weber, who first made rationality a key concept in modernistic thinking and used the term specifically in the sense of purposive rationality or economic rationality, the meaning it is also often has in colloquial language. It thereby denotes the strategic choice of the best means to reach a certain goal. In this way rational decision-making became of central interest and positioned rationality and action theory as core concepts in high modernity. Weber elaborated the role of rationality for individual everyday actions and called attention to the tendency toward disenchantment, that is, toward continuous differentiation and rationalization. Rationalization in this sense designates a historical drive toward a world in which âone can, in principle, master all things by calculationâ (Weber, 1919/1946, p. 136), by rational decision-making. This process of rationalization was not limited to the economic sphere but was extended with its own rational logics also to law and administration, the social and political spheres, and other domains. As a prerequisite, a peculiarly rational and intellectual type of personality or person of vocation was presupposed. Modern scientific and technological knowledge slowly pushed back the germinating grounds of human knowledge, such as religion and metaphysics, and created a culture of âobjectificationâ (Versachlichung). At the same time, there was a loss of substantive-value rationality, the emergence of a polytheism of value fragmentation, and the related tensions between these two developments, in other words, rationality without reason in practice. It is in this framework that one must also situate geographical action theory as put forward by Benno Werlen (Chap. 2, in this volume or 1987, 1995, 1997) in the phenomenological tradition of Alfred SchÃ¼tz (1932). According to this school of thought, the internal mental intentionality directed to outer objects is what ascribes meanings to these objects, as people do through their everyday place-making and everyday spatially differentiated actions. This geographic action theory can be interpreted as the subjectivist version of what Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and Savigny (2001) and Reckwitz (2002) designated as the mentalist paradigm in social theory. This approach contrasts with the objectivist version of mentalism, which stems from classical structuralism as exemplified by de Saussure (1916/1972) in linguistics, LÃ©vy-Strauss (1969) in anthropology, Althusser (1965/2005) and Emerson (1984) in Marxist economics, and Piaget (1970) in psychology. One could also add the more contemporary version of psychological structuralism (Lacan, 2002); behaviorist psychology (Skinner, 1938; Watson, 1913); and cognitive psychology (e.g., Broadbent, 1987), including cognitive linguistics (Fauconnier, 1999). The approach diverges from behavioral geography (Golledge & Stimson, 1996) as well, for which human behavior is an effect of structures in the unconscious mind in relation to structured situations and is thus part of the objectivist mentalist tradition."

For example, when conceiving the invention of ânewâ products or production processes, scientists do implicitly or explicitly also cause the emergence of âproperty rightsâ on the result. Three fundamental steps in this process are captured with the terms âreificationâ and âcommodificationâ. Reification is the process of making something ârealâ. Bioeconomy is based on the creation of new âobjectsâ of interest for society (e.g. new bio-based materials out of existing âwasteâ, enzymes, DNA, etc.). A prominent example in this regard is DNA: The DNA was always there, but only its recognition and the development of technical tools for its manipulation have transformed DNAs into objects of interest for society. The processes of reification primarily triggered ethical debates: in how far are we morally authorised to transform nature objects, parts of bodies, etc. into parts/materials for human usage? Commodification means transformation of formerly non-traded objects into tradable commodities (e.g. blood, organs, waste). Commodification requires the assignment of property rights to new (property) objects. The concept of bioeconomy is based on an extensive process of commodification of objects (e.g. patenting of DNA code), which were formerly regarded as gifts (organs/blood) or waste (a non-property/âres nulliusâ) and which are now transformed into valuables. In most cases, the role of individual researchers with respect to the institutionalisation of bioeconomy is by far not that influential as the one s/he has on the degree of interactive participation in the cooperation process. Here, it is the multitude of choices and decisions taken by a certain number of researchers engaged in bioeconomy which results in orientations of objectives, channelling of funds and finally institutionalisation of conceptualisations and research practices. Nevertheless, as there is obviously some definition power and impact on shared understandings on scientistsâ side, also this part has to be"

For example, if nuclear physics is completely successful in understanding a chain reaction, technology such as nuclear engineering could fail in controlling the reaction as in the case of Chernobyl.1 Or if nuclear engineering is almost completely successful in containing radioactive materials within reactors, social decision-making could fail as in the case of Three Mile Island (TMI).2 Or if society is completely successful in setting goals for the development of renewable energy technologies, science and/or technology could fail as in the case of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC).3 In a word, the success or failure of science, of technology, and of society cannot be overlapped automatically [9, 10]. In particular, there seems to be something missing in-between, which has unique characteristics of its own. The concept of âstructural disasterâ is intended to explore this state. What is in-between could be institutional arrangements, organizational routines, tacit interpretations of a formal code of ethics, invisible customs, or the networks of interests of different organizations. The âstructural disasterâ consists of one or more of the following elements [11]: 1. Adherence to erroneous precedents causes problems to be carried over and reproduced. 2. The complexity of a system under consideration and the interdependence of its units aggravate problems. 3. The invisible norms of informal groups essentially hollow out formal norms. 4. Quick fixes for problems at hand lead to further such fixes for temporary counter measures. 5. Secrecy develops across different sectors and blurs the locus of agents responsible for the problems to be addressed. This chapter focuses on, among other things, the interdependence of heterogeneous agents, which come into play in the science-technology-society interface and give rise to secrecy in a specific social condition. This chapter will make clear the interdependence by tracing it back to the hidden prewar accident, which will give us an important clue to the understanding of the Fukushima Daiichi accident from the perspective of âstructural disasterâ as defined above. To understand the social context of this hidden prewar accident, it is necessary to move away from the current social condition of the post-Fukushima situation to the prewar wartime mobilization of science and technology, within which the clarification of this hidden accident can be properly pursued. After the clarification, we will move back to the current situation surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi accident, to present the sociological implications of the hidden accident for the Fukushima Daiichi accident and for potential future extreme events. 1 For a sociological investigation into the relationships between the Chernobyl and Wind scale"
378,5,0.987,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"The twenty-ï¬rst century is an age of radical change. It presents us with challenges of a new dimension, scale and scope. The transformation challenge of the twentieth century was seen as one of primarily socioeconomic dynamics with nation states being the central actors. We are now facing a situation where we are aware of planetary ecological boundaries and the global nature of the transformation ahead. Recognizing the urgency and magnitude of this challenge, the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) argues in its 2011 flagship report that we need a âGreat Transformationâ. Referring to Karl Polanyiâs work, it creates a realistic vision for the twenty-ï¬rst century of a good life for 9 billion people within planetary boundaries, that is, if we manage to accomplish a great transformation. What we need, if we want to make this vision a real option for the future, are concepts that capture the complex nature of intertwined ecological, social, economic and technological transformation processes for sustainable development. The concepts need to offer guidance and orientation to the people that are actually engaged in the transformation process. Over the past 15 years, scientists have developed approaches for âtransition managementâ to meet these challenges. Many of these approaches, originating from a diverse set of scientiï¬c communitiesâas portrayed in this bookâfocus on greening the economy, fostering (technological) innovation, searching for new modes of governance and understanding the dynamic relationship between established âregimesâ and pioneers working towards new system architectures. However, most of the scientiï¬c frameworks for sustainability transitions and transformation research remain limited in one key aspect: not reflecting on how deeply embedded the capitalist economic logic has become in organizing societies. For a more adequate conceptualization of the âGreat Transformationâ, we need a"

The notion of software quality is, however, highly nontrivial and it has therefore been subject to significant research and standardization efforts. These efforts have a common starting point in the efforts of McCall et al. [8, 22] and Boehm et al. [6], where quality aspects are ordered into a hierarchy. Figure 10.1 depicts the hierarchy as defined by Boehm. Later efforts refined and updated the underlying ideas of McCall and Boehm in several ways. In particular, the quality attributes highlighted in these early models have been argued to be heavily based on the designerâs point of view. There are, however, other stakeholders, such as the user/customer and the company that develops the software as part of a business model. Depending on the role, the importance given each attribute may differ [4]. Security as a quality metric has also grown considerably"

330,273,0.987,Dynamics of Long-Life Assets : From Technology Adaptation to Upgrading the Business Model,"Complex knowledge, that is critical to the ability of an organisation to adapt in a fast-paced globalised marketplace, is becoming increasingly specialised and tacit in nature (Hinton 2003). Tacit knowledge is considered to be a valuable source of context-based information, but is stored and composed in the minds of individuals, so is difï¬cult to obtain and develop (Hildreth and Kimble 2002). Duguid (2005) explains the difference between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge, as knowing what and knowing how, respectively. Optimal performance within an organisation requires the transfer of knowledge between tacit and explicit knowledge. Novice workers need to be able to convert explicit knowledge (theory) into tacit knowledge (practice) and experienced workers need to convert their tacit knowledge (information within their head) into explicit knowledge for training and learning purposes (Duguid 2005). The process for the successful transfer between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge is not fully understood, but is a critical resource for organisational innovation (Stephenson 1998). CoPs have the potential to support the knowledge management process by creating a link between learning and performance (Wenger et al. 2002). This can make a signiï¬cant organisational impact, by allowing managers to connect tacit knowledge to organisational processes and strategically steer innovation towards industrial growth (Du Plessis 2008). Studies have shown that workers are ï¬ve times more likely to turn to a co-worker and obtain tacit knowledge about an activity, compared to obtaining knowledge from an explicit source such as a manual (Davenport and Prusak 2000). In addition, members of a CoP have reported an increase in communication, less dependence on physical proximity, and accessibility to new knowledge, which can result in open discussions and brainstorming activities, leading to new capabilities (Ardichvili et al. 2003). This sharing of tacit knowledge for manufacturing processes has the potential to increase learning trajectories and reduce workplace errors, resulting in overall organisational beneï¬ts. A central theory for the ability of CoPs to exploit tacit knowledge is the theory of situated learning (Hoadley 2012). Situated learning describes a method of knowledge acquisition that is âsituatedâ in context and interactions between individuals, professions, or pursuits (Lave and Wenger 1991). Brown and Duguid (1991) provided an example of learning by photocopy repairmen, which was situated in the context of problem solving and showed knowledge as being co-constructed, through the sharing of experiences, allowing individuals to better understand their job (Cox 2005). A number of studies have suggested that tacit knowledge, can best be transferred in the context of situated learning processes and social practices (Brown and Duguid 1991; Lave and Wenger 1991; Cox 2005; Hoadley 2012), with a number of theories suggesting that knowledge can only exist in social context and interactions, and is not in the possession of a single individual (Hoadley 2012). This implies that CoPs provide a natural environment for the existence of knowledge."
302,489,0.987,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Once in natural water bodies (rivers, lakes, oceans), recovery of microplastics is impossible. Therefore, one challenge is to identify and quantify the upstream sources â a prerequisite to mitigation. In the cases of microbeads and preproduction pellets, we witnessed the role of science to present observations of microplastic pollution, followed by a movement to pressure policymakers to regulate industry. The work of scientists continues to illuminate microplastic impacts, such as recent reports from the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) [118], a working group gathered by UNEP to synthesize and report on the state of the scientific evidence regarding the plastic pollution issue and distribute the information to the United Nations Environment Assembly. There are four principal solutions that will have high impact on preventing terrestrial and freshwater microplastics from forming. They are: (1) identify and quantify terrestrial microplastic sources, (2) scale zero waste strategies, (3) pursue policy-driven EPR, and (4) develop novel business solutions. These solutions will bring greater alignment between stakeholders on the utility of plastic in society and a more equitable end-of-life, where environmental and social justice are integrated in the full cost of plastic. The bridge between the linear and circular economy is about material circularity coupled with a sincere investment in common decency and democracy, and corporate responsibility toward those ends, what Severyn Bruyn calls a Civil Economy, whereby government, business, nonprofits and civic groups âcan develop an accountable, self-regulating, profitable, humane, and competitive system of marketsâ [119] (Bruyn 2000). This a thoughtful approach that considers the chemistry of materials, the design of products, the processes required to make things, and finally the systems that manage how materials flow back into the production chain, all in the context of causing no harm to people and the environment, benign by design in its totality.

Secondly, it offers us a way of pinpointing certain historical and contemporary processes that have been important influences on the religious Nordic scene in the last 100 years. Furthermore, it invites comparison with similar movements on the global level. Our approach is inspired by Andersonâs âfamily resemblance.â The features that we would consider key to our understanding of this category are: emphasis on connecting with the Holy Spirit; the centrality of healing and charismata; the prominence of individual experiences; and bodily involvement in ritual participation (cf. Lindhardt 2011). That said, we aim to avoid the pitfalls of essentialization by presenting case studies from different historical periods and settings, all of which situate and exemplify âPentecostalCharismatic Christianityâ in broader religious landscapes. We also hope to inspire, but also demonstrate, continuing elaboration of the nuances denoted by Pentecostal-Charismatic religiosity as a distinct category. One of the pleasures of academia involves the recognition that new problems arise whenever a solution to an existing problem is reached. Applying this category includes the classification and labeling of different strands and movements, and their terminological disentanglement. Hollenweger distinguished between the early âclassicâ Pentecostals, the âCharismatic Movementâ within mainline churches, and indigenous Pentecostalism in the developing world (2005). His approach has been rethought and new categories developed. A presently strong threefold model involves distinguishing between âclassicâ Pentecostalism, the Charismatic Movement, and Neo-Pentecostalism, which emerged in the postwar period. The latter is characterized by emphasis on well-being here and now, worship, global church networks, and so on (see Anderson 2010, 19â20; cf. Hunt 2010, 184). Of course, this âtriadâ has also been scrutinized; the label Neo-Charismatic in particular has been criticized for being a âleftover category,â lumping together highly diverse movements with different roots and orientations (van der Laan 2010, 204). Moreover, this approach may be a blunt tool when researching contemporary groups, since their origins as Pentecostal or Neo-Pentecostal may say little about their current orientation. As illustrated in Teemu T. Mantsinenâs chapter, Pentecostal organizations may transform in Neo-Pentecostal directions, and Pentecostal and Neo-Charismatic features coexist in the same denomination or even congregation. Except for the classification dilemma (âwhat goes whereâ) semantic problems arise. One kind of scholarly cop-out is illustrated by the creation of neologisms by adding the âneoâ prefix to terms in order to signal new"

This is important as the prevalence of health conditions and impairments is expected to rise with an increasing life expectancy and as more policies try to address deprivations in relation to disability. This book asks the following: How should disability be defined to analyze and inform policies related to wellbeing? What is the prevalence of functional difficulties? What inequalities are associated with functional difficulties? What are the economic consequences of functional difficulties? The empirical work is focused on Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda.

78,301,0.987,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"artefacts bear directly and systematically on the realization, or suppression, of particular configurations of social, ethical, and political valuesâ (Flanagan et al. 2008). As to the legal reasons against this type of design policy, the development and use of self-enforcing technologies risk to curtail both collective and individual autonomy severely. Basic tenets of the rule of law would be at risk, since peopleâs behaviour would unilaterally be determined on the basis of technology, rather than by choices of the relevant political institutions: what is imperilled is âthe public understanding of law with its application eliminating a useful interface between the lawâs terms and its applicationâ (Zittrain 2007). Finally, attention should be drawn to the technical difficulties of achieving such total control through design: doubts are cast by âa rich body of scholarship concerning the theory and practice of âtraditionalâ rule-based regulation [that] bears witness to the impossibility of designing regulatory standards in the form of legal rules that will hit their target with perfect accuracyâ (Yeung 2007). Indeed, there is the technical difficulty of applying to a machine concepts traditionally employed by lawyers, through the formalization of norms, rights, or duties: after all, legal safeguards often present highly context-dependent notions as, say, security measures, personal data, or data controllers, that raise a number of relevant problems when reducing the informational complexity of a legal system where concepts and relations are subject to evolution (Pagallo 2010). To the best of my knowledge, it is impossible to program software so as to prevent forms of harm generating-behaviour even in such simple cases as defamations: these constraints emphasize critical facets of design that suggest to reverse the burden of proof when the use of allegedly perfect selfenforcing technologies is at stake. In the wording of the US Supreme Courtâs decision on the Communications Decency Act (âCDAâ) from 26 June 1997, âas a matter of constitutional tradition, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume that governmental regulationâ¦ is more likely to interfere with the free exchange of ideas than to encourage it.â"

A number of the articles written attempted to capture the essence of the new term, which at the time was afforded a certain currency, with the aim of loading the term with old rehashed material so that more resources could be obtained for projects initiated earlier.9 An approach that resonates with the content of this paper is offered by the researchers Michael Callan and Michael Ryan: âEffects-Based Operations are the application of military and non-military capabilities to realise specific and desired strategic and operational outcomes in peace, tension, conflict and postconflict situationsâ. The later application of the term maintained a relatively general level, which was appropriate since the approach required a high degree of generalisation. The definition is also good because it can be applied to the border area between the use of force and more peaceful means, as described in the above text. The fact is that the definition works very well from a field theory perspective underlines the relevance of the field theory approach. The focus below is on those aspects of the JFCOM (United States Joint Forces Command) interpretation that stress the winning of peace.10 The aspects of both interpretations that focus on weapons effects are not relevant for the purposes of this paper.11 The theory presented in this text offers a practical approach that can be applied in situations where conventional warfare and its concepts are not appropriate. The issue is scientifically relevant, much research, for example, having been conducted into examining terms such as the now dearly departed EBO or the current strategic communication approach.

147,134,0.987,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"Individuals, Learning, and Stage Gates Some individuals are better at adapting to changing environments than others. For example, high meta-cognitive awarenessâa general level of awareness one has concerning his or her own cognitions focused on a specific entrepreneurial task (Haynie, Shepherd, Mosakowski, & Earley, 2010, p. 221)âhas been found to facilitate learning and adaptation in schools (Kamp, Admiraal, Drie, & Rijlaarsdam, 2015; Zohar & Barzilai, 2013) and in the entrepreneurial context (Haynie, Shepherd, & Patzelt, 2012). Indeed, superior learning has been associated with numerous cognitive attributes (e.g., learning style [Dunn, Griggs, Olson, Beasley, & Gorman, 1995], higher-order thinking skills [Zohar & Dori, 2003], and age [Cross, 1981]), processes (e.g., approaches to learning [Biggs, 1993], spatial transfer [Capello, 1999], and collective learning [Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999]), and strategies (e.g., active learning [Meyers & Jones, 1993], self-regulation [Zimmerman & Pons, 1986], and peer assistance [Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, & Simmons, 1997]). However, there has been little discussion about decision makersâ learning in the stage-gate process. The more we acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding (some) entrepreneurial projects, the more we recognize the importance of learning and adaptive decision makingâin selecting and adjusting the gate criteria. In doing so, more scholarly attention is likely to turn to the cognitive processes underlying gate decisions. Some (or perhaps most) gate decisions are made by a team, and there is a substantial literature on collective cognition upon which future stage-gate research can draw to better understand how stage-gate decisions about entrepreneurial projects are made, under what conditions, and to what effect. Such a cognitive explanation of stage gates can also have normative implications as we link cognitive attributes, processes, strategies, and/or collective cognition to value-creation outcomes from the innovation process. Emotions and the Stage-Gate Process Over and above a cognitive perspective, an emotions perspective provides additional insight into stage-gate decisions. For example, people often fear failure (Cacciotti, Hayton, Mitchell, & Giazitzoglu, 2016; Mitchell & Shepherd, 2010; Tsai, Chang, & Peng, 2016). At times, this fear of failure likely manifests itself in a reluctance to kill an entrepreneurial project despite evidence of its weak viability. On the one hand, it could be"

Among these general principles, âvicarianceâ is fundamental. It is the ability to solve some problem by different processes according to the capacity of each one, the context, etc. It is also the ability to replace a process by another in the case of deï¬cits. It is also the possibility to create new solutions. Indeed, it is the basis of creative flexibility.

92,64,0.987,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"This definition can be applied to national cultures, but it can also be used to describe cultural differences within a society such as those between different social classes or professions. Barrera refers to these âsmaller and more homogeneous unit[s] of social organization within a larger ethnic population that [are] bound by shared life experiencesâ as âsubgroupsâ (Barrera et al. 2013, emphasis added). The staff at a health care organization can be seen as such a subgroup, being bound by shared work experience as well as institutional practices, norms, rules, and environments (cultural dimensions as identified by Fiske 2002) which are different from those in other institutions. Beyond these differences, the constructs of health may not be the same for each cultural subgroup. Winkelman notes, âConcepts of health and disease differ from culture to culture and even from person to person within a cultureâ (Winkelman 2013). Consequently, when adapting trainings for health care workers, besides the most obvious adaptation, i.e. language, accounting for cultural differences is also necessary (Bernal et al. 2009). The modification of interventions to fit the needs of a cultural subgroup will be called âcultural adaptationâ in this chapter. Evidence on Cultural Adaptation The literature search conducted for this chapter showed an alarming research gap with regard to cultural adaptation of trainings for health care staff between countries. Research has been done on cultural adaptation of prevention interventions for patients, especially with regard to prevention and management of HIV/AIDS (e.g. DÃ©vieux et al. 2004; Wainberg et al. 2007; Wilson and Miller 2003; Wingood and DiClemente 2008) and diabetes (e.g. Barrera et al. 2012; Davis et al. 2011; Hawthorne et al. 2010; Osuna et al. 2011). One publication was found on the cultural adaptation of health services (T-share Team 2012), but this is a practical manual for the development and implementation of new interventions. No studies were identified which deal with evaluating and guiding the cultural adaptation of interventions for health care staff. Also, most of the available studies have been conducted in the US to adapt prevention interventions for minorities within in the country (Barrera et al. 2012; Davis et al. 2011; DÃ©vieux et al. 2004; Latham et al. 2010; Osuna et al. 2011; Whittemore 2007). Only very few studies discuss cultural adaptations of interventions across countries (Ortega et al. 2012; Kumpfer et al. 2008; SkÃ¤rstrand et al. 2008; Weichold et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2013; Andree LÃ¶fholm et al. 2009); and again, none of these focused on health care workers as a target group. We believe that it would be valuable to generate evidence for this specific group and kind of transfer, prior to planning for larger, more elaborate, multi-centre implementation studies. In particular, more rigorous scientific studies are needed to validate the process of testing cultural adaptation models and to examine whether the adapted programs really render a better fit to the local needs (Castro et al. 2004). Finally, not only proximal health outcomes, but also measures of reach, adoption by health care providers, engagement and maintenance of effects would be worth evaluating to comprehensively consider intervention impact (Glasgow et al. 1999).

These uncertainties from observations and similarly from models need to be taken into account in all fields of climate change related decisions. Climate researcher can give a hint of possible future changes but also have to communicate the range of uncertainty and the limitation of measures. The challenge in climate research tends to focus more and more to a very local scale.

Acknowledgements The analysis of the climate change signal in Central and Eastern Europe is based on regional climate model simulations for all of Europe, and the A1B emissions scenario is based on regional climate model simulations carried out in the European Union-funded Project ENSEMBLES (GOCE-CT-2003-505539).

Sanabriaâs presentation featured the problem of translation between semiotic systems from Duvalâs perspective, invoking discussion about the role of signs and semiotic activity in the production of mathematical objects. Engelke Infante presented a study the goal of which was to determine the effect of the instructorâs gestures in the studentsâ understanding of derivatives. Shvartsâs presentation dealt with the forms and dynamics of child/adult joint activity through a ï¬ne-grained study of perception, oral interventions, and gestures. The use of dual eye-tracking technology facilitated a detailed qualitative analysis of synchronized data. The child not only followed the adultâs cultural intervention, but he or she actively coordinated several semiotic registers; understanding appeared to be a result of this coordination at the moments of joint attention at the micro level."
84,544,0.987,Eye Tracking Methodology,"Using string editing similarity measures, Privitera and Stark evaluated six different attentional algorithms, some sharing similarities with the above models of Wolfe, Osberger and Maeder, and Itti et al.. Although the algorithms tested were not the actual ones proposed by the latter group of authors, it appears that a multiresolutional strategy, such as that of Itti et al., seems to be very efficient for several classes of images. In general, although the set of algorithms picked by Privitera and Stark was only a small representative sample of many possible procedures, this set could indeed predict eye fixations. The problem of computationally modeling human eye movements, and indeed human visual search, is far from being solved. No current model of visual search is as yet complete. Recent progress in algorithmic sophistication is encouraging. Models such as those of Wolfe, Osberger and Maeder, and Itti et al., show definite promise. Certainly the capability of tracking human eye movements has yet to play a crucial role in the corroboration of any model of visual search. Carmi and Itti (2006) recently evaluated the saliency of dynamic visual cues, noting that these cues play a dominant causal role in attracting attention. Peters and Itti (2006) suggest heuristics sensitive to dynamic events as predictors of human attention in next-generation immersive virtual environments and games. Privitera and Starkâs approach to the comparison of human and algorithmic scanpaths is one of the first methods to appear to quantitatively measure not only the loci of ROIs but also the order of ROIs. Undoubtedly future evaluation of human and artificial scanpaths will play a critical role in the investigation of visual search."

118,18,0.987,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"the group that studied social scientific topics on nuclear technology was somehow âseparatedâ from the rest of department as conventional engineering research labs were the majority. From the point of view of an observant social scientist, the situation after the 2004 reformation at the UTNEM was just an âadditionâ of the social scientific part, appropriately suggested by the prospectus cited above. This addition model was not a totally meaningless change, of course, but it was not sufficient to cope with contemporary difficult issues centering around nuclear utilization in a so-called post-industrial society. This process of âintegrationâ seems to require a long-term effort to be accomplished. The Fukushima Daiichi accident clearly exposed the incompleteness of the past efforts at âintegration,â as various chapters of this book discuss in detail; even in 2014, three years after the accident, it seems to be still on going. The abilities required of leading engineers in this post-industrial era are not just to pursue technological development as prescribed (typically by governmental long-term plans or other national programs), but to grasp multi-dimensional needs for technology, to develop technology in collaboration with different stakeholders under a more open societal process, and to fulfill their social responsibility in compliance with values shared within society."

84,14,0.987,Eye Tracking Methodology,"The scope of the book falls within a fairly narrow humanâcomputer interaction domain (i.e., describing a particular input modality), however, it spans a broad range of interdisciplinary research and application topics. There are at least three domains that stand to beneï¬t from eye tracking research: visual perception, humanâ computer interaction, and computer graphics. The amalgamation of these topics forms a symbiotic relationship. Graphical techniques provide a means of generating rich sets of visual stimuli ranging from 2D imagery to 3D immersive virtual worlds and research exploring visual attention and perception in turn influences the generation of artiï¬cial scenes and worlds. Applications derived from these disciplines create a powerful humanâcomputer interaction modality, namely interaction based on knowledge of the userâs gaze. Recent advancements in eye tracking technology, speciï¬cally the availability of cheaper, faster, more accurate, and easier to use trackers, have inspired increased eye movement and eye tracking research efforts. However, although eye trackers offer a uniquely objective view of overt human visual and attentional processes, eye trackers have not yet gained widespread use beyond work conducted at various research laboratories. This lack of acceptance is due in part to two reasons: ï¬rst, the use of an eye tracker in an applied experimental setting is not a widely taught subject. Hence, there is a need for a book that may help in providing training. It is not uncommon for enthusiastic purchasers of eye tracking equipment to become discouraged with their newly bought equipment when they ï¬nd it difï¬cult to set up and operate. Only a few academic departments (e.g., psychology, computer science) offer any kind of instruction in the use of eye tracking devices. Second, to exacerbate the lack of training in eye tracking methodology, even fewer sources of instruction exist for system development. Setting up an eye tracking lab and integrating the eye tracker into an available computer system for development of gaze-contingent applications is a fairly complicated endeavor, similar to the development and integration of virtual reality programs. Thus far, it appears no textbook other than this one exists providing this type of low-level information. The goal of this book is to provide technical details for implementation of a gaze-contingent system, couched in the theoretical context of eye movements,"
293,40,0.987,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Integration Policies Comparative studies are also a tool to understand what conditions account for the emergence of different integration policy models as well as the factors that explain recent trends of convergence in both policies and practices. To explain such differences, various typologies have been developed. One of the most cited is the study by Brubaker (1992) of citizenship policies in France and Germany arguing that the different nation-building histories of France and Germany have led to distinctive conceptions of citizenship. Focusing on the degree of accommodation or acceptance of minority group cultures, another highly cited categorization is that by Castles (1995), which distinguishes between differential exclusion, assimilation, and pluralism. Though these typologies are based on rich historical accounts of integration policy development in different European countries, their relevance has been increasingly questioned. The multitude of national models of integration policies in existence has been criticised for overlooking the importance of the transnational and local levels as well as for minimizing internal incoherencies and changes over time. During the past decade, comparative studies have rendered the analysis and explanation of integration policies significantly more complex by taking into account the supranational (particularly European), regional, and local levels; by focusing on particular policy domains; and by examining the impact of a set of compound factors such as politics and the party system, the constitutional courts and judiciary power, welfare state regimes, and the role of civil society, the media, experts, and civil servants. At the local level, Alexander (2003, 2007) was one of the first scholars to look at the city as the central unit of comparison, building a theoretical model to explain local policy reactions to migrant settlement over time and across a wide spectrum of cities and policy domains. Based on the concept of âhostâ strangerâ relations, he distinguished four types or phases of local policies: a nonpolicy, a guest worker policy, an assimilationist policy, and a pluralist policy. Though Alexanderâs typology has been criticised as teleological, as well as for paying insufficient attention to policymaking and implementation (Caponio 2010), his comparative model is still a key reference in the literature on local integration policies. An early example of comparative studies on particular policy domains is the comparison of the institutionalization of Islam in the Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK in the post-war period by Rath et al. (2001). Among the questions posed by that research were to what extent are Muslims being given the opportunity to set up their"

In sum, six mainstreaming strategies operate at the three levels (local, institutional and interinstitutional).7 They are illustrated in Fig. 15.1 and Boxes 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4. The first two (Strategies IâII) focus on the local or household level and relate to the way the four risk-reducing approaches (outlined above) are included in on-theground initiatives (either integrated or added on). Three strategies focus on the institutional level and address issues of internal organization (Strategy III) and cooperation (Strategy IV), together with policies and regulations (Strategy V). For example, it is crucial to ensure that organizational procedures and routines foster, rather than hamper (cf. Uittenbroek 2016), the implementation of nature-based solutions. The sixth strategy (Strategy VI) focuses on the interinstitutional level, external cooperation with other organizations (local, regional, national and international) and citizens. It addresses sector work, professional training and society in general. At the institutional and interinstitutional level, mainstreaming involves both targeted and implicit integration. At the institutional level, municipalitiesâ mainstreaming strategies can include the development of standalone adaptation strategies, the creation of interdepartmental working groups for climate change adaptation, and the integration of adaptation objectives into sectoral policies and instruments (e.g. green structure plans), comprehensive or detailed planning (cf. Wamsler 2015a; cf., Boxes 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4). Strategies addressing the interinstitutional level can include municipal participation in regional innovation platforms that aim to create new business and cooperation models for financing nature-based solutions for climate adaptation, or the creation of city-citizen collaboration (cf. Wamsler 2015a). Unlike other mainstreaming frameworks that address targeted and implicit integration separately (cf. Uittenbroek 2016), the framework that is presented here includes both since related actions and processes are fluent and mutually supportive. Politics and power must be explicitly addressed at all three mainstreaming levels, as they are a potential root cause of risk and represent avenues (or barriers) to transformation (cf., Boxes 15.1 and 15.4). The analysis of power (relations) is thus a precondition to sustainable change and to understand how transformation can be achieved or be hindered (Daly 2005; Digeser 1992; Partzsch 2015). This should include an evaluation of shared power (power with, cooperation and learning), the exercise of power (power to, resistance and empowerment) and power over others (coercion and manipulation) in potential mainstreaming approaches and strategies (cf. Allen 1998; Verloo 2005). Issues related to power need to be fundamentally challenged whenever and wherever modernity and globalization lead societies down an unsustainable road (Manuel-Navarrete 2010)."

There are estimates that a professional programmer needs 6 -9 months to become proficient with larger framework with exponential increase with the complexity of software. Patterns represent higher level concepts that help to understand complex structures because they are suitable to express a kind of collaboration. It is beneficial to embed this knowledge into the framework to establish pattern-driven O-O understanding (Booch94 et al, 1994). Figure 5-7 shows schema of the pattern recovery process. There is a model of the software system on the input of the process, and it results in explicit information about pattern instances. The process may or may not involve the developer. An approach described in Keller et al (1999) is based on combination of manual and semiautomatic tools supporting design pattern recovery. The recovery interface is complemented by visualization of the software design and highlighting pattern members already identified as participants with certain pattern instance. Another approach (Zhang et al., 2004) focuses on extending partial mapping of elements or modules at different levels of abstraction (namely high level design level to implementation structure) to a more complete mapping. The aim of this approach is to accommodate mapping of the design to the implementation model, which may not necessarily be 1:1 mapping. This is achieved by solving a simultaneous set of equations constraints on the mapping imposed by high level model, while the solution represents a set of design entities to which an implementation entity may be mapped."
169,632,0.987,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The assessment of ES generally requires the identiï¬cation and application of a suitable and comprehensive set of indicators. Indicators are variables that provide aggregated information on certain phenomena (Wiggering and MÃ¼ller 2004), provide a means of measuring service provision (Norton et al. 2015), and serve as communication tools to simplify the complexity of human-environmental systems (MÃ¼ller and Burkhard 2012). Heink and Kowarik (2010, p. 590) provide the following general deï¬nition: âAn indicator in ecology and environmental planning is a component or a measure of environmentally relevant phenomena used to depict or evaluate environmental conditions or changes or to set environmental goals.â Some examples for indicators describing freshwater ES are the area occupied by riparian forests, the amount of ï¬sh produced (catch in tonnes by commercial and recreational ï¬sheries), the ecological status of the water body in question, or the number of visitors to speciï¬c sites (Maes et al. 2016). When selecting indicators for an ES valuation, a careful and critical approach is essential. The framing and selection process not only deï¬nes what is being assessed (Hauck et al. 2015) but it also has signiï¬cant inï¬uence on how the subsequent assessment can help policy- and decision-makers to take appropriate steps to counter undesirable ecosystem changes (Feld et al. 2010; Niemeijer and de Groot 2008). An important factor to consider when choosing ES indicators is practicability and, in this regard, especially data availability. Some authors argue to use indicators that can be described by data that was already collected for other purposes. Others say this approach focuses too much on the currently most visible and easily accessible services (Hauck et al. 2015) and at the same time causes other ES to recede from view and to be neglected in policy decisions (Heink et al. 2015; Maes et al. 2012). Another essential aspect of the indicator selection process is to make a distinction between potential and actual use of ES, because it results in different requirements for indicators. This circumstance is best explained with an example: When referring to the actual use of ï¬sh, one would choose a ï¬ow indicator (measured per unit of time) like tonnes of ï¬sh caught per year. When referring to the potential use of ï¬sh however, e.g., to ï¬nd out about the reproductive potential of the ï¬sh population, a stock indicator (measured at a particular point in time) like the ï¬sh population size would be more suitable (Boyd and Banzhaf 2007). Wiggering and MÃ¼ller (2004) provide a list of scientiï¬c- and management-related factors, which are relevant for successful indicator development, including, among others, a clear representation of the phenomenon of interest by the indicator, a clear proof of relevant cause-effect relations, a high degree of comparability in and with indicator sets, a good fulï¬llment of statistical requirements, a high political relevance concerning the decision process, a high comprehensibility and public transparency, a satisfying measurability, and a high degree of data availability. Keeping all these factors in mind, the indicator selection depends heavily on the speciï¬c context of application and the characteristics of the investigated ecosystem (Reyers et al. 2010; Fisher et al. 2009)."
87,912,0.987,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","To explain the scope of the emerging key competences, the basic structure of âsolving problemsâ (see Sect. 4.1.2) can be used. According to this framework, problem solving starts with the characterization of the present state, commonly the description of a complex problem, the inherent system and the involved stakeholders. Therefore, normative competence is the fundament of exploring the problem, and systems-thinking competence is applied to consider the bigger picture. The target state is analysed via anticipatory competence, and normative competence projects values and principles into it. The process towards the target state, the operation, demands a sustainable transition strategy designed with the professionalâs strategic competence. Across the whole process, interpersonal competence facilitates cooperation and is key to a sustainable solution. Box 12.1: Key Competences for Sustainability (Wiek et al. 2011)"

And, interdisciplinarity is inherently a team effort, requiring us to consider team work in a fundamentally different way. This puts emphasis on education as well as team building. The chapter uses robotics as an example of an interdisciplinary research area, heavily relying on ICT expertise but additionally on other disciplines such as biology, social sciences, and law. In such an interdisciplinary setting, the issue becomes how to organize research, and one way is without doubt to show strong leadership. This is describedâin the special case of a nonuniversity research settingâby Dunja MladenicÌ and Marko Grobelnik and their contribution âLeadership and Balance in Research.â They provide several observations, based on their experience of many years. One is that leadership requires clear philosophical alignment and fundamentals shared between all the members. An important issue is the organization of the team, which should be preferably flat (but not too flat) with well-defined roles, but as fluid as possible. And not surprisingly, one of the major fundamentals is to develop trust between people and maintain good human relationships."
234,183,0.987,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"account for this qualitative difference between types of action goals, the authors deï¬ne âinnovative intentionalityâ as âthe will to conceive or imagine realities with the purpose of making them effectiveâ (CaÃ±ibano et al. 2006: 319). Economic agents, as individuals or organisations, can in turn be qualiï¬ed as operating with higher or lower levels of innovative intentionality. This approach and the weighting given to intentionality as the key driver can be contrasted both with the behavioural science model and, as MuÃ±oz et al. explain, with the economic literature which, âargues that knowledge is the only foundation of capabilitiesâ (2011: 194). For MuÃ±oz et al., economic evolution (systemic change) does not come about as a result of the growth of knowledge per se. Intention, not capability, is the starting point. The concepts that immediately captured our imagination and resonated most starkly with our experience in Uganda included the explicit engagement with agency and the emphasis the model places on existing knowledge. Learning is not something that happens to people as passive actors/ victims (or empty vessels) but something that is essentially relational, interactive and cumulative. The individuals concerned are not devoid of (or lacking in) knowledge per se; indeed, it is their experiential (tacit and highly contextualised) knowledge â âtheir perceived realitiesâ â that shapes their response to new learning and imported knowledge. Agency is explicitly recognised in this model, which assumes that âhumans have sufï¬cient intelligence and incentives to anticipate and avoid the selection effectsâ associated with evolutionary, Darwinian theories (MuÃ±oz et al. 2011: 194 citing; Witt 2004: 128). This approach to intentionality helps us to see motivation as contextualised and as much about extrinsic as it is about intrinsic factors. In the ï¬rst instance, health workers are heterogeneous and this heterogeneity is ânot only a matter of differences in knowledge [or innate ability], but also of differences in action goals and intentionsâ (CaÃ±ibano et al. 2006: 319) and their subjective responses to means (opportunities) or plans will shape their approach to new learning. Furthermore, a health workerâs motivation will vary over time and space and in relation to diverse plans. A person, according to this model, cannot be placed on a linear motivationâdemotivation or innate intelligence continuum: their degree of motivation will necessarily vary according to speciï¬c plans (places, conditions and relationships). Seeing motivation as fundamentally contextdriven helpfully removes some of the essentialising (and potentially racist) elements of the behavioural science model."

341,358,0.987,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Governance Governance is generally understood to imply a societal process (Lautze et al. 2011). For the World Bank (1991), it is more specifically âthe exercise of political authority and the use of institutional resources to manage societyâs problems and affairsâ. A useful corollary views governance as âthe sum of the many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairsâ (Commission on Global Governance 1995). The GEF-supported Groundwater Governance Project, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) jointly with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank and the International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH), adopted the following definition of groundwater governance: âgroundwater governance comprises the promotion of responsible collective action to ensure control, protection and socially-sustainable utilisation of groundwater resources and aquifer systems for the benefit of humankind and dependent ecosystems. This action is facilitated by an enabling framework and guiding principlesâ (Groundwater Governance Project 2016b). Policy While the concept of âpolicyâ has become pervasive, working definitions remain elusive. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2011) defines policy as âa definite course or method of actionâ¦to guide and determine present and future conditionsâ. For the UNâs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2011), policy is âa set of decisions which are oriented towards a long term purpose or to a particular problemâ. This simple and succinct definition captures the centrality of the vital term, âdecisionâ. If we understand the policies to be made by all sectors of society with a stake in governance â not just government â then policy-making can be considered synonymous with decision-making. Once policies have been formulated, putting them in place requires instruments, tools, rules, protocols and other procedures. These may include laws, sets of rights, registrations, permits and regulations (especially regulations that allow those regulated to choose among alternative ways of complying); economic incentives and disincentives such as subsidies, taxes, tradable pollution permits and pricing structures; and civil-society actions such as those that motivate voluntary actions or behavioural changes (Theesfeld 2008). Management The term âmanagementâ is perhaps easier to grasp intuitively than âgovernanceâ. Management can be thought of as the ânitty-gritty of day-to-day operationsâ that emphasises the results of decisions (Linton and Brooks 2011). Other similar notions are âapproaches, models, principles, and information used to make decisionsâ (Bakker 2007, cited in Nowlan and Bakker 2010); âregimes based on institutions, laws, cultural factors, knowledge, and practicesâ (Solanes and Jouravlev 2006); or purposeful activities that enable the accomplishment of goals and objectives (Pahl-Wostl 2007). These definitions share a concern for routine, practical and effective ways to achieve predetermined objectives and proceed with a common caveat: recognition of conflicting interests (Wolf 2007)."
185,401,0.987,The Essence of Software Engineering,"4 Adaptive Process-Aware Information Systems This section reports on adaptive PAISs, a next generation technology enabling adaptive processes that abandon the âengineerâuseâ dichotomy. Adaptive PAISs must not be confused with (self-)adaptive systems as recognized by the adaptive systems research community [3]. Processes are adaptive in the sense that they are continually evolving and reshaping to fit to the situation at hand, but unlike classical adaptive systems (as understood in adaptive systemsâ research) they are not expected to do this themselves. On the contrary, the adaptation is performed with the help of the user/engineer. In other words, in adaptive processes, human engineers and users are part of the loop, and the use and adaptation of processes are seen as two sides of the same coin. In this sense, adaptive processes have more in common with agile software development methods, which focus on encouraging human developers to evolve software in a rapid and effective way. The following sections sketch how adaptive processes and, thus, process flexibility can be realized in PAISs. Note that we do not give detailed insights into formal or technical aspects of adaptive PAISs (see [12, 19, 21, 23, 24]), but want to emphasize the perspectives offered by them, illustrated along the AristaFlow BPM Suite we developed during the last decade."

72,58,0.987,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Third, there are challenges in scaling up social innovation. The stated objective of much social innovation is to bring about systemic change. However, genuine systems change is a very ambitious objective and typically requires a combination of scale, geographical spread and political support. Bloom and Chatterji (2009) acknowledged these factors when they established the SCALERS model as a guide to key activities needed to achieve scale in social innovation, notably in terms of staffing, communicating, alliance building, lobbying, earnings generation, replicating and stimulating market forces. Elsewhere research has focused on the institutional, rather than organisational, aspects of achieving scale, particularly in terms of building social innovation âecosystemsâ (Bloom and Dees, 2008). However, there is relatively little evidence as yet of social innovation delivering systems change without government support â which begs important questions about the publicâprivate dimensions of scaling social innovation. Fourth, social innovation is often limited by access to market â or even discretionary â commercial finance at the start-up and growth phase (Nicholls, 2010b). There are several reasons for this. First, as was noted above, social innovation often occupies hybrid institutional spaces that span the logics of the state and the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. This creates difficulties in terms of assessing risk and return within conventional financial modelling. Furthermore, given its explicit social focus, social innovation âventuresâ may not aim at maximising their financial bottom line, focusing instead on creating âblended valueâ (Emerson, 2003) that combines social and financial performance. A third challenge is investor exit â there is currently no fully functioning secondary market in which social innovation investments can be realised. The emergence of an impact investing market (OâDonohoe et al., 2010) over recent years may partly address this capital gap â but it seems likely that, going forward, public and philanthropic finance will remain important to develop and grow social innovation. Fifth, there are, as yet, no agreed measurement mechanisms or standard units of analysis for social innovation impact and performance. Welfare economics and the large range of bespoke social impact measurement approaches developed within the not-for-profit or social entrepreneurship sectors offer a set of models that can be used in different contexts, but no dominant standard has emerged (Mulgan, 2010; Ebrahim and Rangan, 2010). As a consequence, exploring the comparative performance of social innovation remains a challenge. This has profound implications for access to capital and policy making."
72,57,0.987,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"about through struggle and changing the dominant cognitive frames that frame social issues. Such activity typically comes up against strong vested interests and can encounter (sometimes violent) resistance. As a consequence, the politicisation of social innovation research offers an important new lens through which systemic change can be understood: recognising the political dimension of social innovation is not merely a research opportunity, but it also raises significant practical questions and challenges. Political action often prompts a reaction and can lead to institutional confrontation or even danger. Further, when social innovation addresses public welfare issues or aims to drive political change, it typically does so as private action that lacks any formal democratic legitimacy. This is particularly problematic in cases where social innovation acts as a âshadow stateâ substituting for what would otherwise be the welfare responsibilities of the elected state. Such a democratic deficit challenges rights-based models of citizensâ relationship to their government. There is also the more general issue of who is included in, and who is excluded from, social innovation impacts. A second issue concerns the public legitimacy of social innovation. Many social innovations that aim to address institutional voids may initially lack legitimacy to key populations. This is because they often take the form of interventions that combine otherwise distinct institutional logics and models of action in innovative forms and that challenge normative notions of the roles and responsibilities of the discrete sectors. Such hybrid forms of action typically blend the logics and rationales of two or more established sectors to build new organisational structures (i.e., âsocialâ business), processes (i.e., work integration models) or goods and services (i.e., user-led welfare models) that correspond to complex sets of needs and demands in late modern societies better than conventional interventions do. The logics and rationales of action of each conventional sector are quite different and even contradictory at the normative level. As a consequence, the public legitimacy of social innovation (at both normative and cognitive levels: see Suchman, 1995) can often be compromised, with new models variously seen as attempts to privatise the social, dismantle the state or undermine civil society (Nicholls and Cho, 2006). The reaction to the social enterprise/social business hybrid model within social innovation has been particularly hostile since this challenges fundamental principles of the state and civil society as not-for-profit sectors in many countries. Such loss of public legitimacy can have serious consequences in terms of access to resources, market competitiveness, policy support and staff recruitment."

188,57,0.987,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"According to Zimmerman (2002), students can be described as self-regulated to the degree that they are meta-cognitively, motivationally, and behaviourally active participants in their own learning process. To define studentsâ learning as self-regulated, they have to use specific strategies for attaining their goals and all this has to be based on self-efficacy perceptions. In this context there are mainly three elements important, namely the SRL strategies of students, their perceptions of self-efficacy regarding their performance skills, and the commitment to their goals. The learners are active and able to control, monitor, and regulate their cognition, motivational state, behaviour, and context. Furthermore, the learners set goals and try to achieve them through progress-monitoring. These self-regulatory activities are mediators between personal characteristics, contextual features, and actual performance in the learning process. In a meta-analysis conducted by Hattie (2009), it turned out that performing selfregulatory activities in the learning process is one of the most effective methods to reach the learning goals. Zimmerman has developed a cyclic SRL model (Zimmerman 2002) consisting of three phases, which are the forethought phase (goal setting or planning), the performance phase (self-observation processes), and the self-reflection phase (self-reflection processes). According to this model, learning performance and behaviour consist of both cognitive and meta-cognitive activities. The cognitive activities are related to dealing with subject domains, for example, acquiring domain knowledge through reading. The meta-cognitive activities are related to thinking about and regulating the cognitive activities, for example, making a plan about domain knowledge acquisition. A similar approach is pursued by Boekaerts (1999) who developed the layered SRL model consisting of three layers. The first layer is about the regulation of the self, which is related to the choice of goals and resources. The second layer focuses on the regulation of the learning process that relates to the use of meta-cognitive skills to direct the learning process. The third layer describes the regulation of the processing modes, which describes the choice of cognitive strategies. Also this model deals with cognitive and meta-cognitive activities, as well as with goals and resources. A key role in SRL is given to learning activities that are also called learning strategies or learning processes. Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2004) listed six key processes that are essential for SRL, namely goal setting, self-monitoring, selfevaluation, task strategies, help-seeking, and time management. â¢ The goal setting process is defined as the outcome of a learning process and identifies strategies how to reach these goals. Goal setting motivates the learnerâs choice of and attention to the relevant tasks and it also motivates to attain higher effort and higher persistence over the course of time (Zimmerman 2002). Furthermore, goal setting influences learning through affective reactions, for example, higher self-satisfaction when goals are reached. Also the difficulty of a goal is an important factor for performance that increases with the difficulty level of the goal (Locke and Latham 2002)."
376,275,0.987,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Abstract Rangeland management, like most disciplines of natural resource management, has been characterized by human efforts to reduce variability and increase predictability in natural systems (steady-state management often applied through a command-and-control paradigm). Examples of applications of traditional command and control in natural resource management include wildfire suppression, fences to control large ungulate movements, predator elimination programs, and watershed engineering for flood control and irrigation. Recently, a robust theoretical foundation has been developed that focuses on our understanding of the importance of variability in nature. This understanding is built upon the concept of heterogeneity, which originated from influential calls to consider spatial and temporal scaling in ecological research. Understanding rangeland ecosystems from a resilience perspective where we recognize that these systems are highly variable in space and time cannot be achieved without a focus on heterogeneity across multiple scales."
167,386,0.987,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"development of Arctic-based tourism is a new issue in the public strategic planning, research and commercial activities (Kharlampieva 2016). In this article, the design exploration starts with a statement that the Russian Far North has potential to become a platform for diverse tourism development and, furthermore, to enable new kinds of tourist products and services. Design as a system of material objects and actions aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones (Simon 1996), can support this trend and provide for embodying new standards of tourism ethics and sustainability in the Arctic region. This article contributes to the studies of Arctic tourism development by changing the perspective on tourism and illuminating new opportunities for transforming given resources into tourist products/services by design. This study relies on the experience of the Arctic Design School, ADS (Ural State University of Architecture and Art, Yekaterinburg, Russia) obtained during over 30 years of studio and field-based research, teaching and designing for the extreme environment of the Arctic. By focusing on adaptation and sustainability, it is suggested here to consider remote terrains of the Russian Far North as a natural âliving labâ (Bergvall-Kareborn et al. 2009), which provides an exceptional window to what is involved in being a human in severe conditions, and to what innovative design solutions it fosters. The next paragraph outlines the theoretical foundation for design in Arctic tourism and later on two case studies from collective projects at the ADS are used to illustrate the theoretical background."

His recent work uses the metaphor of mathematics as a âdorsal spineâ on which monsters, not beautiful creatures, are often built. What must we do, what action must we take, to prevent ourselves from building monsters with mathematics and in mathematics education? This paper argues that theoretical approaches drawing on ecological concepts can lead us to understand the interconnectedness of teaching and scholarship with culture and society.

99,16,0.986,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"(a) the ideas of individual inventors working as or with businessmen, (b) ideas of individuals in society that may be taken up at different places, (c) market-networked innovations, generated by (clusters of) enterprises and their R&D departments and finally (d), what he calls âthe fourth quadrantâ (2010, p. 213), non-market/networked movements inventions and actions making them practical innovations. It is then not the more or less technical nature of an innovation, nor the degree to which its final (by)effects are beneficial, but the offspring from the realms of society and social interactions that might make a difference between innovations at large and social innovations. He also tries to show that in the last centuries, there has been a swing from individual and business based to what he calls ânon-market/networkedâ based (social) innovations. It would be tempting to discuss then in which ways there is a link between more social innovation and more civil society as a fertile ground for processes that generate and give room to such innovations. The view proposed by Johnson may allow a more subtle understanding of the prevailing broad consensus on the positive definition of the âsocialâ aspect of social innovation (see BEPA 2010; Mulgan 2006). They may not always be seen unanimously as good, but possibly as more promising or attractive than previous arrangements, or in comparison to the lifestyles created by the innovative products, services or regulations of big business and big government. While this allows us to feel sympathetic towards social innovations, we must still remain critical about statements and definitions that declare them as inherently good. Interpretations of the added value and success of social innovations, which reflect what is seen as good and better for society, will often be widely contested. By definition, innovations differ from prevailing routines, forms of thinking and acting. It is possible that they may become a mainstream practice, but this is never the case at the outset. They can be linked with a diverse range of goals and come to take on different meanings over time. Just as important as the initial goals of social innovation are wider political concepts and institutional systems in which they become embedded (see e.g. Osborne and Brown 2011), reactions of the social and economic environments, and the hopes for better coping strategies and solutions that they attract. The enormous impact of social environments for the shape and directions innovations take is a well known topic from the older and more established research and debates on technological innovations (see e.g. Chesbrough 2003). Basically all innovations, technological and social innovations, are, as convincingly argued by Nowotny (1997), marked by a high degree of risk and uncertainty in the course of their development. Altogether, this shows that defining innovationâand more specifically social innovationâis an issue in an evolving area of study undergoing a great deal of change and often linked with normative assumptions. Against this background, our definition avoids objectifying what is a matter of processes involving not only proponents and activists and their initial goals but also the ways contexts react and shape the ways and directions social innovations develop. We employed the simple criterion that social innovations are those that, created mainly by networks and joint action in social realms beyond business and government routines, at any given moment, raise the hope and expectations of progress towards something âbetterâ (a more socially sustainable/democratic/effective"

54,28,0.986,Perspectives in Glycomics and Lectin Engineering,"5. Conclusions This chapter described various tools, which have been recently applied in order to extend analytical usefulness of lectin based devices in glycoprofiling. A positive aspect of recent effort in the field is utilisation of a great potential nanotechnology can bring into quite a complex and challenging analysis of glycans. Such approaches proved analysis of glycans by different biosensors can be extremely sensitive with a concentration range spanning few orders of magnitude, what are features essential in analysis of low-abundant glycoproteins. Control of immobilisation of lectins is other important issue, which was successfully addressed in a pilot study showing that attachment of recombinant lectins on surfaces via various tags present in recombinant lectin improved sensitivity of glycan analysis. The book chapter described also future prospect of peptide lectin aptamers in order to increase sensitivity and stability of analysis, while suppressing non-specific interactions. Additional issue to focus on in a future is investigation if modified nucleotides can be successfully applied in preparation of novel DNA aptamers targeting glycoproteins with high affinity and selectivity. The final part of the chapter describe the concept of a glycocodon, what can lead to a better understanding of glycan-lectin interaction and for design of novel lectins with unknown specificities and/or better affinities toward glycan target or for rational design of peptide lectin aptamers or DNA aptamers."

136,40,0.986,Principles and Practice of Case-Based Clinical Reasoning Education : a Method For Preclinical Students,"William Osler and the Differential Diagnosis Basically, the early nineteenth century saw a rapid abandonment of HippocrateanGalenic medical theory in favor of modern scientific medicine, which conceives of diseases as derailments of normal processes (or normal structures), rather than as disturbances of some speculative form of homeostasis. New diagnostic tools became available, such as palpation, percussion, and auscultation, which enabled the physician to investigate the interior of the human body without opening it and to distinguish between normal functioning (or structures) and their pathological deviations. The task of the clinician gradually shifted from accurate description of symptoms to drawing conclusions, on basis of indirect information, about underlying pathophysiological or pathological processes. Diseases were no longer defined exclusively on basis of findings (complaints, signs, and symptoms), and it was acknowledged that different diseases could lead to similar symptoms. This led to the emergence of the concept of a differential diagnosis. William Osler (1849â1919) is not only viewed as the founder of North-American clinical medicine, but he is also credited with introducing the âdiscipline of differential diagnosisâ (Maude 2014). A differential diagnosis is a necessary concept if one wants to approach clinical problem solving"

Others include population growth and increases in income as well as changes in human capital, knowledge, and infrastructure. Much of the change in agriculture will stem from new innovations, both in terms of technologies and institutions. This paper aims to provide the background and analyze some of the challenges associated with the development and introduction of new innovations in agriculture and food systems in response to climate change. The analysis will emphasize the role of innovations in CSA. The first section will provide an overview of the impact of climate change and possible mechanisms in response to it. The next section will identify the major categories of innovation associated with CSA. We distinguish between technological, managerial, and institutional innovations and between micro (farm level) vs. macro (farm-system) innovations.

342,7,0.986,Semiotics in Mathematics Education,"can only be hinted at here, caused substantial endeavour within cultural science into investigating the use of images from many different perspectives (see, e.g., Mitchell 1987; Arnheim 1969; Hessler and Mersch 2009). The introduction to âLogik des Bildlichenâ (Hessler and Mersch 2009), which we can translate as âThe Logic of the Pictorialâ, focusses on the meaning of visual thinking. In this book, they formulate several relevant questions on visualisation which could/should be answered by a science of images. Among these questions we read: epistemology and images, the order of demonstrating or how to make thinking visible. Letâs take a further look at a few examples of relevant literature from cultural science concentrating on the âvisual.â In their book The culture of diagram (Bender and Marrinan 2010) the authors investigate the interplay between words, pictures, and formulas with the result that diagrams appear to be valuable tools to understand this interplay. They show in detail the role of diagrams as means to construct knowledge and interpret data and equations. The anthology The visual culture reader (Mirzoeff 2002) presents in its theory chapter âPlug-in theory,â the work of several researchers well known for their texts on semiotics, including Jaques Lacan and Roland Barthes, with their respective texts âWhat is a picture?â (p. 126) and âRhetoric of the imageâ (p. 135). Another relevant anthology, Visual communication and culture, images in action (Finn 2012) devotes the fourth chapter to questions which concentrate on maps, charts and diagrams. And again theoretical approaches from semiotics are used to interpret empirical data: In âPowellâs point: Denial and deception at the UN,â Finn makes extensive use of semiotic theories. Even in the theory of organizations, semiotics is used as means for structuring: In his book on Visual culture in organizations Styhre (2010) presents semiotics as one of his main theoretical formulations."
