53,168,0.995,"Healthcare, Frugal innovation, and Professional Voluntarism : a Cost-Benefit Analysis","initial risk assessment visit that was conducted prior to project commencement: The judgement about whether identiï¬ed risks are âacceptableâ or not in a particular context requires the relative balancing of risk âseverityâ with risk âlikelihood.â On that basis risks associated with road trafï¬c accidents or terrorism are graded as severe, although their likelihood may be low and mitigated by effective behaviour management. This process stimulated and informed the development of SVP volunteer management systems largely reï¬ected in an evolving induction process and associated induction pack.3 Over the past ï¬ve years, the SVP has encountered most of the risks identiï¬ed above. At the more alarming and less âlikelyâ end of the spectrum, there have been outbreaks of terrorism and civil disobedience (typically quite isolated and around election periods or involving tribal disputes). Road trafï¬c accidents remain one of the greatest risks to volunteers in all low-resource settings (Gedde et al. 2011: 186). Bhatta et al. (2009) conï¬rm the importance of road trafï¬c accidents as a major cause of volunteer morbidity and mortality. In a survey of VSO volunteers, diarrhoea was the most prevalent heath risk reported (by 79.9%) with highest levels found amongst short stays and younger volunteers. This is followed by skin and dental problems and 17.5% reported some form of road trafï¬c injury. The authors are clear to point out that the response rate to their survey was small (36%) and that this response rate may be skewed in favour of those who had experienced problems (and had something interesting to report). The situation is exacerbated in the Ugandan context by the use of âboda bodasâ (motorcycle taxis) and a study of Peace Corps volunteers in Africa found that 60% of road accidents were related to motorcycle use (Bernard et al. 1989). These risks to individuals also present a risk to the NHS potentially affecting the subsequent safe return of work-ï¬t employees. Exposure to infectious disease presents more direct potential impacts on return and these are risks that the wider public may become aware of and sensitised to.4 Since the commencement of the SVP, Uganda has experienced at least three localised outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever. We have also witnessed several instances of needlestick injury. Both of these were responded to immediately triggering expert advice and a constant iteration of the induction pack. Whilst NHS employers may be interested in the well-being of employees on placement, they are also anxious about the liabilities associated with that and the impact that any local incidents may have on volunteerâs ï¬tness"
241,854,0.994,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Concentrations of many pollutants over the Baltic Sea region have changed signiï¬cantly over the past century, mainly due to changes in emissions, either within Europe or globally. However, systematic measurements (with a few exceptions) did not really begin until the 1970s and later. Many of the sulphur- and nitrogen-related pollutants have their greatest environmental impact after they are deposited, while concentrations of aerosol species in particular are of concern due to their health impacts (Sect. 15.6). Ozone is a toxic gas affecting human health and vegetation."
151,272,0.994,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"more relevant to the field. Results for cosms thus provided another line of evidence for characterization of the risks of CPY under conditions that are more representative of conditions in the field. Risks to aquatic organisms from measured exposures were assessed by comparing the 95th centile concentrations to the HC5s for the SSDs. These data may not fully capture peak exposures but suggested that there were de minimis risks for all aquatic organisms from exposures measured after use patterns were changed in 2001. The analyses also showed that risks had decreased from those prior to 2001, which leads to the conclusion that the changes made in 2001 and 2005 to the labeled use patterns, and possibly other changes in general pesticide stewardship, mitigated CPY exposures and reduced risks. Estimated exposures from models for three focus-scenarios, representing greater vulnerability to exposures than other use scenarios (Williams et al. 2014), allowed the assessment of risks based on 96-h time-weighted-mean concentrations that were matched to the 48â96 h toxicity data. Based on the joint probabilities of distributions of data for exposure and toxicity, we concluded that risks for fish and aquatic stages of insects were de minimis in all three regions. However, in the intensive-use scenario of Orestimba Creek, in California, risk to crustaceans was greater and deemed to be not de minimis. Further analysis of risks from repeated exposures to CPY, in these three focus-scenarios, confirmed the de minimis risks to crustaceans, insects, and fish in the focus-scenarios in GA and MI. Repeated exposures in Orestimba Creek, CA suggested small risks to fish, insects, and crustaceans. We concluded that repeated exposures to insects and crustaceans would not be ecologically relevant because of the potential for rapid recovery in these taxa. Risks for fish may be somewhat greater because there is more uncertainty regarding recovery of the target enzyme AChE and because of their longer reproductive cycles. The lack of fish-kills since 2002 in the U.S. that were associated with confirmed exposure to CPY is consistent with the small risks to fish and the smaller exposures in surface waters since the change in the labeled uses. Too few data on toxicity of CPYO were available to conduct a probabilistic risk assessment but, on the basis of the available data and the large margins of exposure, we concluded that risks of CPYO to aquatic organisms were de minimis. CPYO is the active metabolite of CPY, and its toxicity is subsumed by the parent CPY. It is thus not surprising that CPYOâs toxicity is similar to that of CPY. CPYO is more rapidly hydrolyzed in water and is more polar than CPY and is less likely to be taken up into aquatic organisms. Detections of CPYO in surface waters were infrequent, and the concentrations were all less than toxicologically significant values for the one fish and one invertebrate for which data were available. This ERA was supported by several strong data-sets. There is a good database of toxicity values for CPY, and many of these tests are of high quality. They are certainly sufficient to characterize acute toxicity to insects, crustaceans, and fish. There are also large sets of data for measured values in surface waters in a number of locations, including areas of intensive use, where greater exposures would be expected. Several studies conducted in cosms, some of excellent quality, are available to provide points of reference for the SSDs and information on recovery of invertebrates"
365,412,0.994,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"increase in food expenditure, both quantity and quality of food consumed responded positively to CGP receipt, implying that households benefitted from the CGP in terms of food security and nutrition. With regards to the effect of climatic variables on welfare and food security, results from Asfaw et al. (2016) show that overall, households in areas that experienced lower than average rainfall had lower levels of daily caloric intake as well as food and non-food expenditures, and this effect was most pronounced for the poorest households in the sample. A possible explanation could be that the decline in rainfall had an initial negative impact on agriculture, livestock production and other water-intensive activities. The decline in volume of production thus affected householdsâ purchasing power, forcing them to improve their coping mechanisms. This study also finds strong evidence that cash transfer programmes have a mitigating role against the negative effects of climate shocks. Households that participated in the CGP had much lower negative effects of the weather shock, with poorest households gaining the most. This indicates the potential of social protection to support food access for households exposed to climate risk. However, the analysis also indicates that while participation in the CGP is beneficial in mitigating negative effects of climate shocks on food security, it is not sufficient to fully overcome these effects. Thus it is important to ensure that SCTs are well aligned with other forms of livelihood programmes and climate risk management, including disaster risk reduction activities. This result confirms the findings of authors like Eriksen et al. (2005), who found a positive relationship between the ability of people to draw on extra sources of income and the ability to withstand droughts in Tanzania and Kenya, with respect to those who were not."
364,358,0.993,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"A total of 175 adult members of the public were given a questionnaire about the risks posed by the construction industry. This survey revealed that the majority were very much aware of the various risks faced by people, plants, and animals, as well as the risks to the environment as a result of construction activities. For example, most of them agreed that construction activity can cause soil erosion, floods, loss of natural resources, reduction in soil quality, and reduction of rain absorption area. The majority also recognized that loss of habitat, death, and destruction are some of the effects on plants and animals. Similarly, most of them agreed that animals may move away from an area where construction takes place. In addition, a large number of respondents also acknowledged that two risks faced by humans are health problems due to dust released during construction and feeling discomfort due to the noise from construction. However, only around one third of the sample considered that murky water caused by soil erosion from construction sites could have a negative effect on fish in rivers. In general, most of the people surveyed held similar perceptions about construction risks irrespective of their academic or social background. One notable exception, however, was educational level: Among the sample who responded to this survey, those who had completed university education obtained a mean score of 63.09 for construction risk awareness. Those who were educated up to pre-university level, on the other hand, obtained a corresponding mean score of 59.68. This difference is statistically significant as shown by the p value of .01 in the independent samples t-test analysis conducted. This implies that university education helped improve awareness of construction risk."
364,244,0.993,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Farmers and fishermen perceive the risks associated with environmental degradation and its long-term negative consequences as affecting not only themselves but the community as a whole. The risks are of both natural and anthropogenic origins. Those of natural origin include typhoons, strong winds, El NiÃ±o, and seasonal variations brought about by climate and/or weather disturbances. In Silang-Santa Rosa, these have the effects of altering the crop cycle, and reducing crop productivity and income. Other types of risks include outbreaks of pests and diseases, crop losses from toxic chemicals, soil erosion and acidity, depressed market prices, and land use conversion. Farmers and fishermen have faced these risks to some degree for years. However, in the upstream, 46 % claimed that their level of exposure to such risks is low. A low level of exposure was also cited by 25 % in the midstream, 100 % in the upper downstream, and 50 % in the lower downstream. This can be attributed to the respondentsâ resiliency and the measures they have adopted to address the risks. Factors affecting their level of resiliency include their earning capacity, family assets, and asset management, as well as support from family and relatives that provide financial assistance in times of need. One specific adaptive measure taken in Silang-Santa Rosa is to immediately replant to replace damaged crops. Otherwise farmers simply wait for crops to recover naturally, or go and seek off-farm or nonfarm employment. However, these adaptive measures are generally makeshift and do little to reduce the impacts of climatic events and other forms of risks. They are also very dependent"

No data exist to determine whether proportion of time birds spend on fields. treated fields equates to the proportion of their diet that comes from treated fields. The various shortcomings with the PT variable could ultimately lead to under- or over-estimation of risk. The results of the evaluation of model performance and the flowable CPY field studies suggest that the risk estimates produced by LiquidPARAM are reasonable or over-estimated.

230,610,0.993,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.5 Conclusions Marine litter is a complex problem to address, which exerts significant economic costs, often borne not by the polluter but by coastal and marine industries such as fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, etc. (some of which also contribute significantly to marine litter). Economic instruments have a potentially important role to play in addressing marine litter, with initiatives in place in several countries proving that they can lead to significant reductions in waste entering the environment (ten Brink et al. 2009). The development of effective and efficient instruments requires a strong link between the behavior change driven by the instrument and the harm caused by marine litter. However, there are several areas where there is a lack of sufficient information to make this link. At the heart of this is the problem of understanding the harm caused by marine litter. The harm caused by some forms of litter is known, however, there are large gaps in this understanding. While the presence of litter in the marine environment and even its ingestion, etc., in species is documented, it is not clear what impact it is having on critical populations of marine organisms or indeed species higher up the food chain (including humans). Further, while some specific types of litter are identified as having some impacts (discarded nets, plastic bags, etc.), the impacts of other types of litter are currently poorly understood, which is most notable with the debate on micro- and nanoplastics. In relation to socio-economic impacts, impacts on tourism from beach litter are documented, but a quantitative link between the impact and levels of litter is poorly understood (Ballance et al. 2000). These links between types, quantities and sources of marine litter and their varied impacts are important to understand if targeted economic instruments are to be developed. Otherwise an instrument may lead to a reduction in litter, but with a limited reduction in impact."
182,208,0.993,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"as key threats to human health in newly independent and developing agrarian nations.128 The Committee was tasked with identifying zoonoses that were evident âworld problemsâ and for which effective control measures had already been developed.129 Over the next decade, it agreed a standard definition of these diseases, which brought over 100 different infections under one general category, creating fertile terrain for veterinarians to expand their international role in human health.130 Perceptions of zoonotic disease threats had shifted significantly in the context of the world hunger campaign. Previously, the animals affected had been regarded as costly impediments to agricultural production, and as transmitters of infections to humans. However, their promotion as food sources for hungry humans led to the realization that, in addition, these animals produced less food for humans, thereby posing dual threats to human health. This was highlighted by one of the Committeeâs leading experts, the Swiss-American veterinary scientist Karl Meyer, in a technical paper on âThe Zoonoses in Their Relation to Rural Healthâ that he presented, on Kaplanâs invitation, to the Seventh World Health Assembly: One need only to consider all of the adverse effects of the zoonoses to realize the urgency of control: loss of life, acute and chronic illness of inhabitants of rural areas, loss of life and impairment of productivity of farm animals with all of the social and economic implications, and loss of life and acute and chronic illness of city dwellers to whom the zoonoses may spread â¦ These infections unquestionably have far-reaching economic aspects; they may mean mere loss of profit or they may mean critical want. In some areas they preclude the raising of livestock altogether â¦ in others they make an already poverty-stricken group poorer still and deny food supply to undernourished populations. In their destruction of food supply alone they are major economic problems. Some of the diseases â¦ are detrimental to rural populations because of their direct effects on health of farm people, making habitation in rural areas impossible or hazardous; some are more important in their effect on the worldâs food supply.131"

Finally, the number of stakeholders involved meant that it had proved very difficult and time consuming to have changes approved; for example, the five-year delay in reaching a decision on the 1974 FDA proposal to reduce the tolerance level of aflatoxin from 20 parts per billion (ppb) to 15 ppb. The NAS review was framed within the overall context of the decline in deaths from infectious diseases, the rise in those from cardiovascular disease and cancer, and the changes to the human environment brought by technological development.33 In the specific area of food, the authors pointed to technical advances having shifted hazards âaway from microbial contamination that produced acute disease soon after exposureâ, to âchemicals in small quantities and other hazards introduced by environmental contamination as well as by food production and processingâ.34 The recommendation for regulatory flexibility came from the aim of allowing agencies to find a middle way between unrestrained use and a ban, as well as a desire to allow them to keep up with progress in research, production and monitoring.35 In other words, the problem of aflatoxins was being defined largely in terms of the risks created by modern methods of food production, distribution and consumption; nonetheless, it was expected to be solved by those very same technologies.36 One factor, echoing issues with regionally specific fungi, was that risks varied with place and individual lifestyles, particularly dietary, meaning that national, let alone international, standards were likely to be hard to agree and even harder to enforce.37 Aspergillosis: âA Rare Diseaseâ, 1900â1960 Poultry were important in the story of Aspergilli fungi and human health at both ends of the twentieth century, as aspergillosis was recognised as a lung disease of fowl and cattle, and an occupational disease in humans around 1900.38 Veterinarians reported the disease to be most common in birds, including chickens, turkeys and certain waterfowl, where it caused pneumonia and other lung diseases.39 Mammals were said to be less susceptible, but it was reported in cattle and dogs. Veterinarians blamed contaminated grain, but argued that certain predisposing conditions were necessary, such as the animals being in poor general health or living in insanitary conditions. âBrooder pneumoniaâ, an American term for aspergillosis, came from its presence in intensively reared fowl. In humans, the disease was found mainly in those who worked with birds and cattle, those who handled grain or worked in dusty conditions. The primary presentation in humans was as bronchial or lung"
55,149,0.993,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"1997.109 The data they collected showed that âdeaths in which an infectious disease was the underlying cause, those due to mycoses increased from the tenth most common in 1980 to the seventh most common in 1997â, with the annual number of deaths increasing from 1,557 to 6,534. They confirmed that there had been âa marked upward trend in overall mortality due to the invasive mycosesâ, and highlighted the growing importance of immuno-compromising conditions, particularly HIV/AIDS.110 What was interesting was that the regionally specific mycoses discussed in this chapter only registered in the summary when they affected patients with HIV/AIDS, indeed, the disease was âa major determinant of the trend in overall mortality from histoplasmosisâ.111 However, the report supported the view that social changes were major factors in the fluctuating incidence of fungal disease, as with coccidioidomycosis in Arizona, where the increase was due to âan influx into the state of older nonimmune individuals who were susceptible to acute infection and more likely to manifest symptomatic illnessâ.112 In other places, it was not so much the arrival of virgin human soil, but the wider and more intense circulation of the âseedsâ of infection, literally thrown up by construction and extreme climate events. In discussing overall mortality, the CDC report confirmed what doctorsâ experience had told them: The two major factors responsible for the emergence of fungal infections have been the HIV disease epidemic and the many advances of modern medicine (including solid organ and bone marrow transplantation) that enable or prolong the survival of critically ill and susceptible patients. In addition, the aging of the population has increased the number of susceptible persons.113 To which should be added greater medical awareness, plus new and more sensitive diagnostic technologies. However, the report showed that antifungal drugs had reduced mortality in certain groups and from certain infections; the main exception was aspergillosis, the mycosis most associated with âadvances in modern medicineâ, which we move on to in the next chapter.

232,168,0.993,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The consequences of a nuclear accident are numerous and intricate. An accident has on-site consequences, such as casualties, highly-irradiated workers or material losses in adjacent reactors. It also causes off-site consequences, such as the release of radioactive materials in the atmosphere, the collective absorbed dose, the area of contaminated lands or the quantity of crops and cattle contaminated. The negative consequences of the countermeasures, such as psychological distress, also have to be estimated. Yet, these numerous consequences have to be assessed in order to derive their monetary value. The source of divergence in the assessment of the consequences is twofold. First, all studies do not assess the same range of consequences. Some studies argue that health effects dominate all other effects [15, 19, 20]. They thus focus on the collective absorbed dose and neglect other consequences. Other studies focus on a wider panel of effects, such as land exclusion, or image effects (tourism, regulatory"

151,2,0.992,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"This volume of Reviews in Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (RECT) is devoted to an ecological risk assessment of the insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPY). Chlorpyrifos (O,O-diethyl O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl) phosphorothioate; CAS No. 2921-88-2) is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide that is important for the control of a large number of insect pests of crops. Applications are made to soil or foliage and can occur pre-plant, at-plant, post-plant, or during the dormant season. Under the enabling legislation of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is charged with assessing the potential for agricultural chemicals to cause undue harm to nontarget plants and animals while considering beneficial uses in protection of crops. Registrations for labeled insecticides and other pesticides are reevaluated approximately every 15 years. Since CPY was last reevaluated, there have been many changes that affect its environmental profile: â¢ The EPA has changed how risk assessments of chemicals used to protect agricultural crops are conducted. â¢ The data available on concentrations and fate in the environment and toxicity of CPY to animals have increased. â¢ Methods and models used to estimate concentrations in the environment and exposure doses to biota have improved. â¢ Use patterns have changed in response to changes in cropping patterns, pest pressures, and new agricultural technologies. â¢ The crops for which CPY can be used and the amounts and frequencies of application permitted on the label have also changed, all of which are the primary determinants of the entry of CPY into the environment and its subsequent fate in the regions of use and beyond. In anticipation of the next reregistration review, the registrant for most of the formulations containing CPY, Dow AgroSciences, requested that we convene an expert panel to review the ecological risks of CPY with a specific focus on current patterns of use of CPY in the US agriculture."

The threats are also speciï¬ed by their magnitudes/strength, such as: the magnitude of an earthquake, the quantity of the rain, the amount of released radioactive substances, the speed of the wind, the rate of water level increase in a flooding river, Very often, one may uses the term âintensityâ to specify threats. One says âan earth quake with high intensity. It causes the death of some hundreds of victims and some thousands of displaced personsâ. Using the term âintensityâ, people refer rather to the impact of the threats and the associated CIsâ disruptions. In our methodology, we keep the term âintensityâ to measure the consequences of the impact of the threats and the corresponding CIsâ disruptions on their environment. Similar to the double use of metrics (quantitative/qualitative) in specifying the threats, engineers and crisis managers use both kind of metrics (quantitative/qualitative) to specify the consequences (impact) of a given crisis. Consequences can then be measured using different types of natural metrics: number of injuries, fatalities, evacuated persons, destroyed buildings, inaccessible roads, loss of services (transport/water/communication/heating/electricity) and ultimately loss of governance/public unrests. Once one identiï¬ed and speciï¬ed the threat, one still need to know how to model and simulate them."
302,373,0.992,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"2 The Plastic Dilemma and Everyday Modes of Risk Production Microplastics emerged as a scientific topic about 10 years ago and recently came into public awareness when the debate focused on their release from cosmetic products and potential abundance in human food [11â15]. But are microplastics really a new phenomenon or can we regard them as a newly discovered symptom of an old problem, the problem of plastic pollution? As indicated in the quotation below, microplastics, called âplastic particles,â were recognized as part of the problem of plastic pollution in coastal and oceanic waters in the 1970s, though the associated adverse consequences were considered as minor compared to other contaminants: At the present levels of abundance of plastic particles in coastal and oceanic waters, adverse biological consequences would appear to be minor compared to the deleterious effect of other contaminants such as petroleum residues and other chemical wastes. Increasing production of plastics, combined with present waste disposal practices, will undoubtedly lead to increases in the concentration of these particles in rivers, estuaries, and the open ocean.

255,233,0.992,Railway Ecology,"Conclusions Our results provide a ï¬rst picture of the avian response to the presence and operation of HSR trains. Although the observed trends are not particularly prominent and are diluted by seasonal and inter-annual variability, they are consistent with the notion that train circulation could be responsible for a decrease in bird abundance in the traversed area. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the presence of the HSR has led to a process of ruderalization characterized by the increased numbers of species taking advantage of the railway. Some bird species representative of open and agricultural areas were found to avoid the HSR, whereas species that use man-made structures were found to be attracted to it. In fact, we documented the active use of these new elements, mainly the embankments and the catenary, by birds. In addition, birds alter their flight patterns near the railway, including showing some avoidance of it. However, birds risk train collision because such avoidance is not complete. Moreover, the species that are most exposed to train collisions are those that respond favorably to the railway and use its associated"

Regions highly prone to landslide occurence that have been subjected to several catastrophic landslide events during the last 20 years are also well described. Despite that, landslides repeatedly cause signiï¬cant damage to infrastructure and incur considerable costs. We asume that one reason is that the general public and responsible authorities do not pay corresponding attention to this potentially damaging phenomenon. To increase awareness about landsliding especially among authorities, we summarized the costs of landslide-related construction and mitigation works claimed in public budgets. These expenses represent the true costs related to landslide occurrence and reactivations and are based on publically available databases which cover the whole territory of the Czech Republic. Therefore this approach represents an objective way to obtain comparable data about expenses related to landslide mitigation works. These data have not been evaluated yet. Resulting annual landslide-related costs do not include all of the expenses but we are convinced that the most costly mitigation works are included. Analysis of the data conï¬rm the high overall costs related to landslides and their uneven distribution within the territory of the Czech Republic."
36,72,0.992,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"3.2.7 Cumulative Effects, Extinction Debt and the Importance of Scale Most of the factors discussed above will be cumulative. The effects of each individually need not therefore be great for the combination to have a profound effect on a bat population. Furthermore, in many cases there will be a lag, known as the extinction debt, between cause and effect (e.g. Tilman et al. 1994; Loehle and Li 1996). This is illustrated in Fig. 3.4. The effects of habitat loss and reduced habitat quality on the distribution of flying bats may be seen quickly, as bats alter their foraging and commuting behaviour to adapt as best they can to the altered landscape. Collision mortality, unless very high, may not have a significant and detectable effect for several generations. The barrier effect may take several more generations to show itself, since it is likely to involve the decline and/or relocation of nursery and other roosts, but it too may be rapid, for example when bats are completely excluded from key foraging areas. Although no data exist for bats, a study of the effects of roads on wetland biodiversity (birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibian and plants) suggests that the full effects may not be seen for several decades (Findlay and Bourdages 2000). This has important implications for monitoring the effects of roads and assessing the effectiveness of mitigation, as discussed later."

The yellow area in Fig. 21.2 illustrates this additional risk. It is uncertain here whether the removal of risks and the creation of additional risks is uniform across the degrees of severity.

Of courseâand this is a relevant distinction in order to circumscribe the focus of this bookâwe also need to distinguish non-vaccination that is due to peopleâs choices or negligence more generally (including, as we will see, the negligence of giving in to unconscious biases) and nonvaccination that is due to factors beyond peopleâs control. Sometimes people do not have (easy enough) access to vaccines, particularly in developing countries (Favin et al. 2012), but also in developed onesâespecially in those with high rates of immigration. Distance from health facilities, internal population displacements and insecurity, and the fact that many illegal immigrants are afraid of being reported to the police if they visit health facilities (DubÃ© et al. 2014b) are among the factors that might hinder vaccination uptake in many countries. These circumstances contribute to the spread of infectious diseases as much as, if not more than the sociological, cultural, or psychological factors that influence individualsâ choices not to vaccinate themselves or their children where vaccination is easily accessible. In fact, difficulties in accessing vaccines account for a significant number of cases of preventable diseases and death worldwide. It has been estimated (Durrheim and Crowcroft 2017) that measles vaccination saved 7.1 million lives worldwide between 2000 and 2015. This looks like a remarkable datum, as it obviously is in many respects. However, this figure pales in comparison with the 114,900 people who died of measles worldwide only in 2014 (Perry et al. 2015): if several million lives were saved where vaccines are easily accessible, it is simply unacceptable for 114,900 people to die in one year of the same easily preventable disease just because many of them have difficulties accessing vaccinesâjust as it is simply unacceptable, to compare, that malnutrition and starvation still exist in certain parts of the world while there is overabundance and waste of food in others. Although these 114,900 deaths represent a stunning 79% decline in measles-related deaths from the 456,800 fatalities of 2000, they remain an objectively too high death toll for a disease that is vaccine-preventable, especially in light of the fact that, since 2010, progress towards the WHOâs goal of eliminating measles from four WHO regions has significantly slowed down (Perry et al. 2015, p. 623). The vast majority of those 114,900 deaths are not the result of peopleâs choices, as is likely the case for most if not all of the about 40 deaths of measles in Europe in 2017."

CPY can be applied by use of aerial spraying, chemigation, ground boom or air-blast sprayers, tractor-drawn spreaders, or hand-held equipment. Since the registration of CPY was last re-evaluated (USEPA 2004, 2008), there have been changes in how assessments of risks of chemicals used to protect agricultural crops are conducted. The amount of data available on mobility, persistence, and concentrations in the environment and toxicity of CPY to animals has increased. Most importantly, many methods and models for estimating concentrations in the environment and exposures to wildlife have improved significantly since the results of the last assessments were published (Giesy et al. 1999; Solomon et al. 2001). Also, patterns of use have changed in response to changes in cropping, pest pressure, introduction of genetically modified crop (GMO) technology, and competing pesticides. Uses of CPY are the primary determinants of the entry of CPY into the environment and its subsequent fate in the regions of use and beyond. The purpose of this paper is to provide a synopsis of uses and properties of CPY and the results risk assessments conducted for aquatic life and terrestrial biota. Mammals were not addressed in any of these risk assessments because they are less sensitive to CPY and do not have as large a potential for exposure as do birds. It was previously concluded that, if birds are not affected by a particular pattern of use, then mammals occurring in the same environment would also not be adversely affected (Solomon et al. 2001)."
230,502,0.992,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Abstract A growing body of literature reports on the abundance and effects of plastic debris, with an increasing focus on microplastic particles smaller than 5 mm. It has often been suggested that plastic particles in the <100 nm size range as defined earlier for nanomaterials (here referred to as ânanoplasticsâ), may be emitted to or formed in the aquatic environment. Nanoplastics is probably the least known area of marine litter but potentially also the most hazardous. This paper provides the first review on sources, effects and hazards of nanoplastics. Detection methods are in an early stage of development and to date no nanoplastics have actually been detected in natural aquatic systems. Various sources of nanoplastics have been suggested such as release from products or nanofragmentation of larger particles. Nanoplastic fate studies for rivers show an important role for sedimentation of heteroaggregates, similar to that for non-polymer nanomaterials. Some prognostic effect studies have been performed but effect thresholds seem higher than nanoplastic concentrations expected in the environment. The high surface area of nanoplastics may imply that toxic chemicals are retained by nanoplastics, possibly increasing overall hazard. Release of non-polymer nanomaterial additives from small product fragments may add to the hazard of nanoplastics. Because"

Nevertheless, the outbreak of Hendra increased the unpopularity of flying foxes in Australia, making conservation of the four native species challenging (Thiriet 2011). Unlike Hendra, Nipah virus has likely been acquired by humans via consumption of contaminated date palm sap (Luby et al. 2006; Rahman et al. 2012), followed by person-to-person transmission (Gurley et al. 2007). Although diseases associated with Hendra virus and Nipah virus have high mortality rates, the risk of infection for humans seems to be low (Chong et al. 2003), and countermeasures may be taken in order to prevent future spillover events (see Sect. 10.5.2). MERS, just as Hendra virus, apparently needs livestock as an amplifier host. In contrast to dromedaries (Hemida et al. 2014), seroprevalence of MERS seems to be low in bats (Memish et al. 2013), making direct transmission from bats to humans unlikely. As long as details on MERS infections in dromedaries and how to mitigate them are missing, it is hard to give recommendations to people who might be at risk. In contrast to MERS, the spillover of SARS into the human populations most likely happened via the wildlife market, either directly from a bat, or from other wildlife species. Likewise, the hunting, butchering and consumption of chimpanzees, gorillas and bats seem to have been sources of Ebola spillovers from wildlife to humans. The education of local communities needs to carefully balance information about the potential risk of acquiring infectious diseases by consuming bushmeat, without implying that bats need to be eradicated in order to prevent spillovers. The recent outbreak of Ebola resulting in several thousand human victims, and with bats frequently being reported as the likely source of origin, has undoubtly led to severe loss of reputation of bats on this continent, which makes the conservation of threatened populations and species even more challenging, not only in Africa, but also worldwide."
36,462,0.992,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"raising turbine cut-in speed) could be enforced on the basis of reduced bat activity or bat fatalities. In Sweden, there were no national guidelines until 2011 (Rydell et al. 2012), and more than ten years after the first turbines were built. Hence, many wind turbines in Sweden were constructed in poor locations with respect to bats, such as along the coast, and with operation permitted without any mitigation measures. After 2011, however, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency concentrated resources to achieve national acceptance for the guidelines among decision makers, the industry and NGOs, and to implement them on all new project. In 2014, all proposed wind facilities are subject to a pre-construction survey and an evaluation regarding the risk to bats. In the Netherlands, all bats are species of annex II and/ or IV of the European Habitats Directive EIA, and risk assessment and evaluation under Flora and Fauna law (research on what species are present) and possibly Nature Conservation law (when EHD annex II species are present) are obligatory. When risk species are present and fatalities cannot be excluded, a permit for construction is needed under FF law and NC law, and information on fatalities needs to be established using protocols and a curtailment may be required (Boonman et al. 2013; Limpens 2013). Mitigation studies have shown that bat fatalities can be reduced substantially (e.g., Baerwald et al. 2009; Arnett et al. 2011). Although curtailing turbines holds great promise, the problem is that developing thresholdsâthose values that trigger some actionâto mitigate bat kills is difficult, especially when supporting data are limited or imperfect (Arnett et al. 2013c). In Germany, recent models accounting for multiple environmental variables that predict and reduce collision rate and further minimize loss of energy production offer promise for mitigating bat fatalities (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2013). However, these algorithms and most other operation protocols still tolerate an arbitrary number of bat fatalities (currently two bat fatalities per wind turbine per year where these algorithms are used in Germany) (Voigt et al. 2015a); any such fatality trigger in Europe is seemingly in opposition to current law, given that European legislation does not allow deliberate killing of any bat, regardless of population effects. Additionally, with increasing numbers of wind turbines, fixed annual âper capitaâ (i.e., per wind turbine) mortality rates may not be acceptable in light of limited bat population sizes, and the acceptance of a reduced fatality rate may not necessarily be consistent with national and EU legislation (Voigt et al 2015a). Regulatory authorities in the US state of Pennsylvania and the Canadian province of Ontario set thresholds for initiating curtailment based on the annual mean number of bats killed per turbine (28 and 10 bat fatalities/turbine, respectively Arnett et al. 2013c). Arnett et al. (2013c) argued that this approach sets a dangerous precedent and has several flaws, none the least of which is the assumption that bat populations are currently stable and remain so. This approach also ignores expanding development of wind turbines that will likely yield increasing bat fatalities per population or region. Policy and management efforts to mitigate bat fatalities and conserve bat populations affected by wind turbines should be proactive and based on science rather than being reactive and arbitrary."
18,81,0.992,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"One of the characteristics of the Fukushima Daiichi Accident is the fact that people are very much concerned about the impact of radiation exposure on children. The protection of children in the accident aftermath has been of particular concern, and parents are extremely worried about the protection of their offspring. They are suspicious that the levels of dose applied for the protection of the population as a whole do not provide sufficient safety for their offspring. The doubt may have been amplified by the natural tendency of human beings to be sensitive about children and infants. I believe that it is the time for UNSCEAR to start efforts to provide a clear summary of the current information on radiation risk of children and infants and for ICRP to start efforts for revision of their recommendation to include a radiation protection scheme for children. ICRP has developed a radiation protection scheme for three categories of exposed individuals: workers in occupational exposure, members of the public in public exposure, and patients in medical exposure. ICRP seems to consider that the"
241,1147,0.992,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Some of the most profound effects of the projected salinity decline involve losses in functional diversity that would accompany the loss of marine elements in the fauna. Also, the potential increase in primary production and sedimentation of organic matter in the northern Baltic Proper, as well the climate-driven decrease in trophic efï¬ciency, as suggested for the Gulf of Bothnia, are potentially important factors for benthic communities. Human-induced pressures, such as overï¬shing and eutrophication, may erode the resilience of the Baltic Sea ecosystem, thereby making it more vulnerable to climatic variations. The Baltic Sea communities, that are poor in both species and genetic diversity, may therefore be particularly vulnerable to external forcing factors caused by the climate change.

151,446,0.991,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Data on non-Apis bees was scant, and data available for NTA as surrogates for non-Apis pollinators was not usable in the risk assessment. However, in many cases the honey bee is a suitable surrogate for exposure and effects in other pollinating insects. Since all insect pollinators have in common certain aspects of their behavior, biology, and ecology, worst-case exposures for honey bees should generally be protective of non-Apis bees. However, there are a number of biological and ecological characteristics of these taxa that can influence risk. Some of these have been described previously and relate to: the role of the queen in founding nests in the spring; increased susceptibility due to smaller colony nest size (i.e., less redundancy); the smaller size of some of non-Apis bees that leads to greater potential for exposure (i.e., greater surface area:volume ratio); the smaller foraging range; and the location and construction of nests (EFSA 2012; Thompson and Hunt 1999). We identified several data gaps and areas of uncertainty in our assessment of CPY on pollinators. Below, we summarize key research topics that deserve more research attention, many of which are relevant to other insecticides: â¢ Given the increasing recognition of the significant role that wild bees have in agricultural and natural ecosystems (Garibaldi et al. 2013), more data are needed on non-Apis species to accurately evaluate the risk of CPY to these taxa as part of higher tier testing. â¢ More information on sublethal effects of CPY on pollinators is needed, in view of the recent increased focus on behavioral effects such as navigation to and from the hive. However, accepted guidelines for sublethal tests are also required. â¢ The stability and rate of degradation of CPY residues in nectar, pollen, and bees wax should be determined. Area-wide concentrations have been reported in monitoring studies, but the concentrations of CPY in nectar and pollen over time, following a defined field application, have not been quantified. Concentrations are expected to be lower on pollen and nectar than foliage for non-systemic insecticides like CPY, but the Tier-1 assessment models assume the same levels are present in all parts of the plant. In addition, depending on floral phenology, pollen present at the time of application will likely be available or attractive to foraging pollinators for only a few days after application. Quantification of concentrations of CPY in pollen and nectar over time after application would help to refine the risk assessment and facilitate testing in the laboratory with environmentally relevant concentrations and routes of exposure. â¢ How CPY partitions and transfers between wax and bee brood or the food stored in wax cells is unknown. It is possible that wax represents a sink for CPY in the colony and that the residues are not bio-available when present at the concentrations that have been reported in wax. Although there can be a risk of sublethal effects from residue in wax for some pesticides, this was not the case for CPY (Wu et al. 2011). â¢ Partitioning of CPY from wax, in the range of concentrations that have been reported, into the airspace of a colony should be quantified. The physical properties of CPY and its strong propensity to partition into nonpolar substances makes"
302,197,0.991,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"identification of different polymers from the fish intestinal tracts suggests a wider range of inputs related to urban waste [17]. The consequence of plastic debris and MPs in the lake ecosystem requires further research. Other types of solid waste, such as those originating from paper production and agriculture, were found to interfere with the distribution of macroinvertebrate communities in the Kenyan waters of Lake Victoria [52]. Future investigations could also consider the trophic transfer of MPs through the freshwater food chain, particularly in the case of Nile perch which are known to feed on smaller fish (haplochromine cichlids) and gastropods, as well as any potential âvector effectâ that facilitates the movement of adhered contaminants through the food chain [53]. These are important aspects to study primarily because the top predators in these food chains are the local residents that ultimately consume the fish. Given the existing population density surrounding Lake Victoria and its estimated growth, the prevalence of plastic debris and subsequently MPs is also likely to increase. The reliance on the lake as a resource means that any potential impacts of MPs on the ecosystem and biota need to be researched, assessed, and, if possible, mitigated. However, research activities should not be confined only to Lake Victoria. A number of African freshwater bodies are just as likely or even more likely to be impacted by MP pollution. Potentially, the main message to be taken from these case studies is the relative simplicity by which they were accomplished. In particular, the purchase of fish from market and subsequent dissections required little specialist scientific equipment and could be replicated in other locations. In the following section, we consider the current challenges to MP research and mitigation in Africa and discuss future research needs."
133,332,0.991,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Strengths and Restrictions This study and our results have some restrictions. First of all, the health indicator used must be questioned. Illness is operationalized by longstanding illness. In the questionnaire of the Microcensus, neither a deï¬nition of illness is given nor is the severity of illness requested. The time frame of four weeks, which was set as the minimum duration of illness to deï¬ne a person as ill, is intended to compensate for this weakness. The relatively high item non-response in the health variable might be problematic, as it has to be assumed that non-respondents are in poor health (Goldberg et al. 2001). The consideration of persons living in private households only might lead to an underestimation of ill people, as especially serious illness is often associated with a stay in a health institution and these people are not included in our study. It should also be questioned whether our indicator reflects the health status for all persons equally or is more relevant to those who are active in the labour market. Because employment rates differ partially between Germans and migrants in Germany, this could cause a bias. Additionally, it should be kept in mind that migrants have fewer chronic diseases and more infectious diseases (see Section âWhy Investigate the Health of Migrants and Distinguish Between Different Migration Backgrounds?â), thus this indicator may not completely cover the spectrum of diseases among migrants. Finally, the deï¬nitions of health and illness are culturally shaped (Helman 2007) so it is conceivable that Germans, Turkish migrants, and Aussiedler differ in their perception of health and illness and have different patterns in the utilization of health care services and consult physicians more or less frequently. Language barriers among migrants may reinforce this effect and might contribute to a lower awareness of health status among migrants. The fact that the proportion of nonresponse is slightly higher among the migrant groups (18.43% among Turks and 16.05% among Aussiedler) than among the German group (14.99%) indicates uncertainty in answering this question among migrants, but might also reflect a sponsorship-effect (the Microcensus is carried out on behalf of the Federal Statistic Ofï¬ce and this ofï¬cial character could help that respondents answer in the sense of the sponsor or to avoid undesirable answers). Misunderstandings and misinterpretation due to language problems in the interviews with migrants/non-German speakers could be an additional bias. Second, there are further restrictions on the contextual level. A generalisation of our ï¬ndings should be veriï¬ed. Health outcomes, motives for a speciï¬c household type, levels of integration, family ideals, and norms are strongly shaped by cultural beliefs, social policies, and other macro structural influences, which means that a transmission of the results, e.g. to other countries, should be part of subsequent studies. Our results reflect the mechanisms in the conservative welfare state of Germany, as well as the cultural values and perceptions of the sub groups analyzed (native Germans, Turks, and Aussiedler in Germany). Third, with our study design, causality cannot be found, as we carried out a cross-sectional study. We assume that household structures affect health outcomes. This assumption is in line with theoretical approaches (Berman et al. 1994) and"
10,373,0.991,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The interview campaigns held within the DROP project highlighted that the broad public is in general unaware of the risks and challenges water providers are facing due to drought. Users are accustomed to a high quality of service 24 h a day, 7 days a week; service interruption is seen as someone not having done his homework, rather than a possibility that can arise as a result of different natural risks to service provision. In addition, stakeholders highlighted that the broad public is typically unaware of the sources of their drinking water. In the Eifel-Rur region, for instance, the overall public perception is that the reservoirs provide other more visible services than drinking water, such as flood protection or opportunities for sailing and tourism attraction. This lack of awareness is a drawback when trying to communicate drought risks to the broader public (La Jeunesse et al. 2015). Communication on droughts faces additional challenges in these flood-prone regions. These highly visible impacting events convey to the broader public the idea that a certain regionâs problems are related to dealing with too much water, and not too little of it, as far as reservoirs are managed for protection against floods and also sustain stream flows during low-flows periods. Conveying the concept that flood risk does not imply an absence of drought risk is a communicational challenge. Awareness of the topic among stakeholder groups seems not much higher than that of the broader public. Stakeholders, in general, do not consider drought and water scarcity issue as urgent from their perspective, and there is a lot of interest in keeping up business as usual or even in expanding water uses. The exceptions to this rule are the drinking water providers themselvesâsome proof is given by the fact that the water boards IAV and WVER are part of the DROP project, and in Flanders drinking water providers also counted this issue as on their agenda. Beyond drinking water providers, some environmental authorities considered were showing interest in the issue, fundamentally due to the environmental problems that could derive of the low flows. Somewhat surprisingly, environmental NGOs in the"
4,33,0.991,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"Child Experiences: The Stories That Make the Person When human beings become embryos, their complete genetic makeup is determined. The individuals they turn out to be is the consequence of the interaction between this genetic makeup and their life experiences. In a few cases, life experiences have no bearing on some important features, such as sex. In most cases though, the path is highly uncertain and strongly dependent on life experiences. Mounting causal evidence indicates that early experiences often have persistent, long-lasting, and significant effects on a wide array of important youth and adult outcomes. First, since developing countries have few mechanisms to cope with risk, environmental and economic shocksâsuch as severe weather, epidemiological events, or armed conflictâcan generate long-lasting negative effects, usually by way of their impact on nutrition.9 For example, Maccini and Yang (2009) look at the effect of rainfall in the Philippines; Almond (2006) studies the persistent impact of the Spanish influenza of 1918 in the United States; and Akresh and others (2012) analyze the effect of growing up during the Nigerian civil war."
36,553,0.991,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Abstract Pteropodid bats damage a wide range of fruit crops, exacerbated by continuing loss of their natural food as forests are cleared. In some countries where such damage occurs, bats are not legally protected. In others, as a result of pressure from fruit growers, legal protection is either not implemented or overridden by legislation specifically allowing the killing of bats. Lethal control is generally ineffective and often carried out with shotguns making it an animal welfare issue, as many more animals are injured or orphaned than are killed. Here, we review the literature and current state of the conflict between fruit growers and pteropodids and describe a wide range of potential mitigation techniques. We compile an extensive list of bats and the fruit crops on which they feed where this has resulted in conflicts, or could lead to conflict, with fruit growers. We also discuss the legal status of bats in some countries where such conflicts occur. We found the most effective means of preventing bat damage to crops is the use of fixed nets (that generally prevent entanglement) covering a whole orchard. Netting individual trees, or fruit panicles, using small net bags, is also effective. Management methods that assist netting include pruning to maintain low stature of trees. These S.A.

376,824,0.991,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Human activities can fundamentally alter the social-ecological interactions within rangeland systems (Stafford Smith et al. 2007), particularly as enterprise owners and managers respond to biophysical drivers such as climate, or socioeconomic drivers such as local, regional, and international markets (Reynolds and Stafford Smith 2002; Reynolds et al. 2007; Chap. 8, this volume). Semiarid and arid rangeland systems may be among the most tightly coupled socio-ecological systems because of the high degree of climate variability and dependency among system components (Stafford Smith et al. 2007). We look to studies of past management response to change for insights that could benefit climate change adaptation. Drought is a normal part of climate and, although common in arid and semiarid rangelands, drought can occur in all types of climate (Thurow and Taylor 1999; Wilhite and Buchanan-Smith 2005). Drought is referred to as a slow-onset natural hazard, where effects of drought accumulate slowly over time. This slow onset, and the temporary nature of drought, often leads to a lagged response by landowners and managers. Drought impacts can be costly, with reductions in water supplies, forage, and livestock productivity. Herd liquidations, one response to drought, often occur on the downside of the price curve for livestock and restocking on the upside of the price curve (Bastian et al. 2006), resulting in financial challenges for the landowner (Torell et al. 2010). Drought has been a learning experience at the scale of an individual livestock enterprise; however, some enterprises may still be underprepared for subsequent droughts. Over 500 cattle ranchers in the state of Utah were surveyed after the 1999â2004 drought, described as the sixth most severe drought since 1898 in Utah (Coppock 2011). Herd size varied from less than 5 brood cows to over 300 head and grazed ecosystems included desert, grassland, and high-elevation grasslands. Only 14 % of cattle enterprises were prepared for the 1999â2004 drought. The experience of this drought increased the number of ranchers that self-identified as being better prepared for subsequent drought to 29 % when they were surveyed in 2006. A negative experience in the 1999â2004 drought and the perception that another drought was inevitable were primary motivations for increasing drought preparedness. The most common risk management actions put in place by ranchers after the 1999â 2004 drought included improving water for livestock, and diversifying family income (Table 15.2). While adaptive capacity for drought improved with this experience, still greater than 50 % of the livestock operators were only somewhat prepared or not prepared for the next drought. This lack of adaptive capacity ensures that crisis drought management will begin again when the next drought occurs."

Smallholder farmers in developing countries are particularly vulnerable. This is due to various factors: x Production often in more exposed areas, e.g. disadvantaged and mountain regions, marginal land; x Shortage or lack of financial means to invest in risk-reducing measures, e.g. irrigation, drainage, frost prevention; x Limited access to loans; x Limited access to inputs to improve production techniques, which might have risk-reducing effects. The livestock sector is more exposed to epizootic diseases than to climatic risks. There is a high risk of epizootic disease outbreaks being spread over a wide area and consequently causing high economic losses. Prominent examples of such outbreaks are foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the United Kingdom in 20018 and in South Korea in 2010â2011,9 as well as avian influenza in Asia since 2003.10 Though such large loss events have relatively long recurrence periods, the loss potential is huge. In many developing economies,11 farmers retain the risk of crop losses and epizootic diseases irrespective of the size of their farms. Their risk management mainly consists of diversifying their income sources by planting a variety of crops and breeding cattle. They have hardly any risk-transfer tools, which in turn limits the availability and range of agricultural production finance offered by banks. This situation has not changed with the development of microfinance and microinsurance12 over the last decade. Thus, neither microfinance nor microinsurance have made their way into the area of agricultural production. Although"
231,207,0.991,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"This chapter examines past and present studies of variability and changes in atmospheric variables within the North Sea region over the instrumental period; roughly the past 200 years. The variables addressed are large-scale circulation, pressure and wind, surface air temperature, precipitation and radiative properties (clouds, solar radiation, and sunshine duration). Temperature has increased everywhere in the North Sea region, especially in spring and in the north. Precipitation has increased in the north and decreased in the south. There has been a north-eastward shift in storm tracks, which agrees with climate model projections. Due to large internal variability, it is not clear which aspects of the observed changes are due to anthropogenic activities and which are internally forced, and long-term trends are difï¬cult to deduce. The number of deep cyclones seems to have increased (but not the total number of cyclones). The persistence of circulation types seems to have increased over the past century, with âmore extremeâ extreme events. Changes in extreme weather events, however, are difï¬cult to assess due to changes in instrumentation, station relocations, and problems with digitisation. Without thorough quality control digitised datasets may be useless or even counterproductive. Reanalyses are useful as long as biases introduced by inhomogeneities are properly addressed. It is unclear to what extent circulation over the North Sea region is controlled by distant factors, especially changes in Arctic sea ice."
255,181,0.991,Railway Ecology,"Conclusions There have been several studies that quantiï¬ed the level of various disturbances and their impacts on wildlife populations. Plants are, in general, the ï¬rst to be described in relation to air and soil contamination, perhaps due to the facility of realizing experimental analysis, or of using plants as bio-indicators. Nevertheless, there is still little scant knowledge about the mechanisms and processes underlying the behaviour of vertebrates, because most studies concerned only a small number of species (van der Grift 1999). There is strong evidence that noise, light, and vibrations that can reach from 85.5 to 97 dB(A), can affect insects, amphibians and birds (Fig. 6.2). In contrast, the availability of food and vegetation in the railway verges seems to overcome the noise pollution and seems to attract reptiles, some bird species, and several mammals (Fig. 6.2). There is a wide diversity of measures to minimize railway disturbances, but further studies are needed to understand the effectiveness of these measures in reducing railway disturbance of wildlife.

151,271,0.991,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"This ecological risk assessment of CPY and its oxon CPYO built upon a previous assessment (Giesy et al. 1999) and was refined to address changes in the labeled uses, different use patterns, and new toxicity data. Exposure data were taken from Williams et al. (2014), which characterizes measured and modeled concentrations of CPY in surface waters of the U.S. The major pathway for exposures to CPY in surface waters is direct accumulation from water, rather than through diet or from sediments. CPY adsorbs strongly to sediments, and this mitigates exposures to benthic invertebrates via sediment. CPYâs sediment behavior is consistent with the fact that toxicity is less frequently observed to occur via sediment than water under field testing conditions. The focus of the ERA was thus directed mostly to surface waters and water-column organisms. Because exposures to CPY in flowing surface waters are episodic with durations usually less than 2 d (Williams et al. 2014), recovery of organisms between pulses can reduce overall risks, but frequent pulses with short recovery periods could result in cumulative damage and cumulative risks. The few studies that have characterized recovery of the target enzyme (AChE) from CPY suggest that invertebrates recover more rapidly than fish. These recovery periods were from 1 to ~7 d for invertebrates, and periods of the order of 4â8 wk might be required for complete recovery of AChE in fish. These periods were considered in the risk assessment. In situations where there is potential for multiple pulsed exposures, a more complex model could be developed that includes accumulation, time to effects and species-specific rates of recovery of AChE. In this assessment of risk, to be conservative, it was assumed that recovery in all organisms would be at the upper bound of observed times (2â8 wk). This assumption likely results in an overestimate of risk. Characterization of acute toxicity of CPY showed that crustaceans were most sensitive to CPY (HC5 = 0.034 Î¼g CPY Lâ1), closely followed by insects (HC5 = 0.087 Î¼g CPY Lâ1). Fish were less sensitive (HC5 = 0.812 Î¼g CPY Lâ1). The little data available for aquatic stages of amphibians suggested that they were less sensitive to CPY than fish. Thus fish were protective of amphibians, and amphibians would only need to be considered in an ERA if fish were affected. This was not the case for CPY. Assessment of the results of a large number of studies of the effects of CPY in cosms suggested that the no observed adverse effect concentration in these systems (NOAECeco) was 0.1 Î¼g Lâ1. These data were derived from single and multiple exposures to CPY and support the conclusion that the HC5s for insects and crustaceans from acute toxicity studies are predictive and protective of toxicity under conditions"

Following regulation, PCB concentrations in the Baltic Sea have decreased substantially although they are still above pre-industrial levels. PBDE levels have also decreased in some places, but they too are well above targeted levels, whereas the situation for PFOS and in particular for PFOA has hardly improved at all. In the case of PCBs, while comprehensive measures took long to implement, initial preventive measures were taken early based on the precautionary principle. This contrasts with the cases of PBDEs, PFOS and PFOA, where the burden of proof on policy-makers has been high and hence caused severe delays in policymaking. There has, however, generally been a positive interplay in all three cases between the EU, which has legislated, and HELCOM, which has taken the role of concept and agenda setting. While environment-oriented policies, such as the Ecosystem Approach to Management under MSFD and BSAP, have grown in importance over time, polluter-oriented chemical legislation has been more important when it comes to final decision-making. Nevertheless, the general response has been reactive rather than proactive, and there is no indication that society responds faster today than in the past, at least not given the fact that awareness, experience and knowledge are greater today than a few decades back. Based on that insight, the article discusses various options for improving governance.

302,345,0.991,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"In 2009 the European Commission published a study on Europeansâ risk perception of potential hazardous chemicals in household products [9]. The results are interesting in the light of the abovementioned framework for âriskâ perception, biases, and drivers. The group of chemicals that were associated with the highest perceived risk were pesticides and herbicides used for home use. Of the respondents that answered, 70% said that this group of chemicals posed a risk in their perception. At the other end of the scale were toothpaste (7%) and hair shampoo (11%). The report concludes that people generally view personal risks lower than risks to the general public. This could be due to a perception of the personal risk being easier to control [9]. The report concludes that if a product is known to be risky, citizens could translate this knowledge into taking precautionary measures, which would again lower the perceived risk. This is in line with the theories about risk perception, i.e., the level of voluntariness as well as the level of control of the risk. Another important aspect for risk perception of household chemicals is the potency of the chemicals [9]. Chemical with high hazardous potential was generally"

The only regions where nature appears to be rather unthreatened by water scarcity are the two that have water reservoirs. In the Vilaine area, however, this has resulted in the reverse effect, namely that of flooding of wetlands in the dry season. This relates to a second issue, that of the degree of modiï¬cation of the water system. In all regions the water system has been modiï¬ed in the past, either for purposes of flood protection or agricultural efï¬ciency or both. All of these interventions had side effects on other services of the water system that were often not recognized when the interventions took place."
219,328,0.991,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"unimportant except in a few isolated cases. For example higher GDP per capita seems to be positively associated with SLM in SSA, but overall these two variables are not signiï¬cant in other regions. The lack of signiï¬cance of GDP may also hint at the fact that the impact of GDP is already captured by other variables indicating economic performance, which are available on a smaller geographic level, such as night-time light intensity. While night lights per se may represent a cruder measure of economic development than GDP, they do not ignore its spatial variability.5 This stresses the importance of including the variables in the analysis that contain information on a more detailed level, since land degradation may also be a highly dispersed phenomenon not limited to country borders or within-country boundaries. The conclusion we can draw is that GDP per capita is not a major factor influencing sustainable land management in many cases. Moreover, higher infant mortality rate, used as a proxy for poverty, has not prevented SLM in most regions of the world. Poorer households are expected to have higher reliance on natural resources, including land, for the livelihoods. Thus, they have more incentives to manage land sustainably. Moreover, the opportunity cost of labor in poorer locations is lower, thus allowing for its use in implementing labor-intensive SLM measures. This ï¬nding is also agrees with the results of Nkonya et al. (2008). On the other hand, those countries which have reduced infant mortality rates more than others seem to be also making more efforts toward SLM. Higher population density is also found to be leading to more land degradation, except in the most advanced countries and some middle income countries (Clusters 4 and 8). Supporting this ï¬nding, most estimations show that night time lighting intensity interacted with population density is leading to SLM. Night-time light intensity can be used as a proxy for socio-economic development of the area, the higher prevalence of non-farm sectors, and easier access to capital. More economically dynamic areas with larger populations, thus, can provide more incentives and opportunities for SLM adoptions and innovations (a la Boserup 1965), information costs can be assumed to be lower and technology spillover effects are more likely. However, densely populated, but economically backward areas seem to be following a more Malthusian scenario, where higher population is translating to more land degradation. It is also found that in advanced economies with higher night time lighting intensity, the effect of population density on promoting SLM is decreasing. This may be due to the overall higher level of night time lighting intensity in advanced economies, where even relatively less densely populated areas have high night time lighting intensity (and also high share of non-farm sectors). Rule of law was found to be positively associated with SLM in most cases, especially in SSA and other developing lower income countries, but not in Europe, and the countries of Clusters 4, 6 and 7. First of all, this may be due to nonlinearities in the effect of rule of law on SLM outcomes. Any increases from very low"
337,185,0.991,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"associated with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus,1 as measured in terms of poultry deaths, can be associated with anthropogenic environmental changes produced by urbanization, agricultural change, and natural habitat alterations. This is a novel way of looking at HPAI and other health risks like it, suggesting these risks are not an accident of time and place, but rather are the product of the modernization and urbanization transitions. We present the conceptual framework in the context of Vietnam because (1) it has been one of the nations most affected by HPAI, (2) has a rapid rate of development, and (3) has very comprehensive secondary databases relevant to such studies. The emergence of the HPAI was first reported in Vietnam at the end of 2003 (Delquigny et al. 2004). Three major epidemic waves of HPAI have occurred in poultry, resulting in 45 million birds culled between December 2003 and August 2005, leading to a 0.5 % reduction in GDP in 2004. As of 2012, a total of 123 confirmed human cases and 61 deaths were recorded (World Health Organization 2012). The country has attempted to control the infection through massive, repeated vaccination campaigns in combination with other control measures (Gilbert et al. 2008a). Vietnam is a particularly useful country to examine development transitions and their associated environmental transformations because these processes are occurring both exceptionally rapidly and simultaneously as traditional agricultural lands are converted to intensified commercial farming or reshaped into urban settlements to meet the needs of the growing population attracted to cities for emerging job opportunities (Douglass et al. 2002; Spencer 2007). If development transitions do pose new challenges to governance, and in particular environmental health challenges, then one would expect to see more of these types of problems in transitional agricultural or peri-urban areas as distinct from both predominately urban and rural areas. The Wilcox-Gubler-Colwell hypothesis of disease emergence was influenced by complexity theory, which argues that as complex adaptive systems (CAS) CNH systems exhibit far-from-equilibrium non-linear behavior often manifested as âsurpriseâ as with the case of abrupt and unexpected epidemiological phenomena including the emergence of entirely new diseases. Parallel to this, in biological science a re-envisioning has occurred in which nature is no longer seen as consisting of balanced ecological systems made up of relatively linear processes. Rather, natural systems are now seen as hierarchical, self-organized, non-equilibrial and non-linear systems in which emerging diseases can themselves be seen as âemerging propertiesâ of these CAS (Levin 1999). The traditional conception of the ecosystem, a fundamental paradigm in the ecological sciences, has thus been overturned (OâNeill 2001). As such, ecosystems, including âsocial-ecological systemsâ are now understood as characteristically producing emergent phenomena like the unexpected appearance of new pathogens, inherently unpredictable by conventional approaches and theory (e.g., epidemiological models). Moreover, nearly all emerging diseases are vector borne or zoonotic (i.e., maintained in natural host-pathogen cycles that âspill overâ to humans) (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005). They, or their immediate progenitors, exist as part of naturally co-evolved host-parasite complexes"
114,32,0.991,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Safety Is a Moving Target Safety is, in a number of respects, a constantly moving target. As standards improve and concern for safety grows within a system, a larger number of events will come to be considered as safety issues. In a very real sense innovation and improving standards create new forms of harm in that there are new ways the healthcare system can fail patients. In the 1950s many complications of healthcare were recognised, at least by some, but largely viewed as the inevitable consequences of medical intervention (Sharpe and Faden 1998). Gradually, certain types of incidents have come to seem both unacceptable and potentially preventable. The clearest example in recent times is healthcare-associated infection, which is no longer viewed as an unfortunate side effect of healthcare. With increased understanding of underlying processes, mechanisms of transmission and methods of prevention, coupled with major public and regulatory pressure, such infections are becoming unacceptable to both patients and professionals (Vincent and Amalberti 2015). In the last 10 years, as more types of harm have come to be regarded as preventable, the perimeter of patient safety has expanded. A larger number of harmful events are now regarded as âunacceptableâ. In addition to infections we could now include, in the British NHS, pressure ulcers, falls, venous thromboembolism and catheter associated urinary tract infections. In the United Kingdom the Francis Report into Mid Staffordshire Hospitals NHS Trust highlighted additional risks to patients, such as malnutrition, dehydration and delirium all of which are now being viewed as safety issues. We should also consider adverse drug reactions in the community that cause admission to hospital, polypharmacy and general harm from overtreatment. All these, in the past, might have been regretted but are now receiving greater attention through being viewed under the safety umbrella. The perimeter of safety is therefore expanding but this does not mean that healthcare is becoming less safe. A long-standing concern with safety in such specialties as anaesthesia and obstetrics is actually a marker of the high standards these specialties have achieved. Safety is an aspiration to better care and labelling an issue as a safety issue is a strongly motivational, sometimes emotional, plea that such outcomes cannot and should not be tolerated (Vincent and Amalberti 2015)."
36,522,0.991,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.7 Recommendations for Conservation of Hunted Bats 12.7.1 More Research is Needed to Understand Hunting Impacts One of the major challenges to bat conservation is lack of knowledge of how hunting affects bats, their population size, and distribution. Collecting these data requires trained biologists, sociologists, statisticians, and well-planned survey techniques and questionnaires that can address sensitive questions. For many regions and species, there is little or no population information on bats, so that population trends are unknown. Managers are therefore encouraged to start monitoring programs by which hunting impacts on population size can be tracked over time. Some bat conservation initiatives provide useful models for population size assessment and monitoring (e.g. Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Research Unit, Filipinos for Flying Foxes, WCS Malaysia, United States Department of Defense in the Mariana Islands, FFI Cambodia). Using the population size estimation and monitoring described, more studies are also needed that investigate the direct and indirect impacts of hunting on bat populations. For example, long term monitoring projects of both people and bats, could show trends in the correlations between number of hunted bats and bat population responses. Finally, more needs to be learned about the people hunting bats and the conditions that lead to increased hunting (Cawthorn and Hoff 2015). If it is understood why people hunt (e.g. for protein? for livelihoods? to vary their diet? for"
77,153,0.991,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Longitudinal Employment Status in People with CF People with chronic illnesses face numerous barriers to entering the labour market, and CF provides a case in point. Factors related to disease severity, such as reduced lung function may restrict employment choices for adults with CF, and the treatment burden further compounds this; adults with CF are generally expected to perform physiotherapy regularly and there are the added demands of taking large numbers of therapies, including frequent visits to hospital (Sawicki et al. 2009). The analysis of the UK Registry shows that at any one time, about 50 % of the UK CF population was recorded as being in full or part-time employment for all ages, but patterns differed by age, sex, and deprivation status. In a longitudinal analysis, all other things being equal, people from more disadvantaged areas in the UK were less likely to be in employment, and furthermore, social deprivation was found to modify the effect of disease severity in CF: poor lung function, as measured by lower lung function (%FEV1 ), is more harmful to employment chances for people living in the most disadvantaged circumstances compared to the least (Fig. 5.7, Table 5.2). A fall in lung function in people with CF has more of an effect on employment"
166,271,0.991,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"natural experiments â events that occur without the contribution of the researcher, where an exogenous source of variation in the social phenomenon of interest randomly determines individualsâ assignment to a treatment (Meyer 1995:151). Plant closure comes close to such a setting: at the individual level, the assignment to the treatment is random because the workers are dismissed independently of their health or work performance. The fact that the entire workforce of a company loses their job suggests that selection into displacement is limited (Eliason and Storrie 2009:1397; Gibbons and Katz 1991:353). Moreover, reverse causality is unlikely in the case of plant closure: if displaced workers are in poor health, it is unlikely that their sickness has caused the plant to close, but rather that plant closure and job loss have negatively affected their health (Kuhn et al. 2009:1099). The advantage of plant closure as an analytical instrument for unemployment thus is that displaced people were not primarily selected into unemployment â that is, dismissed â on the basis of other characteristics such as lack of motivation, poor health or an insubordinate personality. It is thus possible to identify the causal effect of redundancy on workersâ ensuing trajectories (Schwerdt et al. 2010:137). At the same time, this instrument is not immune to two types of selection bias. First, there may be some extent of self-selection of workers into industries and plants that are more vulnerable to economic and structural problems (Cha and Morgan 2010:1141). Evidence from Germany suggests that older workers and workers without technical training or university education are more likely to be made redundant (Burda and Mertens 2001:22â24). Thus, belonging to the workforce of a non-profitable plant is not completely random â confronted with a choice, much sought-after specialists may think twice before seeking employment in a plant that shows evidence of economic difficulties. The same study additionally shows that workers employed in small firms have a higher propensity to be dismissed. A second selection bias arises from the fact that some workers anticipate the closure of their plant and leave it before the closure is officially announced. If more ambitious or motivated workers select themselves out of the sample, the remaining sample is not representative for the total population. In an Austrian study, Schwerdt (2011:100) shows that early plant leavers tend to have higher re-employment rates and lower earning losses than workers displaced at the very end. According to the author the outcome is due to compositional differences between the two groups in terms of productivity-related characteristics. Turnover before plant closure thus seems to be selective."

Undisputedly, irrespective of probability and consequences these will expand the magnitude of risk exposure if frequency and duration increase. Consequently, the risk of probability and consequences will increase. Notwithstanding, arguably countervailing the bi-dimensionality of the approach is its easiness in that almost anyone from a worker to a senior manager can use it quickly to provide instantaneous risk assessments unless they are illiterate and/or colour blind. Similarly, small mining contractor businesses could use it after a small amount of training. Also, itâs relatively easy application to a multitude of risks stands in sharp contrast to ISO 31000 which could take weeks or even months to assess risks of this nature. Further, the complex numerous requirements and large process cycles of ISO 31000 is more suited to large organisations and probably are too unmanageable for small businesses. The results for environmental risks categorised in the Risk Magnitude Matrix are then summarised in separate tables for CBM, AMM and CMM for overall risks for those three categories in terms of the exploration, appraisal, operation and abandonment phases of the CBM/CSG extraction process comprising risk assessments of overall environmental risks (Table 16.2 portrays a partial overview of the extent of major risk exposure categories which in total number more than 40)."
302,350,0.991,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"plastic pellets when measured by number, the mass of the plastic pellets exceeded planktonic mass six times [23]. This âlitter artifactâ in the middle of the ocean was popularly called the âGreat Pacific Garbage Patch,â which had a significant impact on the public perception of the problem. The linguistic framing of the plastic pollution repelled the public by playing on the yuck factor, similar to the case of GMOs described above. The pollution was also unknown to many, making the novelty of the problem significant (driver 7). On the other hand, this description did give some backlash since it created an illusion of islands of plastics floating around in the ocean. Since such islands do not exist in reality, some commentators have argued that the environmental problem was exaggerated and that this could erode citizensâ trust in institutions [24]. Plastic pollution was not perceived as such a big risk in the decades after the first reports were published. This can be explained using several of the risk perception drivers (Table 1). Since plastic pollution was first reported as a phenomenon on the open ocean and not related directly to severe impacts on marine species and ecosystems, it was not perceived as a risk with âpotential for disasterâ (driver 4) nor a contamination that impacted a large group of people (driver 5). Debris in the middle of the ocean has no direct link to any human populations per se, which might also have affected the lack of public response (driver 5). Furthermore, oceanic pollution is abstract and not so tangible since it is not easily visible to most people. Therefore, the âGiddens paradoxâ (driver 8) might also have influenced the lack of perceived risk in these early years. Finally, there was very little information communicated to the public about the problem, for instance, from 2004 to 2010, microplastics were only mentioned a few times in UK newspapers, whereas the number of articles grew markedly in the following years [25]. Since people obviously cannot perceive a risk that they are not aware of, this lack of communication is a final but very important reason for the lack of early alertness to the problem."
365,723,0.991,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"sometimes referred to as Zambiaâs maize belt, as almost half of all maize produced in the country is grown in twelve of its districts (MAL 2007). AER IIa is also recognized as a vulnerable area. About 41% of Zambian farm households live in this region and are mostly engaged in crop production.3 The area is characterized by a semi-arid climate, where maize yields are projected to decrease significantly as a result of increased frequency of droughts and hot days and nights based on countryspecific climate change models (Kanyanga et al. 2013). Given the sampling frame of the data and evidence of expected benefits of the practices analyzed here under climate change,4 we focus our analysis only on AER IIa. Moreover, given the key importance of maize for food and nutrition security in the country (MAL 2007), we restrict our sample to maize producers, resulting in a subset of 487 households. The heterogeneity of the farm populations means that vulnerability is expected to differ significantly between households. To capture vulnerability differences that are relevant to policy choices, it is convenient to identify segments of the household population with common attributes, and to conduct analysis for these farmer groups. Cluster analysis provides a method to identify the appropriate number and description of farmer typologies (Acosta-Michlik and Espaldon 2008). We conduct our analysis for two types of smallholder households that were clearly identified based on cluster analysis: (i) smaller farms with few assets (hypothesized to be more vulnerable), and (ii) larger farms with more assets (hypothesized to be less vulnerable). We first conduct analyses of means to detect differences between the probability distributions of the production methods (CONV and MSD) between these two farm types. Variables analyzed include maize yields, labor use, fertilizer use, cash inputs, profits and returns to labor. Given the baselines obtained from the analysis of household types (low and high vulnerability) and production systems (CONV and MSD) it was clear that there are two distinct types of MSD applications in the sample: one that relies mostly on labor (using hand hoes to dig planting basins/potholes) and another that uses capital (oxen or machinery) for ripping. We denote these groups as MSD-L and MSD-K, respectively. This classification conforms with reports in the literature that find labor requirements for planting basins as one of the main constraints for the adoption of this practice in the region (Baudron et al. 2007; Mazvimavi 2011; Ngoma et al. 2014).5 No distinction regarding emphasis on capital or labor was identified in the case of CONV, which consisted of a relatively small sample."

One study that tried to untangle what seem to be contradicting observations was undertaken by an international group of ecological economists working with Thomas Wiedmann and published as âThe material footprint of nationsâ in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the US (PNAS). They show that DMC, despite being the lead indicator for the Green Growth and Green Economy studies and strategies of the EU, OECD and also the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), hosts two big blind spots: (1) it captures only those materials that made it into the ï¬nal products and leaves all the waste and extraction created in the process unaccounted for; (2) it allocates the resource extraction ï¬gures in the country where they occur and not in the countries where the products they are used for are consumed. This means that all the environmental impacts associated with extracting and processing raw materials into goods fall out of the picture. These include water resource depletion and pollution, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, mine tailings, and natural destruction or pollution through spillages and agrochemicals. In particular the production of metals involves digging out ores and turning them into concentrated commodities. It also means the obfuscation of the way in which the globalized supply chains rich countries use to primarily import materials or even semi-ï¬nished products relegate consumption and natural impact to two separate balance sheets (Wiedmann et al. 2015: 6273). This âleakageâ effect has already been criticized in connection with the commonly used statistics and thus negotiations about CO2 reduction commitments. To tackle these blind spots the research team used the Material Footprint (MF) as a consumption rather than production indicator. It measures all the natural impact that a particular economy creates, including unused extraction, and regardless of where resources happen to be taken out. The indicator has also been called Total Material Requirement (TMR) and comparing it with DMC shows a âprocess of externalization of resource-intensive processes of mature economiesâ in which the MF per capita becomes considerably larger than the standard measure (ibid.: 6273). The United Kingdom and Japan are at the extreme end not only regarding this statistical aberration but also in their dependence on imports for their levels of ï¬nal consumption. When checking for correlations with factors that influence the levels of MFâ such as availability of raw materials, density of population or GDP per capitaâthe ï¬ndings conï¬rm âa very strong link found previously between growth in building materials, ores, and fossil fuels use and economic growth in most of developing Asia, most notably in China,â and, as in many other studies working with footprint indicators, with levels of income. For âa 10 % increase in wealth, the MF would increase by 6 %â (Wiedmann et al. 2015: 6273)."

187,424,0.99,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"For the CAM we distinguish between impact and consequence. Impact is the direct outcome of an event, for example the destruction of a private house or the reduction/loss of function of an infrastructure. An impact has consequences, for example the rebuild cost of a private house or the economic losses due to the reduction/loss of the infrastructure function for infrastructure stakeholders. Impact can be differentiated in direct and indirect impacts. Direct impacts are the direct damages to CI elements or other assets. Indirect impacts are the cascading effects. Consequences can also be differentiated into direct and indirect consequences. Direct consequences are directly related to the impact, for reconstruction cost of a flooded building. Indirect consequences are indirectly related to the impact, for example the number of homeless persons. A further differentiation is possible in CI related and other consequences. CI related consequences are related to the impacts of an incident on CI, for example the recovery costs for a CI operator, the GDP loss produced by a power outage or the number of households without electricity. Other consequences are related to the impacts on everything else, for example the re-construction cost of flooded houses. CA therefore comprises the estimation and assessment of these types of consequences of impacts."
164,64,0.99,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","The marginality framework takes into account the diversity of causes of people living in poverty. As this diversity of factors causing poverty is frequently clustered, it has been referred to as âcausal complexesâ or âmarginality patternsâ by Gatzweiler et al. (2011, 9). Examples of such patterns are low agricultural productivity caused by an inability to irrigate as a result of water shortages due to low water tables and the lack of collective action resulting from central planning that in turn cause critical human health conditions under which the elderly, woman, and children suffer most and therefore cannot contribute their labor or receive education, which limits their ability to change or escape the systems they are part of. Causal complexes that are self-referential systemic feedback loops are also referred to as âpoverty trapsâ (Dasgupta 2009).

74,99,0.99,Tuberculosis in Adults and Children (Volume 2.0),"TB is a curable disease. The fact that it remains the most pressing public health problem for a signiï¬cant proportion of the world, despite the availability of a cure and knowledge on prevention of transmission shows how medicine can fail without commitment at all levels of the community. The distribution of the TB pandemic painfully demonstrates the inequalities in health care delivery globally. Over 95 % of cases and deaths are in low and middle income countries. In general, prognosis of outcome is dependent on a multitude of factors: host factors (genetic variance, co-morbidities, HIV-coinfection, treatment adherence, access to healthcare) and pathogen factors (pathogen virulence, drug-resistance) and the site of the infection (pulmonary or extrapulmonary). The principle factor in a favourable outcome for all forms is early recognition and appropriate treatment. TB is the most common cause of death among HIV patients, estimated to cause a quarter of AIDS related deaths. Drug resistant TB is a growing problem and threatens to reverse the recent gains in global TB control. In regions of the former soviet states MDR TB is found in over half of all new TB cases and threatens a return to untreatable strains of TB disseminating globally without immediate and sustained action. Of the 34,000 MDR patients enrolled on treatment in 2010, only 48 % successfully completed treatment and 15 % died. Among 795 XDR cases, mortality was approximately 50 %. The key to maintaining the momentum towards achieving the STOPTB target of global TB eradication by 2050 will be sustained commitment from donors, governments, national TB programmes, researchers and other stakeholders at all levels of society."
260,152,0.99,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"lead to at least short-term density-independent transmission. Lastly, as noted above, ranaviruses may persist in the environment long enough to be transmitted to naÃ¯ve hosts. Perhaps more importantly, fish, amphibians and reptiles often overlap with other, less susceptible or more abundant species that act as biotic reservoirs for the species of interest. Collectively, there is good reason to think that ranaviruses can lead to host extinction (Miller et al. 2011). In spite of this potential for ranaviruses to cause host extinctions, it is difficult to find specific examples of ranavirus leading to regional or global extinctions or, until recently, declines. Few long-term datasets exist that have followed wild populations of ectothermic vertebrates with reoccurring die-offs from ranavirus, and at least for amphibians, long datasets are often required to be certain of declines (Alford and Richards 1999). To some degree this may be explained by the fact that ranaviruses often affect the larval or juvenile stages (see Sects. 2.1 and 3.3) and for many taxa these stages can be less important demographically than adults (Biek et al. 2002). We would thus expect populations or species where the adults were most affected by ranaviruses to display the greatest declines (but see Earl and Gray 2014). Indeed, Teacher et al. (2010) reported an 81 % median reduction in population abundance of common frog (Rana temporaria) adults at ponds in the UK with known reoccurring die-offs from ranaviral disease. Again, ranaviruses in the UK appear to primarily affect adults (Cunningham et al. 1993; Teacher et al. 2010; Duffus et al. 2013). Similarly, the significant ranavirus mortality observed in adult turtles presumably puts these populations at increased risk of extinction as well (Belzer and Seibert 2011; Farnsworth and Seigel 2013). Repeated ranavirus epidemics in larval amphibians may also lead to declines and local extinctions. Petranka et al. (2003, 2007), for instance, reported minimal recruitment of wood frogs at several newly constructed wetlands over an 8-year period due to annual die-offs from ranaviral disease. Recently, Earl and Gray (2014) used a matrix population-projection model to demonstrate that local extirpation of a closed wood frog population was likely if larvae or metamorphs were exposed to ranavirus once every 5 years. For populations that were exposed every year, time to extinction could be as rapid as 5 years (Earl and Gray 2014). Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that survival of the pre-metamorphic stages was more important than post-metamorphic stages for the wood frog, providing initial evidence that significant mortality of larvae due to ranavirus could lead to population extinction (Earl and Gray 2014). Susceptible species in fragmented landscapes with limited dispersal may be at greater risk of extinction than has been previously recognized (Collins and Crump 2009). The most compelling example of recurring ranavirus epidemics leading to amphibian declines comes from the Picos de Europa National park in Spain (Price et al. 2014). These communities were monitored for six years, during which ranaviruses were apparently introduced, leading to significant declines over the following years. What makes these virus-host community interactions different from others that have not suffered declines remains unknown. Clearly, there is a need for more studies of the population-level effects of ranavirus outbreaks, particularly long-term studies of sites with reoccurring ranavirus die-offs (Gray et al. 2015)."
219,82,0.99,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Analysis of the Cases In all four cases the drivers of land degradation are the same: anthropogenic drivers such as population growth and poverty combined with natural drivers such as background soil erosion and climate change. However, the characteristics of the land users alone do not explain the action/inaction to combat the drivers. A whole set of structuralâor âinstitutionalââlayers modify, alter, or even determine how the drivers translate in actual land degradation. The case of China shows that every context has different determinants, which can be situated at household, institutional, or governmental level. The Guatemala case highlights that historical events, such as the settlement of colonisers in the fertile areas, and economic structures, such as the need for labour force, have triggered or aggravated the process of land degradation. In the Kenya case it is the type of land and water tenure, and especially the fragmentation of land and water tenure, that explain how drivers such as population growth and failing institutions determine where land degradation is more or less severe. The Tunisian case show that well-conceived policies can be effective in changing the land usersâ behaviour, but the case also shows that the participatory policies of the 1990s were much more effective than the top-down policies of the 1970s and 1980s."

Small scale hydroelectric and solar systems can reduce emissions, enable adaptation and help local livelihoods although there are numerous problems that limit the success of projects including poor design, inequitable distribution of benefits, negative user perceptions, and poorly designed or non-existent governance and maintenance structures. Although the design of some case study projects did not allow for the triple objective to be currently met, this does not preclude the projects from meeting it in the future. In some projects, a proper PAR analysis wasnât carried out as there were no extreme weather events reported or any other emergency that showed the usefulness, robustness or vulnerability of the technology or of the population thanks to the infrastructure. Indeed, some DRE projects can be more robust, and some have already been rebuilt after specific extreme weather events. Some users indicated that their systems could still be working had the local donor or implementing NGO been more aware and visited more often and not disappeared. This points to the need for greater and better monitoring as well as evaluation, which hadnât been carried out in some of the projects visited, despite their being implemented for more than 5 years. Table 11.5 gives a summary of the results of all the case studies, according to each major category of indicators. The notes below explain in greater detail the concept of each column."
386,101,0.99,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"pesticides in the US each year. Fatalities for humans are certainly lower, but worldwide deaths and chronic diseases may reach one million per year. GMO certainly do not reach this extent of acute damage. However, the opponents of GMO raise three major points against working with modified seeds: â About 80% of GM crops have herbicide resistance as their innovative characteristic. This means that the main impact of GMO is the increased usage of total herbicides. The âNon-GMO Projectâ argues that the use of total herbicides like Roundup has increased by the factor 15 since GMO came on the market. â For pesticides, some detrimental long-term effects only became visible decades after usage. It still can be argued that negative long-term effects of GMO (be it on human health or the environment) may not be visible yet, although this argument loses weight over time. â GMO-technology requires major investments in infrastructure and knowledge. This is an advantage for multinational companies like Monsanto and Syngenta and prevents their use for minor breeding companies. Therefore, the use of GMOtechnology has implications for the seed industryâs structure. These (and other) reservations against GMO have led a number of countries such as Russia, Peru, Venezuela or Austria to ban the use of GMO in agriculture and even imports of GMO-produced food and feed. Other countries such as Germany and France also do not allow cultivation but tolerate imports. This is another significant distinction to the organic market, where no government has banned the cultivation of conventional crops or the import of conventional food products. The reason for this difference cannot be the harm caused by GMOâor conventional production but more likely lies in the benefits. Few governments would like to impair the productivity that artificial fertilizers and synthetic pesticides have brought to their agriculture, which would be the consequence of banning conventional agriculture. Compared with this scenario, the costs of banning herbicide-resistant GM crop varieties are relatively There is also a political reason that would speak for banning GMO, at least for European administrations. According to a âEurobarometerâ in 2010, 59% of Europeans believe that GM food is not safe for their health. This high degree of scepticism leads us to the question of labelling. If food containing GMO is sold, should consumers be made aware of it? Two agricultural economists from Greece developed a model after their emigration to the US showing that labelling brings advantages. Their model, as shown in Fig. 3.4, sorts consumers in relation to their attitude towards artificial technologies. On the very left, you find consumers indifferent to how their food was produced. On the very right, consumers are opposed to any kind of artificial inputs and have a high preference for organic food. In the reference scenario, there is no labelling of GM food. The net utility for eating non-labelled (nl) food is defined by the gross utility (U) and the foodâs price (pnl ), as is the utility of eating organic (o) food, which depends on U and po . Predictably, the xnl segment on the left derives higher utility from eating non-labelled food, whereas"

36,718,0.99,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Cave-dwelling bats are especially vulnerable to harvesting for consumption and trade due to their aggregation into these confined spaces. Reviews of global patterns in bat hunting for bushmeat indicate that this is common in the Old World tropics, but with possible exceptions, does not appear to be widespread or having a significant effect in other regions (Mickleburgh et al. 2009; Mildenstein et al. 2016). Though a problem in Madagascar and in many African countries, the threat to cavedwelling bats appears to be most widespread and acute in the Asian tropics, where bat harvesters target many species. For instance, Hall et al. (2002) reported dramatic declines in E. spelaea and the greater naked bat (Cheiromeles torquatus) during their successive surveys of Niah caves, Sarawak compared with numbers recorded in earlier surveys by Medway (1958) and attribute this to hunting for human consumption. While Asian hunters often target species that are large, colonial and/or abundant (e.g. E. spelaea, Rousettus spp., C. torquatus, C. plicatus and bent-winged bats Miniopterus spp.), smaller bats are also taken and harvesting activities are highly likely to negatively affect other species sharing the same caves (Hutson et al. 2001; Mickleburgh et al. 2009). Given the scale and severity of bushmeat hunting on bats, there is a pressing need for research on sustainable harvesting. Despite its widespread occurrence, accounts of the impact of guano harvesting upon cave-dwelling bats appear to remain largely anecdotal. This may stem in part from the difficulty of accurately monitoring large bat colonies, although rates of guano accumulation and harvesting records reflect their size (Fig. 15.9)."
187,13,0.99,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"Indeed as outlined above as well as noted in [7], many economic, social, political and technological reasons have caused a rapid change in the organisational, operational and technical aspects of infrastructures. These infrastructures, that in the past could be considered as autonomous vertically integrated systems with very few points of contact with respect to other infrastructures, are now tightly coupled and show large numbers of dependencies. This has generated many positive effects to our society and the well-being of populations, but has increased the complexity, the vulnerability of infrastructures and the related risk to our societies at the same time. Several episodes emphasised such fragility. TNO has collected more than 9,550 CI disruption events which caused the failure of 12,400 infrastructure services through cascading between 2005 and now. Some example events are described in Table 1. Even if the example incidents illustrated in Table 1 are very different in terms of primary causes, extension and consequences, all of them are characterised by non-intuitive dependencies and, especially, by inadequate protection measures to manage the crisis. This is mainly due to the incomplete understanding of an event and especially of its direct and indirect consequences [8, 9]. This is, unfortunately, an effect of the increased complexity of the socio-technical scenario largely characterised by the presence of dependencies among different CI."
320,462,0.99,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Significant climate change pressures such as increasing temperatures, decreasing precipitation, seasonal changes and extreme phenomena, affect the habitats of the Bucegi Natural Park and we can expect the loss of those plants which will no longer have adequate conditions for survival and a gradual change of their habitats. The analyses of the structure of the plant communities and of their ecological spectrum offer some indication of the potential future tendencies in the habitatsâ changes. In this regard, the selected Natura 2000 habitat type 6150, well represented in the Carpathian Mountains, populated by plant species strongly depending on low temperatures and the presence of snow can be considered as potentially vulnerable. A way to buffer as much as possible the effects of climate change on alpine habitats, could be linked to efforts to decrease or limit the impact of human activities, thus avoiding, or at least diminishing, the cumulative effects of climatic and non-climatic stress.

260,9,0.99,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"important insights not only into iridovirus replication, but also eukaryotic biology, virus evolution, and hostâvirus interactions. Elucidating the molecular and cellular events of FV3 replication occupied Allan, his co-workers, and others in the USA and Europe from the discovery of FV3 in 1965 until the early 1990s (Murti et al. 1985; Williams 1996). However, despite the molecular insights gained in these studies, investigations of FV3 and other members of the family languished for a variety of reasons. After some initial optimism, it was clear that invertebrate iridoviruses were not suitable, as was baculovirus, as an insect biocontrol agent. Furthermore, FV3 and related vertebrate iridoviruses were initially viewed as minor pathogens, because few outbreaks of ranaviral disease were reported, and those that were, appeared to have minor effects on populations. In addition, unlike LCDV, there was little evidence of infection among ecologically or commercially important fish species. Therefore, even before the recent emphasis on âtranslational research,â iridovirus studies took a backseat to more medically and commercially relevant poxviruses and herpesviruses. However, beginning in the mid-1980s and continuing to the present, this sanguine view of ranaviruses slowly changed, as an increasingly large number of isolates similar to, but not necessarily identical with, FV3 were linked to die-offs of fish, reptiles, and amphibians (frogs, toads, and salamanders) of both ecological and commercial importance (Chinchar et al. 2009). To date, cases of ranavirus infection and disease have been documented on six continents and in at least 175 species of ectothermic vertebrates (Duffus et al. 2015). It is unclear whether the global emergence of ranaviruses is a reflection of their increased virulence or dissemination (via natural or human-related activities) or increased surveillance coupled with better diagnostic and detection mechanisms. Regardless of the reasons, ranaviruses are now viewed as pathogenic agents capable of infecting all classes of ectothermic vertebrates (fish, reptiles, and amphibians) and, depending upon the specific virus, host, and environmental factors, triggering significant morbidity and mortality. The family Iridoviridae currently contains five genera, two of which infect invertebrates (Iridovirus and Chloriridovirus) and three that infect only ectothermic vertebrates (Lymphocystivirus, Megalocytivirus, and Ranavirus; Jancovich et al. 2015a). Lymphocystiviruses and megalocytiviruses only infect fish, whereas, as indicated above, ranaviruses target fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Infection of âhigherâ vertebrates (i.e., birds and mammals) has not been reported. However, this block likely reflects a temperature limit above which the virus cannot replicate (approximately 32 Â°C), and not a lack of suitable cellular receptors, as ranaviruses can replicate in mammalian cell lines (e.g., baby hamster kidney) when incubated at 30 Â°C. Ranaviruses also cause apoptotic cell death in mammals even if the pathogen has been inactivated by heat or radiation (Grayfer et al. 2015). Thus, ranaviruses represent a group of pathogens that possesses a wide host range and the potential to affect diverse populations of vertebrate species around the globe. The question frequently arises, âAre ranaviruses a significant threat to wildlife?â We believe the answer is, âYes,â but that the seriousness of the threat is dependent"
36,461,0.99,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"In the European Union, all species of bats, regardless of numbers, are strictly protected by law and it is illegal to deliberately kill or harm bats irrespective of any population effects. âDeliberatelyâ means in this case that the actor is aware that activity may have an effect but still carries out the activity. The EIA Directive 85/337/EEC (amended to Council Directive 97/11/EC in 2011) legally requires an assessment to be carried out for all wind facilities with 5 or more turbines, or which are over 5 MW capacity. In addition, member states must restore or maintain their bat populations in favorable conservation status (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). All members of the EU have translated these directives into their domestic legislation which in theory should provide high levels of protection and a consistent way of handling the issue, based on the EUROBATS guidelines (Rodrigues et al. 2015). However, while bat issues are taken very seriously in some countries, this is not true in others. In the UK and Republic of Ireland, it is an offense to deliberately or recklessly kill or injure a bat or to deliberately disturb bats in a way that would significantly affect their local distribution or abundance, and detailed guidance is in place about the requirements for EIA. The EUROBATS guidance (Rodrigues et al. 2015) proposes that turbines should not be placed closer than 200 m to woodland, whereas the current recommendations for the UK are that the blade tips should be at least 50 m from woodland or hedgerows. It is argued that a smaller buffer size is acceptable because the activity of bats found in the UK tends to decline rapidly with increasing distance from linear landscape features and woodlands (Natural England 2014). It is officially acknowledged that risk assessments for bats in the UK and Republic of Ireland are hampered by a lack of evidence in crucial areas (Bat Conservation Ireland 2012; Natural England 2014). Not only are collision rates unknown, but population estimates, and therefore inferences about the impact of turbine collisions on population viability, are uncertain. Standardized post-construction monitoring, including acoustic and carcass surveys, is recommended for sites identified as âhigh riskâ (Bat Conservation Ireland 2012; Natural England 2014). In reality, little post-construction monitoring occurs. This is at least partly because responsibility for requiring and enforcing survey conditions lies with local planning authorities, which are reluctant to impose conditions which may be open to legal challenge. A particular difficulty is that while generic guidance on survey designs is available, there is no standardized methodology and so it is extremely difficult to judge whether a particular level of bat activity would place a site as being in a âhigh riskâ category: This point has already been raised at a legal review. Further, there has been no assessment of the relationship between pre-construction and post-construction acoustic surveys (or collision risk). It is therefore unclear how data collected pre-construction can be used to predict post-construction risk, particularly given evidence from the USA demonstrating a poor relationship between pre-construction activity surveys and bat fatalities (Hein et al. 2013). A final difficulty for Local Authorities is that the legal basis of bat protection relates to the conservation status of local populations (except in Scotland, where recklessly killing a bat is also an offense). Given that local population sizes are very poorly characterized, it is unclear how mitigation (such as"
133,293,0.99,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","were a minority and they emigrated to live as Germans among Germans. For Aussiedler, Germany is their cultural home (Janikowski 1999). Due to this German origin, Aussiedler are in the unique situation that they are legally recognized as âGermans by statusâ and can directly acquire citizenship, which entitles them to participate in the health and welfare system. Aussiedler immigrated from different countries, the majority come from the former Soviet Union (1.4 million), Poland (570,000), Kazakhstan (568,000), and the Russian Federation (555,000) (Statistisches Bundesamt 2015b). Studies demonstrate signiï¬cant differences between the host population, Turks, Aussiedler, and other migrant groups in Germany. Regarding health, non-Germans generally are exposed to other and higher health risks; while chronic diseases and cancers are less common among migrants compared to Germans without migration background, they have higher risks of suffering from musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases (Neuhauser and Razum 2008). These differences are at least partly explained by poor working and living conditions of non-Germans, and also reflect the relatively high medical standard in Germany6 (Neuhauser and Razum 2008). More detailed analyses reveal that Turks in Germany have increased morbidity, and especially higher risks for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and viral hepatitis (Knipper and Bilgin 2009). This is particularly attributed to an inactive lifestyle and other eating habits (Knipper and Bilgin 2009). Among Turks, eating has a high priority (Rehaag et al. 2012); a bountiful table is a sign of hospitality and although traditional Turkish cuisine is based primarily on vegetables, they are often prepared with copious amounts of oil (Zwick 2007). Aussiedler, on the other hand, exhibit increased risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (e.g. alcohol consumption, obesity, drugs), but seldom have severe diseases. Despite the pooling of risk factors, Aussiedler have surprisingly low rates of mortality (Becher et al. 2007; Wittig et al. 2004; Knipper and Bilgin 2009). Generally, these differences (between the groups of migrants and non-migrants) are more pronounced in women than in men (Worbs et al. 2013). The causes are mainly due to socioeconomic differences, but also cultural differences contribute to this (Neuhauser and Razum 2008). Turkish migrants in Germany have a low social status on average, e.g. low levels of education and a poor economic situation (Statistisches Bundesamt 2015a; Woellert and Klingholz 2014), and thus bundle characteristics that are associated with health disadvantages (Mielck 2008). On the contrary, the Aussiedler have an advantageous structure in their educational and professional qualiï¬cation, are usually employed, and thus have a high similarity to the German middle class (Worbs et al. 2013). The proportion of people with a higher education entrance qualiï¬cation is 43% among Germans,7 31% among Aussiedler, and 20% among"
97,110,0.99,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","There is still considerable need for fundamental research on the ecological characteristics that could mitigate the effects of extreme events and climate change. Sound ecological knowledge is the first building block for understanding how to design NBS to meet different needs. These needs can be understood as the âdemandâ for protection, and are very much determined by socioeconomic factors and cannot be captured by a biophysical assessment alone. An ecologically suitable NBS will only deliver expected solutions if it is sufficiently sized and adequately located (cf. Andersson et al. 2015). The answers to both these questions need to be sought in the larger social-ecological system â as is clearly demonstrated by the literature on vulnerability and exposure (e.g. Adger et al. 2005; Folke 2006). According to IPCC âvulnerability describes a set of conditions of people that derive from the historical and prevailing cultural, social, environmental, political, and economic contextsâ and âthe propensity of exposed elements such as human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard eventsâ (IPCC 2012, p. 71 and p. 69, respectively), while exposure refers to an âinventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occurâ (ibid., p. 69). While the literature and common usage sometimes conflate the two they do capture different aspects. To be vulnerable you must be exposed to the risk, but exposure alone is not sufficient. Awareness of exposure together with appropriately planned and implemented adaptation measures may at least reduce the vulnerability of people and property. If NBS are to contribute to making communities less vulnerable they must be sized to match the magnitude of the disturbance and the extent of the exposed area. For example, bioswales and other types of green infrastructure being employed around the world in cities to provide NBS for mitigating surface flooding may fail if overwhelmed by large or extreme precipitation or flood events. Second, they need to be located in the right place. There are several possible spatial relationships between the source of the insurance capacity â the NBS â and where people and property may benefit from it (see e.g. Fisher et al. 2009; Renaud et al. 2016). Most usually, the insurance is achieved by the NBS providing a âbufferâ between the exposed area and the potential risk, e.g. wetlands upstream or along the coast outside a city (see Haase 2017, Chap. 7, this volume). This connection between the NBS and their beneficiaries is mediated by social structures such as built infrastructure"
166,267,0.99,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"1 Introduction Involuntary job loss often comes as a shock for the affected individuals. Dismissal not only hampers individualsâ health (Kuhn et al. 2009) and life satisfaction (Oesch and Lipps 2013), but may also negatively affect their occupational trajectory. Displaced workers are deprived of the positive components of work â they lost not only a source of income but also their social contacts, an important determinant of their social status, and the time structure implied by an economic activity (Andersen 2008). Threatened by the risks of financial deprivation and social exclusion, displaced workers are in a state of heightened vulnerability. Yet not all individuals are exposed to these threats to the same extent: some are more disadvantaged than others. When trying to determine workersâ occupational trajectories after job dismissal, researchers face a number of methodological problems. The fact that workers displaced individually are probably a self-selected group of people makes the causal analysis of the impact of job loss on the ensuing work career tricky: the same factor causing the workers to lose their jobs such as poor health or lack of motivation may also reduce their re-employment prospects (Brand 2015).

Corticosteroids were the recommended therapy, having been shown to be more effective than bronchodilators and other symptomatic treatments. The condition was typically debilitating, leading to progressive deterioration in lung function, though in some patients the condition âburnt outâ and they ârecoveredâ. American allergists and pulmonary specialists were curious about why ABPA was not found across the Atlantic. In 1969, Raymond Slavin and colleagues at the St. Louis University School asked: Why is [allergic] aspergillosis such a rarity in the United States? It would seem that the climate and geography of England does not make a profound difference since A. fumigatus is commonly reported in air sampling surveys in this country. In addition, as stated previously, secondary aspergillosis is not uncommon. It appears then that a failure of recognition and errors of omission account for the rarity of allergic aspergillosis in the United States . . . With the proper appreciation of the characteristics of allergic aspergillosis, both laboratory and clinical, this disease may be more frequently recognized and take its place with such hypersensitivity pneumonitides as pigeon breedersâ disease, bagassosis and farmersâ lung.96 As late as 1977, APBA was being discussed as an âemerging diseaseâ in the United States, due âto increased awareness by physicians, increased referral, better diagnostic modalities, and earlier bronchographyâ.97 Studies in the 1970s comparing the incidence of APBA in London and Cleveland showed similar levels of sensitivity to A. fumigatus antigens in asthmatics in both cities (23% and 28%, respectively), with the differences in prevalence attributed to exposure.98 However, the incidence of the condition was on the rise in both countries, contributing to the overall increase in asthma, which has been widely discussed and attributed to many factors, from greater awareness to modern lifestyles. ABPA was soon recognised in most countries as the most common form of fungal-induced allergic lung disease and, though a largely chronic condition, was known to produce acute episodes.99 By the early 1980s, ABPA was a disease defined by eight diagnostic criteria, which were: asthma, an immediate positive skin test to Aspergillus antigens; presence of antibodies for A. fumigatus; elevated total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE); bronchial damage revealed by X-ray; high levels of white blood cells; proximal dilatation of the bronchi and elevated"

In this range, photosynthesis in C3 plants is CO2 limited, so it is possible that rising atmospheric CO2 has benefited C3 woody plants more than C4 grasses. The response of plants to elevated CO2 has been reviewed extensively elsewhere, but as a rule of thumb, a doubling of atmospheric CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm typically results in a 30â50 % increase in the carbon assimilation rate of C3 plants under optimal conditions. In contrast, C4 plants are not affected directly by atmospheric CO2 because they concentrate CO2 at the carboxylation sites to substrate saturation. Still, C4 plants often receive a growth advantage through partial stomatal closure, which increases their water-use efficiency in water-limited environments. At the wholeplant level, elevated atmospheric CO2 can elicit a wide range of growth responses depending on other co-limitations including other resource limitations (light, nitrogen, water), stress conditions (heat, frost), crowding, and species differences in growth and reproductive strategies (KÃ¶rner 2006). As a result, a community may contain many species that show no response to elevated CO2 at all. Projections of CO2 enrichment effects should therefore be made cautiously and in the context of other drivers and constraints. Woody encroachers are composed overwhelmingly of C3 plants. By contrast, grasslands and savannas in tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate biomes often are dominated by C4 grasses. This pattern led to the hypothesis that woody encroachment"
182,355,0.99,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"ANIMAL PATIENTS Surprisingly little is known about the history of animal patients. This is partly because many animal victims of disease were not awarded this role: they were killed or left to suffer and die rather than being cared for clinically by owners and healers. It is also because historians have not tended to study the sorts of animals and diseases that resulted in the treatment of animals as patients. In focusing on the interests of humans rather than animals, their accounts privilege the effects of infectious animal diseases on the health of humans, animal populations and the agricultural economy. They rarely consider the implications of disease for individual and small groups of highly valued animals that were more likely to be subjected to clinical interventions: Abigail Woods. âAnimals and Disease.â In Routledge History of Disease, edited by Mark Jackson, 147â64.

36,344,0.99,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"has been little studied. Fundamental research is most needed throughout Africa and other arid zones on how often bats need to drink and whether this varies across species, geographically and seasonally. Comparative studies on bats with distributions restricted to arid regions and species that have populations in mesic and arid regions would be particularly informative in this regard. For example, the diversity of renal capacities and habitat use amongst African species of bats of the same family (Happold and Happold 1988), and the emergence of robust family level phylogenies (e.g. Stoffberg et al. 2010) provide an excellent opportunity to study the evolution of renal form and function in African bats in an ecological context. Special focus should be placed on research determining the extent to which African bats are reliant on artificial water sources. Such research should target arid zone species of bats, especially those species that live in close association with humans because these are the species likely to be impacted by insufficient or polluted water sources. Research is also needed on whether all water sources are used for both drinking and foraging and how bats respond to decreases in water quality as a result of pollutants. Do certain species of bats avoid drinking from low quality bodies of water as shown by Korine et al. (2015)? Would bats still use polluted bodies of water for feeding but not for drinking? If so, how do they detect low quality water, do they do so before they are adversely affected by it and do they have alternative water sources? How are desert-dwelling bats affected by pollutants in water or by waterborne toxins and pollutants in the insect fauna, and are such bats able to deal with such pollutants physiologically? Although least is known about bats and water in sub-Sahara Africa, studies thus far in other regions of the world are in their infancy in terms of understanding the long-term effects of decreased water availability on bat and other wild populations. Due to human destruction of wetlands and riparian habitats as well as unsustainable human population growth that more and more is utilizing greater amounts of fresh water, availability of fresh water to sustain wildlife populations are reaching critically low levels, especially in areas suffering from extended droughts due to human-induced climate disruption. Because water is a key ingredient of all life, focus on this topic needs to increase and because bats act as âcanaries in a global coal mine,â studies concerning bats and water are key to better management of water resources in natural and artificial areas.

308,283,0.99,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"We are now developing a clearer view of the longer-term implications of ART. Cumulative evidence from a variety of sources including population registries, cohort studies, and meta-analyses indicate that ART is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformation, and that this risk appears to vary by treatment modality in addition to patientâs age and factors related to infertility. The use of pre-embryo freezing appears to substantially reduce the risk, which suggests that the defects are in part intrinsic to the embryos, and that a freezeâthaw cycle adds a selection pressure against developmentally compromised pre-embryos [14]. Women undergoing IVF with multiple embryo transfer face an increased risk of twins and triplets. The social and economic consequences of multiple pregnancies are signiï¬cant, as are risks to the mother and baby. Single Preembryo transfer can minimize the risk of multiples but the pregnancy and live birth rate was lower [15]. Multifetal pregnancy, particularly high-order multiple pregnancy, should be prevented in the ï¬rst place because of its associated fetal and maternal complications and increased cost [16]."
255,76,0.99,Railway Ecology,"Sources of Bias in Wildlife Mortality Estimates The reduction of mortality is one of the main aims of mitigation measures, hence high mortality rates and their locations need to be as accurate as possible (Guinard et al. 2012). As stated, even in systematic surveys, the number of carcasses found largely underestimates mortality because (1) only a subset of animals killed stay within the area that is searched by the observer; (2) many carcasses are removed by scavengers, or decomposed until the survey occurs; and (3) some dead animals remain undetected because of the observers failure (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015). Thus, to obtain unbiased estimates, the numbers obtained during surveys should be corrected by taking into account: (1) the proportion of animals killed in the area searched; (2) carcass persistence probability; and (3) searcher efï¬ciency. In order to take into account these sources of bias, several mortality estimators were developed in wind farm studies (Korner-Nievergelt et al. 2015) and some have been applied to road casualties (Gerow et al. 2010; Teixeira et al. 2013), but rarely to railways, where these issues also apply. The proportion of casualties (dead and/or injured that have not moved away) recorded at the search area can be obtained from the size and spatial distribution of the total area that can be searched, the spatial distribution of the carcasses, and the proportion of injured animals (still alive) that manage to move away. However, the"

A background is that the most populated parts of the Netherlands have an artiï¬cial water system that allows to manage water levels to prevent droughts by bringing water from other areas. On top of that water scarcity is often related to the prevention of saltwater intrusion by using large quantities of freshwater to flush these artiï¬cial waterways. All of this makes the

Diasporic entrepreneurs are defined as entrepreneurs who are tapping into the Caribbean or diaspora markets. 19. A total of 67 diasporic firms responded to an online survey. The sample was mainly gathered from Compete Caribbeanâs registered database of entrepreneurs that responded to the open call for the Caribbean Idea Marketplace (CIM). 20. Of the firms surveyed by PROTEQin 79 % cited the quality of education as a factor ranging from important to critical in causing skill shortages and almost 77 % cited a shortage in the number of local professionals trained by local institutions. 21. A shortage in local professionals trained by local institutions could also be affected by people who migrate away from the Caribbean to pursue educational opportunities elsewhere (Thomas-Hope 2002). 22.

The altered state of the blood might also be evident without microscopic analysis, however, ï¬owing sluggishly and making collection of it difï¬cult.95 The content of the blood, then, was a topic of interest some years before the early twentieth century, when the spirochete causing syphilis was identiï¬ed and general paralysis was ï¬rmly linked with syphilitic infection. For the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century doctor, toxins of various kinds were thought to be responsible for mental symptoms such as delirium or acute excitement but were also suspected to have longer-term effects. Chronic forms of insanity depended on a toxinâs effect on internal structuresâchanges taking place over an extended period of time that would eventually become evident to the asylum pathologist. The steadily advancing physical symptoms of the disease, and the varied body parts found to be affected at postmortem, illustrated the movement of the toxin around the body. The âtoxic theoryâ of general paralysis thus seemed to provide answers to questions that had dogged alienist researchers throughout the last quarter of the nineteenth centuryâparticularly, what had caused such striking lesions in different parts of the body? Making these connections between general paralysis and some form of toxin, researchers found themselves leaning more towards the ideaâvoiced by several doctors in the ï¬nal quarter of the nineteenth centuryâthat general paralysis was dependent upon earlier syphilitic infection. As the link between general paralysis and syphilis became more certain, Ford Robertson wrote: I would summarise what appears to me the most probable hypothesis regarding the pathogenesis of general paralysis as follows. The disease depends upon the occurrence of a general toxic condition, the exact nature of which is still obscure, but which is certainly in many cases the result of antecedent syphilitic infection. The ï¬rst important effect produced by the toxins is a proliferative and degenerative change in the walls of the vessels of the central nervous system, including those of the capillaries of the cerebral cortex. This alteration in the capillary walls interferes in various ways with the nutritive exchanges between the blood and cerebral tissues. Consequently the adjacent cortical neurons undergo primary degeneration, and the neuroglia [supporting structure of nervous tissue] also tends to suffer certain morbid alterations. At the same time these tissues are to some extent affected directly by the toxic agents circulating with the blood.96"

Although our study provides additional light on the relationship between parenthood and health at later life, it also has limitations. First, our analysis is based on cross-sectional data, and it is therefore possible that health problems may have prevented men and women from having any or additional children. Interestingly, however, we have not found any negative effect of being childless or with parity 1 on any indicators of health as in previous studies, suggesting that if reverse pathways (i.e. poor health preventing having any or additional children) shaped such associations, these were not signiï¬cant. Second, selection may act differently for different socio-economic groups and for different cohorts. For the older cohort, high parity was associated with lower socio-economic status and with the South of Italy (Santini 1995), but we are not able to control for those variables at the time of birth of the child. Still these results hold when considering current socio-economic indicators. Furthermore, selection by death may bias our sample and could explain why in our study we did not ï¬nd any disadvantage associated with childlessness among women; however, as mortality before age 50 is very low in Italy (Human Mortality Database 2015), this source of distortion should be minimal. Third, this study used data from two different sources, IFS and SHARE. Even though the distributions of the variables of interest seem to be relatively comparable across both datasets, the demographic and socio-economic distributions of SHARE respondents differ considerably, with SHARE respondents being younger, more likely to be married, with low education, and from the Centre-South of Italy compared with IFS participants. This may be due to a combination of initial low response rate of the SHARE survey, longitudinal attrition, and the fact that no weights were available for the pooled sample used in this study (Di Gessa 2011). Our research is based on complete case analyses of SHARE, and does not consider how sample attrition might potentially bias associations (Fitzgerald et al. 1998). This study has tried to provide additional insights in the relation between fertility histories indicators and health in the context of a familialistic country such as Italy. In addition to the physiological justiï¬cation that may explain the differences found between men and women for the detrimental effect on ADL of high parities, a more complicated link may be hypothesised. The negative effect of high parity on IADL for women may indicate a socially deprived environment for women with more children which the variables included in the questionnaires are not able to capture. Furthermore, in a familialistic country women are exposed to a greater overload of unpaid work (house chores and care activities), both during adult and later life. Both factors may explain the female disadvantage in terms of high parity and early motherhood. Because these characteristics are becoming rarer among younger cohorts (in 2013 only 0.4% of the births occurred to teenagers mothers compared to 4.7% in England and Wales), we hypothesised that these factors will not play a major role in younger cohorts."
302,148,0.99,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"1 Introduction Plastics are the most versatile materials invented by man. The use of plastic materials has brought great convenience to our daily lives but not without downsides [1]. Inappropriate disposal of wasted plastics has caused serious environmental problems. The presence of plastic debris in the environment not only affects the aesthetical and recreational values of ecosystems but may also present a persistent pollution problem that will continue to accumulate into future generations [2â4]. Once entering the environment, plastics are subject to physical, chemical, and biological weathering processes, which act to slowly break large pieces of plastic into smaller fragments. Plastics less than 5 mm are considered as âmicroplasticsâ [5]. However, no universally accepted definition in terms of the size range for microplastics is currently available [6]. Microplastics can be ingested by aquatic organisms, which might cause potential adverse effects and arouse food safety concerns [7â10]. As a result, microplastic pollution has become an issue of emerging concern and is drawing increasing attention from both the public and scientific community. Microplastic pollution in the marine environment has received widespread attention. Microplastics are found ubiquitously in benthic and pelagic environments in the oceans [11, 12]. In oceans, the high abundance of microplastics observed in the large-scale subtropical convergence zones is attributed to the circulation of ocean currents [13â15]. Accumulation of microplastics in shoreline sediments has also been observed worldwide [16â19]. The majority of plastic debris in oceans originates from land, although discharges from ocean vessels, military operations, and general shipping activities cannot be discounted [20]. It was estimated that 275 million metric tons of plastic wastes were generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, and about 4.8â12.7 million metric tons are estimated to end up in the ocean [20]. Based on this estimation, over 95% of the plastic wastes will remain on continents to be either recycled, disposed of in landfills, go for incineration (with or without energy recovery), or otherwise be discarded and stay on continents [21]. Only a few studies have addressed the issue of microplastic pollution in terrestrial environments and inland waters in contrast to the vast amount of research in marine environments. These studies suggest inland waters are facing similar microplastic accumulation problems as found in the oceans [22, 23]. Many inland waters are habitats for aquatic species that have important ecological and economic value and provide services for recreation, aquatic products, and water resources. Therefore, it is important to understand the occurrence, fate, and effects of microplastics in inland waters [24â26]. Asia is the largest and the most populous continent in the world. Asia covers about 30% of Earthâs total land area and supports about 60% of the worldâs population. There are about a 1,000 ethnic groups with diverse languages and cultures. Nearly all countries in Asia are developing countries, which are under rapid development while facing growing environmental problems at the same time. In this chapter, we reviewed the available literature on microplastic pollution in inland waters with a specific focus on Asia. A considerable lack of data for inland"

Figure 18.8 shows a brief about various aspects of wastewater irrigation in the different regions. Most studies have been done in Mediterranean countries (44 %) and one can see considerable wastewater treated (Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Tunisia, Croatia, Egypt, Algeria, and Libya) and wastewater used (Israel, Syria, Turkey, Libya, Jordan, Malta, Morocco, Palestine, and Lebanon) in this region according to Figs. 18.5 and 18.7, respectively. Moreover, Fig. 18.6bâd shows that there is no population affected in this region (or the population affected is very low). The maximum percentage of the Mediterranean countries is because they are most in the number of water-stressed countries (Near East, Northern Africa, and Mediterranean Europe) (Fig. 18.1). The second place has been allocated to Asia (24 %) and one can see a considerable wastewater treated (Bahrain, Mongolia, China, Jordan, India, and Thailand) as well as both considerable wastewater used (Iran, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia, China, Kazakhstan, and Bahrain) and minor wastewater used (Viet Nam, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Singapore, Korea, and Japan), as shown in Figs. 18.5 and 18.7, respectively. Therefore, the status of study, treatment, and use of wastewater for irrigation is highlighted in the Persian Gulf due to water crisis conditions (Figs. 18.1 and 18.2). Meanwhile, Fig. 18.6bâd shows 13 countries with population affected (Malaysia, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Viet Nam) in Asia that no suitable research has been done there (Fig. 18.8). The third place belongs to Americas (19 %) and one can see considerable wastewater treated (Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Dominican Republic) versus poor wastewater used (Dominican, Nicaragua, Mexico, Guatemala, U.S.A., Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru), as shown in Figs. 18.5 and 18.7, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. 18.6b, c shows eight countries with population affected (Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Venezuela, and Ecuador) in Americas that no suitable research study has been done there (Fig. 18.8). In Europe, Africa, and Oceania (10 % of studies), one can see considerable wastewater treated (Luxemburg, the U.K., Germany, France, Ireland, Austria, Netherlands, Belgium, Zimbabwe) versus poor wastewater treated (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Somalia, Ethiopia, Botswana, Congo, and Mozambique) and poor wastewater used (Australia, France, the U.K., Senegal, Latvia, Lithuania, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Seychelles). Meanwhile, Fig. 18.6bâd shows that one can see ï¬ve countries with populations affected (Cote dâlvoire, Burkina Faso, Congo, Swaziland, and Mauritania) in Africa where no suitable research has been done (Fig. 18.8). Although a study of wastewater irrigation from crops, soil, groundwater, health, irrigation equipments, modern technologies, and other environmental aspects is useful, increased investigation (management studies) in comparison with other aspects can help lead to more reliable and more extensive ï¬ndings and ï¬nally a better decision on using wastewater for irrigation.

365,699,0.99,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Box 1 Towards prioritising investments in CSA: sub-Saharan Africa as an example One preliminary step towards generating the information needed to prioritise investments in CSA is identifying those locations where different interventions may be profitable for smallholders, feasible given their biophysical, informational and socio-economic constraints, and socio-culturally acceptable. As an illustration, we mapped the 17 interventions outlined in Sect. 2 to spatial domains in sub-Saharan Africa based on the mixed system classification shown in Table 1. We used the potential impacts of the intervention from Table 1 and the nature of the constraints to adoption from Table 2, and then subjectively evaluated the suitability of each intervention as zero, low, medium or high in each system. One way to evaluated suitability is in relation to potential adoption rates. To date, adoption rates of agricultural technology in SSA have not often exceeded 30% over one or two decades (see, for example, a discussion in Thornton and Herrero (2010)). Accordingly, we used potential adoption rates of 5% (low suitability) 15% (medium suitability) and 30% (high suitability), nominally for the period to 2030, for the 17 CSA interventions in Table 1. For each intervention, we calculated the size of the rural area and the current number of rural people in each system, crudely multiplied by the associated adoption rate, and summed these to give a highly approximate indication of the relative size of the âsuitability domainâ (in terms of size and rural population) for each intervention. Results are shown in the table below. Improved feeding and altering the enterprise balance may be suitable over relatively large areas and for large numbers of people living in the rural areas, not all of whom are engaged in agriculture, of course (Lowder et al. 2014). Food storage, grazing management and changes in livestock species (particularly large to small ruminants, or ruminants to non-ruminants, for example) are also options with relatively large domains, according to this analysis. The results for food storage are noteworthy; this intervention appears to have solid CSA benefits (particularly related to increased food availability), and considerable effort and resources might well be warranted to increase the uptake of simple food storage technology and the availability of appropriate information. There are many problems with this particular analysis: to name just three, the subjective nature of the suitability index, the fact that potential adoption rates are likely to be context- and intervention-specific, and the lack of specificity as to what the exact intervention actually is in each category (for instance, âimproved feedingâ is a broad term covering many different types of intervention). Nevertheless, this type of broad-brush analysis, if done on a global basis in relation to specific interventions and with as much quantifiable information as possible, could be very helpful in prioritising investments in CSA over the next few years (Table B1)."
230,168,0.99,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"interaction with marine debris. For example, even for experts using standard protocols, it is difficult to distinguish whether wounds are caused by entanglement in active or derelict fishing gear, even when remains of nets or similar are found on the body. Some suggestions are being developed concerning entanglement rates in ghost nets or for bird entanglement in synthetic materials used for nest construction (MSFD-TSGML 2013). â¢ For ingestion, in addition to frequency of occurrence (âincidenceâ) it is recommended to collect data on quantities of ingested debris not only on the basis of numbers of items but also by mass of categories. â¢ In such ingestion records, as a minimum it is recommended to separate industrial plastics (pellets) from consumer-waste plastics (see Table 4.5). The latter if possible can be further specified following the categorisation recommended for ingestion by birds, mammals and fishes according to the EU Marine Strategy Directive (MSFDTSGML 2013), that is into categories of sheetlike, threadlike, foamed, hard fragmented, and other synthetic items, plus categories of non-plastic rubbish. â¢ For averaged data, information should be provided as âpopulation averagesâ with standard error of the mean. Population averages are calculated with the inclusion of individuals without ingested plastics. Additional data can be maximum levels observed, or proportions of animals exceeding a particular limit [such as the 0.1-g critical limit in the Ecological Quality Objective for plastic ingestion by northern fulmars (Van Franeker et al. 2011)] (see Table 4.5). We emphasize this explicit use of population averages because in quite a few of the publications checked for this review averages had been calculated just over those individuals that had plastic, often not specifying that zero values had been omitted. â¢ Negative species results (e.g. Avery-Gomm et al. 2013; Provencher et al. 2014) are also relevant but again should be based on an adequate sample size of animals studied according to a proper protocol. Thus, records of absence of debris for an individual sample should be as firm as those on presence. From experience in our own research group, we know of claims on absence or near absence of plastics in stomachs or guts of several species of which diets were studied, but without dedicated methods or data recording for marine debris (including zeros). Once proper methods were established for laboratory procedures and data recording, each of those species was found to contain debris regularly (e.g. Bravo-Rebolledo et al. 2013). â¢ Examples of protocols for ingested debris in intestinal tracts of larger organisms can be found in e.g. MSFD-TSGML (2013), with further information for ingestion by marine birds in Van Franeker et al. (2011) and marine turtles in Camedda et al. (2014). Standard protocols for marine mammals, invertebrates have not yet been established in detail but may largely follow those for seabirds and turtles. In general, these studies consider debris of â¥1 mm by using sieves with such mesh size. â¢ Only when using the above approaches on frequency of occurrence (proportion of animals in populations affected) and gravity of interaction (quantity of ingested material; damage level from entanglement), it becomes possible to design experimental or other dedicated studies that allow estimates of the true impact of plastic ingestion on wildlife populations. This relates to both the physical and chemical types of impacts, and will ultimately require model predictions using demographic characteristics of the species involved (Criddle et al. 2009)."
151,146,0.99,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Detectable concentrations of the organophosphorus insecticide CPY in air, rain, snow and other environmental media have been measured in North America and other locations at considerable distances from likely agricultural sources, which indicates the potential for long range transport (LRT) in the atmosphere. This issue was addressed by first compiling monitoring results for CPY in all relevant environmental media. As a contribution to the risk assessment of CPY in remote regions, a simple mass balance model was developed to quantify likely concentrations at locations ranging from local sites of application to more remote locations up to hundreds of km distant. Physical-chemical properties of CPY were reviewed and a set of consistent values for those properties that determine partitioning and reactivity were compiled and evaluated for use in the model. The model quantifies transformation and deposition processes and includes a tentative treatment of dispersion to lesser atmospheric concentrations. The model also addressed formation and fate of CPYO, which is the major transformation product of CPY. The Characteristic Travel Distance (CTD) at which 63% of the original mass of volatilized CPY is degraded or deposited-based on a conservative concentration of â¢OH radicals of 0.7 Ã 106 molecules cmâ3 and a half-life of 3 h, was estimated to be 62 km. At lesser concentrations of â¢OH radical, such as occurs at night and at lesser temperatures, the CTD is proportionally greater. By including monitoring data from a variety of media, including air, rain, snow and biota, all monitored concentrations can be converted to the equilibrium criterion of fugacity, thus providing a synoptic assessment of concentrations of CPY and CPYO in multiple media. The calculated fugacities of CPY in air and other media decrease proportionally with increasing distance from sources, which can provide an approximate prediction of downwind concentrations and fugacities in media and can contribute to improved risk assessments for CPY and especially CPYO at locations remote from points of application, but still subject to LRT. The model yielded estimated concentrations that are generally consistent with concentrations measured, which suggests that the canonical fate and transport processes were included in the simulation model. The equations included in the model enable both masses and concentrations of CPY and CPYO to be estimated as a function of distance downwind following application. While the analysis provided here is useful and an improvement over previous estimates of LRT of CPY and CPYO, there is still need for improved estimates of the chemical-physical properties of CPYO. Based on the persistence in water, soils, and sediments, its bioconcentration and biomagnification in organisms, and its potential for long-range transport, CPY and CPYO do not trigger the criteria for classification as a POP under the Stockholm convention or a PB chemical under EC 1107/2009. Nonetheless, CPY is toxic at concentrations less than the trigger for classification as T under EC1107/2009; however, this simple trigger needs to be placed in the context of low risks to non-target organisms close to the areas of use. Overall, CPY and CPYO are judged to not trigger the PBT criteria of EC 1107/2009.

Although clear distinctions between human error on the one hand and technical malfunction on the other can seldom be made, available statistics show that the former tend to still be the most common cause of incidents and accidents (Knudsen and Hassler 2011)."
255,7,0.99,Railway Ecology,"wildlife mortality. Therefore, a careful assessment of railwaysâ impacts on nature and of mitigation measures is in order. Trains are not cars, and railway tracks are not roads. These assertions are obvious, but they are often ignored when assessing the potential and actual biodiversity impacts of railways, which are normally equated to those of roads. This is regrettable because roads and railways differ in many respects, which can strongly influence their impacts. For instance, trafï¬c on railways tends to be less intense than on roads, but trains often travel at higher speeds than cars. Roads and railways also have different physical structures, especially in the case of electriï¬ed railways, where overhead lines along the rail tracks can represent an additional source of impacts. All these differences are likely to affect wildlife responses to roads and railways, and hence their impacts on, for example, animalsâ behavior, mortality, and landscape connectivity. A quick survey of the literature shows that studies on the biodiversity impacts of railways have greatly lagged behind those of roads. This is probably because the road network is much larger than the railway network, but probably also because the impacts of roads are more easily observed by ecologists and the general public. For instance, the safety and economic costs associated with the risk of collision with a wild or domesticated animal is more easily perceived in a road than in a railway, although the latter are also very signiï¬cant: an accident with an animal is likely to go unnoticed by passengers in a train, with the remarkable exception of the train driver, but the same will not happen so easily in a car. Even the legal frameworks under which roads and railways operate can be different, conditioning the way the environment in the vicinity can be protected and which mitigation measures can be applied. All these differences add to a number of speciï¬cities that clearly set railways apart from roads, and thus a paradigm shift is needed whereby the impacts of railways on biodiversity are considered on their own. This book aims at contributing to this shift, ï¬lling a gap in the literature about the impacts of transportation on biodiversity. We have brought together 44 researchers from 12 countries, from North and South America to Asia and Europe. We aimed at combiningâin a single volumeâthe most relevant information that has been produced on the interactions between railways and wildlife, and to illustrate such interactions with a set of carefully chosen case studies from around the world. We have tried to produce a comprehensive volume that should be of interest to researchers and practitioners alike, including the staff of railway and consultancy companies that deal with the environmental challenges of railway planning, construction, and operation every day. Although this book addresses several environmental problems raised by railways, we would like its main message to be one of hope. Indeed, while we expect societies to keep looking for more efï¬cient means of transportation, we also expect that efï¬ciency to become ever more synonymous with environmental efï¬ciency, as societies seek to mitigate impacts or even improve biodiversity. We hope that our book can help achieve this goal, contributing to the mitigation of the negative impacts of railways on biodiversity, thereby improving the sustainability and environmental beneï¬ts of this mode of transportation."
365,250,0.99,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"We focus on the 2900 households from the DFG FOR 756 that are engaged in agricultural production because we are interested in the connection between climate change perception and consequences for agriculture. In Thailand, the provinces are Buri Ram, Nakhon Phanom and Ubon Ratchathani located in the Northeastern region of the country. In Vietnam, the provinces are Ha Tinh and Thua Thien Hue located in the North Central Coast region and Dak Lak situated in the Central Highlands. All six provinces are dominantly agricultural areas albeit with a large degree of heterogeneity in development potential. The provinces are bordering neighboring Laos and/or Cambodia. The choice of the provinces was motivated by the assumption that people in rural and geographically remote regions are more vulnerable than people in urban and central regions. Furthermore, these provinces belong to the poorer environments with less developed infrastructure in agriculture and a high potential for climate-related shocks and thus are more likely to be affected by climate change (Waibel et al. 2013). The survey instruments comprise of a village head and a household questionnaires. The village head questionnaire contains information on the physical and social infrastructure of the village. The household questionnaire has a detailed shock section that included questions about past climate-related shock experience and details about shock severity in terms of income and asset loss (using a 4 point ordinal scale).1 A special module on climate change was included where respondents were asked whether or not they had perceived a change in climate in the time that they had lived in their location. Respondents were also asked how they thought that changes in climate is affecting their agriculture (e.g. lower yield, more crop failure) and what measures they had taken to adapt to climate change (e.g. change crop varieties, invest more in irrigation, planting trees, etc.). Part of the household questionnaire was a simple risk item that measures respondentsâ general attitude towards risk on an 11 point Likert scale following Dohmen et al. (2011) and Hardeweg et al.

232,370,0.99,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"dynamic adaption to our ever-changing world, whether driven by environmental, technological, societal, health, or other causes. The concept of resilience often appears provocative to the public, as it implies the possibility for more disruptions or accidents to happen. However, this is exactly what has to be realized: the fact that there is a ï¬nite probability for events with potentially disastrous consequences to happen. We need to enhance our resilience in order to be better prepared so we can minimize the physical and âmeasurableâ impact as well as the psychological and emotional health impact. Only an informed public and educated decision-makers are able to provide an effective response to a disruption. The necessity for a better-informed public on advanced technologies or more broadly for a âtechnologically literate citizenâ is not new [9]. As we can see, for example, from the events associated with Fukushima, in the discussion about vaccinations or genetically modiï¬ed organisms (GMOs) the public, particularly in the United States but also globally, is susceptible to a perceived risk, rather than a factual risk. Unfortunately, the concept of risk is not well understood in the public and therefore, any discussion about risk is dominated by the potential impact of an event, rather than both the impact and the probability of an event. As a matter of fact, the likelihood for a disastrous event to happen is often neglected. The misperception of the concept of risk in the public is compounded by the fact that the potential impact can easily be used in the media to capture attention and increase readership. In addition, social networks are becoming one of the main venues for communications and distribution of information without any review and vetting of information. The fact that social networks operate instantaneously does not help conventional media to convey information that has been vetted and therefore, is always delayed. The delayed release of vetted information by conventional means also increases the potential for early spread of misinformation, which can be difï¬cult to combat after the fact. Regarding the contentious issue of GMOs, the risk of potential side effects overwhelms the discussion about the beneï¬ts in the public. While there is no scientiï¬c evidence supporting any claims of detrimental side effects of GMOs in the modiï¬cation of approved food [10, 11], social media is dominated by claims of disastrous effects on animals and human consumers. Not only is a large portion of the animal feed in the US already genetically modiï¬ed [12] without any obvious effect, GMOs need to play a critical role in addressing the enormous and expanding malnutrition in many developing countries speciï¬cally in Africa or India [13]. The development and utilization of vaccines have prevented devastating epidemics decimating whole communities and regions in the past. While vaccination is associated with a small health risk, this risk is insigniï¬cant in comparison to the risk of foregoing vaccinations. Recent increases in measles epidemics in the US reflect the emerging challenges by experts to convince the public about the beneï¬ts vs. the risk associated with vaccination [14]. The opposition to GMOs or vaccination is largely driven by the misperception of risk, as the general public often overestimates the detrimental effects and underestimates or is not aware of the beneï¬ts and the effects of not adopting these technologies. GMOs have another challenge in that it is a new and advanced"

A similar association is found for persons with a severe limitation in wave 1 or wave 2, albeit less strong. Comparing the results of severe and moderate functional difficulty transitions, overall similar results are found for moderate difficulties but with smaller odds ratios. Next, the mean adjusted multidimensional poverty headcount (M0)2 is calculated for different groups of persons with functional difficulties based on age, sex, and the severity and trajectory of the functional difficulty.3 The trajectory covers a functional difficulty in one wave vs. both waves. Results are presented in Fig. 6.1. Groups are ranked from the least (bottom) to the most (top) multidimensionally poor as measured by M0. There is a considerable variation in M0 across the subgroups ranging 0.45â0.7 in Ethiopia and 0.3â0.6 in Uganda. There are some patterns in both countries. Older persons, older women, and persons experiencing severe difficulties in both waves tend to be the groups the most multidimensionally poor. These are groups for whom personal factors, structural factors, resources, and functional difficulties may interact to create situations of extreme deprivations. Further research is needed that explores the heterogeneity in wellbeing of persons with functional difficulties and how they are shaped by personal, structural, and resource factors."

73,356,0.989,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Abstract In most peri-urban communities of south east Nigeria, shortages of domestic water supply relative to demand is a common feature. This is because most of these peri-urban communities usually fall outside the urban water supply projects physical boundary, thus forcing the people who live there to consume water from doubtful sources which most often contain pathogens found in human faeces. Apart from consuming water from doubtful sources, most inhabitants of this area also travel long distances to collect it or pay dearly to purchase it from water vendors. The study was therefore undertaken to determine the factors necessary for a safe water supply in such areas. Towards achieving this objective, a questionnaire was designed and 2000 were administered to households in the area between January and June, 2013. A total of 15 factors were isolated and analysed in 10 periurban communities of the region. The major analytical tool employed was multiple regression analysis with which we were able to determine the relative importance of each variable using SPSS version 20. Based on the result obtained, important determining factors for safe and sustainable water services were discussed in terms of their implications to the formulation of a needed policy that will ensure improvement in supply of the service to meet demand.

77,34,0.989,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Introduction The last few decades have seen a dramatic rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in most high-income countries. This rise has been seen across all ages, even in very young children (Wang and Lobstein 2006). Obesity is now recognised as one of the most important public health concerns of our time (Dietz 2004), and places a considerable burden on healthcare systems; the cost of obesity to the UK economy was estimated in 2007 to be Â£15.38 billion per year, including Â£4.2 billion in costs to the National Health Service (Public Health England 2014). Although recent evidence suggests that the increase in childhood obesity may be abating in some countries (Han et al. 2010), it is too soon to be certain that the flattening of the epidemic will continue, and there is no evidence of a decline in the currently high levels. There is wide variation in the prevalence of childhood overweight between European countries (Fig. 2.1). This variability does not notably follow patterns of geographic area, country wealth or political system and suggests that there is potential for the lowest levels to be seen across the whole of Europe. Being overweight or obese as a child is associated with both short- and long-term health risks, particularly for cardiovascular health (Owen et al. 2009; Friedemann"

All these data should be able to contribute to the estimates of future water demands, consumption and wastewater discharges per unit of activity. As well as the level of activities and the resulting water demands, knowledge of the geographical location of water using activities (the pattern of activities) is necessary. If the pattern of activities is not expected to change, the analysis can be focused on the present situation in the study area. If new activities are expected to develop within the study area and their water use characteristics are unknown, it may be necessary to study the water use characteristics of similar activities in other regions. The resulting water demand data need not always be considered as âgiven.â Water-use coefï¬cients can be changed through measures such as water pricing that aim at reaching a socially preferred use pattern. Technological developments may result in less water use and pollution load per person or unit of product.

Lessening the impacts of future drought events typically requires the development of drought risk policies that emphasize a wide range of water conservation and early warning measures. Drought management techniques are often conditional on the severity of the drought. Identifying the actions to take and the thresholds indicating when to take them are best accomplished prior to a drought, as agreements among stakeholders are easier to obtain when individuals are not having to deal with the impacts of an ongoing drought. Drought impacts can be economic, environmental, and social. Economic impacts can include direct losses to agricultural and industrial users, losses in recreation, transportation, and energy sectors. Other indirect economic impacts can include resulting unemployment and loss of tax revenue to local, state, and federal governments. Environmental losses include damages to plant and animal species in natural habitats, and reduced air and water quality; an increase in forest and range ï¬res; the degradation of landscape quality; and possible soil erosion. These losses are difï¬cult to quantify, but growing public awareness and concern for environmental quality has forced public ofï¬cials to focus greater attention on them. Social impacts can involve public safety, health, conflicts among water users, and inequities in the distribution of impacts and disaster relief programs. As with all natural hazards, the economic impacts of drought are highly variable within and among economic sectors and geographic regions, producing a complex assortment of winners and losers with the occurrence of each disaster."

The explanatory variables described in Section 6.2, except for EXPMANU , have been found to be closely related to CDM credit flows with the expected signs. In particular, the GS2SLS estimates show that the the geographic variables LATITUDE and ELEV are positively associated with CDM development. For the resource and commodity exporter dummies, EXPSERV is positively related, while RESPOINT , RESDIFF and RESCOFF are negatively related, to CDM development. All of the control variables including GDP03, POP03, ETHNIC, RELIGION and legal origin dummies (CIVLEG, COMLEG) are in general found significantly associated with CDM development and should be included in the model.115 With a row-standardized binary weighting matrix, Table 6.3 in general confirms the findings of Table 6.2 in terms of positive impacts of LATITUDE, ELEV and EXPSERV , and negative impacts of RESPOINT , RESDIFF and RESCOFF on CDM credit flows. Table 6.3 seems to provide stronger evidence than Table 6.2, especially for the spatial autoregressive coefficients, âÎ»â and âÏâ. According to the SARAR(1,1) model, the degree of neighbourhood effects for the CDM credit flows increases to 0.48. The finding on the positive association between absolute latitude and CDM credit flows is consistent with the literature. On the one hand, research by Diamond (1997), Gallup et al. (1999) and Sachs (2003a) suggests that countries in a tropical location in terms of a smaller absolute latitude are often associated with poor crop yields and production due to adverse ecological conditions such as fragile tropical soils, unstable water supply and prevalence of crop pests. On the other hand, tropical location can be characterized as an inhospitable disease environment, believed to be a primary cause for âextractiveâ institutions, in conjunction with weaker institutions according to the settler mortality hypothesis of Acemoglu et al. (2001). Countries further from the Equator are more likely to have better climate conditions and stronger institutions, which are conducive to CDM project development. The finding on the positive association between elevation and CDM credit flows is in line with recent research. It is widely known that the Earthâs average surface temperature rose by approximately 0.6â¦ C in the twentieth century and will rise a few degrees C in this century. Global warming is likely to raise the sea level and change the land area and elevation above sea level for many countries. Countries with higher elevations are therefore supposed to have more potential to attract CDM projects."

Meanwhile, the challenge with complex systems is that they often have delays in their feedback structures, depending on the available stocks of resources that can be used, like credit, for a certain amount of time. In addition, the effects on one resource or biophysical process are typically linked with other natural cycles and may lead to accelerated feedback loops that have nothing to do with the original human activities. This means that problems often only become visible or tangible when it is no longer easy to put a halt to the damage they are causing. The linear causality image of a kettle removed from a stove when it whistles is utterly misleading. MIT professor John Sterman and Harvard education expert Linda Booth-Sweeney explain this âwrong mental modelâ in the context of climate change. It assumes, they argue, that it will only require short delays in all the links in a long causal chain, stretching from the detection of adverse climate impacts to the decision to implement mitigation policies to emissions reductions to changes in atmospheric GHG [Greenhouse Gas] concentrations to radiative forcing to surface warming and ï¬nally to climate impacts, including changes in ice cover, sea level, weather patterns, agricultural productivity, the distribution of species, extinction rates, and the incidence of diseases, among others. None of these conditions hold: there are long delays in every link of the chain (Sterman/Sweeney 2007: 214)."

The consequent relative deterioration in the scarcity situation, a ratio, can be added up for all such impacts, giving rise to the total environmental impact, e.g. for a manufacturing site over a specific period. Before the assessment method can be applied, it is vital for the most important environmental impacts for the country in question, to have been investigated and quantified as completely as possible. Such is the case in many countries and also in the EU as a community of nations. One significant feature of the ESM is that it can be used to assess completely different environmental impacts and to compare them with one another. In a similar way to how, say, apples and pears can be compared with one another, for instance by a freight carrier, because they share a common feature. That is for example their weight in kilograms, which is of importance to the carrier. The feature common to all environmental impacts which enables this comparability is the relative deterioration in the scarcity situation brought about by the particular individual environmental impact under consideration. A user of the method can then tell directly from the result whether, for example, a site has become âmore environmentally friendlyâ over the course of a year, despite energy consumption having perhaps increased, waste volumes having fallen, greenhouse gas volumes having risen and emissions to water having declined, etc. Using the ESM, it is possible to environmental impacts, prioritize a budget and define environmental objectives. In brief, the structures for corporate use are largely comparable with those of management cost accounting (Please note that the calculation process used for the ESM is described in greater detail at the beginning of the data section)."
233,13,0.989,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"During the last centuries and more dramatically in the last four decades, natural habitats were destroyed at rates much higher than ever observed in human history. All biomes were affected, but those located in tropical regions were more impacted, particularly because policies for the development and appropriation of these territories were emphasized during this period. Nonetheless, the massive transformation of these landscapes to give place to crops and towns multiplied speciesâ losses and vulnerability at incredible rates (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005), mostly due to the fact that most of worldâs biodiversity is concentrated around the tropics (Gaston 2000). In addition to habitat destruction and fragmentation, natural ecosystems were also submitted to high levels of pollution, overexploitation of forestry and ï¬shery resources, invasive species, and to the effects of climate changes mainly provoked by man-induced greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, a high number of species were already extinct and others have suffered severe populations declines (Mace et al. 2005), with many advancing at high speed to higher categories of threat every year (e.g., Hoffmann et al. 2010). So, recent scenarios integrating main extinction drivers suggest that rates of extinction are likely to rise by at least a further order of magnitude over the next few centuries (Mace et al. 2005; Pereira et al. 2010; Barnosky et al. 2012; ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2013). This critical situation is now recognized as the âsixth mass extinctionâ, i.e. the sixth period in the history of life in which more than three-quarters of the living species is lost in a short geological interval (Barnosky et al. 2011). Compared to the ï¬rst âbig ï¬veâ, this extinction period has the peculiarity of being caused mainly by the way of living of one single species, the humans. Counteracting this trend is perhaps the biggest ethic, political and scientiï¬c challenge of our times (Sarkar 2005), as the time for action is short, funds for biodiversity conservation are far from below the real needs (e.g., McCarthy et al. 2012), uncertainties are enormous (Forest et al. 2015), and the solution of conï¬icts with main-trend ways-of-living and main patterns of distribution and consumption (e.g., Lenzen et al. 2012) often takes much longer than habitat destruction. In the race to combat extinctions, there is urgency for increasing conservation worldwide. The scientiï¬c community is pressed to provide criteria in order to deï¬ne priorities, as well as for indicating variables and standards that allows for monitoring the evolution of biodiversity in the light of these strategies (Hoffmann et al. 2010; Pereira et al. 2010, 2013; Mace et al. 2010, 2014). Traditionally, biodiversity conservation was based on species counts, valuing sites in terms of species richness, number of endemics and number of threatened species (Myers et al. 2000; Myers 2003; Kier et al. 2009). However, in spite of its generalized use, this kind of data can be very heterogeneous making very difï¬cult comparisons across taxonomic groups, along time and among sites, as species richness can be inï¬uenced by many factors, going from the species concept to the spatial scale and sampling effort (see Gaston 1996 for an overview on this subject). Similarly, in spite of the great interest of Red Lists of speciesâ threats, such as that from IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), to indicate imminent risks of extinction, concentrating conservation-limited resources on threatened species can be very risky and these limits must be considered (Possingham et al. 2002). Moreover, measures based on species counts also have the limitation of considering all species as equals, being"

Furthermore, when we talk of the Black Sea basin, we are in fact referring to an area that extends beyond the immediate environment of its waters: in addition to a respectable total of six riparian countries (Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine), Greece, Armenia and Azerbaijan can also be considered to fall within its bounds. There are obviously wide-ranging differences between the above-mentioned countries, according to a variety of indicators: economic development; governance, democracy and human rights protection; the pace at which reform is taking place in these aspects; access to energy resources (whilst one riparian country can be considered a veritable energy superpower, others are energy deficient and highly dependent on imports; some countries are energy producers, and others are simply countries through which energy passes); and their relationship with the EU. In the latter regard, some are EU Member States, and others are not: one is an EU candidate country (Turkey), others are European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) partners and another (Russia) is a strategic partner for the EU. Amongst the ENP partner countries, three have shown willingness to achieve closer ties with the EU (Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), whilst others evidence a certain degree of reticence and appear to favour partnerships with other interlocutors (Armenia, Azerbaijan).2 Additionally, there are a number of frozen conflicts within the area, such as those in the Republic of Moldova (Transnistria) and Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) or that between Armenia and Azerbaijan (the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave). To this we must add the serious conflict provoked by Russiaâs illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, which has brought about a substantial modification in the strategic landscape not only of the Black Sea Basin itself but also of the outlying area, seen as an example of a broader systemic challenge to the European security architecture.3 In addition to the complex political situation described above, it must also be noted that the Black Sea ecosystem is suffering from substantial environmental degradation: as a virtually enclosed inland sea, it is particularly fragile from a physical standpoint, and its vulnerability has regrettably not been sufficiently compensated for by the introduction of appropriate policies to prevent its deterioration. The enormous pressure resulting from numerous human activities such as industrialisation, urbanisation, overfishing or transport (not only of hydrocarbons since the arrival of invasive species in shipsâ ballast water has also been proved to represent a serious environmental threat) has led to serious problems of pollution, loss of biodiversity, extinction of species and eutrophication, amongst others.4"

These capabilities were developed into a long questionnaire, which was piloted on a separate sample and then refined (Kinghorn et al. 2015). Tellez et al. (2016) assess the wellbeing of older people with and without Alzheimerâs disease from the point of view of their functionings and latent capabilities. They find that persons with Alzheimerâs disease have lower levels, and a smaller set, of capabilities, when compared to persons without the disease, even when the latter have several impairments, thus demonstrating that Alzheimerâs disease considerably affects wellbeing among older adults. There are many challenges with respect to applying the human development model and more generally the capability approach, given challenges in measuring health deprivations and wellbeing. Some of these challenges are discussed below. 3.1.1.2 Measurement of Health Deprivations To measure wellbeing for persons with health deprivations, one needs to identify health deprivations. Health measures broadly are of two types âself-perceived and observedâ (Murray and Chen 1992). Self-perceived measures give an individualâs own perception of health deprivations, while observed measures rely on an external partyâs assessment. Both types of measures provide complementary and valuable information on health (Murray and Chen 1992). There is often no observed health data in LMICs, self-reported measures are used in this study and are therefore the focus of this section. Health Conditions/Impairments Some surveys ask respondents if they have specific health conditions. Health conditions may be temporary, episodic or chronic, physical or mental, life threatening or not, infectious or noncommunicable. They may be coded according to the ICD specifications for health conditions (WHO 2011) (e.g., the National Health Interview Survey in the USA). Not everyone has access to health services, which is necessary to have a diagnosis associated with a doctor/clinic visit or hospitalization. Such questions in fact identify those with a diagnosis among those who are able to access healthcare, who may be a small minority in LICs. In order to capture health conditions among those who may not have received a diagnosis, some questionnaires attempt to find if people experience"

Cook and Heath (2005) examined the relationship between sea surface temperature and recruitment in a number of North Sea ï¬sh species (cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole) and concluded that if the recent warming period were to continue, as suggested by climate models, stocks which express a negative relationship with temperature (including cod) might be expected to support much smaller ï¬sheries in the future. In the case of cod, climate change has been estimated to have been eroding the maximum sustainable yield at a rate of 32,000 tonnes per decade since 1980. Calculations show that the North Sea cod stock, could still support a sustainable ï¬shery under a warmer climate but only at very much lower levels of ï¬shing mortality, and that current âprecautionary referenceâ limits or targets (such as FMSY), calculated by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on the basis of historic time series, may be unrealistically optimistic in the future. For Atlantic mackerel, increases in sea surface temperature are known to affect growth, recruitment and migration with subsequent impacts on permissible levels of exploitation (Jansen and Gislason 2011). Jansen et al. (2012) used information on larval ï¬sh from the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) to show that abundance has declined dramatically in the North Sea since the 1970s and also that the spatial distribution of mackerel larvae seems to have changed. Whether these trends can be ascribed to changes in climatic conditions remains unclear, although development and/or mortality of mackerel eggs is known to be very sensitive to seawater temperature (Mendiola et al. 2007). There have been many attempts to include climatic variables in single-species population models (e.g. Hollowed et al. 2009), and thereby to project how the productivity of ï¬sh stocks will be affected by climate change in the future. Particular emphasis has been placed on climatic determinants of ï¬sh recruitment, and indeed several studies have inserted temperature or other environmental terms within the âstock-recruitâ relationship in order to make medium or long-term forecasts. Clarke et al. (2003) used projections of future North Sea temperatures and estimated the likely impact of climate change on the reproductive capacity of cod, assuming that the high level of mortality inflicted by the ï¬shing industry (in 2003) continued into the future. Outputs from the model suggested that the cod population would decline, even without a signiï¬cant temperature increase. However, scenarios with higher rates of temperature increase resulted in faster rates of decline. In a re-analysis by Kell et al. (2005), the authors modelled the effect of introducing a âcod recovery planâ (as being implemented by the European Commission), under which catches were set each year so that stock biomass increased by 30 % annually until the cod stock had recovered to around 150,000 tonnes.

In this sense, outcomes of systems remain in a defined range of parameters. However, these concepts are more important for engineering and the physical world. Ecosystem resource has shown that outcomes may vary considerably, and, if they vary, radical shifts may occur not only due to external shocks but as a normal condition (consider summer and winter aspects of ecosystems in the North or the dry season/rainy seasons in the South). For the analysis of such systems, the concept of resilience has been widely adopted. It is defined as the capacity of an (eco)system to respond to a perturbation or disturbance by resisting damage and recovering quickly (Schiere et al. 2004).

73,83,0.989,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The experience of managing land devoted to the conservation of the ï¬ying fox in urban Australia has been complex and lengthy. Several lessons emerge from the research into ï¬ying fox management that could be helpful in the management of other species that affect properties neighbouring bushland areas. The following lessons have informed Councilâs management approach within the KFFR: â¢ Interfering with habitats or attempts to modify the natural behaviour of the ï¬ying fox inevitably exacerbates the problem through unintended consequences. Attempts by the Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens to move ï¬ying foxes out saw the ï¬ying foxes end up in Centennial Park. Attempts by Cairns City Council to move the ï¬ying foxes out of trees in the main street saw the animals move into trees at a local school. In both cases the magnitude of the problem was ampliï¬ed by bringing more people into closer contact with the animals; â¢ Community education: the most popular community education events run by Ku-ring-gai Council concern local wildlife particularly when it involves species that are controversial and have a human impact such as ï¬ying foxes, ticks, bandicoots and bush turkeys. People can happily co-exist with the ï¬ying fox habitat nearby when they better understand the values associated with ï¬ying foxes, the general magnitude of impact and options available to manage any negative impacts; â¢ Modiï¬cation of the built environment: a far more practical, effective and efï¬cient management measure is to strengthen the resilience of homes, properties and lifestyles to the impact of wildlife; As Roberts et al. (2013) note it is the magnitude of the perceived problem that is important. This needs to be understood before responding. For example, if noise, smell and faeces from a camp affect only a small number of residents, then smaller, local-scale mitigation options should be applied. In this way the unintended consequences of the management action will be minimised and be less likely to result in a worsening of the problem. It is the unintended consequences of management actions that need to be thoroughly investigated and understood. For example altering the ï¬ying fox habitat or the animalâs natural behaviour may inadvertently foster the incidence of zoonotic disease by increasing the stress on animals who are already experiencing pressure for resources from urbanisation of habitat areas. Biodiversity integrity and human health have long thought to be inextricably linked (Pongsiri et al. 2009). Strategies to manage wildlife impacts on urban populations need to be mindful of the bigger picture surrounding the immediate context of these decisions. Increasing pressure by further degrading biological resources to the point where the system declines could have a range of signiï¬cant consequences. Conserving the integrity and diversity of biological resources can assist in maintaining resilience to emerging diseases. The response to the problems created by urban development encroaching on conservation areas must prioritise minimal disruption to the service and functions of the natural systems for any successful resolution to emerge."

A more liberal diet could bring benefits in terms of palatability, cholesterol reducing, use of parenteral nutrition and an improvement in quality of life. The LBD, usually poorer from a nutritional point of view and less attractive compared to a normal diet, may be an unnecessary burden on patients who already have difficulties with eating. The studies reviewed do not support significant results on the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the LDB, and many useful results still do not encourage the use of LBD."
133,394,0.989,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Outcome Variables Our key health outcomes were self-rated health (SRH), depressive symptoms, and various measures of functional limitations. In the ISF survey, SRH was measured by the WHO question (De Bruin et al. 1996) adopting a 5-point ordinal scale (very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor), whereas in SHARE self-rated health was measuredâin both wavesâusing the ï¬rst question of the SF-36 scale (Ware 2000) in which the response options are slightly different (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor). In our study, the ï¬ve SRH items were dichotomised into âpoorâ (the last two categories of the ISTAT survey and the last of SHARE) versus better health. The âfairâ category of the WHO scale was aggregated with positive evaluations because of its Italian translation, which has more of a positive connotation (Egidi and Spizzichino 2006). Even if the two scales are not directly comparable, we wanted to conï¬rm the directions of the effects of the socio-demographic and fertility characteristics on self-perception of health. Functional limitations were measured through a series of indicators targeting situations in which health disorders and conditions had impacted peopleâs usual activities. First, both ISF and SHARE respondents were asked whether they had experienced âlimitation in activities people usually do because of health problems for at least the past six monthsâ. This single-question item is a validated measure, which approximately captures global activity limitations (Jagger et al. 2010). We categorised respondents as limited regardless of severity of the limitation.

38,17,0.989,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"remains inadequate to address the emerging challenges to biodiversity, human development and planetary management (Costello et al. 2013d). It is well known that biodiversity is in world-wide decline (Butchart et al. 2010 summarises recent evidence). This impoverishment takes the form of local and global extinctions, but also more pervasive and subtle simpliï¬cation, hollowing-out and dominance by a few species of formerly complex, abundant and equitable ecosystems (e.g., see Pereira et al. 2012). The resources of the Earthâland, oceans, water, primary productivity and nutrientsâare increasingly appropriated by humans and their client species (Haberl et al. 2007). The process of human domination has been underway for nearly ten thousand years, ever since the domestication of crops and livestock, but has accelerated over the past century or two. It has reached such proportions that we have entered the âAnthropoceneââthe era when human actions are the dominant Earth-shaping force (Crutzen 2002). There is little doubt that the current and projected rate of biodiversity loss exceeds its rate of generation. As a result, the world is getting poorer in terms of the biological variation it supports. The loss of biodiversity has well-established immediate causes: the loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat needed for the completion of life histories; over-harvesting of organisms which have commercial value (and the collateral damage to other organisms and ecosystems in the process); pollution of the environment by biocides and the waste products of human activity; and competition, predation or infection by invasive alien species deliberately or inadvertently introduced from other parts of the world are the leading causes (SCBD 2010). Climate change during the 21st century is projected to be high up on this list of the causes for biodiversity loss. The contemporary decline in diversity is not entirely without precedent. On at least ï¬ve previous occasions in the approximately ï¬ve billion year history of this living planet, biodiversity has undergone relatively abrupt decreases (Leakey and Lewin 1995). In some cases, this has been the result of the rise to dominance of a new group of organisms, such as the evolution of oxygen-generating algae three billion years ago, which conï¬ned the previously dominant anaerobic bacteria to low-oxygen niches. In other cases, it is attributed to cataclysmic events such as the impact of an asteroid. Although previous episodes of biodiversity loss have left a lasting imprint on the biota of the world, biodiversity overall has always recovered, often in different forms. Disruption of the old order may even have been the stimulus for biological innovation. For instance, the end of domination by dinosaurs may have allowed a relatively obscure group of proto-mammals to evolve, ultimately, into our own species. Why then are we concerned about the current loss of diversity? First, the current loss of biodiversity is just one element of an interconnected syndrome known as âGlobal Changeâ. Another element is climate change, mostly driven by human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and release of other waste gases. A key driver of both climate change and biodiversity loss is the ongoing transformation of the surface of the planet due to human activities, including agriculture, deforestation, settlements, transport infrastructure, ï¬shing and"

At the 1950 NYAS meeting, Samuel B. Salvin, then at the Division of Infectious Diseases at NIH, placed the incidence of fungal diseases in context of other infectious diseases. Fungus infections in man, although less frequent than bacterial, are still numerically important. For example, of the 92,933 deaths due to infections and parasitic diseases in the United States in 1945, 284, or 0.3 per cent, were due to mycoses. This was approximately equal to the number of deaths reported as caused by scarlet fever, measles, or the typhus-like diseases (due to rickettsia), and was more than the total of all deaths recorded from rabies, smallpox, relapsing fever, leprosy, brucellosis, paratyphoid fever, plague, cholera, and anthrax. It should be realized, of course, that effective control measures are employed against some of the aforementioned diseases, whereas control methods against the mycoses not only are not practiced, but, generally, are not even known. It should also be borne in mind that the dermatophytoses, although characteristically nonfatal, are extremely common, probably equalling the most widespread of the bacterial or virus diseases in prevalence.6 In 1953, Walter Nickerson from the Department of Microbiology, Rutgers University, tried a creative presentation of mortality data to chart the rise of fungal infections.7 He used graphs for the period 1945â1949 that showed starkly opposite mortality trends, where âall infectionsâ had dropped sharply, while that from mycoses had increased markedly. Nickerson had produced his graphic illustration by using very different scales for the two classes of infection. Deaths from mycoses were recorded as actual numbers, while those from all infections were recorded in thousands. The alarming increase of nearly 50% in fungal infection deaths was actually from 270 to 380, while the actual number of deaths from all infections had fallen 30%, from 93,000 to 66,000 deaths â still 170 times greater! In the event, the annual total deaths from mycoses in the next decade never reached 500.8 More telling was Nickersonâs point about morbidity; he stated that âmycotic infections are probably the mostly widely distributed and most numerous types of infection, with dermatophyte infections, such as athleteâs foot, alone as prevalent as the most widespread of the bacterial and virus diseasesâ.9 Medical mycologists had long argued for recognition of the distinctive pathogenicity of fungi. In 1940, Arthur Henrici, who worked in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of Minnesota, argued"
133,114,0.989,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Sex Differences in Health-Related Quality of Life Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an indicator that is highly sensitive to differences between individuals, even in subpopulations with the same objective health proï¬le (i.e., individuals who have been diagnosed with the same disease). This is largely because this indicator is usually derived from the compilation of information from a set of items that reflect different aspects of how an individual feels as a consequence of his/her health status (e.g.: âDoes pain interfere in your daily life?â âHow often do you feel calm, or full of energy?â). Different tools have been developed to measure HRQOL based on the set of items used (e.g., SF36, SF20, SF12, 15D, the Nottingham Health Proï¬le) and the wording of questions. Since these scales are often used to monitor patient health outcomes, we provide a few examples of epidemiological studies that have assessed sex differences in HRQOL among individuals with the most prevalent diseases mentioned in the sex differences in morbidity section within this chapter: namely, CVD and cancer. In a study of stroke survivors in Japan, HRQOL was found to be higher among men than among women because women had a higher prevalence of ADL limitations and depression (Kuroda et al. 2006). Similarly, an examination of MI survivors in Spain showed that men had higher HRQOL levels than women. This study also found that the evolution of HRQOL scores from the third to the sixth month after experiencing the attack followed a sex-speciï¬c pattern: men showed greater improvements in most dimensions of physical and social functioning, while women improved in social functioning and in only few physical dimensions (DueÃ±as et al. 2011). Moreover, female cancer patients (colorectal and breast cancer) have been found to have lower HRQOL levels than their male counterparts (colorectal and prostate cancer) (LeMasters et al. 2013)."

248,77,0.989,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","Water Availability Is not an Ecological Issue, but a Management Problem Solved at High Social and Ecological Costs That water availability is not dependent on ecological conditions is particularly obvious in regions such as Africa, Central Asia, the USA, as well as in China. Neighboring countries with similar ecological conditions in North- as well as in West Africa have very different access rates to safe water sources. In the Democratic Republic of Congo only three quarter of the population is provided with safe drinking water, despite holding nearly a quarter of all renewable water resources and represents the water richest country of the entire continent. In contrast, in very dry countries like Egypt or Namibia, nearly 100 % of the population has access to safe drinking water (MDG 2015). The problems of water supply are obviously not of an ecological nature but are the outcome of the political economy speciï¬c to these countries. The importance of the political economy to understand water availability is also evident in the American West, where the water supply for drinking water, irrigation, and the industry of not only California, but also of the western states like Nevada, Arizona, and Utah has been developed in a particular socio-economic and political context presented in famous books like âRivers of Empireâ by D. Worster (1985) and âCadillac Desertâ by M. Reisner (1986). Other famous examples of how limited hydrological conditions are overcome on a large scale in order to enable urban, agricultural, and industrial development can be seen in the control and exploitation of the Amou-Daria and the Syr-Daria in Central Asia or the Yangtse in China. Rivers here have been tamed, controlled, and managed in order to exploit them in the service of the economy, the people and the state. But the control and the exploitation, (i.e. the management patterns of these rivers) have created social and economic inequalities, sometimes even dramatic ecological consequences. Of major concern is the removal of people and the loss of properties due to the construction of dams. According to the World Commission on Dams, between 40 and 80 million people have been displaced worldwide since the 1940s often without recovering their livelihoods (World Commission on Dams 2000). The displacement of people, as well as the consequences downstream leads to an increase of social and economic disparities. Very few people (mostly the national elites) actually beneï¬t from these dams and the economic wealth created by it, while the majority of people loose their livelihoods, triggering oppositions and sometime virulent resistance. Another issue created by the construction of dams is the unequal water share riparian states can use, despite treaties, and agreements.

Sources of such shifts are rooted in various kinds of policies and changes in the market environment. A summary of options to reduce various kinds of exclusion are summarized in Fig. 3.4. If exclusion is voluntary the urge to reduce exclusion may be justified if the social benefits from inclusion are perceived to be higher than the costs perceived by private individuals opting for exclusion. In such cases individual action may be influenced either by motivating changes in the objective function of excluded agents or by providing incentives (if the cost of the latter is less than the perceived net social benefits). Similarly the second and third types of exclusion may be addressed by promoting awareness through networks and by addressing competing factors respectively (e.g., excusing school-age children from daily household chores). Options are rather limited in the first three cases since it is only possible to address the demand side. In the last three cases options are open from both the demand and supply sides, as well as through innovations that reduce supply costâ through costs of production, delivery, or both. A comprehensive list of interventions is provided in Fig. 3.4."
187,43,0.989,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"1 Introduction Dependencies among infrastructures are usually complex and non-obvious. They may allow cascading disruptions or failures to different infrastructures, thus causing a potentially signiï¬cant impact to multiple types of sectors, individuals or countries. Well-known examples of such cascading effects include the electric power disruptions in California in 2001 [1], as well as the major blackouts in the USA, Canada and Europe in 2003 [2]. Identifying CI dependencies leads to a more accurate assessment on the criticality level of a single infrastructure element, or even of a whole sector. It also enables the identiï¬cation of dependency chains among dependent CIs. In this way it becomes possible to identify the âmostâ critical among the infrastructures and adopt more cost-efï¬cient security controls, so as to reduce overall risk [3]. The identiï¬cation of such dependencies is also important during the risk assessment and planning phase so as to ensure that the mitigation and the recovery processes take into account such relationships among infrastructures.

38,561,0.989,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.2.1 Kenya Northern Kenya is a region of high biodiversity conservation value. It is a hotspot of mammalian diversity in Africa and is critical habitat for several endangered and threatened large mammal species. This region is largely under tribal communal tenure, and the rich flora and fauna of the region are threatened by heavy and continuous grazing by domestic livestock, which has caused moderate to severe land degradation over large areas (Georgiadis et al. 2007). Several NGOs, the largest of which is the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), have been working to promote wildlife conservation and better land stewardship in this region. In 2008, NRT and other scientists developed a simple protocol useable by community members to monitor rangeland condition, which, in turn, determines the amount and quality of forage for wildlife. These methods were based upon pastoralistsâ traditional knowledge and monitoring practices that were also be scientiï¬cally defensible. Through a series of conversations at which the NGOs, scientists, and community members were present, all participants agreed that the indicators currently used by pastoralists to make management decisions were insufï¬cient, as they were largely focused on livestock condition and grass conditions affected by rainfall. All agreed that a new protocol was needed to capture information about long-term (>3 year) trends in rangeland functionality. However, these methods would need to be simple so that they could be learned and used by community members with low literacy. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID-East Africa), a team of scientiï¬c experts was assembled, as well as a diverse advisory panel, to guide this project. This team conducted focus group interviews with community members representing the Maasai, Samburu, Borana, Afar, and Karyu ethnic groups in Kenya and Ethiopia. In these interviews, researchers asked community members to describe the changes in their rangelands they had observed over the last several decades. The responses were markedly similar across diverse social and ecological contexts: increased bare ground, decreased perennial grasses, increased woody vegetation, and increased soil erosion. These observations also matched the general indicators of degradation that have been observed by scientists working in rangelands around the world. Researchers then used this traditional knowledge to adapt an existing set of rangeland monitoring methods (originally developed and thoroughly tested in the western United States) for the East African context. Notably, the US methods were simpliï¬ed by basing them on a stick 1 m long (rather than measuring tapes or other manufactured tools) and created a single graphical data sheet on which data could be collected by circling icons. The intent was that these methods could be used by people who could not read or write but could count and recognise simple icons (e.g., a picture of a shrub representing a sample point with shrub cover)."
133,112,0.989,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Sex Differences in Functional Status Functional status can be assessed using a wide range of indicators, with the most extensively used being Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). ADL are all of the activities related to an individualâs capacity to take care of his or her own basic needs, such as bathing, feeding, and dressing. IADL are the activities that allow an individual to live independently in a community context, such as shopping, managing money, and using the telephone. In this chapter, we focus on age-related functional limitations as a consequence of a progressive decline over an individualâs life course; i.e., on limitations resulting from the âdisablement processâ proposed by Verbrugge and Jette, rather than on functional limitations at younger ages, which are likely to be of a different nature (1994). A variety of studies have provided consistent evidence that men report having fewer difï¬culties in performing ADL and IADL than women (Newman and Brach 1999; Murtagh and Hubert 2004; Palacios-Cena et al. 2012). However, recent empirical research suggests that a female disadvantage in functional limitations is not apparent at all ages. Analyzing individuals from the British 1946 cohort, Murray et al. found that men and women are equally likely to have limitations at age 43, but that the gender differences are greater at age 53 (2011). This ï¬nding suggests that age-related declines in functional limitations are likely to be gender-speciï¬c. Although less research has been done on sex differences in age-related declines in physical functioning, there is some evidence that the rates of decline in physical functioning are higher among men than among women (Oksuzyan et al. 2010c). There is also some debate about a possible sex-speciï¬c bias in some of the items used to measure IADL. Especially in the older cohorts, activities like cooking or shopping are more likely to be done by women than by men. As sex differences have been found in studies that looked at both self-reported and observed disabilities (Merrill et al. 1997), it is possible that the female disadvantage in functional limitations is independent of how these limitations are measured. There are relatively few empirical studies that have compared gender differences in the prevalence of functional limitations across countries. Cross-country comparisons of these activities are complicated by cultural differences, such as differences in"

The results suggest that the distribution of Black-winged Stilt between types of pond (feeders, evaporators and crystallizers) was not particularly affected by the construction. The major disturbance took place in the crystallizers, where the pillars were erected. However, as the results above show, these were the areas less used by the species, even in the pre-construction phase, which may be the reason why no impact was observed during the entire construction period and afterwards. Concerning nest phenology, the interruption of construction probably prevented an impact on the temporal distribution of nests. Likewise, this may explain why we did not ï¬nd any evidence that the railway affected hatching and survival of the fledglings that used impacted saltpans. During the wintering season, the usage of the saltpans can be conditioned by their availability, particularly by unpredictable fluctuations in the water level. Thus, the birds may be more limited in their choice of the saltpans, causing a high variability in the counts. This effect is more restricted during the breeding season due to the management of saltpans for the extraction of salt. During the last phase of this study, two saltpans (one impacted) were transformed into aquacultures, conditioning the use of the saltpans even more. Additionally, many of the shorebird species do not show a random distribution since they group for foraging or roosting, even if there is enough area to spread (van de Kamp et al. 2004). Even taking into account these sources of variability, the data suggest that the wintering community, as a whole, did show a negative response to the disturbance caused by the railway, since signiï¬cant differences were found between the two types of saltpans over the years, regarding the speciesâ abundance. Nevertheless, although the use of a pooled number of individual birds allowed the analysis of data that is inherently over-dispersed and zero-inflated, it restricts the full interpretation of the data. On the other hand, the distribution of the main wintering species was not affected, while for the wintering Dunlin, the number of birds in each activity did not show a response to the disturbance caused by the railway. Disturbances can inhibit foraging activities in favor of vigilant behaviour, but since all saltpans are close to sources of human disturbance (e.g., roads), the effect of the railway may have been buffered."

Risks of exposure to CPY through water on wet soil, such as puddles, and wet foliage from rain and dew was assessed by use of simulation models. Tier-3 tests studies were used to resolve important uncertainties identified in Tier-1 and Tier-2 assessments. Incident reports were also considered in the Tier-3 assessment. Honey bees have long been included in regulatory test requirements as a surrogate for pollinators as well as for terrestrial invertebrates in general (USEPA 1988), and most data on CPY in this risk assessment relate to honey bees. In studies on 21 species of non-Apis bees, LD50 values for several species are within an order of magnitude of that of the honey bee (Fischer and Moriarty 2011), suggesting A. mellifera can be a good surrogate species for other bees (Porrini et al. 2003). Toxicity data for CPY in non-Apis pollinators were used when available. In addition, certain non-target arthropods (NTA) such as Aphidius spp. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), Typhlodromus spp. (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae), and Aleochara bilineata (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) can be useful in assessing risks to non-Apis pollinators (Miles and Alix 2012). Therefore, an attempt was made to find useful toxicity data for CPY with these non-target arthropods and their usefulness as surrogates for non-Apis bees was evaluated."
230,394,0.989,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.1 Introduction With the increasing reliance on plastics as an everyday item, and rapid increase in their production and subsequent disposal, the environmental implications of plastics are a growing concern. The benefits of plastics, including their durability and resistance to degradation, inversely result in negative environmental impacts. As user-plastics are primarily âsingle useâ items they are generally disposed of within one year of production, and whilst some plastic waste is recycled, the majority ends up in land-fill. Concerns arise when plastics enter the marine environment through indiscriminate disposal and it has been estimated that up to 10 % of plastic debris produced will enter the sea (Thompson 2006). Interactions between litter and the marine environment are complex. The impacts of larger plastic debris are discussed by KÃ¼hn et al. (2015) and consequences include aesthetic, social and economic issues (Newman et al. 2015), and numerous environmental impacts on marine biota (Derraik 2002; Barnes et al. 2009). However, with an ever increasing reliance on plastic products, and as plastic production, use and disposal continue, microplastics are of increasing concern (Sutherland et al. 2010). Microplastics enter the sea from a variety of sources (Browne 2015) and distributed by oceans currents; these ubiquitous contaminants are widespread (CÃ³zar et al. 2014). The amount of microplastics in the sea will continue to rise, leading to gradual but significant accumulation in coastal and marine environments (Andrady and Neal 2009). Increasing evidence of microplastics in the sea has led to a need to understand its environmental impacts as a form of marine pollution. A recent review of marine debris research found only 10 % of publications to focus on microplastics, the majority of which were from the last decade (CBD 2012). Even though plastic is the primary constituent of marine debris, microplastics are considered under-researched due to difficulties in assessing their distribution and abundance (Doyle et al. 2011). It has only been in recent years that international, national and regional efforts were made to quantify microplastics in the sea. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, 2008/56/EC) has highlighted concerns for environmental implications of marine litter and one of the key attributes of the MSFD is to determine the ecological harm caused by microplastics and their associated chemicals (Zarfl et al. 2011). Microplastics were first described as microscopic particles in the region of 20 Âµm diameter (Thompson et al. 2004). For the purpose of this study, microplastic refers to items <5 mm in size using the criteria developed by US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Arthur et al. 2009). The small size of microplastics makes them available for interaction with marine biota in different trophic levels. By inhabiting different marine habitats, a range of organisms are vulnerable to exposure (Wright et al. 2013a). At the millimetre and micrometre scale, sorption of microplastics is dominated by bulk portioning, with effects including blockages when fibres or fragments form aggregates."
73,307,0.989,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The Horsley Park urban farming precinct is largely fallow, unmanaged lots. The spread of noxious and environmental weeds, mainly blackberry, is rife across the precinct. Noxious weeds are plants that are controlled under the Noxious Weeds Act 1993 in NSW which is enforced by the Local Councils. Control actions will vary depending on the risk to primary production, cost to undertake the control and the ultimate beneï¬t. They include actions such as complete removal and suppression through to restrictions on sale or propagation. The majority of weeds in the urban farming precinct are class 4 weeds, meaning they are a serious threat and widespread. As such, the cost to control them is prohibitive so the legislated control measure for most of these species is limited to restricting propagation or sale. This highlights the reason for the spread of these weeds, that is, there is no forced control. The impact for the Trust is that many lots are not suitable to take to the market without large capital investment in the removal of weeds. Many of these species will take many years and control attempts before they succeed. To counter this issue the Trust has embarked on a program of crash grazing. Lots are offered free of charge for short term grazing. Agistees are required to erect fencing to contain the animals and manage all access issues. There has been considerable success in the reduction of African Olive using cattle and some limited impact on the spread of Blackberry. The Trust is in the process of seeking other livestock, such as goats, that may help remove the Blackberry."
337,327,0.989,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"DECUMA has been applied in Kajiado District, southwest Kenya, and applications are ongoing in Samburu, Kenya, as well as Mali and Tibet. The Malian application provides an example of the usefulness of making tools used in integration portable. In that work, led by N. Hanan of South Dakota State University, we are exploring changes in the hydrology of lakes, the roles that pastoral people have had in those changes, and the benefits to them. A hydrological model (SWAT; Gassman et al. 2007) is being linked to the ecosystem model called ACE (African Carbon Exchange), which in turn is being linked to DECUMA. By programmatically isolating the materials DECUMA requires from an ecosystem model (see Boone et al. 2011 for details), we can relatively easily link the model with any ecosystem simulation tool that can provide the needed information (e.g., forage availability and forage acquired by animals). Our ongoing analyses in Samburu, Kenya demonstrates this kind of integrated modeling. C. Lesorogol of Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri has gathered in-depth anthropological data for two study sites in southwest Samburu District, Mbaringon and Siambu. The sites differ in ecological settings, with Mbaringon at lower elevation and with less rainfall, for example. But the main difference of anthropological interest is that Siambu is subdivided, and Mbaringon remains communal lands (although somewhat fragmented). In the 1970s residents within some districts in Kenya began to subdivide into individually owned parcels. In Siambu, the land was divided into 240 small individually owned parcels. We are also investigating changes in Samburu norms, where the sense of reciprocity and sharing is less important in young peoplesâ lives. Our integrated assessments are driven by both theoretical questions and by questions put forth by stakeholders (Reid et al. 2009). The eight scenarios (numbered below) we are addressing in Samburu reflect this, and highlight the flexibility of using comprehensive simulation tools such as SAVANNA and DECUMA. Central to our work are questions of subdivision and its effects. We are simulating sedentarizing people and their animals on individually owned parcels, and the effects of that on livelihoods (1). Another scenario asks about the influence of commercial cropping in Siambu and fence building in Mbaringon, and the effects of loss of access has on livestock (2). These types of scenarios are represented in the modeling system by altering spatial surfaces or agent behaviors so as to prevent animals from leaving home parcels or from using areas that are inaccessible. We describe a diversity of scenarios to demonstrate the utility of integrated modeling but discuss one (number 8) in more detail here. Both Siambu and Mbaringon are grazing refuges for herders outside those areas. When drought conditions hold in other areas of Samburu, herders move their animals into these areas. In a scenario, we are adding additional livestock to each area, and summarizing effects on the resident animals (3). Plains zebras (Equus quagga) and occasionally Grevyâs zebras (Equus grevyi) are joined by various antelopes in the Mbaringon study site. We will vary the numbers of wildlife by a factor of four in scenarios, with and without tourism benefits to local people, to judge effects on livestock numbers and household livelihoods (4). Livestock sales are increased in simulations, above the observed number of sales that is typical (5). This is an"
364,240,0.989,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"The Path to Food Entitlement Crop losses affect the amount of food available for a family and the amount of food surplus that can be sold for cash to purchase other basic needs. The incidence of food insecurity is therefore influenced by the farming systems adopted (crops grown, number and density of crops, etc.), as well as anthropogenic or biogenic hazards or risks encountered in farm production, and the consequent effect on the familyâs access to food. Difficulties in Meeting Household Expenditures Across sites, the majorityâif not almost allâof the respondents indicated that they have problems or difficulties in meeting their expenses for even the most important household expenditures. These include food (10â58 %) and farming/fishery inputs (33â69 %). For all sites, the main reasons for problems in paying for their household needs include the seasonal and irregular flow of income, crop losses from typhoons and seasonal climate variations, the high costs of agricultural inputs, and the difficulty of reducing expenses and making other household adjustments. In the upstream and midstream sites, 44 % are below the 2009 NSCB food poverty threshold of PHP 14,040 for the province of Cavite, while 52 % in the upper downstream site and 26 % in the lower downstream site are below the NSCB food poverty threshold of PHP 12,150 for the province of Laguna. Food expenditures include basic necessities such as rice, fish, sugar, coffee, cooking oil, and in some instances canned goods, flavorings, milk, and meat. Rice is bought by the majority of the households across the watershed. Pandey in his report (2008, as cited in RaÃ±ola 2010â2011) indicated that in developing countries like the Philippines, poor people spend 30â50 % of their income on rice. However, with the price of rice increasing by as much as 50 %, this means an equivalent drop in their real income of 15â25 %, a substantial loss for poor people who are hovering just above the poverty line. Sources of Entitlement, Risks in Farm/Fishery Production, and Seasonal Food Insecurity The ability of households and their members to acquire enough food through production, exchange, or transfer depends on their current sources of entitlement. These include their productive assets, such as their land, tools, and equipment, as well as their farm-related entitlements such as the number or density of crops planted, combinations of crop species, period of harvesting and/or production cycle, total land area for cultivation, and the actual farm size cultivated. Other important sources of entitlement include labor resources, education and health, size of the family, level of income, and nature and sources of income. These factors are related to householdsâ levels of poverty and food poverty thresholds as estimated by the NSCB. However, for households in the Silang Santa-Rosa subwatershed, sources of entitlement are limited, and this is compounded by their regular exposure over time to combinations of farm risks and uncertainty (both natural and anthropogenic)."
151,306,0.989,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"food is a factor. Because flowable CPY may be applied up to four times per growing season, chronic risk was also estimated for that formulation. For the chronic assessment, preferred metrics included the most sensitive of the population-relevant endpoints, viz., survival, growth and reproduction. The following decision criteria were used in deriving effects metrics for each focal species: (1) If a toxicity study with five or more treatments was available for the focal species or a reasonable surrogate, then a dose-response curve was derived for that species; (2) If multiple toxicity studies that followed a similar protocol and together had five or more treatments were available for the focal species or a reasonable surrogate, then a dose-response curve was derived for that species; (3) For untested focal species, an SSD was derived. Without toxicity data for a focal species, there is uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of that species to CPY. To deal with this uncertainty, the SSD was used to bound the risk estimates (i.e., assume 5th and 95th centile sensitivity on the SSD) and to estimate median risk (i.e., assume 50th centile sensitivity on the SSD) (USEPA 2005). Dose-response curves were then derived for low (95th centile), median (50th centile) and high (5th centile) sensitivity species by using a distribution of the available LD50 data and measured dose-response curve slopes. Because insufficient bird species have been tested for chronic exposure, the most sensitive effects metrics were assumed for all focal species. Each toxicity study was evaluated, and acceptable studies met the following criteria: (1) Single contaminant exposure only; (2) Gavage (acute) or dietary (chronic) route of exposure; (3) Ecologically-significant endpoint (e.g., survival, reproduction, growth); (4) Adequate statistical design (e.g., five or more treatments including controls, responses spanning most of the range of 0â100% effect including at least one treatment with a partial response) to estimate toxic effect doses; and (5) Study employed acceptable laboratory practices or was previously accepted by EPA (USEPA 2009). Studies that did not meet the above criteria were not used to derive effects metrics. Risk characterization. Three lines of evidence were used to characterize risks of CPY to birds: (1) Modeling of exposure and effects; (2) Information available from field studies; and (3) Information available from incident reports. Risk curves were derived for each exposure scenario and focal bird species by determining the percentages of fields that had â¥5% mortality (â¥1/20 dead birds per field), â¥10% mortality (â¥2/20 dead birds per field), â¥15% mortality (â¥3/20 dead birds per field), â¦ , 100% mortality (20/20 dead birds per field). The result was a plot of probability of exceedence versus magnitude of effect. Similar approaches have been used in ecological risk assessments performed for the EPA at the Calcasieu Estuary, Louisiana, the Housatonic River, Massachusetts (USEPA 2002, 2004a) and by others assessing the ecological risk of pesticides (Giddings et al. 2005; Moore et al. 2010a, b, c; Solomon et al. 2001). In this assessment, area under the risk curve (AUC) was estimated for each combination of focal species and exposure scenario. AUC is the area under the curve divided by the sum of the AUC and the area above the curve, with the result multiplied by 100. The AUC was used to"
232,138,0.989,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"It is of signiï¬cant concern for the public whether they can survive, e.g. by successfully evacuating in case of a nuclear accident. For this purpose, we need to provide information on the likelihood, timing, and possible amount of radioactive material released for possible accidents. Because all units may suffer from identical external events, multi-unit risk assessment is necessary considering the disturbance of on-site and off-site activities related to mitigate the consequences of the accident, as was observed in the hydrogen explosion in the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Considering off-site emergency response, it is critically important that we recognize that off-site facilities may suffer damage from a nuclear accident due to natural events occurring simultaneously. There are many kinds of possible interactions. A ï¬rst point of consideration is the difï¬culty for local residents to evacuate and also the difï¬culty for external organizations to provide support to the nuclear site, due to the spatial distribution of damage to the infrastructure (see the examples of damages for surface transportation around the Fukushima Daiichi NPP shown in Figs. 1 and 2) and other factors. A second point of consideration is that the rescue activity for people affected by the severe natural event may be disturbed because of the forced evacuation due to nuclear accident, such as when a rescue team is forced to leave the site. Additionally, people are discouraged from multiple damages repeatedly by the natural event as well as by the nuclear accident."
376,668,0.989,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","brucellosis in red deer (Cervus elaphus) declined as a result of control efforts in livestock (Serrano et al. 2011). In these cases the wildlife populations were not competent disease reservoirs, failing to sustain the infection without co-circulation through livestock. In cases where wildlife populations are competent reservoir hosts, control efforts are complicated by social, logistical, and ecological factors (e.g., Donnelly et al. 2006). Culling and increased hunting of wildlife are often proposed to control wildlife diseases but they are seldom effective. First, it might be difficult to achieve the necessary hunter participation to create large reductions in host density (e.g., Heberlein 2004). Many hunters will want to maintain high densities to maximize their future hunting opportunities. Second, the cost of culling wildlife, particularly in a test and cull strategy, can be very high and so is only applicable to localized operations (Wolfe et al. 2004). One of the rationales for culling wildlife is that disease transmission might be positively correlated with host density (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005). Although plausible, this assumption is not always supported by data and even if transmission is density-dependent, culling can have adverse consequences. For example, culling badgers (Meles meles) to control bovine tuberculosis in Britain causes the disease to spread even further due to social disruption, with surviving badgers roaming more widely to find mates (Bielby et al. 2014). In addition, increased hunting in regions of easy access might locally aggregate wildlife in areas of limited hunter access even if the regional density declines. Part of the problem, at least for diseases that can be transmitted back and forth between livestock and wildlife, is that disease control measures used on wildlife are based on those developed for livestock. Therein lies a mismatch in spatial scale, because livestock can be intensively managed within fences at the ranch scale but wildlife populations are free-ranging at the landscape scale (Bienen and Tabor 2006). There is also a mismatch in temporal scale because disease eradication campaigns are typically continuous for livestock but in wildlife they can be tactically scheduled to take advantage of episodic natural disturbances. For example, in the Kruger ecosystem of South Africa, buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in herds with a higher prevalence of bovine tuberculosis lose condition faster during dry seasons (Caron et al. 2003). It follows that any attempts to minimize the disease in the buffalo population should be reserved for immediately after droughts, which occur about once per decade. That is when die-offs of 50 % or more leave a smaller population size to contend with, and presumably a much reduced proportion of infected animals (du Toit 2010). For rangelands in particular, progress in reducingâor at least accommodatingâthe risks of wildlife-borne diseases to livestock will depend upon the better integration of veterinary practice and epidemiology with disease ecology. As a case in point, before brucellosis was virtually eradicated in cattle in the USA it was transmitted to elk (Cervus canadensis) and bison in the Greater Yellowstone Area, where it has repeatedly been transmitted back to cattle from elk (Rhyan et al. 2013). Free-ranging elk are now increasing in the area in which brucellosis is endemic and so the veterinary achievements in fighting the disease in livestock over the past 75 years must now be followed by ecologically based adaptive"
248,91,0.989,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","The Survival of the Most Vulnerable Diarrheal disease kills three-quarters of a million children under the age of ï¬ve every year. Although preventable, it is the second leading cause of death, and the leading cause of malnutrition in children under ï¬ve years old. Malnutrition is linked to childhood stunting and underdevelopment. An estimated 165 million children have stunted growth, which may have short and long-term impacts for physical health and cognitive development. Recent evidence suggests that childrenâs height is linked to household hygiene practices, especially in situations where children ingest fecal bacteria through unwashed hands, contaminated utensils, and contaminated drinking water (Lin et al. 2013; Pickering et al. 2012). Subsequent gastrointestinal infections impact nutrient absorption, leading to malnutrition that contributes to stunting. Other research undertaken at the household scale indicates additional factors that put children at risk of infection. In parts of Africa, for example, young children may not be expected to use the household latrine, in which case they defecate in the family courtyard. As they learn to use the latrine they may not be using the unit hygienically, as might be expected for a new user of any age. Third, anal cleansing may not take place in the unit, but instead outside it, in the family courtyard. In combination, these three practices put feces in the public domain and put children and others at risk of infection (Exley et al. 2015). It is common knowledge that access to clean water and sanitation will lead to improvements in public health. But this conventional wisdom requires some unpacking. For example, clean water may be clean at the source, but can easily become contaminated by unwashed hands, unhygienic storage, and flies. It is well-known in the Indian context that access to sanitation does not necessarily mean that family members will use it, and may chose to defecate in the open instead (Mara et al. 2010). Evidence suggests that high levels of coverage and use at the community level are necessary to reduce disease associated with fecal contamination (Emerson et al. 2001)."
291,127,0.989,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The goal of this monograph was to show a variety of possibilities to visualize mortality dynamics on the Lexis plane. While we provided examples of raw and smoothed mortality surfaces, our focus was on visualizing rates of mortality improvement (âROMIsâ), i.e., the derivative of age-specific death rates with respect to time. We provided ROMI examples for national populations covered by the Human Mortality Database as well as for selected causes of death in the United States. These âROMI-plotsâ were quite instructive to detect period and cohort effects. We also illustrated how changes in age-specific mortality contribute to a gain (or loss) in life expectancy. In Chap. 9 we decomposed seasonal data for causes of death to investigate whether the seasonal pattern, measured via the amplitude and the peak moment (âphaseâ), has changed over or age. The previous chapter dealt with survival chances of persons who were diagnosed with cancer. Despite the large number of figures, our list is obviously not exhaustive; here we want to provide a few more two ideas how the Lexis diagram can be used to illustrate not only mortality dynamics. Figure 11.1 adapts our ROMI approach to fertility. The top panel contains a surface map of age-specific fertility rates in the eastern part of Germany. Birth counts and corresponding exposures by single year of age and calendar time were downloaded from the Human Fertility Database (2017). The estimates were (again) generated with Camardaâs R package for smoothing surfaces with P-splines"
248,33,0.989,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","So, time to celebrate? Maybe, but ï¬rst it is vital to consider some problems associated with measuring malnutrition (LappÃ© et al. 2013; IFPRI 2014). The FAO (2012, 2014) employs a limited deï¬nition of hunger based on a diet of 1800 kilocalories per day, the minimum for someone who is not active. If we assume people are active and need more calories, then these estimates are a gross underrepresentation. They also ignore âhidden hunger,â diets sufï¬cient in calories but which lack essential minerals and vitamins, such as iron, vitamin A, iodine and zinc. A recent estimate holds that 2 billion people suffer from this form of malnutrition and associated health problems (IFPRI 2014, p. 5). Such statistics also ignore the geography of global hunger. While there has been a marked decline in under nutrition between 1990 and 2014, the process has been very uneven. Advances âby two countries, China (â96 million) and Viet Nam (â24 million) amounts to 91 % of the net numerical reduction in undernourished people between 1990 and 2012â (LappÃ© et al. 2013, p. 1). Such geographical disaggregation is vital for understanding global trends. It is also vital for identifying successful and unsuccessful national policies. Examining regional trends is complex tooâexamples from Africa exemplify this point. The 2012 FAO Report remarks that âwe are losing the battle in Africa.â However, if we disaggregate the statistics, a more nuanced picture emerges; countries in this region exemplify best and worst practice. Ghanaâs success is dramatic and illustrates what can be done to reduce hunger by dedicated political interventions (Curtis 2011). In contrast, the Democratic Republic of Congo exempliï¬es the worst case situation and helps explain the poor performance of Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) in aggregate; extract this one country and the âpictureâ from"
321,75,0.989,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"Next let us consider the second paradigmââThe Limited Earth.â The problems caused by the fact that the Earth is limited are far-reaching. These include not only energy, resources, global warming, air pollution, water pollution, ground pollution, food, and water, but alsoâif we think broadlyâsuch problems as the widescale spread of infectious diseases of people and livestock. The reason is that the probability of virus mutation and transmission increases along with the probability that wild animals come into contact with livestock, livestock with other livestock, humans with livestock, and so on. And in turn, the probability of contact on the limited surface of the Earth increases in proportion to the square of the population density. âVision 2050â has been proposed as a solution to three of these issues, namely energy, resources, and global warming. These three problems are deeply interrelated, with each problem and response coupled to the others. Therefore these three issues must be solved at the same time. That solution is âVision 2050,â a model that the world should aim for in order to solve these problems confronting humanity. Of course, âVision 2050â does not include other problems facing our world, such as terrorism, political conflict, or eradication of poverty. While it does narrow down the focus to the material foundations of the overarching picture, in order to solve these three problems, it is a vision that gives structure to and integrates fragmented and scattered knowledge, thereby providing a whole picture of these issues."
231,1179,0.989,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"French scientists from IFREMER have used a delta GAM/GLM approach to model future plaice and red mullet distribution in the eastern English Channel and southern North Sea (see Vaz and Loots 2009). Abundance of each species was related to depth, sediment type, bottom salinity and temperature. Results suggested that climate change may strongly affect the future distribution of plaice. For large plaice (>18 cm), distribution will still be centred in the southern part of the North Sea, however for young individuals, the predicted distribution is anticipated to shift north-westwards and to the Dogger Bank area in particular (as has already been observed, see van Keeken et al. 2007; Engelhard et al. 2011). Model outputs indicate that the distribution of red mullet will not change dramatically but that for young individuals (deï¬ned as <17.3 cm), the offshore habitat situated on the Dogger Bank may become increasingly favourable. Older individuals seemed little affected by the simulated change in environment, but they may beneï¬t from higher juvenile survival and expand their area of occupation as a result. There are some concerns about the validity of the bioclimate envelope approach for predicting the future distribution of commercially important ï¬sh species (see Jennings and Brander 2010; Heath et al. 2012). First, it may not be possible to assess temperature preferences from current distributions because the observed distributions are modiï¬ed by abundance, habitat, predator and prey abundance and competition. Second, there may be barriers to dispersal (although this is typically less of an issue in the sea than on land) and species will move at different rates and encounter different local ecologies as temperature changes (Davis et al. 1998). A more detailed, physiologically-based approach has been taken by some authors, whereby the detailed dynamics of individual animals are modelled, often by linking complex biophysical models (forced with the output from Global Climate Models) to sub-routines which replicate the behaviour/characteristics of eggs, larvae, juveniles or adults. Teal et al. (2008) reported a study of plaice and sole distribution in the North Sea, in which they predicted size- and season-speciï¬c ï¬sh distributions based on the physiology of the species, temperature and food conditions in the sea. This study combined state-of-the-art dynamic energy budget (DEB) models with output from a biogeochemical ecosystem model (ERSEM) forced with observed climatic data for 1989 and 2002, with contrasting temperature and food conditions. The resulting habitat quality maps were in broad agreement with observed ontogenetic and seasonal changes in distribution as well as with long-term observed changes in distribution. The technique has recently been extended to provide future projections up to year 2050, assuming moderate climate warming (L. Teal, pers. comm. IMARES, Netherlands)."
230,574,0.989,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"of marine ecosystem services, which are estimated at â¬16.5 trillion in one study (Costanza et al. 1997), suggest that even fractional deterioration in provision would represent a significant cost (Beaumont et al. 2007; Galparsoro et al. 2014). Thus far, studies undertaken to estimate the economic impacts of marine litter have generally focused on the direct losses borne by economic activities adversely affected by the presence of marine litter in the environment, within which they operate and rely upon (see Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; MacFayden 2009; McIlgorm et al. 2011). Largely, such studies have not taken into account the often intangible costs of any social and ecological impacts. Some early studies allude to the need for research to explore these costs. For instance, Kirkley and McConnell (1997, p. 185) call for strategies, which account for the economics related to lost ecological functions driven by marine litter. The intricacy of developing such strategies can be illustrated with the example of alien invasive species. Marine litter provides additional opportunities for marine organisms to travel (including alien invasive species) up to threefold (Barnes 2002). Given that the introduction of alien invasive species can have a detrimental impact on marine ecosystems and biodiversity (Kiessling et al. 2015) and can result in serious economic losses to many marine industries, any estimates, which exclude such ecological impacts, will inevitably fall seriously short of the true cost of the marine litter problem. For example, the introduction of the carpet sea squirt (Didemnum vexillum) in Holyhead Harbour (Wales, U.K.) resulted in an eradication and monitoring program over a decade starting in 2009, which was expected to cost â¬670,000. This expenditure was economically justified as allowing the species to spread unpredated and smother organisms and marine habitats would have cost the local mussel fisheries up to â¬8.6 million alone over 10 years (Holt 2009). Goldstein et al. (2014) recorded the ciliate pathogen Halofolliculina (known to cause skeletal eroding band disease in corals) on floating plastic debris in the western Pacific and suggested that the spread of the disease to Caribbean and Hawaiian corals may be due to rafting on the enormous quantities of litter reported from the area. Increased coral mortality or the introduction of other pathogens via floating marine debris may lead to economic costs, for example through decreased revenues due to falling numbers of visiting tourists. Despite their partial coverage, the studies that are available provide sufficient information to draw a number of important conclusions. The main economic sectors, which have been identified from the literature as being affected by marine litter are agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, commercial shipping and recreational boating, coastal municipalities, coastal tourism sector and the emergency rescue services (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010). The economic impacts affecting these sectors are described and quantified where possible (Hall 2000; Mouat et al. 2010; McIlgorm et al. 2011; Jang et al., 2014; Antonelis 2011).

So, even though local people are aware of the disturbance they may be causing, they often have no idea of the severity of population-level consequences. Because bats appear to be numerous, popular belief is that humans can have only minimal impact on their populations. For example, the greater short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx) is believed by experts to be threatened by hunting in parts of its range, but in other parts, <1 % of local people surveyed believe the species could be threatened by their hunting (Johnson et al. 2003). Similarly, throughout the Philippines, bats are eaten regularly with little understanding of the impacts that harvest is causing. Hunters who join biologists on bat population counts commonly overestimate the population size by three orders of magnitude prior to the count and then are shocked when the counted population is in the hundreds or low thousands (Mildenstein et al. 2007; Mildenstein 2012).

This deï¬nition of risk, however, represents only one aspect of risk, which is complex in nature. It is described in ISO 31000 [2] that organizations face internal or external factors and influences that make it uncertain whether and when they will achieve their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on an organizationâs objectives is deï¬ned as ârisk.â The objective of nuclear safety is to protect people, individually and collectively, as well as the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiations [3]. Therefore, the risks of nuclear power plant accidents are the effect of uncertainty in the various predecessors of accidents, e.g., earthquakes, ï¬res, flooding and human errors, etc., on the objective of nuclear safety. Analysis of risk is to attempt to envision what will happen if a certain course of action, including inaction, is taken [4]. Therefore, risk is deï¬ned as an answer to the following questions [4]: â¢ What can go wrong? (Scenario) â¢ How likely is it? (Likelihood) â¢ What might its consequences be? (Consequence) The importance of the scenario, in addition to the consequence and the likelihood (or frequency), is more emphasized in this deï¬nition to describe the characteristics of risk. It is also emphasized that the risk information should include information about what is within/out of scope and how uncertain the result of the risk assessment is. The consequences that are assessed by risk assessment are not limited to fatalities due to radiation exposure, but include other consequences related to quality of life, e.g., environmental damage. It should also be noted that the actual fatalities related to nuclear power plant accidents are not always limited to radiation effects but may include other factors as discussed above, which should be included in the scope of the risk assessment of nuclear power plants."

The health services should be distributed in a fair way between rural areas and cities; and between tertiary hospitals and primary health care. Disease prevention, health education, and health promotion deserve its fair share; otherwise discrepancies will continue between the rich and the poor, the town and city dwellers and the rural, desert area and shanty town dwellers. The end result will be poor health indices. There is no doubt that USA is the number one country in terms of spending on health, research and medical advancement, availability of hospitals, great physicians, surgeons, and health providers; nevertheless, it is no better than Malaysia in certain indices mentioned above set by the WHO. It is deï¬nitely far from the high standard of Singapore, Japan, Nordic countries, or Western Europe in these health indices. Certainly, it is not only the number of physicians or nurses or beds that will improve the health standard of the nation.

Although justice is a core value of USA, the actual facts of life show intolerance, injustice in different racial and ethnic groups of USA.

The prevalence of limited literacy is high among those with lower levels of education, the elderly, the minorities, and those with chronic disease. An emerging literature has begun to describe the myriad of health consequences of limited literacy.

255,273,0.989,Railway Ecology,"Introduction Many animals range widely across landscapes in the quest to meet their daily, seasonal and annual biological needs of food, water, shelter and mates (Caughley and Sinclair 1994). Habitat connectivity within a landscape helps dispersal and re-colonization, thus maintaining regional metapopulations and minimizing risks of inbreeding within populations (Newmark 1987; Wilcove et al. 1998). Historically, the spread of agriculture probably contributed the most to loss and fragmentation of their natural habitat. In an increasingly industrialized world, however, transport networks (railways, roads, and waterways) or so-called âlinear infrastructures,â restrict the movement of wildlife populations by fragmenting their habitat, increasing edge effects, constricting ecological corridors, blocking animal movement, and increasing the risk of mortality due to direct collisions with motorized vehicles (Forman and Deblinger 2000; Trombulak and Frissell 2000; Inell et al. 2003; Van der Ree et al. 2011). These processes hinder the persistence of species in human-dominated landscapes because small and isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction from stochastic demographic processes and loss of genetic variation (Soule and Wilcox 1980). Roads are perhaps the most widespread and pervasive form of âlinear infrastructureâ that have greatly impacted wildlife populations in the more developed parts of the world through habitat loss, restriction of animal movements, alteration of animal behaviour, and directly injuring or killing very large numbers of animals in collisions with vehicles (Trombulak and Frissell 2000; Seiler and Helldin 2015). A variety of animals are involved in roadâkills, from large-bodied ones such as moose to smaller creatures such as frogs (Fahrig et al. 1995; Formann et al. 2003; Dorans et al. 2012). One estimate of roadâkills suggested that 1,000,000 vertebrates were killed in the USA every day (Lalo 1987), while Conover et al. (1995) estimated that the number of deerâvehicle collisions in the USA exceeds 1,000,000 annually, causing approximately 29,000 human injuries and 200 fatalities, apart from animal fatalities. Given the magnitude of animal roadâkills and the occurrence of human fatalities, there has been much attention paid to mitigating wildlife road kills through the appropriate design of roadways in many developed countries (Clarke et al. 1998; Inell et al. 2003). In contrast, only limited attention has been paid to wildlifeâtrain collisions, although this has also been happening on signiï¬cant scales in many countries. For instance, 200 moose train collisions were estimated in the province of British Columbia, Canada, during 1988â1990 (Child et al. 1991), with 266 collisions in a 92 km section of railways in Norway during 1980â 1988 (Andersen et al. 1991), and between 9 and 725 collisions annually in Alaska (Modafferi 1991). Similarly, 69 roe deer train collisions in the Czech Republic were reported during 2009 (Kusta et al. 2014). Therefore, there is an urgent need for more information on trainâwildlife collisions, and how these may be mitigated. India is one of the countries with serious problems of trainâwildlife collisions. This is because the Indian Railways (IR) is one of the worldâs largest railway networks, comprising 115,000 km of tracks over a route of about 65,000 km and"

As can be seen in Fig. 6.1, the number of yearly flight hours varies considerably among HELCOM member countries, although there has been a slight upward trend over time at the aggregate level. For example, Sweden in almost all years has had more flight hours recorded than all the other countries together. Russia, in contrast, has only recorded ten flight hours between 1993 and 2011. Even though it is reasonable to expect countries with long coastlines and major sea routes to have more flight hours than others, the overall impression is that compliance with flight hour commitments is uneven. Despite the uneven implementation of the flight surveillance schemes, available data seem to indicate that the number of intentional spills has declined over the last decade, in spite of the significant increases in marine traffic at the Baltic Sea (Fig. 6.2). Although the interpretation of HELCOM data may seem straightforward â improved command and control measures through satellite and aerial and surface monitoring have led to decreased levels of intentional oil spills â uncertainties remain regarding the number of spills as well as what drivers have been most important in the alleged reduction of intentional spills. It may very well be the case that increased surveillance has led to fewer intentional oil spills in the last decade. Most likely this is the main explanation for the declining trend shown in Fig. 6.2. However, the number of observed spills is most likely considerably lower than actual spills.

Such experiments, referred to as in situ mesoscale ocean enrichment, provide valuable insights into the wide range of processes that are influenced by an episodic nutrient addition, and as such provide a âbiogeochemical timelineâ of how the nutrients released from dust deposition may have myriad effects on both surface and subsequently subsurface or atmospheric processes. Trends from over ten of these experiments reveal convergences but also differences, which in many cases are due to regional differences between the environmental characteristics of HNLC waters in tropical to polar waters (de Baar et al. 2005). Convergent results provide confidence in compiling a biogeochemical timeline of the many processes that may be altered by aerosol deposition. In the case of iron enrichment, rapid initial changes (i.e. hours to days) include altered iron chemistry, up-regulation of cellular machinery in pelagic microbes such as photosynthetic competence (Fv/Fm), increased growth rates by all phytoplankton groups which is first manifested as an increase in stocks of cyanobacteria followed by those of nanophytoplankton (such as haptophytes). This initial increase in cyanobacterial abundances is truncated within a day or so as they are grazed down to initial levels as nano-grazers respond to higher picoprey concentrations. A similar increase in haptophyte abundances lags the cyanobacteria, and then they are also brought under grazer control. In contrast the diatom stocks take longer to reveal an increase in abundances, and in many cases they escape grazing pressure resulting in an iron-mediated bloom (de Baar et al. 2005; Boyd et al. 2007). This biological activity results in distinct biogeochemical signatures that produce feedbacks that are important for oceanâatmosphere interactions. For example, at some but not all experimental sites, the grazing of the haptophytes by microzooplankton may result in increased ocean DMSP inventories (Boyd et al. 2007) that consequently may in some cases result in elevated DMS concentrations in the upper ocean. However, in other studies such as SERIES in the NE subarctic Pacific no such increase in DMS was observed by the end of the bloom (Boyd et al. 2007). Concurrently there is widespread evidence of significant decreases in oceanic CO2 concentrations due to enhanced C fixation by the blooming diatoms (de Baar"

This trend is particularly strong in landslides in Cenozoic rock.

Further analysis incorporating additional examples is required; there is a possibility that the characteristics of large-scale landslides deduced herein are also common in areas outside of Japan that have similar geology, topography, and evolution of geological structure.

These four interrelated elements need to be coordinated within and across sectors and multiple levels for the system to work effectively and effective feedback mechanisms need to be in place for continuous improvement. Failure in one component, or lack of coordination across them, could lead to the failure of the whole systemâa critical issue since an EWS that does not warn effectively will not be trusted (Golnaraghi 2012). EWS can be developed for speciï¬c hazards and speciï¬c consequences or for multiple hazards and a range of impacts. The latter are termed MHEWSâa concept that is relatively newâand currently deï¬ned (UNISDR 2016b) as EWS which are designed to be used in multi-hazard contexts where hazardous events may occur alone, simultaneously or cumulatively over time, and taking into account the potential interrelated effects. A MHEWS with the ability to warn of one or more hazards increases the efï¬ciency and consistency of warnings through coordinated and compatible mechanisms and capacities, involving multiple disciplines for updated and accurate hazards identiï¬cation, mapping and monitoring and dissemination of warnings from various sources with a âsingle authoritative voiceâ and through standardized formats, codes and deï¬nitions. They may also involve international cooperation to address transboundary risks, such as floods, epidemics and the release of hazardous materials into the air or water. MHEWS, therefore, build synergies for data collection, analysis and operational management, thus enhancing cooperation, efï¬ciency and effectiveness (Basher 2006). However, in practice and even in theory, there is no agreement what is meant by an EWS and its individual terms âearlyâ, âwarningâ or âsystemâ. The answers are highly contextual, depending on social settings and the hazards themselves. In general, âearlyâ indicates that a warning is provided in advance of a potential hazard event in order to allow for sufï¬cient time for preparatory actions Thus, the hazard-speciï¬c âlead timeâ becomes a crucial characteristic of the EWS. However, âearlyâ in terms of warning of possible climatic changes could mean 100 years in advance, whereas for a flash flood it could be less than an hour in advance. In some instances, the ï¬rst warnings can only be issued when the hazard has already materialised, e.g. for some tornadoes or after a potentially tsunami-generating earthquake. âwarningâ information supports decision-making dedicated to threats and hazards and their potential impacts based on thresholds and other, user-speciï¬c criteria. However, caution is advised since a warning can be understood as a general information category with no legal obligation or an authoritative message from a mandated national authority that triggers a speciï¬c protocol."

For example, the importance of the Nietoperek fortifications in Western Poland as a bat hibernaculum was first brought to the attention of bat biologists outside the Iron Curtain by a Russian plan to dump radioactive waste there. The plan was shelved as a result of a successful campaign by conservationists. Throughout Poland, groups known as âbunkermenâ meet socially in underground fortifications where they may disturb the bats. Thomas (1995) showed that non-tactile disturbance from seemingly innocent cave visits during hibernation periods can cause bats to arouse and maintain significantly greater flight activity for up to eight hours afterwards. Such arousals are highly detrimental to their over-winter survival and non-tactile disturbance during other critical periods such as reproduction may lead to: (1) death of young that lose their roost-hold and fall to the cave floor, (2) females abandoning the roost for less ideal sites where prospects for reproductive success may be reduced, (3) greater energy expenditure among females and less efficient energy transfer to young (translating into slower growth of young and increased foraging demands on females), (4) reductions in the thermoregulatory benefits of a roost as a result of decreased numbers of bats frequenting the site (McCracken 1989; Sheffield et al. 1992). As a result, uncontrolled human disturbance often leads to decreases in numbers of bats roosting in caves and mines (Tuttle 2013). For instance, disturbance"

So it is conceivable that the migrants in our sample are subject to a positive selection mechanism and thus the effects are underestimated. It should also be kept in mind that Turkish migrants and Aussiedler in Germany are subject to an additional selection process. Due to their health checks in their recruitment as guest workers, at least the ï¬rst generation of (male) Turkish migrants was selected by health, and Aussiedler are selected by their proximity to German culture. This may have direct and indirect impact on health factors and the integration into society. Another explanation could be that migrants have greater social resources. In addition to stable family structures, they might be emotionally supported by extended families, social networks, and ethnic communities in times of shortage (Razum and Spallek 2012; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003). Networks across households and/or outside households were not investigated in our study, but could provide further explanations. As Haug (2007) describes, external resources mightâ along with the householdâact as sources of social embeddedness and it seems that this resource is equally compensatory among migrants and non-migrants. The ï¬nding that women who live in households without any non-migrants have increased health risks suggests that networks, in particular social contacts with Germans, might counteract health risks and is in line with existing studies (Haug 2004; Lancee and Hartung 2012). Finally, it should also be questioned whether in fact there are immense differences in value systems, family ideals, and the motivation for the formation of a speciï¬c household type between non-migrant Germans and migrants, particularly against the background of a long duration of stay. According to Haas (2010) and Haug (2004), migrants often maintain ties with their countries of origin, which exist and are formative long after migration. Among Turkish migrants, this social capital is rather family-based and kinship based (Haug 2005), which could be detrimental for the social integration and health care utilization and thus might establish an intra-ethnic segmentation (Lue Kessing et al. 2013; Esser 2001). Bearing in mind that Turks and Aussiedler often migrated to reunite their family orâin the case of Aussiedlerâto live in their cultural home, this assumption must be questioned. It is conceivableâand supported by our resultsâthat there is a gradual appropriation of cultural peculiarities, which goes together with an adaption of norms and values as well as health risks in the course of stay (Schenk 2007). As in other studies, we conclude that migrants who have been in Germany for a long time adapt behaviours (Milewski 2010, 2011; Berry 1992). Our results also indicate that there are social structures which compensate for differences at the household level. There are differences in the health structure between Turkish migrants, Aussiedler, and Germans, but these generally do not explain health differences by migration background. One exception are (female) Aussiedler, where it remains partly unclear why they have better health and why their dependence on the household structure follows a different pattern."

Since ancient times, and more intensively from the mid-19th century, the development of human settlements, infrastructure and economic activities is expanding more and more in the mountain region and the space belonging to land and water has been reduced. On the surface that previously belonged to the river have developed agriculture, transport routes and settlements. At the end of the 20th century, development spread over hazardous areas, many torrent flowed in highly conï¬ned channels, and ground water recharges dropped down, instability of land surface and security for inhabitants decreased. This resulted in reduction of water resources of appropriate quality, reduction of space for sediment deposit, increase of erosion, impacts on natural habitats, causing major flood damage, decrease of groundwater stock, and deterioration of water quality. The water regime integrates all events across space from landslides, debris flow and is manifested in river regime in low lands (Brilly 2015). This problem is partially covered by many United Nations (UN) and UNESCO documents and reports. Proper actions are also suggested in the Ministerial Declaration from the 7th World Water Forum (World Water Council 2015), where the ï¬rst mentioned action is the signiï¬cance of appropriate land management in relation to sustainable water management and planning. More Room for Landslides actually means more space for control of potential landslides caused by human activities that cause slope instability; more space for torrents; more space for water and sediment storages and less impact on the slope stability; consequentially higher security for the people. The occurrence of landslides in Slovenia can be expected at approx. 1/3 of the total surface area (RibiÄiÄ et al. 2005). However, more and more intense and concentrated use of space is increasing risk of landslide occurrence. Furthermore, there are also spatial interventions at unstable areas by which conditionally stable areas change into unstable. Landslides in Slovenia most often occur as consequence of heavy rainfall, which means that landslides are inseparably linked to water. In our paper we present three cases of landslides that have occurred in the past on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, and discuss how could measures in the ï¬eld of spatial planning reduce risk and consequential damage in these cases. We have focused on cases where analysis has shown that due to improperly designed or maintained forest roads and skid trails, the damage was greater: StoÅ¾e (2000), Laze Dolsko and Slapnica (2009), Upper Savinja Valley (1990)."

Grey infrastructures might not be able to respond and accommodate the uncertain future ahead of us. Huge flood defence works, in the Thames river in the UK or the MOSES project in Venice (Italy), have shown to have quite long time lags of implementation, about 30 years, which is also true in the case changes in urban planning (Hallegatte 2009). Maladaptation to climate change can also occur through the installation of energy-intensive machines or infrastructures (such as pumped drainage or desalination plants) (Dawson 2007). These usually do not meet climate mitigation objectives since they are often powered by climate polluting energy sources, and can also fail as was the case of overconsumption and power outages illustrated by the summer blackout in the U.S. Northeast in 2003 (Andersson et al. 2005). Especially in the case of CCA, construction costs can be extremely high (Bosello et al. 2012) while maintenance and restructuring (e.g. digging in sand for riverine dikes) can also be financially demanding. There is however a wide variability among factors important to consider in the case of the implementation and maintenance of grey infrastructures. These factors also depend on the type of hazard under consideration. For some hazards, structural measures with highly sophisticated early warning and evacuation plans might be needed. Seawalls are for instance particularly effective in the case of tsunamis, even if these might be costly (Khazai et al. 2007). Additionally, to adapt to rising temperatures and heat-waves, air conditioning and cooling centers, will continue to be important for adaptation and reduction of risk. Grey infrastructures tend to require limited amounts of land, are replicable, can be monitored, and to some extent controlled (The Nature Conservancy 2013), all of which are characteristics that remain particularly suitable to the urban context in a fast changing climate."

The effects of the other covariates were generally as expected: Those living in residential care units had a higher risk of slow walking, which was largely explained by life-style and health variables. SES exerted a strong effect, which was partly attributable to life-style factors. Light-to-moderate alcohol drinking seemed to be positively related to walking speed; rarely/never performing any physical activity severely increased the risk of slow walking speed. High numbers of chronic morbidities increased the risk of slow walking speed as did signs of depression. As expected, walking speed in the previous wave was a strong predictor of current walking speed. Turning to the Change Models, which explored the risk of a severely declining walking speed, for men we found little effect of living in a partnership, and a"

Performance also depends on several other factors that are all inherently vulnerable to climate change, including reservoir design, operation strategies, dam safety, and distributions of floods and droughts. Thorsteinsson and BjÃ¶rnsson (2012) showed that climate change may have critical signiï¬cance for dam safety and flood risk and so is likely to influence the future design and operation of hydropower plants."
97,112,0.989,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Beyond life history traits, spatial dynamics have been highlighted as an essential factor for resilience (Webb and Bodin 2008; Allen et al. 2016). In principle, having connections between for example the specimens of a specific type of NBS will usually promote the resilience of the individual NBS as well as the connected network of NBS. Each node in the network can potentially support the other nodes by replenishing locally extirpated populations and facilitating reorganisation (e.g. Hanski and Gilpin 1991; Bengtsson et al. 2003). While perhaps more indirect than the immediate response to disturbance, these processes make it more likely that the NBS survives and are in place to support system resilience when needed. However, connectivity can be problematic as some of the disturbances that challenge NBS may follow the same linkages (Holling et al. 2002; Allen et al. 2014). For this reason, modularity has been suggested as a fluid middle way where smaller groups of nodes within a network are internally well connected but relatively isolated from other groups (e.g. Webb and Bodin 2008). Bioswales are a good example for how modularity can help maintain resilience. Since they are often small and spatially disaggregated, failure of one set of bioswales may not impact bioswales in other locations in the city allowing continued functioning for flood mitigation in places where bioswales did not fail. Similarly, street trees, which tend to be spatially separated, may be able to sustainably provide NBS when faced with disturbances more reliably in some instances than more spatially aggregated trees in urban forests. Tree insect pests, which may become increasingly threatening to NBS (Dale and Frank 2014), can spread more easily among closely growing tree stands. Here again, the principle of modularity where redundant functions are disaggregated can help to ensure continued green infrastructure performance for mitigating effects of climate change in cities."

The Zebu in India and Pakistan, and other breeds in Africa and Europe, were scrutinized and evaluated as a basis for advising governments and local breeders on âhow best to utilize their valuable animal genetic resourcesâ.111 Nutrition was also a key focus. One of the Divisionâs first reports, Nutritional Deficiencies in Livestock, detailed the state of animal nutrition in much of the world, the variety of nutritional diseases that burdened livestock, and ways of improving their nutrition.112 Building on almost a half-century of animal nutrition research in the USA,113 the authors argued that just as with humans, poor animal diets led to poor growth and dietary deficiencies, and were a âchief factor limiting production of meat, milk and eggs â¦ Tremendous quantities of the worldâs feeds are wasted in this type of feeding, resulting in large losses of human foods.â Not only was âthe vitamin A value of milkâ¦ entirely dependent upon the amount present in the feedâ, but âunderfeeding dairy cows results in the reduction of milk supply as much as 75%â.114 Therefore, âcorrecting dietary deficiencies in livestock rations will do much to increase the worldâs supply of meat, milk and eggsâ.115 To address the problem, the American nutritionists who wrote the report placed particular emphasis on improving the quality of pastures through mixed farming and the application of fertilizers. The APHD also had a Health Branch. Its activities were coordinated by vet Thomas Dalling, who had helped to lead the British veterinary professionâs wartime efforts to connect bovine and human health. He had also advised UNRRA and the fAO on the post-war reconstruction of European veterinary services and livestock economies.116 He was convinced that âto improve the food supplies of protein origin for people in different parts of the world â¦ we must increase animal production; and if we can increase and can better the health of animals, then we will have gone quite a long way towards increasing that animal production.â117 111 Phillips (1981)"
231,1180,0.989,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Year-Class Strength and Implications for Fisheries Fishers and scientists have known for over 100 years that the status of ï¬sh stocks can be greatly influenced by prevailing climatic conditions (Hjort 1914; Cushing 1982). âRecruitmentâ variability is a key measure of stock productivity, and is deï¬ned as the number of juvenile ï¬sh surviving from the annual egg production to be exploited by the ï¬shery. Recruitment is critically dependent on the match or mismatch between the occurrence of the larvae and availability of their zooplankton food (Cushing 1990) as well as other processes that affect early life-history stages (see Petitgas et al. 2013). Empirical data on exploited populations often show strong relationships between recruitment success, ï¬sheries catches and climatic variables. These strong relationships have been demonstrated, for example, for cod (OâBrien et al. 2000; Brander and Mohn 2004; Cook and Heath 2005), plaice (Brunel and Boucher 2007), herring (Nash and Dickey-Collas 2005), mackerel (Jansen and Gislason 2011) and seabass (Pawson 1992). Correlations have been found between ï¬sh recruitment and various climate variables, including sea surface temperature, the NAO and even offshore winds (Table 12.2). A number of publications describing the impact of climate variability (e.g. the NAO and AMO) on small pelagic ï¬shes such as herring, anchovy or sardine in the North Sea have been published in recent years, for example those of Alheit et al. (2012) and GrÃ¶ger et al. (2010). According to the most recent assessment of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the NAO is one of the climate indices for which it is most difï¬cult to provide accurate future projections (IPCC 2013). Recent multi-model studies (e.g. Karpechko 2010) suggest overall that the NAO is likely to become slightly more positive (on average) in the future due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, a slight tendency towards enhanced recruitment and larval abundance of these species in the future could be expected if the relationships observed in the past continue to hold. In the case of cod, there is a well-established relationship between recruitment and sea temperature (OâBrien et al. 2000; Beaugrand et al. 2003), but this relationship varies with regard to the different cod stocks that inhabit the North Atlantic (Planque and FrÃ©dou 1999). For stocks at the northern extremes (e.g. in the Barents Sea) or the western Atlantic (e.g. Labrador), warming leads to enhanced recruitment, while in the North Sea, close to the southern limits of the range, warmer conditions lead to weaker than average year classes (Drinkwater 2005). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, cold conditions were correlated with a sequence of positive recruitment years in North Sea cod"
245,529,0.989,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"GreenMetric analyses six areas: setting and infrastructure, energy and climate change, waste, water, transportation, education. Right from the beginning this ranking showed its limits. The ï¬rst problem that the GreenMetric team had to face was the differences due to the variety of contexts wherein universities are placed. Indeed, considering some indicators, universities located in city centre or in historical cities could be disadvantaged because they have not a lot of leeway in making actions to reduce their environmental impacts through building works or enlarging green spaces. For instance, in some historical cities there are no possibilities to build new and green buildings or to install solar panels, because making this kind of interventions involves important structural works in buildings that are often protected by artistic restrictions. Moreover, environmental impacts can be very different from a climate zone to another and this influences considerably the amount of KWH used. A similar consideration can be made also for the indicator âpercentage of area covered in vegetationâ, that in some countries is inevitably bigger than other countries with a high population density per square kilometre, or even the presence of a forest inside the campus. Another big limit of GreenMetric ranking is the lack of the social dimension of sustainability: there is no indicator that measures the social impacts of universities and social cohesion, although this dimension produces probably the most relevant and evident results for a community, also in the economic sphere."

Furthermore, the release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to crop stubble burning results in the depletion of the oxygen layer in the natural environment causing green house effect. Burning of crop waste also has adverse implications on the health of milk producing animals. Air pollution can result in the death of animals, as the high levels of CO2 and CO in the blood can convert normal haemoglobin into deadly hemoglobin. There can also be a potential decrease in the yield of the milk producing animals. Burning of crop stubble has severe adverse impacts especially for those people suffering from respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease. Pregnant women and small children are also likely to suffer from the smoke produced due to stubble burning. Inhaling of fine particulate matter of less than PM2.5 Âµg triggers asthma and can even aggravate symptoms of bronchial attack. According to Singh et al.

The prevalence of medium- and smallsized settlements in regions like ZlÃ­n or Karlovy Varyâas opposed to the economically more deprived but also more urbanized northwestern and northeastern parts of the countryâmay explain the configurations of regional inequality described above. At the same time, fuel prices and availability may have played a role in the geographical distribution of energy poverty indicators in Poland and Hungary; regions where biomass and coal are more abundant perform better on the LIHC and energy burden despite the low incomes of the population. This may be due to wider price effects, as our analyses in Bouzarovski and Tirado Herrero (2017a) have also shown an increased incidence of the LIHC and high energy burden indicators in households who use solid fuels as the main source of warmth (Table 4.5). As a whole, the reviewed evidence suggests that the demand-side fuel mix and the condition of the housing stock have combined with existing patterns of deprivation to produce new spatial distributions of energy poverty at the subnational level."

In total, 42 of the island mammal species we assessed were listed by the IUCN as Data Deï¬cient, 47 as Least Concern, with the remainder as threatened species. Those species already listed as threatened were potentially suffering from other threats (e.g. non-native species as predators/competitors). Focusing on those species that are Data Deï¬cient or Least Concern and have higher Î»M-ED scores would be most beneï¬cial, as their rarity indicate them to be at risk and a high Î»M value represents an important patch, and one that would pay off greatly to conserve. The ï¬ve islands with the highest average Î»M-ED scores, taken by adding all the scores and dividing by our (island-restricted mammals) species richness per island were Jamaica, Guadalcanal, Isle of Pines, Madagascar, and Nggela Sule (see Table 2, Fig. 3 for map). Interestingly, Madagascar held 39 of the highest Î»M-ED species, and ranked fourth in our Î»M-ED islands list. We found that combining evolutionary distinctness with Î»M revealed species that may be of concern that were not otherwise noticed. Because quantifying fragmentation effects on species takes into account spatial conï¬guration, this can help to improve threat status assessments. The EDGE programme has already sought to visualize regions in the world with the most rare species and moved to prioritize those particular species. This adds a spatial understanding of the species distribution to that prioritization."

The key issue in this context is not one of presence/absence, because CPY and CPYO can be monitored in air at concentrations as little as 0.001 ng mâ3, which are much less than thresholds for adverse effects. Risk depends on the magnitude of concentrations, especially in media where organisms might be exposed and thus are potentially at risk. It can be difficult to assimilate ranges in concentrations in the atmosphere and the variety of concentration units of differing magnitudes in sampled media. Accordingly, here, the feasibility was assessed of compiling a more readily comprehendible depiction of multi-media environmental concentrations by expressing the concentrations as ranges and converting concentrations in various media to fugacities. Fugacity is essentially partial pressure and can be deduced for all media and compared directly, without difficulties introduced by the use of different concentration units for individual compartments of the environment. Using fugacity as a synoptic descriptor of concentrations in the ecosystem has been applied previously to multi-media concentrations of organochlorines in the Great Lakes (Clark et al. 1988). It is, of course, possible to calculate multimedia equilibrium concentrations using partition coefficients directly, rather than using fugacity as an intermediate, but the equilibrium status of two phases with units such as ng mâ3 in air and mg kgâ1 in vegetation may not be obvious. Ideally, to demonstrate directly the trend of decreasing concentrations, the data should be plotted as a function of distance from source, but because sources are often uncertain and concentrations vary with time as a function of transformation of the material at the location of release, this is rarely possible. The approach adopted here was to compile a distribution of reported concentrations to gain perspective on the range in magnitude of concentrations at various distances from points of release, at least for ecosystems for which sufficient monitoring data have been compiled. Accordingly, Table 4 depicts the distribution of reported concentrations for air, rain, snow, water bodies, soils, sediments, and biota on a decade scale. In some cases, products of transformation are included and in others they were specifically excluded. Some of the data were reported graphically or as ranges, so numerical values were sometimes difficult to establish. Locations for which information was available varied geographically and often lacked information on current and recent meteorology such as wind speed, temperature, and precipitation. Some values reported for each concentration range are approximate because reports gave only"

Improvements to reticulated water supplies have not been quite adequate to compensate for this, and consequently levels of water-borne diseases have risen slightly. Protection of biodiversity has been detrimentally affected by a government focus on economic development, though efforts by civil society groups to remedy this have been stepped up. Coastal fisheries have dwindled due to the use of illegal and destructive gear, defiance of the ban period by the fishers and catching of undersized fish.

233,94,0.988,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Prospects In the examples presented above, assessments of sets of taxa (and/or areas) focussed on two related goals. One was the assessment of losses in PD (as in Fig. 1) and the other was assessment of gains in PD (as in Fig. 2). Regarding gains, it is apparent that some indices may fail to record a large gain in PD, because they do not detect the degree to which a set of taxa is spread out phylogenetically. Regarding losses, some indices may miss a large loss in PD because they do not take into account the fact that a set of taxa are clumped phylogenetically. The latter case is a particularly important one, given that these scenarios may correspond to âphylogenetic tipping pointsâ, where long, deeper, branches of the phylogeny are lost (see Faith et al. 2010; Faith and Richards 2012), The theme of PD gains and losses is a critical one also for the conservation assessment of geographic areas. For species/taxon priorities, the expected PD methods have advantages over the ED and EDGE approaches for estimating expected gains or expected losses (Faith 2008). The application of expected PD by Jono and Pavoine (2012), noted above, provided an example of such an effective assessment of PD expected gains or losses. We also need effective estimates of the expected PD gains or expected PD losses for entire areas or regions. Expected PD will have advantages over other methods for assessments of areas. For example, the study of Saï¬ et al. (2013), discussed above, highlighted the importance of identifying regions having a concentration of threatened species and phylogenetic diversity. However, they focussed on the âhighest accumulation of top mammal species ranked in terms of their EDGE score.â Similarly, Gudde et al. (2013) set out to identify places with a concentration of threatened phylogenetically distinctive and rare species. Both studies, while identifying important assessment issues for the future, unfortunately applied methods that do not fully integrate the principle of phylogenetic complementarity. The expected PD framework may provide an effective way to address such assessment goals. The identiï¬cation of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) is one important context for future work of this kind.

Its efficacy in the general population of women, in sex workers, and in young girls in sugar-daddy relationships (i.e., young girls in unequal relationships with older males) is unknown. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit especially hard by HIV/AIDS. An estimated two-thirds of people affected by HIV worldwide are concentrated in this area, although significant variations exist in different parts of the continent (Kalipeni et al. 2004). Unfortunately, the distribution and availability of ART drugs have exposed the inadequacies of some African national health systems, such as the negative effects of a long-neglected health sector, economic challenges, declining public expenditures, and decentralized funding (Schneider et al. 2006). Many international aid groups help fund public health programs, including programs to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS. Programs such as PEPFAR (The United States Presidentâs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), the Global Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations, and the Gates Foundation have all contributed large sums of money for this purpose. African groups at high risk of contracting new infections (and thus good potential candidates for PrEP) include sex workers, men having sex with men, serodiscordant couples, and girls in sexual sugar-daddy relationships. The latter group poses specific ethical issues. These girls, typically teenagers, may be coerced into sexual relationships with men old enough to be their fathers or even grandfathers through the offering of gifts or money. These sugar daddies generally engage in multiple sexual relationships, possibly with a spouse and several young women, while putting the girls at risk of HIV. Every averted case of HIV increases economic productivity, lowers the risk of social unrest, strengthens the labor force, and improves the investment climate (Over 2011)."
22,68,0.988,"Education and Skills For inclusive Growth, Green Jobs and The Greening of Economies in Asia : Case Study Summaries of india, indonesia, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam (Volume 27.0)","2 Arguments Concerning the Role of Increased Employment and Productivity in Promoting Sustainable and Inclusive Growth The prevailing view used to be that economic growth trickles down in society to lift populations out of poverty. Kuznetsâs hypothesis (1955) (Kanbur in Ranieri and Ramos 2013: 2) states that in the early stages of development, growth produces (and exploits) inequality, and as per capita income rises there comes a turning point after which inequality declines. It was argued that, at ï¬rst, growth not only produces but necessitates income inequality. However, as Ranieri and Ramos (2013: 2) demonstrate, there has never been âconsummate empirical evidenceâ of that being the case. In advanced economies, it can be seen that real per capita income grew steadily from 1950 to the late 2000s, but inequality also grew. In some developing countries, average income steadily grew, but in others, fast growth was accompanied by worsening inequality without the growth process reversing that trend. Instead, poverty rates persisted at high levels or even increased (Ranieri and Ramos 2013: 2). The phenomenon of jobless growth has resulted in a deepening of existing inequalities and social exclusion, and the existence of the phenomenon of the working poor, where the majority of peopleâwhile workingâremain poor and deprived (UNDP, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and International Labour Organization (ILO), 2012: 4). Low growth is predicted for many large economies, and job creation will remain a challenge for some time. Moreover, the poor living in both rich and poor countries are most vulnerable to environmental degradation and climate change (OECD 2010a, b). Since low-income households spend a signiï¬cant share of income on food and energy-related items, they are also more exposed to the impact of wasteful practices, overconsumption, and environmental degradation, including soil degradation, deforestation, overï¬shing, and fresh water shortage (ILO 2012a, b: 1). In addition, globally, a link has been shown to exist between environmental pollution and social deprivation, with poorer communities being more exposed to environmental hazards. For example, the Commission of the European Communities found that Europeâs poorest communities suffer the worst air quality, are more likely to be located near industrial sites, and are more exposed to the risk of flooding. In one study cited, people in deprived communities were exposed to 41% higher than average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and in another it was found that half of municipal waste incinerators in the United Kingdom were located in the poorest 10% of communities (Commission of the European Communities 2005: 16). Other studies throughout Europe, the United States (e.g., Environmental Health News 2012), and in developing countries conï¬rm this link.

18,65,0.988,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"On March 11 of 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami affected the Tohoku District of Japan. In TEPCOâs Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, the external power supply was lost because of damage to the grid lines caused by the earthquake, and emergency diesel generators were terminated by the tsunami, which eliminated the capability to control radioactivity in reactors and the spent fuel storage pool. Consequently, a large amount of radioactive materials was released into the environment. Immediately after the release there was tremendous difficulty in managing the radioactive materials. It was extremely difficult to maintain communication, to mobilize human resources, and to procure supplies among other areas when addressing the nuclear accident that coincided with a massive natural disaster. Then, environmental radiation monitoring was initiated and various kinds of protective measures were implemented; however, radiation exposure resulted among the residents of Fukushima Prefecture and neighboring areas. Radiation exposure was initially caused by radioisotopes of iodine and short-lived radionuclides and subsequently by radiocesium from both external irradiation and internal irradiation through consumption of foods contaminated with these radionuclides. Data and information related to dose assessment, such as in air dose rate and the concentration of radioactive materials in various environmental media after the Fukushima accident, have been reported by various organizations and disclosed by news media and the Internet. The International Symposium held on 14 December 2012 by Kyoto University provided an excellent opportunity for the integration of relevant information. Results of dose assessment for various populations have been also reported by various authors. However, no quantified and conclusive results of dose assessment have been reported by the responsible organization so far. The results are still in the process of being finalized for official presentation to the public. In the present comments, therefore, I start by describing the implication of dose assessment in general, then I will report some results of dose assessment in the Fukushima accident. Finally, I touch on a key point of the present accident, radiation exposure of children, which seems to me extremely important for current radiation protection."

Coastal habitats are already one of the most severely endangered habitats due to intensive land-use changes occurring during the last decades. Most changes are driven by tourism, which has caused substantial destruction of most endangered habitats such as coastal dunes. The second threat is increasing area of ports, which require more and more space for containers or car terminals. Urbanisation in general has caused an important pressure to coastal areas, which offer higher living standards, better economic conditions, job and education possibilities and favourable climate. Therefore, immigration pressure to coastal areas is substantial. Besides that, there is also agriculture, developed in adjacent areas to the coast, driven by favourable climate and increased requirement of fresh products. The constantly increasing anthropogenic pressure is additionally intensified by climate change effects, among which the sea level rise is a serious threat. Sea level rise is a parameter which â in contrast to many other climatic parameters, being also congruent among â is showing quite clear trends. However, factors which cause changes in morphology of coasts are numerous and include sediment supply, tidal currents, wave action, extreme weather events (Cooper and Pilkey 2004), and also the subsidence of the surface (Lambeck et al. 2004). Baustian et al. (2012) reports that in certain situation, such as high sedimentation of both organic and inorganic materials coastal wetlands may be able to keep pace with rising sea level. There are different projections of the sea level rise in different coastal areas across the globe; thus the only relevant basis for reliable predictions are local measurements on the concrete studied sites.

302,202,0.988,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The role of the general public through awareness and active involvement (i.e., citizen science) is discussed in detail elsewhere in this book, both with an historical overview and specifics related to MP pollution (see Syberg et al. this volume [62]). Briefly it could be suggested that in comparison to other environmental issues, the public has been invaluable in assessing the magnitude of plastics and MP pollution through volunteer beach cleanups and surveys that provide data for monitoring programmers, as well as carrying out the practical task of removing beach litter. In the USA most information regarding the abundance and distribution of beach debris has been derived from volunteer beach cleaning efforts [63], and such public involvement is also occurring elsewhere. Public collaboration with scientific research has taken place in a number of locations worldwide, for instance, the collection of marine litter in the Firth of Forth, Scotland [64], collection of beach debris along the coast of southeast Chile [65], and many volunteers mobilized for beach surveys in South Africa [66]. However, to the best of our knowledge, such public-involving initiatives have not been attempted in areas surrounding African freshwaters. Part of this problem may be, as has been discussed, a scarcity of information regarding the scale of potential MP pollution, which results in a lack of funding and a lack of awareness. As discussed, funding for environmental issues may not be the highest priority in most African countries, but NGOs which could collaboratively work with various public sectors have paid little or no attention in raising public awareness in the issue of plastic waste management [67]. Similarly, the opportunities for 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle) are not well explored and advocated in developing countries [68]. It has been suggested that improved education on the issues of waste management in developing countries, and the preparation and training of environmental professionals and technicians, could be the way forward. Some developing countries have reported positive effects from investing in education, such as citizens assuming responsibility and higher status of waste workers, which have resulted in cleaner cities [68]. Such programs would potentially have similar results in urbanized regions around African freshwaters, and the downstream effect of cleaner cities would be less urban waste from which to produce MPs. But as mentioned earlier in this section, the increase of awareness and education of the population must be coupled with an increase in effective waste management and ultimately coherent regional political action."

High density areas are instead only the consumers of these resources, and the âupstream flowsâ do not weigh on their metabolic rates. This difference was considered so striking that UNEP based its scenarios of future resource use on the assumption that developing countries, over the coming decades, would tend to emulate the metabolic rates of industrial countries but maintain differences according to population density (UNEP 2011). Nevertheless, the IRP came to the conclusion that the already ongoing continuation of metabolic convergence would lead to an untenable level of global resource use, running up not only against all climate concerns but also against global resource constraints (fossil fuels, metals). Thus, Boserup, in contrast to most of her contemporaries, correctly viewed population growth and density increase not just as rising but also as alleviating environmental burdens."
150,53,0.988,"Socioeconomic and Environmental Implications of Agricultural Residue Burning : a Case Study of Punjab, india","The above discussed studies clearly establish that mass agricultural residue burning in the fields is seriously damaging the environment. Further, open burning of residue in the fields also leads to death of soil micro flora and fauna and may also damage nearby trees in addition to adjoining standing crops. Further, the ash left after burning is a very good absorbent and if not fixed properly, absorbs the applied weedicides, which results in decreased efficacy of herbicides. Thus, the on-site impact of burning includes removal of a large portion of the organic material, denying the soil an opportunity to enhance its organic matter and incorporate important chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as, loss of useful micro flora and fauna. The off-site impacts are health related due to general air quality degradation of the region resulting in aggravation of respiratory like cough, asthma, bronchitis, eye and skin diseases. Fine particles also can aggravate chronic heart and lung diseases and have been linked to premature deaths in people already suffering from these diseases. The black soot generated during burning also results in poor visibility which could lead to increased road side incidence of accidents. It is thus essential to mitigate impacts due to the burning of agricultural waste in the open fields and its consequent effects on soil, ambient air and living organisms."
199,61,0.988,Synchronized Factories : Latin America and the Caribbean in the Era of Global Value Chains,"Recapitulating Most of the indicators we used to examine the participation of LAC in global value chains present a similar picture: LACâs participation generally tends to be low relative to other regions. However, there is also significant heterogeneity within the region. For instance, Mexico and countries in Central America are more engaged in production networks, particularly with North America, and tend to participate in the final stages of production networks. For their part, countries in South America typically enter supply chains in the early stages. A set of clear factors explain at least some of these differences. For instance, proximity to the US makes Mexico an ideal recipient of offshoring activities. Likewise, the sheer abundance of natural resources in South America biases countries to participate in more upstream stages of supply chains. Proximity, the endowments of natural resources, and the relative abundance of different classes of labor are obvious drivers behind the levels and types of participation in supply chains. But they are not the only drivers. The next chapter uses a more rigorous analysis to identify a more complete spectrum of factors behind the regionâs relatively subpar participation in international supply chains.

46,100,0.988,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"in other regions it is a more prevalent issue. Besides space, the dimension of time needs to be acknowledged; how long a person is poor and during which phase in the life course, for example, during childhood, and whether poverty is a returning issue is highly relevant information. The dynamics of poverty are crucial and underexplored, which can also be attributed to the lack of data (Addison, Hulme and Kanbur 2009). Time is also relevant in the sense that it is valuable information to know if certain phases of life are particularly prone to poverty, as is the case for childhood. It is puzzling that members of society regularly deemed as in need and worthy of particular protection and support, called by politicians âthe future of a societyâ, are more often living in poverty. Before examining the injustice of child poverty, we need to point out two further aspects in relation to the aims and scope of this chapter. Firstly, we will focus on child poverty and studies that examine it in welfare states such as the countries of the European Union, the USA and, in some cases, Canada and Australia. We will, however, exclude the poorer states of the EU, such as Bulgaria and Romania, from our examination. The main reason is that, although such countries are members of the EU and certainly higher developed than many other countries in this world, they are still not on par with the richer states in the EU or the USA. The data we presented before on the breadth and depth of child poverty in these countries shows that sufficiently. Evidence shows that in highly developed countries severe forms of child poverty also exist but fortunately on a smaller scale (Weinreb et al. 2002). Secondly, despite this focus, we are confident that our conclusions are applicable to many more countries and contexts of child poverty. It holds generally that child poverty negatively affects the functionings children can achieve and the capabilities they can develop during childhood and in later life. This is in no way a problem exclusive to rich countries; in fact, evidence convincingly suggests that the problems are even greater and more severe in poorer countries in Europe and, indeed, everywhere else in the world. Still, child poverty in Romania and Bulgaria is less severe and widespread than it is in many African or Asian countries. It should be kept in mind that, using the monetary measure alone, the poor in richer states would be the middle class in others and among the affluent in many more."

Furthermore, in contrast to bird nets, this measure is non-lethal to the bats and therefore of high conservation value to local populations. However, such protective measures are reported to be rarely used in Bangladesh (Nahar et al. 2010, 2013). This could potentially be changed by encouraging local farmers to use this method, emphasising its inexpensiveness and efficiency while highlighting the reduced risk of acquiring Nipah virus disease. One of the key issues both for conservation and public health is the direct transmission of SARS and Ebola via wildlife markets. In South-East Asia, flying foxes are hunted regularly for the purpose of food (Mickleburgh et al. 2002; Mildenstein et al. 2016, Chap. 12), sometimes even authorised by the local Wildlife Department such as in Malaysia (Breed et al. 2006). Likewise, fruit bats are consumed regularly throughout Africa (Mickleburgh et al. 2009; Mildenstein et al. 2016, Chap. 12). Since bats are suggested as potential reservoir for the recent outbreak of Ebola, Guinea banned bats for sale from markets (Gatherer 2014). Educational efforts to reduce the threat both to public health by zoonotic diseases and to the conservation of local bat populations are challenging, as they are usually impeded by the lack of understanding of entrenched cultural behaviours and social components (Pooley et al. 2015; Kingston 2016, Chap. 18). In Ghana, for example, where the consumption of bats is part of the local culture and traditions, a survey revealed that knowledge about the ecological and economical value of bats would not make people refrain from killing and eating bats (Kamins et al."
291,68,0.988,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The current chapter shows how surface maps of rates of mortality improvement can also be used to analyze causes of death. This might enable researchers to gain better insights into the underlying mortality dynamics than merely looking at the Lexis surface of rates of improvement for all-cause mortality. We selected the United States for two reasons: â¢ Data on deaths are available as public use files since 1959 (National Center for Health Statistics 1959â2015; National Bureau of Economic Research 1959â 2015). Information is included not only on age at death and sex of each deceased individual but also on cause of death and many other variables. See Chap. 3, starting on page 11, for further details about the more than 118 mio. deaths contained in the data. â¢ The pattern of the rates of mortality improvement for women in the United States looked different than in any of the other countries (see Fig. 6.21 on page 65). Since the late 1970s/early 1980s, the US has not experienced any prolonged period of survival improvements. Indeed, the United States gained less years of life than most other western countries during the latter part of the twentieth century. As a consequence the National Institute on Aging in the United States ârequested that the National Research Council (NRC) launch a major investigation to clarify patterns in the levels and trends in international differences in life expectancy above age 50â (Crimmins et al. 2011, p. 2). We used again the same techniques and color schemes as in Chap. 6. To avoid any spurious conclusions due to small numbers of deaths, we excluded deaths above age 95 and below age 20."

From these results arise new questions for future research about how extensively rewilding should be facilitated, especially in those low-altitude humanized areas, in order to decrease vulture dependence on networks of large and fixed supplementary feeding stations. The consumption of wild ungulate carcasses derived from hunting is not exempt of risk for avian scavengers. Birds ingesting pieces of hunting ammunition are exposed to lead intoxication (see review in Fisher et al. 2006; Mateo et al. 2007) to the extent that its incidence can be a serious threat to large-scale reintroduction projects such as that of the California condor in North America (Finkenlstein et al. (2012 and references therein). Lead levels are also very high in Europe, for instance Iberian griffon vultures show seasonal and spatial variations according to the rate of consumption of wild ungulates (GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez et al. 2005). Moreover, carcasses resulting from hunting activities frequently accumulate at a few points at the end of hunting activities (Wilmers et al. 2003), which mimics the predictability offered by vulture restaurants and may result in similar negative effects (see above). Under a future scenario of a wilder Europe, we may promote two lines of action to curb the poisoning of scavengers: the consideration of a wilder Europe with zones limiting or lacking in hunting activities and in parallel the encouragement of the traditional extensive grazing currently under decline."

Above all, our analysis reminds historians that the minor, self-limiting and self-treated conditions are common across medicine and not just with infectious diseases. Illness âice bergsâ, the many episodes that do not reach the medical gaze, were and are present across all areas and most diseases. Yet, gaze of historians has always tended to be âabove the waterâ. For example, histories of the âGreat Influenza Pandemicâ of 1918â1919 emphasise that between 20 and 40 million people died of the infection or complications such as pneumonia, yet the average mortality rate was around 2% (varying between 1% and 10%) amongst those who suffered.5 This rate was very high compared to the normal experience of influenza, where case fatality rates was and remains typically less than 1%.6 Both figures make our point that the majority patient experience of influenza was and is one of recovery; with an illness of variable severity, which was and is typically self-treated and not require medical attention, if indeed, the sufferer had access to, or could afford, professional consultation. Moreover, then, as now, those likely to die of pneumonia were and are people with underlying health problems; in other words, those with weakened âsoilâ. The investigation of rare and unusual diseases highlights the importance of the adaptation of mainstream ideas and practices to novel problems, and the opportunities to âexperimentâ with new methods of diagnosis and treatment. In an era when standardisation and formal protocols dominate medical practice, our study of âorphan mycosesâ has shown the variability, complexity and individuality of clinical practice and the many resources, theoretical, practical and material, that doctors drew upon, and still draw upon, in all aspects of clinical work. The ways in which uses of amphotericin B, one the earliest antifungal antibiotic drugs, has been reinvented many times exemplifies this adaptability and shows the need to think about invention and innovation as processes rather than events. The very recognition of âorphan diseasesâ in part derives from novel medical and social technologies of surveillance, which have provided new types of recognition of infection, such as X-rays and immune reactions, and new attitudes to risk associated with social, economic and technological changes, such as the negotiation of thresholds for intervention in public health and with specific populations. Marginality has been studied by historians and sociologists of science as a âcontextâ that stimulates innovation.7 These ideas have been critiqued empirically and for having loose definitions of marginality"
226,50,0.988,Formalizing The Shadow Economy in Serbia : Policy Measures and Growth Effects,"In Serbia there is a large number of types of tax, and the system used to assess individual taxes is very complex. The more different streams of public revenue there are, and the more complex rules to assess and implement taxes, the lower the ability of tax inspectors to audit all types of tax, resulting in a lower probability of detecting tax evasion. In 2011 there were in excess of 370 various charges in Serbia, both fiscal and quasi-fiscal; most were administered by the Tax Administration of the Republic of Serbia and by local Public Revenue Administrations (NALED 2012a). In an environment dominated by such a large number of charges and with few qualified people auditing taxes, the complexity of the tax system is a major cause of the shadow economy. A large number of taxes, including many that are difficult to assess, can also lead to tax evasion by omission, as taxpayers may"
197,119,0.988,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"gEograPhIc PattErns of EnErgy PovErty In EuroPE I now turn to the social and spatial patterns of domestic energy deprivation across Europe, which, as evidenced by some of the work reviewed above, are highly geographically variable and locally contingent. General insights about the geographic extent of energy poverty in the EU can be gleaned from published SILC data. Based on the consensual approach (Healy, 2017) the information generated by the subjective measure on âinability to keep the home warmâ can be combined with more objective data about the shares of each countryâs population facing disproportionately high housing burdens, living in low-quality dwellings or having arrears on utility bills. Dividing each of these objective indicators by 3 (as they do not necessarily demonstrate energy poverty themselves), and adding them to the more direct subjective measure referring to the level of domestic heating, offers broad information about Europeâs spatial patterns of energy poverty (Fig. 4.1). The highest shares of populations with insufficient self-reported domestic warmth are concentrated in the part of the EU that is constituted by the post-socialist states of ECE (also referred to as the EU-10), especially"

Gillnets, which compromised more than 80% of all the debris found and 96% of waste in the fourth depth strata, are constructed using synthetic fibers, and although nylon was used in the 1960s, newer materials, such as ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are now commonplace as they are cheaper, are more durable, and require less maintenance. Multifilament gillnets are used in the fishing of Nile perch, while monofilaments are used for catching tilapiine species, including Nile tilapia. Both species were found to contain MPs in their intestinal tracts, as described in Case Study II [17]. There were only minor differences in the abundance by weight of debris sampled from the different depths, and of the six waste types identified, the proportion found at each depth did not vary to any great degree, with the exception of the bottom strata in which longlines and hooks (67%) were most abundant. Of the three ecological zones, the intermediate zone (20.1â40 m) contained most waste and is also known to have the highest levels of fishing activities; thus, within this zone, there was a reduced abundance of clothing and plastic bags. Fishing activity appears to be the major source of solid (plastic) waste in Lake Victoria, but landbased waste was not accounted for due to the inability to trawl at shallow depths (<4 m) in the nearshore. Land-based waste is often an important component of marine waste and through tidal action is transported to the lower depths of the sea [46]. However, without strong currents, this mechanism of circulating waste is ineffective within the lake environment. Nevertheless, within shallow waters, landbased waste would undoubtedly be important. While not specifically focusing on the abundance of MPs, this study demonstrates that plastic waste is present at all levels of Lake Victoria and is strongly linked to fishing activities and discarded fishing gear. Though authors do not discount other sources including land runoff and transportation of cargo, the limitations of the study do not allow these to be investigated further."

Market failure will be the rule. Moreover, climate change has a significant impact on the frequency of catastrophic events worldwide. The data from the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction show a dramatic increase in the occurrence of natural disasters, particularly of hydro-meteorological events during the last century (OECD, 2009). It is clear that not all agricultural risks are insurable:14 insurance contracts for some risks do not exist because the insurance premium covering all the costs would be prohibitive (OECD, 2009). Miranda and Glauber (1997) emphasize the need for risk to be independent among the insured, arguing that due to correlations among individual yields, crop insurers face portfolio risk that is about ten times larger than that faced by private insurers offering more conventional lines of insurance (automobile, fire, etc). And also reinsurers are reluctant to take portfolios with a probability of very large obligations. Natural disasters like the Tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2006, the earthquake in Haiti in 2008, and the recent countrywide flooding in Pakistan in 2010 are examples of catastrophic risk where market instruments break down and which call for the government, supported by the international donor community, to step in with emergency aid, disaster relief, and safety net provision.

10,220,0.988,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"In the Vilaine River area impacted by the management of the Arzal dam and its reservoir, one can say that the need to produce drinking water is paramount, and other activities related to water are placed at a second priority level. All users of water resources and local municipalities are aware that resource protection is crucial, but many of them do not want to bear the consequences of a restriction on water use in their territoryâthe ânot in my backyardâ syndrome. The need to produce drinking water is essential, but it also requires concessions. In the Arzal area, the only adjustable variable considered is the water level in the reservoir and, still, all stakeholders and managers agree on the priority to be given to the protection of water resources for producing drinking water. Trade-offs are only accepted when water scarcity becomes obvious, as in sensitive areas in the eastern sub-basins of the Vilaine River. The observations described in the previous section lead to the general conclusion that the governance context for drought adaptation policies and measures for the case of the Arzal area of the Vilaine River can be considered as moderately positive. This general conclusion is obviously relative to the observations collected during the interviews that were carried out in 2013â2014 and may evolve with time. The following matrix seeks to represent the supportive, neutral and restrictive elements of the drought governance analysis provided (Fig. 6.7)."
365,869,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Table 2 reports the estimates of the endogenous switching regression model estimated by full information maximum likelihood with clustered standard errors at the woreda level.16 The first column presents the estimation of downside risk exposure by ordinary least squares (OLS) with no switching and with a dummy variable equal to 1 if the farm household adapted to climate change, 0 otherwise. The second, third and fourth columns present, respectively, the estimated coefficients of selection Eq. (1) on climate change adaptation, and of downside risk exposure, which is represented by skewness functions (4a and 4b) (i.e., the third central moments of production function (2) in regimes (1) and (2)), for adapters and non-adapters.17 Table A3 of the appendix shows the estimation of production function (2) in regimes (1) and (2) from which we derived the third central moments.18 The estimation of Eq. (1) suggests that key drivers of farm householdsâ decision to adopt some strategies in response to long-term changes in mean temperature and rainfall are represented by the information sources farm households have access to and the environmental characteristics of the farm. More specifically access to government extension, media, and climate information increase the likelihood to adapt. These findings are very consistent with what has been found elsewhere (e.g., Maddison 2006; Deressa et al. 2009; Hassan and Nhemachena 2008; Gbetibouo et al. 2010; Deressa et al. 2011; Di Falco et al. 2011). Farm households with highly fertile soils are less likely to adapt. This highlights that most adaptation intervention is implemented in medium fertility soils. Rainfall in both rainy seasons displays U-shaped behaviour.19 In addition, we find that literacy has a positive significant effect on adaptation as well as having experienced a flood in the past. This is also consistent with what has been found by Deressa et al. (2009) and Deressa et al. (2011). It may be argued that pooling different crops can induce some bias. There"

This is particularly true for Mediterranean ecosystems, where 93 % of fire regimes are considered to be in a degraded or very degraded state (Shlisky et al. 2007). Today, farmland abandonment is driving further changes in fire regimes across Europe, particularly in Southern Europe, with potential impacts for biodiversity and ecosystem services (Mouillot et al. 2005; Bassi et al. 2008; ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2010). Where the number of ignitions is not a limiting factor, which is true in many regions under farmland abandonment (Bassi et al. 2008; Ganteaume et al. 2013), climate and fuel availability will be the main determinants of future changes to the fire regime. In high-productivity ecosystems with a high level of humidity, such as temperate broadleaved forests, fires will be limited by climate and humidity level, and less responsive to changes in fuel accumulation, since fuel is already a non-limiting factor (Pausas and Ribeiro 2013). Vegetation will be more susceptible to fire during warmer seasons following droughts, when the existing fuel is more flammable (ProenÃ§a et al. 2010; Pausas and Ribeiro 2013). In low-productivity ecosystems, such as arid Mediterranean scrublands, fuel is the main limiting factor and will be the main driver of shifts in the fire regime (Pausas and FernÃ¡ndez-MuÃ±oz 2012; Pausas and Ribeiro 2013). Recent trends in the Western Mediterranean Basin support the above predictions (Pausas and FernÃ¡ndez-MuÃ±oz 2012). In this region, fields used to be grazed, frequently burned (small scale) and cleared for farming and timber (ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2010), limiting fuel availability. The rural exodus since the mid-twentieth century led to shrub encroachment and afforestation with fireprone species, and resulted in more frequent, more intense and larger fires. Today, increased fuel load and spatial continuity are driving a shift in the fire regime, which is becoming more responsive to drought, similar to high-productivity ecosystems (Pausas and FernÃ¡ndez-MuÃ±oz 2012). In the future, the response of fire regime to changes in climatic variables, such as precipitation, is expected to be non-linear (Batllori et al. 2013): while a small decrease in annual precipitation may increase probability of fire, a large decrease may lead to the inverse response due to a drop in ecosystem productivity, leading the system back to a fuel-limited fire regime."
36,616,0.988,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"13.6.3 Education of Growers and the Public Apart from research into damage mitigation methods, there is also an urgent need to educate fruit growers and increase their awareness on the ecological and economic importance of pteropodid bats. Huang et al. (2014) found that in Sumatra, less than 20 % of coffee growers interviewed (n = 16) were aware that bats were pollinators, and none were aware that bats dispersed seeds. As demonstrated by Bumrungsri et al. (2008, 2009), pteropodids are major pollinators for some commercially important fruit trees, even when the bats may not be the most frequent visitors. In northern Queensland, P. conspicillatus plays a vital role in rainforest reproduction through pollination, and although these bats may affect the fruit industry, there has never been a full study of the economic value of flying foxes as pollinators of eucalypt hardwood forests in Australia. The majority of timber trees harvested on the east coast produce nectar and pollen only at night (P. Birt, unpublished). This means that as flying fox populations decrease, fewer timber trees will join the logging cycle. More importantly, pteropodid bats play a major role in seed dispersal. The further that a fruit is dispersed from the parent tree, the greater the chance of any resulting seedlings surviving to maturity. Fighting over feeding territories (the squabbling heard at night) leads to the loser departing with a fruit in its mouth, and consuming it at a distance. This has been termed the âraiders versus residentsâ seed dispersal model (Richards 1990), tested by McConkey and Drake (2006) in Tonga, where they showed that once numbers of flying foxes declined below a threshold where there was no conflict over feeding territories, then seed dispersal away from the parent tree ceased. Therefore, while economic estimates of fruit loss are an important first step in quantifying the problem of crop damage, a costâbenefit analysis that takes into account the positive economic impact of ecosystem services provided by the same bat species (e.g. pollination and seed dispersal to maintain healthy forests) is needed. The resulting data must be shared and communicated to growers and orchardists. They will form a crucial component in mitigating conflict, as at least one example from an Australian orchardist shows that ignorance can lead to opinions that the ecological role of flying foxes is negligible. The orchardist claimed to have seen no evidence that flying foxes are essential to forests (Bicknell 2002). This shows that in some cases, feeding on fruit crops can create a negative bias"

This can be countered, however, by observations in several places that pastoral women are gaining more opportunities, livestock marketing is more prevalent, communications have improved, and access of some populations to public services and political processes is better. And, although conflict persists, some case-study sites have seen peaceful transitions to more democratic systems of government where pastoralists are freer to make their own choices when compared to their lives under dictatorial, totalitarian regimes. It is probably most accurate to say that there has been a mix of failure and progressâperhaps with the former dominating. The process of development and change will always yield winners and losers. And some may logically argue that the proposition as to whether research and development have led to meaningful changes in developing-country rangelands is unfair. There are many arenas in the world where the progress of humanity, or lack thereof, cannot be attributed to the incremental contributions of researchers or change agents. Academics and others charged with a research mandate rarely also have a mandate to achieve real-world impact on the human subjects they study. Similarly, development agents at the forefront of change are often ill equipped or unmotivated to document impacts they observe. Much that happens therefore goes unrecorded, whether positive or negative. Achieving impact, in any case, is doubly difficult in places such as developing-country rangelands where the residents are often voiceless in their national political discourse, and the natural resources they depend upon have been regarded as having little economic value. It is difficult to promote positive change for marginalized people living on marginalized lands under the best of conditions. Despite all this, it remains quite reasonable that we can celebrate even the small steps in positive directions that have been achieved. The contributors to this chapter were polled and asked whether they felt that their work had any demonstrable impact on the people or resources in the six case-study sites. The poll results were understandably mixed. There are three instances, however, where there is clear evidence of impact from combined research and development activities. As previously noted, systemic change has also occurred in both the Altiplano and northern Mexico, but such change is very broad scaled and cannot be directly attributable to contributions from our coauthors; thus it will not be detailed further. For Afghanistan, Schloeder and Jacobs describe their conflict mitigation program that was undertaken from 2008 to 2012.44 They trained 560 leaders from 31 provinces in conflict mediation/mitigation methods; these trainees then have proceeded to resolve 3450 conflicts in both farming and herding communities along 5 major migration routes. Over half of these conflicts dealt with access and user rights to land, forage, and water; the remainder was comprised of social conflicts. About 204,600 households were positively impacted by these efforts. The ripple effect continues as of this writing, despite that the project ended in 2012."
187,50,0.988,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"human behaviors in the case of crisis, e.g. overloading communication system or collective panic reactions. In [1] it is stressed that cyber interdependency tends to become an absolute and global characteristic of all the infrastructures, while other types of interdependencies are more local. Cyber dependency potentially couples an infrastructure with every other infrastructure that uses the cyberspace, in spite of their nature, type or geographical location. A different, but similar, classiï¬cation can be found in [9] where the authors consider: Physical, Geospatial, Policy, and Informational. Using a dataset on CI disruption incidents, empirical analysis [10, 11] showed that interdependenciesâmutual dependenciesâseldomly occur. Newer analysis shows that the only interdependencies that are mentioned in press reports occur at a lower, component or subsystem, level of abstraction. No âshooting in oneâs own footâ has been observed where A depends on B, B on A, and the disruption of A causes B to get disrupted causing A not being able to recover at all as Bâs critical functions are disrupted. Using this understanding, Nieuwenhuijs et al. [6] concluded that the set of âinterdependenciesâ presented by Rinaldi et al. on 2001 needed a reassessment. They stated that the geographical interdependencies are not dependencies but they are the result of a common mode failure (e.g. astorm) and that the mentioned âinterdependenciesâ are just âdependenciesâ. Dependencies are not a binary on/off phenomenon but shall be seen as the service level of quality (or set of qualities), e.g. the triple pressure, biological purity, and chemical purity of drinking water. Only when the service level drops below the expected service level, a dependency may cause a âcascadingâ disruption in the dependent function, service, or infrastructure. The degradation and recovery characteristics for each quality are infrastructure speciï¬c functions, such as the slow loss of pressure in drinking water pipelines after the failure of the distribution grid pumps ampliï¬ed by on-going demand, and the slow system recovery as repressuring takes time. Their analysis also shows that those who analyze CI dependencies also need to take into account the mode of operation. The daily set of dependencies (normal operations) may be very different from the set of dependencies when a CI has been disrupted (stress mode of operation), the dependencies in the crisis mode of operation, and during the recovery. For instance, a hospital is not dependent on diesel fuel, diesel trucks, truck drivers and lumbermen for their normal operations. But when a big storm hits and downs power lines, the backup generator starts. When the diesel tank starts to run dry, the hospital needs to order diesel, requires diesel transport (fuel loading, truck, driver) and a road cleared from toppled trees. Alike, for recovery, one may need an extraordinary large crane to repair critical infrastructure. To identify such sets of shifting dependencies it is required the analysis of the scenarios beyond the analysis of a disruption of a single CI.

The results show that the costs of action against land degradation are lower than the costs of inaction in Russia by 5â6 times over the 30 year horizon, meaning that each dollar spent on addressing land degradation is likely to have about 5â6 dollars of returns. The costs of action were found to equal about 702 billion USD over the 30-year horizon (Fig. 18.9), whereas if nothing is done, the resulting losses may equal almost 3663 billion USD during the same period. Almost 92 % of the costs of action are made up of the opportunity costs of action. This is one of the key barriers for actions against land degradation, as the costs are tangible and may need to be borne by landusers, as well as regional and federal budgets, however, the beneï¬ts of action are not fully internalized by landusers and often not even locally, as they represent global beneï¬ts from additional ecosystem services enjoyed by the whole world. At the same time, it is also true that these restored ecosystem services and goods would beneï¬t ï¬rst and foremost the people living in these degraded areas and Russian society as whole. Figure 18.10 showed the map with several layers: costs of action over the 30-year horizon in US dollars shown per hectare and land degradation hotspots. For example, we will look at the European part of Russia. This region should show the most accurate results because of the data used and beneï¬t transfer approach. Three categories of lands might be distinguished: the ï¬rst categoryâthe degraded lands with high costs of actions; the second categoryâthe improved lands with low costs of actions; and third categoryâcross-matches of the ï¬rst and second categories. The cost of action of this category is from 2 to 11 thousand US dollars per ha. The areas are mostly concentrated in the southern part of Russia: the dig cluster consists of Astrakhan, Volgograd, Saratov, Orenburg regions. These regions are affected by soil salinity and alkalinity problems; the other cluster consists of Caucasia regions, which are affected by moderate and serve water erosion; the third cluster is Chernozem zone, where there is an intensive agricultural activity (the lands basically change into croplands); and last cluster is northern part (mainly Komi Republic)âthe area of rivers and swamps. The degraded area is situated in the basin of Pechora and Usa rivers. We link these results with hydrological conditions and type of rivers dietary habitsâmainly snow, which is not stable from year to year. It was shown that different sources come to the same results, so we can talk about land degradation in these regions with a big share of conï¬dence. The cost of action of the second category is from 0.1 to 2 thousand US dollars per ha. The area is mainly the northern border of Central Chernozem zone, where many croplands, due to different reasons, which were described in the ï¬rst part of the chapter, were changed to other categories (Fig. 18.7) and so land improvements occurred. It should be also taken into account that this area is less eroded and not affected by salinity and alkalinity as was the case in the southern part of Russia. The third category needs additional analyses on land degradation and improvement."
302,369,0.988,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Abstract The diagnosis that we are living in a world risk society formulated by Ulrich Beck 20 years ago (Beck, Kâ¬ olner Z Soziol Sozialpsychol 36:119â147, 1996) has lost nothing of its power, especially against the background of the Anthropocene debate. âGlobal risksâ have been identified which are caused by human activities, technology, and modernization processes. Microplastics are a by-product of exactly these modernization processes, being distributed globally by physical processes like ocean currents, and causing effects far from their place of origin. In recent years, the topic has gained great prominence, as microplastics have been discovered nearly everywhere in the environment, raising questions about the impacts on food for human consumption. But are microplastics really a new phenomenon or rather a symptom of an old problem? And exactly what risks are involved? It seems that the phenomenon has accelerated political actionâthe USA has passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015âand industries have pledged to fade out the use of microbeads in their cosmetic products. At first sight, is it a success for environmentalists and the protection of our planet? This chapter deals with these questions by adopting a social-ecological perspective, discussing microplastics as a global risk. Taking four main characteristics of global risks, we develop four arguments to discuss (a) the everyday production of risk by societies, (b) scientific risk evaluation of microplastics, (c) social responses, and (d) problems of risk management. To illustrate these four issues, we draw on different aspects of the current scientific and public debate. In doing so, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the social-ecological implications of microplastics."
165,270,0.988,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"that are small in size. The good news is that S will reliably detect residential separation between two groups so long as the spatial units used in the research design are appropriate for the analysis. In the cases just examined, block data readily revealed patterns of segregation even when some of the groups in the segregation comparisons were very small in overall population size. Block data were once widely used in segregation analysis including most notably the landmark study by Taeuber and Taeuber (1965) and dozens of studies that used and supplemented these measures (e.g., Schnore and Evenson 1966; Roof 1972; Roof and Van Valey 1972; Sorenson et al. 1975). But in recent decades, with only occasional exceptions such as Lichter and colleagues (2010) and Allen and Turner (2012), segregation studies have relied primarily on tract-level data. The examples reviewed above highlight how the practice of using larger spatial units such as tracts and even block groups can limit the potential scope of segregation studies by creating problems for assessing residential separation between groups when one group is small. This sometimes is mistakenly viewed as a problem inherent in the indices themselves. Indeed, some have raised concerns that the separation index will ânecessarilyâ yield low values when segregation involves small groups. The examples just reviewed show this view is mistaken on two counts. First, to the extent that there is a problem, it is not limited to the separation index; it applies to all popular indices of uneven distribution. Second, the problem is not inherent in the indices; the problem is with basic features of research design in failing to use spatial units appropriate for obtaining valid assessments of segregation. The analyses just reviewed demonstrate that both D and S can yield misleading low values when computed using tract-level and block group-level data but will correctly signal the presence of substantial segregation when computed using block-level data. This suggests that studies should use block-level data to guard against the problem. But as noted above this practice has become uncommon. The prevailing use of tract-level data is partly due to the fact that census tabulations for tracts provide more detailed breakdowns of population groups. But another important factor is that methodological studies have noted problems that can arise when measuring segregation using small spatial units. Taeuber and Taeuberâs thorough discussion of issues in segregation measurement (1965: Appendix 1) noted one reason. It is that it can be difficult or even impossible to achieve even distribution with small areas and small groups because populations are distributed in indivisible, whole number âclumpsâ associated with individuals, families, and households, not fractional parts, and this makes it difficult to exactly reproduce city-wide racial proportions in small areas. Winship (1977) pointed out a second reason that has been seen as more important. It is that indices measuring uneven distribution are inherently susceptible to undesirable, non-negligible upward bias when segregation is assessed using small spatial units. The potential undesirable impact of both factors is more consequential for D than for S. But it is an important concern and, accordingly, I review it at length in analyses I present in Chaps. 14, 15 and 16. I save the details of that discussion for later. For now, I note that the new methods introduced in this monograph make it possible to identify the underlying basis for the problem of index bias and introduce new versions of popular indices that eliminate undesirable impact of bias while retaining"
365,513,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"distribution of rainfall are quite uncertain, with no clear agreement among climate models on whether rainfall would rise or fall. The combination of changes in temperature and precipitation shows biophysical impacts that can have significant consequences for the agriculture and related water sector. The likely negative impacts of climate change on rainfed agriculture and the increased uncertainty about water resources available in the future make it essential to consider climate change into agricultural sector planning. Indeed agriculture will mainly be affected by loss of yields for the main crops (cassava, millet, yam, maize, sorghum, and rice), even if precipitation increases in several parts of the country. The effects are fairly clear in the longer term but somehow more ambiguous in the shorter term (2020) when, according to more than half of the climate models, cassava, and perhaps other crops, might actually experience an increase in productivity. The projected decline in rainfed yields along with projected rises in temperature might ultimately reduce food security. It is projected that half of Nigeriaâs agroecological zones will be food insecure by 2020 and 75% by 2050 unless their diminishing local food production is complemented by improved in-country trade or more imports. Impacts on water resources are more uncertain, but it looks very likely that availability of water for storage and use will be different from the past. In particular, our analysis suggests that, by 2050, in only 23% of the country the hydrological regime will remain stable. In the rest of the country, the hydrology of the future will be very different than today, with 50% of the country expected to have higher runoff than the historical average, 10% of the country projected to be exposed to drier conditions, and 33% of total land area will be uncertain as climate models disagree so much that is difficult to define where runoff will increase or decrease. The decline in crop yields will have significant consequences also for the national economy, by 2050 reducing GDP (compared to the no-climate change scenario) by up to 4.5%. Climate change is also projected to increase net import of various crops, particularly rice and other cereals. The major policy implication of our analysis is that ignoring the effects of climate change in the design of agriculture policies, programs and projects would have dire consequences on the sectorâs development prospects, and indeed on the countryâs overall growth. At the same time, because of large uncertainties on the magnitude, speed and, in the case of precipitation, even direction of change, there is no silver bullet to consider in the design of climate change adaptation interventions. In fact, selecting the wrong adaptation response to climate change may have costs as large as not adapting at all. In the case of the rainfed agriculture, the adoption of certain adaptation technologies (e.g. the shift in sowing date) may turn out be illsuited for some crops or agro-ecological regions, and result in a net decline in yields, rather than reducing climate change impacts. Similarly, development of irrigation schemes may lead to wrong-sizing of the amount of storage or irrigated area, both if climate change is ignored, and if a single scenario of climate change is arbitrarily selected (instead of considering the full range of possible outcomes)."
110,261,0.988,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"similar patterns and characteristics of doing business. One characteristic is the high degree of informality as small farmers and enterprises are usually not registered. Household and enterprise activities are not separated. They are characterized by low levels of education and financial literacy. They rarely keep books of accounts and only few are able to produce financial statements. Most household enterprises do not have assets that could be pledged as collateral for loans from financial institutions. For such businesses, credit institutions are exposed to significant information and monitoring problems. This is due to asymmetric information that exists when one party to a transaction (a lender) has less information than the other party (the borrower), and the resulting problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. Borrower screening and selection pose a tremendous challenge in such a situation. Finally, poor legal frameworks and systems create enormous enforcement problems. On top of all this, the poor state of the physical infrastructure (roads, electricity, telecommunication, etc.) in rural areas in many parts of the world further increases the risk and the cost for rural financial institutions. Arguably, it is these principal credit risks that have prevented formal financial institutions from providing financial services and have resulted in financial exclusion of large parts of the society. This exclusion applies to micro and small enterprises and small farmers alike. 2.3 Specific Risks in Agriculture Specific risks in agricultural finance mainly comprise production risk, on the one hand, and market and price risk, on the other hand. Financial institutions around the globe seem to be reluctant to finance agriculture particularly because of the perceived prevalence of these two types of risks. Production Risk Production risk in agriculture arises from the high variability of production outcomes. Unlike most other entrepreneurs, farmers cannot predict with certainty the amount of output their production process will yield, because of external factors such as weather, pests, diseases, and other natural calamities. Such events are higher for farmers engaged in monoculture of crops that are particularly sensitive to the correct use of high-quality inputs or the timing of harvesting. Production risk in agriculture can also be traced to farmers seeking to increase their incomes through higher-risk, higher-return cropping strategies (Christen and Pearce 2005, p.2). The production of most high-yielding crops is relatively complex, involving careful timing of numerous stepsâ from preparing land through planting, fertilizing, and harvesting. Mistakes or delays at any step can substantially reduce returnsâor eliminate them altogether. Moreover, climate change is regarded as steadily increasing the production risk (OECD, 2009)."
183,343,0.988,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"early actions are the best to prevent loss of lives and to protect livelihoods andâafter the disaster has hitâwhich response actions to take. Decision-making in the preparedness and response phase should be based on factual data about the needs on the ground, but is in reality a highly political process. For example, damage and needs assessments are competitive and difficult processes as agencies continue to see information on the impact of a disaster as something to be âownedâ in order to leverage resources and influence rather than as something to be shared (Walton-Ellery and Rashid 2012). Responders also face âhigh levels of uncertainty, extreme stress with significant consequences of actions, compressed timelines and significant lack of information available initially followed by extreme information overloadâ (Preece et al. 2013). In the case of Typhoon Haiyan, for example, those responding considered the multitude of different information sources and formats generally as an information overload (Comes et al. 2013). Responders will have different degrees of data literacy and cognitive abilities to deal with these circumstances and to make sense of the data and information that is available and accessible to them. The degree of collective sensemaking that is reached among responders is another important factor in decision-making between and within organizations (Wolbers and Boersma 2013). Important in sensemaking is having reliable, accurate, and timely data. Getting such data right after a sudden onset disaster is challenging given the chaotic and disrupted situation. In the case of floods in Bangladesh, the working group on Disaster Emergency Response (part of the Local Consultative Group that coordinates between the Government of Bangladesh and the different development partners) established a Joint Needs Assessment project in 2014. The Joint Needs Assessment project started a large survey to collect data in the field given the absence of consistent, comparable information across the affected area, whereby they had to trade-off between time, quality, granularity, and available resources (Wahed et al. 2014). Harmonizing and coordinating the different assessments organizations are doing is a difficult task and heterogeneity issues in the data sets that come out of the assessments are most commonly unavoidable. Given these data-related challenges, it is evident that responders face information gaps. Whether it is not having enough information at the very onset of a disaster or whether it is having too much information later in the disaster; in both cases, their information needs are not adequately covered. These gaps will be more articulate in developing countriesâoften data poor and low techâthan in developed countries."
10,331,0.988,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Following Contextual Interaction Theory such a generally supportive governance context is expected to have positive consequences for the motivation, cognitions and resources of the actors involved in the process of implementing drought resilience measures. What we did observe is a varying and on average moderate, but also growing degree of draught awareness among the actors. This also positively influenced their motivation. Of course there is here a strong pre-selection effect: while all measures are taken voluntarily it is no surprise to see predominantly positive motivations. On the other hand: also with previously sceptic actors like the agricultural organization positive developments are observable. The resources of the actors made available for drought resilience measures and to push and pull to get them accepted are generally sufï¬cient, with the exception of the withdrawal of the national government from the support for nature development and the national landscape park that has made things more difï¬cult. On the positive side, the provincial government has compensated this loss to a large degree, indicating its preparedness to contribute. All in all this has led to an implementation process with a remarkable degree of collaboration. When we look more speciï¬cally into the three actor characteristics of Contextual Interaction Theory we see the following. The motivation of the stakeholders working to act on drought is triggered to large extent by their own goals and values. In a dense country such as the Netherlands, the last remnants of nature are seen as especially precious. In addition, desiccation is considered one of the major environmental policy themes in the Dutch government for several decades now. The local water authority views cultivating drought resilience for the area as its own responsibility. Also nature organizations and more and more farmers are aware of the implications of drought and water scarcity, including loss of flora and fauna in creeks and crop losses. For the province also the external pressure of European policies is very relevant. Low self-effectiveness assessment on top-down regulation of preparatory measures limits the scope of instruments to voluntary ones. The cognitions of actors are mainly driven by observations on the changes of the regional water balance. The visibility of drought issues has increased in the region, with creeks running dry as well as dry vegetation. Damages from droughts are affecting agricultural yields in rural areas. Cities and their urban infrastructure are also affected by drought, which in leads to a change in awareness and perception. In contrast to the strong legal requirements behind nature conservation in the Netherlands there are limited resources for the nature organizations to combat drought issues themselves. Their key competencies are rather limited. Other actors,"

The role of the Dutch Wadden Sea as a nursery area seems to have changed considerably, a pattern which is most prominent in plaice but also apparent in some other flatï¬sh species. The densities of 0-year old plaice have strongly reduced since the mid-1980s to a stable and low level that has not changed since 2000. The period in which they use the area has also changed: instead of staying from early spring until October, they now tend to disappear in July/August. The 1- and 2-year olds have disappeared completely since the end of the 20th century. Although several mechanisms may be operating, climate change is a likely cause of these alterations. Using dynamic energy budgets, Teal et al. (2012) showed that the most likely explanation for the recent loss of the nursery function, especially for plaice, is that increased temperatures make coastal areas unsuitable for growth. Growth rate data for 0-year old plaice showed that recent higher summer temperatures result in metabolic activity raised to levels at which food becomes limiting (Teal et al. 2008). In contrast to the decline observed in overall biomass, dominated by marine juveniles, the resident species show an increase followed by a stable period in the coastal area. However, understanding of the mechanisms acting on the different resident species is still very limited. One exception is the discovery that the decline observed in eelpout Zoarces vivparus in the Wadden Sea since 1985 is due to an increase in temperature above the thermal maximum of the species, causing thermally limited oxygen delivery (PÃ¶rtner and Knust 2007). Thus, the mechanisms underlying the large changes observed in the ï¬sh fauna of the Wadden Sea are still largely unknown. They are certainly partly climate related, but the impacts of changes in food, predators and abiotic factors acting on the different life stages are still poorly understood (Rijnsdorp et al. 2009)."

We acknowledgee that: â¢ Landslide disasters are caused by exposure to hazardous motions of soil and rock that threaten vulnerable human settlements in mountains, cities, coasts, and islands. â¢ Climate change will intensify the risk of landslides in some landslide-prone areas through an increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of heavy rainfall, and shifts in the location and periodicity of heavy rainfall. â¢ Developments in mountains and coastal areas, including construction of roads and railways and expansion of urban areas due to population shifts, increase exposure to hazards of landslides. â¢ Although they are not frequent, strong earthquakes have potential to trigger rapid and long-runout landslides and liquefaction. Earthquake-induced coastal or submarine large-scale landslides or megaslides (with depths on the order of hundreds of meters to one thousand meters) in the ocean floor can trigger large tsunami waves. These hazardous motions of soil and water impacting on exposed and vulnerable population can result into very damaging effects. â¢ The combined effects of triggering factors, including rainfall, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, can lead to greater impacts through disastrous landslides such as lahars, debris flows, rock falls, and megaslides. â¢ Understanding landslide disaster risk requires a multi-hazard approach and a focus on social and institutional vulnerability. The study of social and institutional as well as physical vulnerability is needed to assess the extent and magnitude of landslide disasters and to guide formulation of effective policy responses. â¢ Human intervention can make a greater impact on exposure and vulnerability through, among other factors, land use and urban planning, building codes, risk assessments, early"

The effects of this conflict are devastating for all concerned. â¢ Stock mortality with radical herd decline initiated a major exit of northern villagers toward Lake Turkana. Most household heads in the upland plains region knew of at least one or two nearby villages whose residents had already departed for the lake. A few said that they too were considering moving in that direction, as well. (Some village heads indicated that they might instead move to a town in order to increase their chances of receiving food aid.) â¢ Food and other essentials available in local markets are priced beyond the reach of most householdsâeven those fortunate enough to generate income from household/village based commodity production. â¢ Internal social problems accompanying such economic stress are also on the increase. Many elders flatly state that they no longer have authority over the actions of their young men and that such problems are a radical departure from earlier times. The decline of customary traditional authority relations most likely results from a combination of influences including government administrative systems imposed on the Turkana, economic disenfranchisement and displacement of communities, access to weapons (providing young Turkana men with a new sense of power and independence), and privatization of Turkana lands and resource âcommonsâ."

But what does this mainstream narrative tell? What realities deï¬ne how the mainstream thinks about Alzheimerâs? And how does all this relate to my encounter? Alzheimerâs disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly. In view of major demographic changes, it has reached epidemic proportions in the developed world during the last thirty years. More than twenty-six million people suffer worldwide â 1.5 percent of the American population, 1.2 percent of the UK population, and by the year 2050 this number is expected to triple. The condition presents as an early as well as the more well-known late-onset form. Patients afï¬icted by the early-onset form are as young as forty-ï¬ve when they are diagnosed, and account for approximately two percent of Alzheimerâs patients. Late-onset Alzheimerâs disease, in turn, is deï¬ned as afï¬icting individuals aged sixtyï¬ve years or older. Patients face memory loss, an impaired ability to understand or produce speech and an inability to recognise things or people. Most of all, they are aware that their mental acuity continually declines, and their perception of themselves as individual persons disappears in a relentless process of brain atrophy.3 Regardless of their age of onset, patients usually have ï¬ve to ten years between diagnosis and death. During this period, they pass through different stages of the condition, with early stages still allowing for the patientâs articulation. Later stages strongly limit intellectual performance, making the patient dependent on caregiving in almost all activities of daily life. Drugs are currently only of limited symptomatic effect.

365,837,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"One consequence of climate change in sub Saharan Africa is that farmers will be more exposed to environmental risk. More erratic and scarce rainfall and higher temperature imply that farmers will face greater uncertainty. Ethiopia is a prime example in that rainfall variability and associated drought have been major causes of food shortage and famine. During the last 40 years, Ethiopia has experienced many severe droughts leading to production levels that fell short of basic subsistence levels for many farm households (Relief Society of Tigray, REST and NORAGRIC at the Agricultural University of Norway 1995, p. 137). Harvest failure due to weather events is the most important cause of risk-related hardship of Ethiopian rural households, with adverse effects on farm household consumption and welfare (Dercon 2004, 2005). Climate change is projected to further exacerbate these issues (Parry et al. 2005; Lobell et al. 2008; Schlenker and Lobell 2010; World Bank 2010). Thus, the implementation of adaptation strategies can be very important (Mendelsohn and Dinar 2003; Deressa et al. 2009; Di Falco and Veronesi 2013). For instance, farmers may face drier soil, and therefore they implement investments in soil conservation so that soil moisture may be retained. They can plant trees to procure shading on the soil or utilize irrigation and water harvesting technologies (Kurukulasuriya et al. 2011). They can also simply switch to different crops or activities that are more suited to drier or wetter environmental conditions (Seo and Mendelsohn 2008a).1 This paper uses survey data from the Nile basin of Ethiopia (IFPRI 2010) to investigate whether having adapted to climate change, defined as having implemented a set of strategies such as changing crop varieties, adopting water harvesting or soil and water conservation in response to long-term changes temperature and rainfall, affects current environmental risk exposure. In particular, we pose the following questions: 1. Are farm households that in the past implemented climate change adaptation strategies getting benefits in terms of a reduction in current risk exposure? 2. Are there significant differences in risk exposure between farm households that did and those that did not adapt to climate change? 3. Is climate change adaptation a successful risk management strategy that makes the adapters more resilient to current environmental risk? The Nile basin of Ethiopia provides a relevant area to address these issues for a number of reasons. This is a very large area that covers about 34% of the total geographical area and almost 40% of the population of the entire country (Deressa et al. 2009). Farming is characterized by small-holder subsistence farmers. Farm size is on average quite small (less than one hectare). Production is traditional with plough"
364,228,0.988,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Food systems and food security are greatly affected by environmental changes such as land degradation, loss of biodiversity, and alteration in hydrology or climate patterns. These changes may be either natural or anthropogenic in origin, although it is the alterations of anthropogenic origin that contribute most to environmental change. Food systems include activities such as food production, processing, packaging, and distribution and retailing. They are complex systems influenced by environmental, social, and economic factors, and they link directly with policy and public health issues. Currently, the accepted definition of food security as defined by the International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) is âaccess by all people at all times to the food needed for a healthy life,â [FAO/WHO 1992a, as cited by the Committee on World Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization (Food and Agriculture Organization-Food and Nutrition Division and Publishing Management 1997)]. Food insecurity, on the other hand, is defined as lack of access to enough food for a healthy and active life. According to a definition that had its origins in the 1970s, however, food security refers to the availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability of food supplies (Stamoulis and Zezza 2003, as cited in Springer Editorial 2009). Food availability is often associated with climatic changes that can affect the agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry sectors. Accessibility, however, depends on the knowledge and resources of households themselves. Such knowledge and resources include strategies utilized by households for food acquisition, that is, their ability to produce food and exchange assets for food. The strategies may include borrowing money, selling assets, or engaging in wage labor to provide food for the family. While neither rural nor urban households are spared from food insecurity, especially during seasonal troughs, the former are able to produce their own food, while the latter purchase most of their foods. The urban households are therefore more affected by food insecurity, especially if jobs are lost, incomes fall, and food prices increase. In terms of utilization, women are usually responsible for food procurement, preparation, and storage, especially in rural areas. Stability of food supply, meanwhile, is defined by use of a set of strategies to cope with both major and minor stresses. Communities that live in stressful environments, in particular, have developed strategies to reduce the impact of environmental stresses on household food security in the short- and/or long term. An important strategy is protection of the resource base through production practices that do not damage the environment to the detriment of the agriculture, fishery, and forestry sectors. An example would be changing cropping systems to increase farm productivity. Another coping strategy is to ensure that the procurement of food does not lead to the loss of a householdâs capacity to produce using its assets such as land, equipment, and farm animals. The issue of risks to food security from environmental degradation is of major importance, because the poor are the ones most affected. In rural areas where a high incidence of poverty exists, the rural poor are forced to cultivate fragile and marginal lands causing soil erosion. This renders them very vulnerable to environmental"

Many pathways were created idealistically, but rigid interpretation means that they can become associated with unthinking, mechanistic practice that can detract from individual, person-centred care, demotivate staff and stiï¬e creativity. Top-down monitoring means that it is difï¬cult for staff to deviate from pathways deemed to be correct, even if they do not ï¬t with an individualâs care needs (Department of Health 2013).

Other difï¬culties identiï¬ed by AEGIS related to overcrowding and understafï¬ng, problems that reemerge in modiï¬ed forms. Today the NHS has fewer beds, associated with rapid throughput, with some patients being discharged before they are sufï¬ciently well. This is less visible than excessive numbers of beds on a ward but is nevertheless a pernicious form of overcrowding, in time rather than in space. In particular, managers take pride in rapid patient throughput and may assume incorrectly that discharge indicates adequate and effective treatment in a shorter time, and therefore a lower ï¬nancial cost. If stafï¬ng levels have not increased in line with the demands caused by shorter admissions, staff under pressure may work too fast for the patientâs comfort, with insufï¬cient time to give patients explanations for the care or treatment they require. Staff may inadvertently tolerate rough handling, undigniï¬ed and untherapeutic care, and cause patients unnecessary distress. A report from the public services trades union UNISON (2015, p. 7) commented on dangerously low ward stafï¬ng levels associated with management inaction, and it highlighted complacency about achieving satisfactory standards. UNISON stated: â62% of respondents who had had a nursing âred-ï¬agâ [unsafe stafï¬ng level] event occur on their ward said that the ward was not immediately allocated additional staff.â Not only was the âred-ï¬agâ unremedied, but managersâ unresponsiveness linked to the risk of future underreporting of difï¬culties because staff lacked conï¬dence that the process would achieve the desired outcome. This risks inadequacies being accepted as normal, irremediable or âthe best under the circumstancesâ, linking to low standards, as happened in the psychiatric hospitals. Today, most care homes are small, modern and well equipped, and facilities suggest that residents receive digniï¬ed care. As the scandals of Farleigh and South Ockendon demonstrated, the size and the modernity of the buildings did not relate to the standards within them. The physical"

These all represent major obstacles to the effective control of marine litter. For instance, the UNEP (2009) pointed out that at the national level, only the Wider Caribbean and Northwest Pacific regions have countries with specific national legislation addressing marine litter. The revised MARPOL Annex V has not yet been transposed into national law in countries such as Germany (UBA 2013) and thus there is no legal footing to implement this revised Annex V at the national level. The IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) shows that there are numerous reported cases of alleged inadequacy of reception facilities.47 In the US, as of 1995, <10 % of cases put to trial under MARPOL Annex V have resulted in penalties48 and each of the penalized cases was fined an average of â¬4,560, an amount far too low to serve as a deterrent (Gold et al. 2013). In Taiwan, no penalties exist for the violation of the Annex V. The EU PRF Directive is vague at defining the fee/cost recovery system. The transposition of the directive into national legislation leaves room for different solutions on how to introduce incentives for waste delivery at ports. The use of different waste-fee systems by EU ports creates confusion among ship owners and operators (EMSA 2012; ÃhlenschlÃ¦ger et al. 2013). â¢ Poor cooperation and insufficient participation of states in international/regional initiatives Despite the fact that numerous international and regional initiatives already exist and provide a platform for cooperation and coordination of marine debris issues, a few cases indicate that cooperative action on marine litter has lagged behind, or the participation of states in these initiatives was insufficient. This would leave a loophole in the global/regional efforts, given the fact that marine debris is a transboundary issue. For example, there are no legal instruments in place dedicated to the management of marine litter as yet in the Black Sea, even though the Bucharest Convention49 contains several articles pertaining to marine debris (Interwies et al. 2013). Some regional seas do not even participate in the UNEP Global Initiative, such as west central and southern Africa, northeast Pacific, Pacific and the ROPME50 sea area (UNEP 2009). Countries bordering these regional seas might lack appropriate waste-management schemes because of economic constraints, although a number of African countries have recently banned the use of plastic bags."
347,367,0.988,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Finally, in the case of eutrophication, while the basic causes of nutrient leakage are easily identified, the ecosystem and resulting socio-economic effects are far more complex and long-lasting. The difficulty to transform, for example, agricultural production around the Baltic Sea, a dominating source of nutrient leakage, to generally lower levels of nutrient loss, taken together with the strong resistance to do so amongst many farmers and their organisations, makes environmental governance in this case very difficult. This is further complicated by a set of other leakage sources and ambiguity concerning which measures would be most cost effective. Present policies in the EU, HELCOM and individual nation states are far from sufficient to steer development steadily towards agreed targets, which points out a need for both immediate policy-making and longer-term deep reform in the sectors contributing to the problems, as well as in society at large. In the near future, as we see it, pricing externalities in line with the polluter pays principle set out in the EU treaty (meaning, e.g. environmental taxes on fertilisers) and reforming subsidies, steering away from incentivising production not compatible with agreed environmental targets, are examples of potential measures. In the longer run, we consider that deep reforms of agricultural systems might be needed, for example, by improved spatial coordination of crop production and husbandry in order to better control flows of nutrients. At the same time, several of these potential reforms may require an increased willingness to pay amongst consumers for environmental measures in food production. Evidently, the proposals that we have identified above are not described and evaluated in any detail, and before adopting or implementing such policies and processes, potential consequences should be investigated, whether nationally, in the EU or within HELCOM. We believe though that the ideas presented are motivated to such an extent that they will stimulate discussion and further analysis and studies. In the next section, we zoom out from the specific cases and take a look at governance issues on more of a system level."

Driven by the rediscovery of long forgotten, 1970s studies on the occurrence of small plastic fragments (today termed microplastics) in the oceans, oceanographers and marine biologists resurrected the topic in the early 2000s. Since then, the field has rapidly expanded and established that plastics are ubiquitous in the marine system, from the Arctic to Antarctic and from the surface to the deep sea. While obviously the sources of environmental plastics are land-based, much less research has been dedicated to investigating them in freshwater systems. At the time of writing this book, less than four percent of publications had a freshwater context, reflecting the idea that streams, rivers, and lakes are mere transport routes transferring plastics to the oceans similar to a sewer. Because this is too simplistic, this book is dedicated to the in-between. Our authors explore the state of the science, including the major advances and challenges, with regard to the sources, fate, abundance, and impacts of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems. Despite the many gaps in our knowledge, we highlight that microplastics are pollutants of emerging concern independent of the salinity of the surrounding medium. Environmental (micro)plastics are what some call a wicked problem, i.e., there is considerable complexity involved when one tries to understand the impact of these synthetic materials on the natural world. Just as an example, there is no such thing as âthe microplastic.â Currently, there are in commerce more than 5,300 grades of synthetic polymers.1 Their heterogeneous physico-chemical properties will likely result in very heterogeneous fates and effects once they enter the According to the plastics industryâs information system CAMPUS (http://www.campusplastics. com, last visited on June 20, 2017)."
365,683,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The substitution of one species of livestock for another is one strategy that livestock farmers can use to increase their resilience to climatic and economic shocks. There are various mechanisms by which this can occur: risk can be spread by having a more diverse species portfolio, and for a farm with small stock, it will often be easier to shift between small stock species than between larger, less âliquidâ stock. The last several decades have seen species substitution in several parts of Africa, as a result of long- and/or short-term climate and vegetation changes. In parts of the Sahel, dromedaries have replaced cattle and goats have replaced sheep, in the wake of the droughts of the 1980s (Hoffmann 2010). In Ethiopia, smallholders are adopting goats and sheep rather than cattle in response to market opportunities: there is strong urban demand for meat, it is easier to sell small animals, and profits accrue more quickly and are generally less risky. Traditional cattle keepers in parts of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia have adopted camels as part of their livelihood strategy as a result of drought, cattle raiding and epizootics. More widespread adoption of camels and goats in the drylands of Africa is now being observed in many other places â unlike cattle and sheep, browsers feed on shrubs and trees, and browse may be a relatively plentiful feed resource even in situations where herbaceous feed availability is declining. Livestock species substitution may also arise from considerations of GHG emissions, given that there are considerable differences in emissions and emission intensities between ruminant livestock production systems and monogastric systems producing chickens and pigs, for example (Hoffmann 2010). Livestock species substitution will no doubt continue to occur, and it is clear that these substitutions can deliver various benefits: enhancing resilience, maintaining or increasing productivity in the face of shocks, and mitigating GHG emissions. There is little evidence, however, of how the synergies and trade-offs may play out in the mixed crop-livestock systems, particularly through time: while there may be long-term benefits of species substitution, there are likely to be short-term costs and challenges associated with species switching that smallholders may be unwilling or unable to address (FAO 2013). The challenges revolve around the capital outlays involved, and the lack of technical know-how needed to manage unfamiliar livestock species."

Interestingly, their cross-correlation analyses suggest the propagation of a climate signal from SST through decapod larvae, adult crabs and lesser black-backed gulls with lags that match the biology of each trophic group. This is indicative of climate-induced changes in the marine fauna extending to the avian fauna, and thus to the terrestrial food web around the seabird colonies (Luczak et al. 2012). Case Study 5: Vulnerability of the seabird community in the western North Sea to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Most seabird studies have tended to consider the impacts of single stressors on single species at speciï¬c times of the year, and so may be unrepresentative of the combined effects of pressures experienced by top predator communities over an annual cycle (Burthe et al. 2014). For marine top predators, there is evidence to suggest that interactions between climate and other threats may be additive (Frederiksen et al. 2004b; Burthe et al. 2014). Burthe et al. (2014) studied the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a community of seabirds in the North Sea. More precisely, they examined vulnerability to climate change and other anthropogenic threats in a seabird community (45 species; 11 families) that used the Forth and Tay region (eastern Scotland) of the North Sea for breeding, overwintering or migration between 1980 and 2011. They found only 13 % of the seabird community in the Forth and Tay region to fall within the categories of low or very low population concern to future warming, whereas in considering multiple anthropogenic threats 73 % of the species in this bird community were considered to be of high or very high population concern for the future (Burthe et al. 2014). Case Study 6: Effects of extreme climatic events on coastal birds breeding in low-lying saltmarshes (for a more extensive review see Chap. 9). Van de Pol et al. (2010) investigated whether the frequency, magnitude and timing of rare but catastrophic flooding events have changed over time in Europeâs largest estuary, the Wadden Sea. They subsequently quantiï¬ed how this had affected the flooding risk of six saltmarsh nesting bird species (both seabird species and coastal species). Maximum high tide has increased twice as fast as mean high tide over the past four decades, resulting in more frequent and more catastrophic flooding of nests, especially around the time when most eggs have just hatched. By using data on speciesâ nest elevations, on the timing of egg-laying and on the length of time that the eggs and chicks are at risk from flooding, van de Pol et al. (2010) showed that flood risk increased for all six species (even after accounting for compensatory land accretion) and that this could worsen in the near future if the species do not adapt. This study provides the ï¬rst evidence that increasing flooding risks have reduced the reproductive output below stable population levels in at least one species, the Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus.

376,345,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","A reduction in access to key resource areas would cause livestock numbers to decline over the course of several years, especially during drought periods. In contrast, an abundance of non-key resources is likely to occur during the wet season, because animal numbers have been reduced by a scarcity of, and competition for, high-quality forage during the dry season. This interpretation establishes that livestock are closely coupled to forage resources, for at least part of the year, to meet their energy and nutrient requirements for survival, growth, and reproduction. This interpretation has been experimentally corroborated in a pastoral system located in an arid and highly stochastic environment (Hempson et al. 2015). In this investigation, livestock body condition followed density-dependent depletion of the limited dry-season riverine vegetation (key resources), and annual demographic parameters of animal populations tracked dry-season conditions. Dry-season length and previous population size were the main determinants of the animal population trajectory, with no clear evidence for an effect of growing season conditions over the vast area accessible to them. Therefore, wet-season rangeland can be categorized as nonequilibrium, because animal populations are only loosely coupled with it, but livestock do exist in equilibrium with dry-season resources. Implications to Grazing Management. Reinterpretation of the NEP model has several important implications for management of livestock grazing. It indicates that the potential for grazing to modify vegetation and potentially degrade rangeland resources during the wet season increases as the proportion of key dryseason resource areas increases because it is these resources that establish the maximum number of livestock supported over the long term. Consequently, a high ratio of key dry:wet-season resources could support livestock numbers which are sufficient to produce high grazing intensities on wet-season resources, even though they may not be in equilibrium with them. Key resource areas themselves are obviously of considerable importance, and since they represent an equilibrial part of the grazed ecosystem they generally respond to increasing grazing intensity through reduced productivity and altered species composition (von Wehrden et al. 2012; Muthoni et al. 2014). These negative vegetation impacts will likely have direct, negative feedbacks on animal populations as described by traditional grazing management. Commercial ranching represents a situation where livestock are often provided with supplemental feed during the dry or winter season to minimize animal mortality and weight loss. In these cases, livestock numbers would become uncoupled from both wet- and dry-season resources because grazing intensity is determined by animal numbers maintained by supplemental feeding. The maintenance of high livestock numbers during these periods increases the potential to adversely impact vegetation during the growing season and it reduces the opportunity for vegetation recovery following drought compared with less intensively managed systems. In principle, this interpretation would also apply to wild herbivores that migrate from wet-season (summer) resources to dry-season resources during the winter and then return to wet-season resources. Vegetation on summer range would be impacted to the extent that resource availability in winter range can support total animal numbers."

However in practice, reducing the geographic scale of the index too much leads to issues related to moral hazard, i.e. the fear that households may become able to manipulate the index. Finally, for products which do not aim to cover all types of shocks (such as insurance products based on a rainfall index), an additional source of low quality arise from uncovered covariate risks (e.g., locusts, tsunamis). This type of error is related to the traditional distinction between single-peril and multiple-peril insurance products, but the difference is not as clear in the case of index insurance: satellite-based products such as IBLI, for instance, are supposed to cover all types of shocks related to lack of forage- including increase in livestock diseases- but cannot detect shocks which are not related to the ground vegetation- such as a new epidemic affecting well-fed livestock. These uncovered covariate risks further decrease the quality of the protection offered to poor households. Of course, households may be still interested in affordable index insurance products which only protects from one type of shock (e.g. drought), but the overall protection provided by this type of product has to be carefully analyzed and put in perspective with the price of the product and the probability that a farmer is made worse off with the insurance than without it.12 The lack of a strong negative correlation between the insurance indemnities and income shocks due to yield losses will result in a low demand for the insurance product (Clarke 2016; Smith and Watts 2009). Low correlation will not only fail to protect farmers, but eventually seriously damage livelihoods, because poor households pay high premiums to purchase protection, and plan on being protected when making investment decisions. Thus, a detailed analysis of the sources of errors needs to be conducted before implementing an index-based insurance and after its implementation, in order to rule out low quality products and pave the road for future product improvements. While this type of analysis is rarely undertaken in practice, IBLI is one of the most studied index insurance programs, and its quality has been closely scrutinized before and after implementation."

In many cases there is a difference between the actual acceptance of risks and the normatively expected acceptance, i.e. the acceptability of the risks [8, 9]. While acceptance rests with the individual, acceptability raises a host of ethical questions: Why and under what conditions can one legitimately impose risks on other people (Chap. 4)? The question gains yet more urgency when the potentially affected are neither informed of the risks nor have the chance to give their consent, e.g. in the case of risks for future generations. The objective of the ethics of risk [11] is a normative evaluation of the acceptability and justiï¬ability of risks in light of the empirical knowledge about the type and severity of the harm, the probability of its occurrence and resilience (capacity for resistance) and in relation to a speciï¬c risk constellation.2"
349,290,0.988,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"Assumption of Stable Conditions Most SOM dynamic models assume stable conditions in SOM pools prior to modeling how factors like management or climate change affect their dynamics. However, the vast majority of small household systems in the tropics are not necessarily in steady state conditions. In the tropics, large tracts of land under current agricultural practices have been covered by natural ecosystems not much longer than a generation ago, but in many cases this would only be a few decades or even just some years ago (Houghton 1994; FAO and JRC 2012). Because of this, current SOM dynamics will still be highly influenced by past vegetation. Therefore, the assumption of stable conditions in those systems is likely to result in gross inaccuracies. While the influence of past vegetation might of course be modeled, this would be done at the expense of bringing on further uncertainty to the results, as this impact is likely to vary with the type of vegetation, time since conversion, landscape position, soil type, etc."
222,607,0.988,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This SES takes into account the people living directly adjacent to the Sundarbans mangrove forest. People fish on its margins and interior, and enter on a daily or weekly basis to collect firewood, honey, fish, crabs, and thatching among other resources. The Sundarbans is a nature reserve so people are prohibited from living within its boundaries. Households therefore live on its border among the brackish water shrimp ponds. Three themes emerged from the interviews with mangrove collectors: (i) highly seasonal incomes, (ii) high levels of livelihood and personal insecurity, and (iii) systems of permits that are difficult to navigate and/or ineffective. Interviews with these natural resource users revealed livelihoods highly affected by seasonality. Wet season rains make collection of firewood difficult (9); in the dry season there is a scarcity of freshwater and people have to drink salty water (9); fishermen fish in different locations in different seasons (8, 14); resource collection is banned during certain periods (68); and the quality of resources (e.g. the size of crabs) changes with the season (11). Some respondents move between different resource and day labour opportunities, while others exhibit extremely low livelihood mobility due to a strong livelihood-based identity (e.g. traditional fishermen), or a lack of human capital. For example, despite collection of firewood being prohibited, a woman of around 50 still went into the forest every day. In doing so, she faced the threat of both being detected and physical punished by forest guards as well as exposure to extreme weather and natural hazards (9). This theme of insecurity commonly arose in interviews.

Among signiï¬cant proximate drivers positively influencing SLM adoptions are being in more arid agro-ecological zones, longer growing period for crops, lower variance in annual precipitation and temperature, more experiences of past weather shocks. More arid agroâecologies in Central Asia are associated with more intensive agricultural production through application of irrigation and the related higher productivity, making the value of agricultural lands in these areas much higher, thus increasing the opportunity costs of losses due to land degradation and providing with higher incentives for SLM adoptions. The same mechanism explains the signiï¬cant positive coefï¬cient of the length of growing periods. The higher variability of long-term (30 years) rainfall and precipitation has negative association with SLM adoption. Most agricultural technologies do not perform equally well, for example, under drought and flooding, or under frosts and heatwaves. Higher climate variability leads to inconsistent performance and returns from a given SLM technology, consequently reducing the likelihood of its being adopted. However, past own experiences of short-term weather shocks (as opposed to climate variability) are found to have positive relationship with SLM adoption, as farmers having more experiences of weather shocks may seek ways on how to minimize their impacts by trying out various SLM technologies."

Information is consistent across almost all crops and includes the total of active ingredient (a.i.) applied, likely average percent of crop treated and likely maximum percent of crop treated. Gomez (2009) used proprietary data from 2003 to 2008 and Californiaâs PUR data, when that State had more than 40% of the crop acreage. Gomez does not indicate if the reported usage covers all of the U.S.; it seems likely that the proprietary data would concentrate on states where the most acreage of specific crops was planted. Gomez reported estimated usage for all crops considered both for individual years and averages of 4â5 years. Although Gomez provided valuable data on the percentage of a crop treated, he used different methods of analysis based on proprietary data, which precluded comparisons with EPA and NASS data analyses. Gomez also used data that typically had 3â5 significant figures, while EPA used one significant figure in their estimates, or 2 significant figures for numbers of more than 1,000,000. Gomez calculated and presented the percent difference between his estimates and those of EPA. Although real differences existed between some numbers, many apparent differences resulted from averaging and different rounding methods. The NASS performed usage surveys of individual pesticides on certain crops in selected states (âprogram statesâ) where those crops were most important (http://www.nass.usda.gov/). These surveys are not performed every year. The frequency is dependent upon the crop and typically varies from 3 to 5 y. Methods used by NASS are publically available; but, because they are required to protect individual privacy, data are aggregated in ways that sometimes hides useful information. NASS maintains databases of known growers that are stratified in several ways. They typically send out questionnaires to selected samples of growers. Depending upon the nature of the survey, they might follow up by letter, telephone or computer. They analyze these data using standard statistical aggregation. Therefore, the collected data are representative rather than actual, and only apply to the selected states. As a result, the amounts presented as total pesticide applied nationally are likely to be underestimates, the magnitude of which depends upon how much of a particular crop is grown in the states selected for analysis. However, the percentage of crops treated and the amount applied by acre are likely to be comparable in non-selected states. NASS data are reliable for specific states, at least for years that are sampled. Although annual data might be skewed, the comparisons are fairly close among sources when averaged over several years. A summary of data from the three national sources on the amount of CPY used on various crops is given in Table 4. EPA estimates usage from existing stocks on some crops that are no longer labeled, but these are not included in Table 4. NASS usage estimates are only given for the latest year, although the amount of CPY used will vary considerably from year to year, depending upon pest pressure."

Alongside the use of simple statistical analysis or qualitative research to describe the main reasons for Ukrainian migration, Ukrainian researchers have been favouring âpushâpullâ theory, which has been heavily criticized by Western researchers (De Haas 2010). Quantitative studies also usually lack comparative analysis of the causes of migration among the different migrant groups (by age, gender, skill level, social status, overall economic situation at the time of departure, etc.), and this can often be attributed to samples being small and non-representative. For the same reasons, formal models of migration decision processes have rarely been used to test key hypotheses on the determinants of migration. Nevertheless, studies that predominantly describe the existing status quo without providing much explanation remain very valuable as they contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind migration. Recent studies of the reasons for Ukrainian labour migration based on various data sources show that the main driving force behind the decision to work abroad is usually labour migrantsâ desire to improve the living standards of their families; the major push factor for migration of Ukrainians is low wages and the main pull factor in the destination countries is anticipated higher earnings (ETF 2008; GfK 2008; UCSR 2009; Bogdan 2011; Kupets 2013). Qualitative research based on in-depth interviews with Ukrainian migrants working in European countries (e.g. IvankovaStetsiuk 2009; Kys 2010) and focus-group discussions with Ukrainians at home (Kupets et al. 2012) add that it is not only differentials in wage rates that matter for the decision to migrate abroad, but also the lack of stability of earnings in Ukraine due to widespread wage arrears and under-employment in the formal sector and even more acute problems in the informal sector. As a result, many Ukrainians have already chosen long-term labour migration to European countries or are considering the opportunity to secure stable earnings by migrating abroad. Interviews with local employers and population in Italy and Spain suggest that Ukrainians and migrants from other Eastern European countries are not using migration as an economic survival strategy but rather as a strategy to improve living conditions at home (Kys 2010, see also Chaps. 10 and 12). Unemployment appears to be a less important reason for seeking work abroad than low wages in Ukraine and the possibility of earning quick money abroad (ETF 2008; GfK 2008; UCSR 2009; Bogdan 2011). This is not surprising because unemployment rates defined according to the ILO methodology are lower in Ukraine than in many destination countries, whereas average wages are significantly higher in all destination countries. One study of the determinants of temporary work abroad among residents of a small town in Ukraine (Hormel and Southworth 2006) found that unemployment increases the odds of temporary labour migration. However, in-depth interviews conducted by the same authors reveal that the majority of the unemployed did not migrate. Estimates based on the Labour Migration Survey show that out of 1.3 million labour migrants in 2007âfirst half of 2008, only 37.2% were not employed before moving abroad, whereas the rest had jobs in Ukraine but were dissatisfied"

An analysis of the structure of relationships, the quality of relationships, and the exchanges within households appears to be necessary and useful, but this was not initially targeted in our analysis. The necessity to capture the high complexity, multidimensionality, and heterogeneity of health, illness, households, family ties, etc. in a more detailed way is revealed by our gender-speciï¬c models and might yield further research suggestions. Fourth, the classiï¬cation of generation structures in our analyses is partly imprecise. In particular, the group of the one generation households is rather heterogeneous, as it includes singles and couples who either are childless or whose children have already left the parental home. When using the data of the German Microcensus there is no reliable way to differentiate between these groups, so this is a data problem. The main strengths of our study are the consideration of different levels that affect health and the modelling of the effect of the generation composition within households on health. The multilevel approach allows us to consider a second level âthe household levelâand thus to meet the variance across households in health matters, which are postulated by the approaches of the Household Production of Health and the New Household Economics. Our results illustrate this variance and the need for multilevel models. By considering the generation composition, we focus a measurement of the household structure, which will probably gain ground in the future. Already today, we ï¬nd numerous changes in family and household structures (e.g. the trend towards smaller households, the possibility of coexistence of several generations), which are associated with different health risks and opportunities. This differentiation will also continue in the coming decades, resulting in the need for household to be a level of consideration. By using several household-related characteristics, we can prove that many of these characteristics act independently. Some of the indicators measure similar issues, however, they are not perfectly multicollinear and have an additional effect on health inequalities (e.g. there is a signiï¬cant correlation between partnership status and the family status (p < 0.001), but we ï¬nd all combinations of characteristics; the proportion of partnerless is 3% among married, 85% among widowed, 76% among divorced, and 73% among singles). What is surprising is the effect of the generation composition, which is stronger and more robust than the effect of the family status, which traditionally is examined as the main indicator for household characteristics. The comparison of men and women as well of the migrant groups shows that this is a largely global effect."
114,33,0.988,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Only Part of the Healthcare System Has Been Addressed Patient safety has evolved and developed in the context of hospital care. The understanding we have of the epidemiology of error and harm, the causes and contributory factors and the potential solutions are almost entirely hospital based. The concepts which guided the study of safety in hospitals remain relevant in primary and community care but new taxonomies and new approaches may be required in these more distributed forms of healthcare delivery (Brami and Amalberti 2010; Amalberti and Brami 2012). Care provided in a personâs home is an important context for healthcare delivery but patient safety in the home has not been addressed in a systematic manner. The home environment may pose substantial risks to patients, greater in some cases than in the hospital environment. Safety in the context of a patientâs home care is likely to require different concepts, approaches and solutions to those developed in the hospital setting. This is because of the different environment, roles, responsibilities, standards, supervision and regulatory context in home care. Critical differences are that patients and carers are autonomous and are increasingly taking on professional roles; they rather than the professional become the potential source of medical error. Additionally, stressful and potentially hazardous conditions, such as poor lighting, mean that socio-economic conditions take on a much greater importance. In both primary care and care at home the risks to patients are rather different from those in hospital, being much more concerned with omissions of care, failure to monitor over long time periods and lack of access to care. These areas have not traditionally fallen within the area of patient safety but are undoubtedly sources of potential harm to patients. The concept of the patient safety incident, and even of adverse events, breaks down in these settings or is at least stretched to its limit. Suppose, to take just one example, a patient is hospitalised after taking an incorrect dose of warfarin for 4 months. The admission to hospital could be viewed as an incident or a preventable adverse event. This description however hardly does justice to 4 months of increasing debility and ill health culminating in a hospital admission. In reality, the admission to hospital is the beginning of the recovery process and a sign that the healthcare system is at last meeting the needs of this patient. The episode needs to be seen not as an isolated incident but as an evolving and prolonged failure in the care provided to this person."
309,23,0.988,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"2017, 66). The demand for more transparency, the call on governmental and other regulatory mechanisms, and the enforcement of consumer citizenship rights (Brooks et al. 2013) started to address the perceived need to re-embed the externalities of living in a ârisk societyâ in which scientific progress and knowledge not only provided solutions and probabilities for rational management of food scares but also permanently unleashed new incalculable risks (Beck 1992). Meanwhile, neoliberal policy on a global scale led to the birth of âthe consumerââunderstood as an individual supposedly acting in the commoditised system of food provision on the basis of individual choice, total information, and personal utilityâand, by consequence, to the individualisation of healthy and safe food choice (Parsons 2015). In Vietnam, concerns over the safety of food have mounted with people being anxious about the effects of feeding their bodies with harmful food. Thus, while economic growth and gains in food productivity have meant a reduction in the prevalence of undernourishment in the country (Marzin and Michaud 2016), one now increasingly finds widespread concerns over food safety related to the harmful effects of the overuse of agricultural inputs as well as regarding the insufficient traceability of food. Correspondingly, consumers at times assess that while the variety of meals has improved, the quality of food products has diminished as has the trust in food regulation bodies to detect substandard produce (see FiguiÃ© et al., this volume). Faced with an emerging commoditised food system, the âinventionâ of the consumer in Vietnam in recent decades coincided with described neoliberal economic paradigms on the international scene, standing in stark contrast to the prior governmental food rationing system and general discouragement of conspicuous consumption of foreign goods (Vann 2005, 468). With the general surplus that emanated from industrial production in many world regions and âthe majority of the populace hav[ing] access to the ever-growing consumerist fruits of the productivist treeâ (Corrigan 2011, 1), food consumption gradually became key for social differentiation as well as for food scholars engaging with food-related identities symbolically as well as in terms of its material conditions (e.g. Goody 1982; Klein 2014). âConsumer cultureâ, âconsumer societyâ, and âlifestyleâ became common conceptual foci through which scholars aimed to"
386,138,0.988,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"4.3.3 Socioeconomic Sustainability Revisited Typically, the environmental pillar of sustainability attracts the most attention, both inside and outside academia. In a textbook concerning the socioeconomics of agriculture, it is obvious that the opposite should be the case. There will be more convenient locations in which to debate the details of sustainable phosphorus or biodiversity management, but there are few more convenient locations to discuss issues related to socioeconomically sustainable agriculture. It is extremely tricky, however, to appropriately deal with economic sustainability. The easiest part is the definition of sound indicators. Meul et al. (2008), for example, consider the production of value-added products, the efficient use of production factors and a low risk in agricultural production to be the core factors. Similarly, Ryan et al. (2016) suggest focusing on different productivity indicators. Such and similar suggestions may provide valuable clues with respect to the state of a farm (or any other enterprise). Yet, sustainability is also used to distinguish âgoodâ farms from âbadâ ones, both for marketing chains and for policy-makers. This is where economic sustainability indicators quickly reach their limits. Obviously, it makes no sense to only buy eggs from farms with high labour productivity or to restrict direct payments to farms above a certain income threshold. Economic sustainability on the farm level has few direct externalities, although a low level of sustainability may raise distributional concerns and might, in fact, be an argument for more rather than less public support. This is different in the case of social sustainability. Social sustainability, to a great degree, refers to the links between the farm business and the outside world, which is a parallel to environmental sustainability. However, the flows in and out of the farm are not flows of nitrogen and pesticides, but rather flows of money as well as flows of appreciation and respect. The affected third parties are both farm workers and their relatives, in addition to neighbours and customers. Farms are a crucial component of the local social fabric and they should know about it. It is a worthwhile exercise to choose 50 sustainability assessment tools in which social aspects are included in order to find out more about any emerging consensus concerning what social sustainability actually entails. When this exercise was completed for this book, it turned out that 24 of the tools were connected to a label, while 26 were assessment tools with a merely informative purpose. All the indicators were recorded and sometimes grouped into larger categories so as to see which subjects were the most frequent. It appeared that there were three main front runners: â¢ Thirty-two of the 50 frameworks contained safety hazards. Apparently, a farm is not socially sustainable if pesticides or machinery are handled in ways that provoke accidents or long-term damage. Indeed, the concept of sustainability is touched at its very core if incidents occur on farms in which some of the workers or even bystanders are harmed. Bennett (2013) reports 621 fatalities in US agriculture in 2010 and, while the figures from developing countries are less widely distributed, they are certainly not lower."
10,20,0.988,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"natural causes, such as drought, but can also be induced by human activities only, or, as is usually the case, may result from the interaction of both (Pereira et al. 2002). Drought is expected to increase in the future as a result of climate change. In 2007 11 % of the European population and 17 % of the European territory were affected by drought (EC 2007). Already, it can be noted that the number of people and areas in Europe affected by drought and water scarcity has increased with 20 % between 1976 and 2006 (EC 2007). The total cost of these 30 years of droughts amounts to 100 billion euros (ibid.). This makes it very important to deal with drought and water scarcity now, and to increase drought resilience before the problem grows even bigger. In the 2007 Communication the European Union clearly states that devising effective drought risk management strategies has to be regarded an EU priority. But in order to optimize drought resilience not only the physical situation must be studied and worked on. The governance setting matters a great deal in determining the effectiveness of drought adaptation measures and facilitating their implementation. Governance ultimately revolves around the social, organizational, political and juridical dimensions and how actors operate in these dimensions to work on issues such as drought resilience. In many instances (technological) innovations for increasing drought resilience do exist, but their implementation is hampered because of factors in the governance setting. As an example, an innovation is developed and tested by a local actor, but its upscaling for broader application is limited because actors in the region do not engage in intensive networking or suffer from the ânot invented hereâ syndrome and the resulting lack of ownership decreases the potential to upscale. Another example is when the ideas for an innovation do exist, but resources lack to fund their proper development, as a result of little experienced urgency for change at regime level. In other words; governance matters, and governance is broader than just the (governmental) actors and their adoption of drought resilience measures. In the upcoming chapters governance and the role of governance in drought resilience will be further discussed, translated into a fully developed governance assessment model, and applied to real-life cases. Through this discussion, development and application we want to provide assistance to practitioners working on increasing drought resilience. This book is primarily written by scientists, but strongly embedded in our interaction with practitioners. Some chapters are also co-written by these practitioners. We believe that this work on the edge of science and practice contributes to an innovative perspective on drought resilience, and is an example of the novelty and applicability of our work."

219,408,0.988,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Land tenure We use tenure security, which is threat or absence of likelihood of land expropriation by government or elites. USAID and ARD (2008) used country-level land policies and past history of land expropriation to give a country level tenure security. The land tenure security is divided into three major groupsâ (i) Moderately serious concern. This group includes countries where land users/owners have the least concern about expropriation. Examples of such countries include: Mali, Senegal, Tanzania, and Zambia. (ii) Serious concern, which is medium threat of expropriation, examples of which include DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria. (iii) Extremely serious concern of expropriation. This is the group with the worst land tenure security and includes such countries as Zimbabwe and Sudan. Surprisingly even South Africa and Namibia are included in this group. Government effectiveness We use the World Bank measure of government effectiveness index, which measures the quality of public services, civil service, and the degree of its independence from political pressures. Poverty We use infant mortality rate (IMR) to represent poverty. The IMR is a good indicator of poverty and has been used in many poverty studies (e.g. see Dasgupta 2010). We use the IMR to represent the impact of poverty on cropland extent and cost of land degradation. IMR data are at half degree resolution and are obtained from CISIEN. Table 9.9 summarizes the data used, their sources and baseline and endline periods. As far as possible, the baseline and endline periods of all the covariates were matched with the corresponding periods for cropland area and cost of land degradation. For some variables, data for the baseline period (2001) were not available. Hence, an alternative period which is as close as possible to the 2001 periods was used. These include GEI and population density at half degree resolution."
164,362,0.988,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","To close this chapter we want to re-emphasize the complexity and plurality of the types and magnitudes of the causal relationships between poverty and environmental degradation. The wide array of relationships between LD and poverty were confirmed by literature review, where it is difficult to find an empirical based consensus on the nature of the links between the two. The breadth of the nature of povertyâLD linkages can be explained by several factors. First, there are several feedback and synergistic effects between the different causal factors of LD, therefore the true impact of poverty on LD cannot be captured in a bivariate analysis. Second, there are feedback effects between poverty and LD that make it harder to determine the direction of the causality. Finally, the institutional framework within which land users operate and make their land management decisions can supersede the impacts of poverty on LD. This was clearly exemplified by case studies in Niger and India. All of these empirical findings were shown to be independent of the cost effectiveness of SLM practices (Nkonya et al. 2011a), and are echoed in the theoretical literature on poverty and growth and their links to environmental degradation. The existence of an EKC has been debated at length. Bulte and van Soest (2001) showed that under imperfect labor markets, the combined income and substitution effects of rising resource prices can lead to an allocation of farm labor that is either consistent with the EKC hypothesis or not, depending on the choice of environmental degradation indicator. Poverty as well as LD can be accounted for using a wide variety of indicators, the choice of which will influence the understanding gained about any particular linkage, which can differ vastly across regions and countries. A global and inclusive definition of poverty is inevitably linked to a general concept of well-being and welfare. There are currently no established indicators at the global-level that fully capture the variability in human well-being. Well-being is partially attributable to the state of the environment. This can be captured to some extent by global indicators such as genuine savings (Aglietta 2010), which adjusts the savings rate for the depletion of natural resources in particular. However, as noted in Nkonya et al. (2008), LD is a form of âsquanderingâ that is not addressed by any current frameworks and indicators of well-being, not even in measures of genuine savings. This needs to change, because productive land is a global public good that is increasingly under pressure to deliver the required ecosystem benefits to support a growing world population, sparking increasing competition over its ownership (Deininger and Byerlee 2011).

River floods mainly occur during the wet season (monsoon), when a large volume of water is received from the upstream catchments. This typically results in 20â60 per cent inundation of Bangladesh annually (Salehin et al. 2007), although in the study area such flooding is limited by an extensive system of coastal embankments and polders. Flood risk is projected to increase over the incoming decades, given increased overall discharge projections for the Ganges and other major Himalayan rivers. For the Ganges and Brahmaputra, Lutz et al. (2014), for example, show increased run-off till mid-twenty-first century due to a combination of increased precipitation and glacier melt in the high upper catchments. Cyclones and tropical storms regularly make landfall in Bangladesh, typically more than once per year, leading to high winds, extreme sea levels and saltwater flooding (Alam and Dominey-Howes 2015; Mutahara et al. 2016). This can damage crops and properties with consequences for life and livelihoods, creating social vulnerability for the study area population. The economic and health consequences of these events are highly significant, and virtually all analyses show that the consequences for economies and societies will increase with projected climate change, with impacts falling disproportionally on poor and vulnerable populations and acting as a brake on development (Hallegatte et al. 2017). Yet interventions and governance processes can make dramatic differences to vulnerability, poverty and the trajectories of development in the delta. Improved disaster risk management, for example, through the growth of flood warnings and cyclone shelters has greatly reduced the death toll during extreme floods and cyclones compared to the large mortality in 1970 and 1991 (Shaw et al. 2013; Lumbruso et al. 2017). The aspirations of the Bangladesh government are towards economic growth and poverty alleviation, as directly articulated in their planning processes: a Bangladesh which, by 2021, will be a middle income country where poverty will be drastically reduced where, our citizens will be able to meet every basic need and where development will be on fast track, with ever-increasing rates of inclusive growth.

231,1373,0.988,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"negative impact on accommodation prices along the German sea coast. Braun et al. (1999) investigated combined scenarios of temperature and precipitation change with sea-level rise and beach loss and their effect on the number of tourists travelling to the Baltic and North Sea coasts of Germany. They concluded that the likelihood of choosing the north German coast for a holiday was slightly higher with increased temperatures. However, for scenarios with potentially negative impacts on the German coasts, such as beach erosion, the likelihood of visiting was substantially lower, even if with adaptations such as greater setback of tourism infrastructure or more diversiï¬ed outdoor activities. Lohmann (2002) concluded that the effects of climate change in the North Sea area, such as sea-level rise, were likely to destroy infrastructure and that frequent extreme weather events may discourage visitors. Infrastructure at ports and marinas is a major asset at many destinations. Sea-level rise, coastal erosion and storms might compromise its functionality. There is still a lack of detailed academic research on this topic for the North Sea region. For the German North Sea coastline, sea-level rise is expected to extend the tides (i.e. lengthen flood duration on mudflats) hampering tidal flat walks for tourists (Regierungskommission Klimaschutz 2012). Higher average temperatures in the North Sea region will also cause tourism-driven changes in biodiversity. If more tourists visit the North Sea in, before and after the summer season, this might increase pressure on local biodiversity, in particular vegetation cover and habitat for nesting birds (Coombers et al. 2008). Effects on nature-based tourism and activities, like animal watching, still require closer academic study. Travellers to the Baltic Sea coast judged algal blooms negatively, especially for swimming (Nilsson and GÃ¶ssling 2012). There is also concern that foam algae might pollute the beaches (Regierungskommission Klimaschutz 2012). Further studies are needed to examine the (potentially toxic) effects of new plant species moving into the North Sea region and an increase in harmful algal blooms could impact on bathing water quality and the tourism industry in general over the longer term (GÃ¶ssling et al. 2012). Broader socio-economic impacts of climate change on destinations, such as those concerning health, security or insurance implications should also be considered. Heat waves in summer might adversely affect health resorts, but it may be that such conditions are still preferable to those of other inland destinations and will therefore have an advantage in the future. Knowledge gaps still remain on health issues, especially the future distribution of vector-borne disease along the North Sea coast. Overall, tourism in the North Sea area in summer is expected to proï¬t from rising temperatures (air and water), decreasing precipitation and a longer season. But"
118,342,0.988,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"The paradigm within which Industrial Age technologies are understood is based on an Enlightenment worldview. As said, this worldview is atomistic (reductionism), deterministic (cause and effect) and objectivistic (universal laws). In other words, the laws governing the behavior of these complicated systems can be: â¢ Understood by studying the behavior of their component parts, â¢ Deduced from cause and effect (a search for causal links or chains), and â¢ Determined independent of the observer, that is, only deduced from âobjectiveâ empirical observations. The context within which our Post-Industrial Age Technologies and their underlying science are understood is based on a nonlinear worldview. This worldview gives rise to complex systems that are characterized by at least one of the following [28]: â¢ Holistic/emergentâthe system has properties that are exhibited only by the whole and hence cannot be described in terms of its parts, â¢ Chaoticâsmall changes in input often lead to large changes in output and/or there may be many possible outputs for a given input, and â¢ Subjectiveâsome aspects of the system may only be described subjectively. It is often said that for complex systems, âthe whole is greater than the sum of its partsâ. What this means is that there is an emergent quality (sometimes called an emergent property) that is not exhibited by the parts alone. Examples include electric power transmission grids, the disposal of high-level radioactive waste, and the response of social systems to severe natural phenomena. I believe that the new issues regarding national and international security also fall into this category. In each case, the system is simultaneously a whole and a part of a larger whole, a characteristic of complex systems. It should be made crystal clear that the impacts of human activities on both society and the environment (from the development of the steam engine to the development of the jet engine) have always been complex. In the past, however, the only undesirable consequences of an Industrial Age technology, such as a nuclear power plant, that were considered in a PRA were geographically local (public health effects out to one mile or 25 miles) or they were observable in ârealâ time (a hydrogen explosion). This gave the impression that the current risk paradigm is accurate because locality and observability were two characteristics of the impact. This lens is changing, and yet our practices are still based on the same paradigm. That is, a nuclear power plant accident has âglobalâ impacts (an accident at one plant affects the operation of all plants) and manifests very quickly (e.g. loss of public confidence worldwide). In the case of disposal of radioactive waste, the undesirable consequences are almost imperceptible (e.g. the migration of high-level radioactive waste takes place over geological timescales or millennia). Moreover, these impacts may be temporally persistent and/or irreversible (e.g. the degradation of public welfare due to nuclear proliferation). Thus, as a result of the complexity inherent in Post-Industrial Age Technology, societal and environmental impacts are no longer geographically local, nor perceptible in real time, nor reversible. Rather, complexity can produce impacts that are"

If this is correct, the number of undetected oil spills could be substantial. Possible partial solutions to this problem could be more effective satellite surveillance, increasing the number of flight hours in darkness and using and intensifying the use of joint surveillance efforts that are not announced beforehand (CEPCO operations). Moreover, if we are in fact witnessing a reduction in the number of spills, it is likely that these command and control measures are not the only reasons for this reduction. At least two additional factors are probably important. First, as tanker fleets in the Baltic Sea are modernised, the pollution from, for example, flushing of machine rooms could be expected to decrease as spill water can be better taken care of in modern tankers. Moreover, when vessels are modernised and better adapted to existing reception facilities in the ports, the incentives to clean tanks at sea are weakened, as less time than before is needed for cleaning tanks in port. Second, the introduction of more effective reception facilities and the No-Special-Fee system (elaborated on below) means that no additional charges are made for cleaning tanks in port. Incentives for cleaning them at sea are thus reduced. Two concerns remain regarding the effectiveness of aerial surveillance. First, member countries are responsible for covering their respective air space. This means that the engagement shown most likely will continue to vary in accordance with national capacity and priorities. Second, detection of oil spills typically do not lead to identification of the perpetrator. Only in 12 % of the detected spills has the"

Effects were detected for the in vivo species with EC50 values between 0.54 and 5.2 mg/L, whereas EC50 values for cytotoxicity were between ~60 and 87 mg/L. Besseling et al. (2014b) reported that 70 nm polystyrene particles reduced the growth of algae (Scenedesmus obliquus) at high particle concentrations, and malformed offspring of Daphnia at a concentration of 32 mg/L. The effects on Daphnia were studied with and without fish (Perca fluviatilis) kairomones in the water and the effect of the kairomones appeared to be stronger in the presence of 1.8 mg/L nanoplastic. This suggests that nanoplastics might interfere with the chemical communication among species, which would cause subtle behavioural disturbances in finding a mate or food, or in the avoidance of predators such as fish. Such effects may be taking place at low concentrations that are not easy to detect using standard toxicological tests but that may result in changes in the food web in exposed ecosystems over time. In summary, the limited literature provides some evidence of effects of NPs to marine and freshwater organisms, yet at relatively high concentrations, i.e. higher than ~0.5 mg/L NPs. There are currently no NP environmental concentrations to which this value can be compared, but the lowest NP effect concentration of 0.54 mg/L (Casado et al. 2013) is about four to six orders of magnitude higher than the 0.4â34 ng/L microplastic concentrations found in freshwaters in the USA (Eriksen et al. 2013) and Europe (Besseling et al. 2014c), but almost similar to the highest concentration estimated for marine water (i.e. 0.51 mg/L, see Besseling et al. 2014b; Lopez Lozano and Mouat 2009). However, because of the limited data, the uncertainties in these numbers and the absence of actual NP exposure data, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution."

Engagement in off-farm activities has a negative influence on the probability of Jatropha adoption. The current result might be due to the fact that farmers engaged in off-farm activities have less time and resources to engage in Jatropha cultivation. Table 6.7 provides the distribution of the propensity scores. For adopters, the estimated propensity scores vary between 0.06356 and 0.98953 with a mean of 0.50168. For non-adopters, it varies between 0.06356 and 0.89317 with a mean of 0.42073. The results suggest that the region of common support is satisfied in the interval [0.06356, 0.89317].

193,145,0.988,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"The fact that Ukrainian migrants can transfer the money earned abroad personally without having to bear additional transfer costs is an advantage of temporary, especially circular, migration (Grotte 2012). However, qualitative studies on the remitting behaviour of Ukrainian migrants report negative examples of Ukrainian migrants being robbed on the way back to or upon arrival in Ukraine (Grotte 2012; Kindler 2011). A study conducted in Italy (Weber 2004) indicates that difficulty in re-negotiating social status when back in Ukraine may constitute a constraint on return, and rather a motivation to remain abroad longer than initially intended, going home only for short periods of time. This shows that the âstatus tensionsâ experienced by temporary migrants, as well as by their children, are strongly linked to their statuses in their countries of origin, which can impact not only temporal patterns of mobility but also the well-being of both migrants and their families. This also demonstrates that lowprestige work in the destination country does deprive migrants of their social status, partially challenging the claim put forward, for example, by the dual labour market theory of Piore (1979) that such deprivation should be lower or non-existent in the case of temporary migrants. This is due to the fact that the Ukrainian migrants studied had experienced tensions about their social position in the country of origin. The risk of deskilling or de-qualification is high for temporary Ukrainian migrants (see Triandafyllidou 2011; Caglar et al. 2011; Iglicka et al. 2011). The temporary migration of Ukrainian citizens is often related to temporary jobs that do not require high skills and belong to the so-called secondary sector of the labour market. Consequently, studies in a number of countries have found loss of skills among educated Ukrainian migrants performing low-skilled jobs (Antoniewski and KoryÅ 2002; Shakhno and Pool 2005; Fedyuk 2012). For example, a study based on two national surveys of foreigners in the Czech Republic provides evidence of a significant waste of human capital among Ukrainians (Leontiyeva 2014; see also Chap. 8). A crucial finding of this study is that migrants âwith permanent residence permits turned out to be twice as likely to have skilled jobs compared to those with temporary residence permits and were half as likely to end up on the bottom rungs of the labour marketâ (Leontiyeva 2014:74). This suggests that the temporal dimension of migration, related to legal status on the Czech labour market, intersects with the risk of deskilling among migrants, which tends to be higher for temporary migrants. Irregular stay means higher risks and consequently higher mobility costs between Ukraine and the country of migration (see Chap. 4).

This is especially concerning given the strict protection afforded to all bat species and particularly bat roosts under the EU Habitat Directive; this prohibits deliberate disturbance of all bats during any stage of their life cycle as well as the destruction of breeding sites or resting areas. As such, the timing of forest harvesting needs to consider whether bats may be roosting in targeted areas (e.g. Forestry Commission 2005). There are no such restrictions in Australia; though for New Zealand pine plantations, Borkin et al. (2011) recommends that harvests should be planned when bats are not heavily pregnant nor have non-volant dependents. In eastern North America, logging is currently restricted from 15 October through 31 March across the distribution of the endangered Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, as this bat uses live and dead trees as maternity sites during the growing season (USFWS 2009). Restrictions are further constrained to a start date of 15 November within 16 km of known hibernacula of the species (USFWS 2009). The implications of white-nose syndrome and the extensive mortalities of cave-hibernating bats in North America (USFWS 2012) are likely to add species of forest bats to the threatened and endangered species list in the USA, leading to further restrictions on logging. Missing in all of the dialogue, however, is any direct link of impact, or mortality of bats, during logging operations and studies of these potential impacts are needed (but see Borkin et al. 2011)."

246,77,0.988,Rewilding European Landscapes,"farmers, even with the support of subsidies (Rey Benayas et al. 2007, see Chap. 1). These land-use changes raise challenges in terms of lifestyles, social structure and biodiversity (Munroe et al. 2013). Thus, predicting these changes has received considerable importance in recent research. We map the areas in Europe where farmland abandonment is projected to take place based on the Dyna-CLUE model (Verburg and Overmars 2009) (Fig. 2.3). For the projections of the social and economic drivers driving farmland abandonment, we used four VOLANTE scenarios describing different development paths towards the year 2040 (Paterson et al. 2012). These scenarios are loosely based on the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (Nakicenovic et al. 2000) and they cover the range of socio-economic conditions across the axes of regionalization versus globalization, and willingness versus reluctance against sustainable lifestyle changes at the societal level. We indicate here in how many of the four scenarios land abandonment is found significant across Europe (Fig. 2.3). How will farmland abandonment affect wilderness value? The answer to this question depends on where farmland abandonment takes place. Many areas of abandonment can be found around mountainous regions such as the Apennines, the Massif Central, the Carpathians, the Balkans, areas of higher altitude and lower productivity that have already experienced abandonment in the past decades (Fig. 2.3). These areas have a low density of human population and a low level of infrastructure development. As the human density will decrease even more, the use of artificial light will decrease as well, but the physical infrastructures will withstand for longer than the outmigration of people albeit with lower intensity of use. Spurred by the already existing infrastructure, many abandonment areas might also see a surge in tourism, biofuels cultivation and renewable energy industries, replacing the agricultural activities (Laiolo and Tella 2006). From an ecological point of view, farmland abandonment will directly lead to a decrease in harvested PP as grazing and cultivation are projected to drop. This will increase the resources available to wild populations and ecosystems, and vegetation cover will evolve towards a more natural state (Rey Benayas et al. 2007). Previous studies have showed that increased availability of biomass and reduced presence of humans lead to growing numbers of wild herbivores in south Asia (Madhusudan 2004). The recovery of ecosystems to a wilderness state depends on rebuilding natural trophic cascades and networks that are both resilient to natural disturbances and able to sustain key ecosystem functions. In these networks, megafauna and apex predators have a fundamental role, especially in the depleted conditions of the current European biota (Schmitz 2006; Sekercioglu 2006; Johnson 2009; Ritchie and Johnson 2009). For the natural recovery of ecosystems and the return of these species, the presence of source populations is paramount and adjacency to existing core wilderness areas will be a key driver (see Chaps. 4, 8). We explore the chances for a natural recovery of European fauna by mapping the distribution of megafauna (Fig. 2.4). The results are encouraging for many areas of future agricultural abandonment: megafauna richness is high in the adjacent"

However, in recent decades the influence of human transformations on the slopes is so vast that nowadays it seems to be rather impossible to ï¬nd landslides 100% of natural origin. Anthropic activities induce a series of constant disturbances on the slopes producing a lack of equilibrium and a higher susceptibility to landsliding that affect all kind of societies (AlcÃ¡ntara-Ayala 2016). Consequently, landslides can be regarded as socio-natural hazards, that is to say, resulted from the interaction between social practices and the environment (Lavell 2003)."

Care at home could, in some circumstances, generate even more adverse events than hospitals. The advancing age of the average patients at home and increasing numbers of comorbidities and medications are all associated with increased risk of experiencing a medication error or an adverse event (Lorincz et al. 2011).

Variations in the strength of the Gulf Stream cause variations in the âtiltâ of the ocean surface, and thus the height at the coast. A strong Gulf Stream tilts the surface away from the coast, and some estimates predict a slowing of the Gulf Stream. The slowing would result in enhanced sea level rise along the coast. There are systematic variations of sea level in Norfolk associated with internal modes of variability in the atmosphere, for example, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Sea-level rise sits in context with internal variability and other causes of relative sea-level change, which is typical of many applications. Partly because the increase in flooding is widely obvious and interferes with commerce and day-to-day life, sea-level rise has received much attention in what is generally a politically conservative region. Residents, businesses, cities, and the military are all active in developing sea-level-rise policy and plans. Local universities have performed research quantifying the different causes of sea-level rise and contributing to communication of what has happened, framing vulnerability, and what is likely to happen. Many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with different focuses represent particular interests ranging from conservation to social justice. In the mid-2000s, the need to address sea-level rise and climate change became so apparent that a regional focus started to emerge, with the local Intergovernmental Pilot Project being formalized in 2014.9 This organization strives to coordinate the sea-level-rise preparedness and resilience planning of federal, state, and local government agencies and the private sector and take into account the perspectives of the regionâs citizens. Though sea-level rise projections are often viewed as highly uncertain, the convergence of observations, peopleâs perception of vulnerability, effective communication, and concern for the viability of the region stand as motivation to take action. With planning periods focused on the next few decades, building standards, zoning, and codes are being modiï¬ed. There is recognition that at the end of this planning horizon, sea-level rise will not be stable, but likely to be increasing. Therefore, sustained, future-looking planning and design will be required. Climate model results provide a range of estimates of possible future states to inform this process (though they may be uncertain; see Chap. 11). However, climate change effects on sea-level rise are only one part of the planning process (see Chap. 12)."
166,323,0.988,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),6 Is It Gold or Just Glittering? So far we have made the case for implementing LHCs in research on vulnerability. However all that glitters is not gold and the LHC method has also a number of drawbacks that researchers must consider. Time and costs are problems of the LHC technique (Belli 1998) especially when the calendar has open answers that must be manually entered into a database and eventually coded. However the use of new technologies like tablets may overcome part of these problems and drastically reduce the costs (e.g. Glasner 2011). More problematic are the administration time and the relative difficulty of the task. Both can easily increase for complex and atypical trajectories but vulnerable populations are the most likely to have complex atypical trajectories that do not follow normative transitions. Thus difficulties in filling LHCs could add to other problematic aspects of surveying vulnerable populations in particular those with low personal resources such as low socio-economic status or low cultural capital. Though the concept of life history calendars is becoming more popular thanks to its implantation on recreational platforms (e.g. Facebook Timelines) filling a calendarbased questionnaire is a cognitively demanding operation. On the one side we showed that LHCs are suitable to study vulnerability processes from different perspectives considering vulnerability as the interrelation between diffusion accumulation and interpretation processes. By allowing for integrated analytical approaches the LHC can stimulate researchers towards complex and multifaceted understandings of vulnerability interconnecting subjective evaluations with factual episodes. On the other side specific segments of the society especially those at the margin that may be more at risk of experiencing prolonged vulnerability may encounter more difficulties in filling calendar-based questionnaires. Thus researchers should take extreme care in designing questionnaires for potentially vulnerable populations.
353,21,0.988,"Disability, Health and Human Development","This research is motivated by three main factors. First of all, there is very little research on disability in the context of LMICs, and LICs in particular. Much of the research is from the last decade or so. The seminal World Report of Disability (WHO-World Bank 2011) contributed some internationally comparable prevalence and situational analyses in 59 countries, including in some LICs. It showed that disability is not rare and is associated with lower educational attainment, lower employment rates, and limited access to health services. Some recent research in LMICs has consistently found that disability is associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing simultaneous multiple deprivations (multidimensional poverty) (Hanass-Hancock and McKensie 2017; Mitra et al. 2013; Trani and Cunning 2013; Trani et al. 2015, 2016). In contrast, some research using traditional poverty indicators (consumption expenditures and asset ownership) paints a mixed picture (Filmer 2008; Mitra et al. 2013; Trani and Loeb 2010). Second, the prevalence of health conditions and impairments is likely going to increase in LMICs in the near future. Aging is on the rise because of epidemiological transitions, including increased life expectancy due to a reduction in mortality from parasitic and other infections (WHO 2016). At the same time, chronic and degenerative diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases) are becoming more common. People may survive conditions once fatal as the quality and accessibility of treatments and healthcare improve (HIV/AIDS). Hence, there is a need to study disability in LMICs. Third, in the past decade, disability has received more attention in policies and programs worldwide and more knowledge is required to inform them. As of January 2017, 172 countries have signaled their commitment to protect the rights of persons with disabilities with the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) a decade after its adoption (United Nations 2006, 2016). Disability also explicitly features in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the Agenda 2030 (UNDP 2016b). In LICs, there are numerous advocates who work toward the empowerment of persons with disabilities and they tend to work in NGOs or disabled people organizations. For policies and programs in LICs, more knowledge is needed on topics as basic as the prevalence of functional difficulties and their association with wellbeing inequalities."

Instead, state sponsored/approved forcible encroachment by private interests into communal lands predominates. â¢ Genuinely inform and consult populations prior to the inception of developmentârather than âmanufactureâ âconsentâ from orchestrated and government (or donor) controlled gatherings. â¢ Implement a valid assessment of the efï¬cacy of âcompensationâ or âmitigationâ for the hundreds of thousands of indigenous residents, even if such were a genuine GOE intention. â¢ Implement its own deï¬ned Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)âafter such is shaped with community consultations.11 Repeated assertions by the Ethiopian government, particularly EEPCO, that the âbeneï¬tsâ of Gibe III generated electricity would serve the needs of Ethiopians so far without access to power contradicted by two realities. Firstly, a high proportion of Gibe III generated electricity is slated for export, as outlined in prior chapters and in the section below. Secondly, since electricity costs in Ethiopia are predicted to rise by a minimum of 200 % in the near term, according to the World Bank, the overwhelming proportion of Ethiopian citizens would have no means to purchase available electricity. This is true even with the unlikely scenario that the GOE subsidizes energy costs for large numbers of the poor. The major consumers of electricityâin Ethiopia, Kenya and elsewhere in eastern Africaâare projected to be industry, agroindustry, commerce and government entities, along with relatively better well-off domestic consumers. â¢ Systematic actions taken by Ethiopiaâs institutional nexus of river basin development policy (see description in Chap. 2) over more than ï¬ve decades for more than ï¬ve decades reveal a clear pattern of ignoring the human and environmental consequences of major hydrodam developmentâthe Gibe III being the worst case, to date. The close coordination and overlapping objectives among GOE Executive ofï¬ces, international development banks (playing the key role among aid agencies in large capital projects) and global consulting industry membersâboth ï¬rms and individualsâform the functional core of bringing about such massive dam and infrastructural projects as the Gibe megadam. The GOEâs dismissive approach to the survival and well being of its own indigenous population within the lower Omo basin residents is evident from these two statements by Meles Zenawi, the late Prime Minister of Ethiopia, at Ethiopiaâs Annual Pastoralistsâ Day in 2011. âOn this occasion, I assure the people of South Omo, especially the pastoralists, that the time of losing your cattle or life because of the Omo flood is over.

Free movement of capital and the common currency might also render difï¬cult the measurement of remittances towards Greece from these recent migrants. A second tentative conclusion is that the overall number of Greek emigrants does not correspond to a wave of mass emigration, despite the heavy recession and the favorable institutional framework of freedom of movement within the EU. In this regard, Greece does not differ from the other EU member-states that have been severely hit by the crisis. As noted recently, âif we consider the extent, the duration and the harshness of the crisis it seems that a surprisingly lower number of Greeks, Italians, Irish, Spaniards and Portuguese have emigrated than would have been expectedâ (Gropas and Triandafyllidou 2014a: 5). There exist many explanations behind the discrepancy between predicted economic migration and observed reality. First, there are well-known impediments to labour mobility within the EU: inter alia, linguistic barriers, cultural differences, inadequate information on labour supply and demand in other EU member-states and incomplete recognition of qualiï¬cations (Deutsche Bank Research 2011). Mobility is also, generally, very costly for unskilled workers, who would have the greatest incentive to migrate, while skilled workers are able to cover such costs more easily but do not face as high unemployment levels (for a similar analysis, see SER 2001: 7â8). Htouris (2012) has also underlined the protective role of the Greek family for those hit by the economic crisis in the absence of other welfare provisions. We may assume that this family-based safety net, bolstered by the relative protection of pensions during the crisis, constrains the geographic mobility of young, unemployed Greeks. An underdeveloped area of research relates to the qualitative characteristics of recent emigrants, such as their skills, professional aspirations, geographic origin, family history and networks etc. Empirical research on emigration is limited in the Greek scholarly community, since most academics and research institutions still focus on issues of immigration (including irregular immigration), settlement, and integration of third-country nationals. Two surveys have dealt exclusively with documenting the characteristics of emigration ï¬ows (Lambrianidis 2011; Gropas and Triandafyllidou 2014a, b). However, both concentrated on the movement of the high-skilled, while the older survey is based on data collected prior to the economic crisis. There is practically no systematic data available on emigration ï¬ows of the lower-skilled or unskilled Greek emigration. Due to its seasonal and undocumented nature this type of emigration is also underestimated in ofï¬cial registries (unlike Portugal, there is no recording of posted workers, see Chap. 5 in this volume). This remains an empirical challenge for the full appreciation of the recent migration movement from the South. Indeed, a private communication of the authors with a representative of the Association of Immigrants and Coethnics from Germany, conï¬rmed that many low-skilled workers migrate for a brief period and work in restaurants, construction and transportation (often in businesses owned by relatives or other co-ethnics) without registering residence or employment (telephone interview 10/08/2014)."

The incorporation of landslide mapping into regional and local land-use planning is an important measure to reduce the impact of landslides (Fell et al. 2008). In Vietnam, landslide-related studies were carried out for a long time ago by means of traditional geological surveys, mainly by transect-walks. The investigations on landslide hazard and risk have evolved since the last two decades thank to the advancement of GIS and remote sensing technology (Hung et al. 2016). However, like in many other developing countries, as summarized by van Westen et al. (2006), there are many kinds of obstacles that make the execution of hazard risk zonation difï¬cult in Vietnam. Most of projects on landslide mapping in Vietnam have been conducted at small scales (less than 1:100,000) in large regions (more than 1000 km2) (Hung et al. 2016). Several advanced-worldwide technologies for landslide zonation and warning at larger scales (>1:50,000) have been applied to several pilot areas, but not yet systematically adapted to the Vietnamese context (Hung et al. 2015). Those projects are often carried out by several organizations with different specialties for a number of purposes, and different criteria. Therefore, the results of previous works have not yet been integrated into one uniï¬ed national database. Furthermore, the outcomes of those projects have not been transferred to the end-users, especially to the local communities and the national organizations for natural disaster prevention and control (Hung et al. 2015). To overcome the above-mentioned limitations, the country needs a national program to systematically conduct landslide inventory mapping, assess landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk for all of prone areas. The programs should apply the advanced techniques for zoning and warning of landslides in mountainous areas in Vietnam and it is urgently needed in order to serve the operational effectiveness for prevention and mitigation of landslides in the context of climate change."
151,345,0.988,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"There are a number of bird species that frequent agroecosystems besides those included as focal species in this assessment (see Best and Murray 2003). The USEPA (USEPA 2005) used estimates of mortality for the combination of focal species and bird sensitivities in each modeled exposure scenario to approximate the cumulative distribution of outcomes for the complex of species using treated fields. The approach assumes that the focal species included in the modeling exercise are representative of the birds and their exposures occurring in the fields (USEPA 2005). This assumption is supported by the selection of focal species known to occur on the treated crops by actual survey (e.g., Best and Murray 2003). According to the USEPA (2005), the outcomes of the three modeled sensitivity assumptions (low, median and high sensitivity) âcan be viewed as a stratified sample from the population which estimates the limits and mid points of the cumulative risk distribution and therefore provides a reasonable approximation of the distribution.â The resulting cumulative distribution of acute risk for banded application on corn at the maximum application rate of 1.12 kg haâ1 (1 lb ai Aâ1) is shown in Fig. 8. Results of simulations using LiquidPARAM indicate that several species of birds, if highly sensitive, would experience up to approximately 30% mortality. Similar results were predicted for alfalfa, almond, apple/cherry, grape, grapefruit and soybean (Table 5). For orange, somewhat greater risk is expected in the bird community because this crop has the greatest application rate allowed on the Lorsban Advanced label (i.e., 6.27 kg haâ1 (5.6 lb ai Aâ1)) (Fig. 9). Although the results of the LiquidPARAM modeling indicated some acute risk to the most sensitive species for several crops listed on the Lorsban Advanced label (Table 5), the evidence from field studies that used the corresponding application rates (i.e., corn, grapefruit, and orange) indicate that flowable CPY poses little risk to birds (Dittrich and Staedtler 2010; Frey et al. 1994; Gallagher et al. 1994; Selbach and Wilkens 2008b; Wolf et al. 2010).

Kinh households (the dominant ethnic group in Nam) represent only 17% of our sample, Thai minority is 54% (mostly located in Dien Bien), and Hâmong is 13% (mostly located in Yen Bai). In terms of institutions, 43% of households in the sample have received advice on MT and 72% on FDP and/or SIP. Seventy-four per cent of households have a member that belongs to a farmer union. Only 3% of the households received any support for fertilizers; 14% received seed support (more than 1/3 in Dien Bien); and 43% had access to formal credit, with the highest concentration in Dien Bien (73%). Also, distribution of wealth indicators differ across provinces. Dien Bien has the highest percentage of households with income sources other than agriculture and livestock measured by Tropical Livestock Units (TLU), whereas Son La has the highest asset index.17 Table 7 reports the results of the analysis on the determinants of adoption of MT in maize systems (columns A and B), and FDP and SIP in rice systems (columns C to F), using probit specifications as per Eq. (11). We estimate two different specifications for each model: one includes the long-term coefficients of variation (LT CV) of climatic variables (columns A, C and D), and the other includes also long-term averages (LT AVG) (columns B, E and F). These variables capture the potential impact of long-term average values of climatic variables that cannot be obtained from the standardized value of variation using CV. Results from columns A and B suggest: (i) households that operate plots on higher slopes are significantly more likely to adopt MT; (ii) none of the household socio-economic characteristics significantly affects adoption, suggesting adoption is very much driven by agronomic indicators; (iii) extension advice is significantly and positively correlated with higher probability of adoption as expected; (iv) a positive relation between the share of households adopting MT and the relative diffusion of MT in the same communes is a sign of positive spillovers of effective adoption; (v) access to formal credit significantly and positively affects adoption, which is especially important for ethnic minorities with limited access to credit (and extension) compared to the Kinh majority (Do and Nguyen 2015); and (vi) having received support for improved seeds is negatively associated with the probability of adoption of MT. Controlling for long-term averages in rainfall shocks that matter for maize (column B), we find that the probability of adoption is significantly lower in places where the variation in rainfall during the first 10 days of maize season is higher. On the other hand, the probability of adoption is significantly higher where the long-term variation in rainfall during the flowering season is higher, indicating that farmersâ incentives to adopt MT are more sensitive to long-term variation in rainfall when excessive rain can damage the crop and could be particularly problematic in high slopes."
365,534,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The AgMIP RIA methods are designed to assess vulnerability of farm households to climate change. We define a climate as a probability distribution of weather events that occur at a specific place and during a defined period of time. A change in climate is a change in the probability distribution of weather events. These changes are often described in terms of the mean temperature over a period of time such as a day, month or year, but can also be changes in temperature extremes, the variability of weather events, and other aspects such as rainfall amount and intensity and wind velocity. Impacts of climate change are quantified as gains and losses in economic wellbeing (e.g., farm income or per capita income) or other metrics of well-being (e.g., changes in health or environmental quality). In this framework, some or all individuals may gain or lose from a change, and we say the losers are vulnerable to loss from climate change. The AgMIP RIA methodology is designed to quantify the proportion of the population that are losers, as well as the magnitude of loss. It is important to note, however, that in a heterogeneous population there are typically some gainers and some losers, and thus the net impact may be positive or negative. The AgMIP RIA method is designed to quantify climate vulnerability by modeling a heterogeneous population of farm households rather than modeling a ârepresentativeâ or average or typical farm. This approach begins with the representation of impacts on the farm household using the concept of economic gains and losses (other metrics of impact can be also be used depending on available data, e.g., the impact on health of household members). As Fig. 3 shows, the AgMIP RIA approach uses a statistical representation of the farming system in a heterogeneous region or population to quantify the distribution of gains and losses, e.g., due to climate change. Figure 4 illustrates this idea with two loss distributions. The area under the distribution on the positive side of zero is the proportion of losers and is the measure"

Researchers analyzing Ukrainian circular migration to Hungary underline its positive aspects in terms of migrantsâ economic activity in the face of Hungaryâs ageing population (Kincses and RÃ©dei 2009). In contrast, studies on Ukrainian, Albanian and Moroccan circular migrants in Italy and Spain (Triandafyllidou 2011: 5), illustrate the negative side of circular migration by stressing that longer absence of migrants from work in the destination country (while they visit the home country) is negatively valued by the employers, as they âwant reliable, stable, year-round migrant workersâ. Other negative aspects of Ukrainian temporary migration to Europe are often linked in the literature to irregularity, with irregular status becoming a major concern for receiving countries which not only lose out in terms of their national budget (undeclared work of migrants) and the additional costs of control and detention but also have to somehow address the issue of a group at risk of exploitation and marginalization (see Malynovska 2011). Moreover, it has been stressed in the literature that Ukrainian temporary migration, especially when the secondary sector of the labour market is involved, reproduces social, ethnic and gender inequalities (Fedyuk 2012, 2015; Tolstokorova 2010)."
241,965,0.988,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Background levels assume that transformations in the landscape have reached steady state, that is their natural release is in balance with natural removal processes. Increasing numbers of studies, however, show that transformations can either decrease or increase in their efï¬ciency with changing environmental conditions. For example, Weyhenmeyer and Jeppesen (2010) reported that the efï¬ciency of nitrate removal from freshwaters varies with changes in N deposition. Since substantial fractions of substances are retained or lost in boreal catchments by a wide range of transformation processes, changes in transformation processes within the landscape will have major impacts on river export. HÃ¤gg et al. (2010) estimated that about 75 % of the anthropogenic N deposited from the atmosphere was retained within the boreal landscape before entering the sea. Retention capacity varies depending on background levels and the biogeochemical process in question. There are indications that southern parts of the boreal region surrounding the Baltic Sea are more N-saturated than northern parts (Weyhenmeyer and Jeppesen 2010), resulting in a more effective N retention capacity in northern landscapes than southern. This pattern is probably also valid for other substances and will be affected by changes in trends in atmospheric deposition."
382,83,0.988,"A History of Male Psychological Disorders in Britain, 1945â1980","Authors interested in occupational health outside Britain were more forthcoming about drawing associations between repeated absence, neurosis and peptic ulcer. Some went further and drew a direct correlation between neurosis, heavy drinking and stomach disorders. One Australian study of repeated sickness absence in a range of occupations specifically noted: âNeurosis, smoking and peptic ulcer, found to be linked with drinking, and the physical consequences of drinking to excess, no doubt contributed to the liability of the drinker to be absent repeatedly.â70 The author of this research unequivocally stated that social factors, such as conjugal failure, drinking and other âpersonal maladjustmentâ, contributed to repeated sickness absence.71 The same author, in a study of neurosis among male telegraph workers in Australia, found that one-third (33 per cent) of the 516 workers who were examined were considered to have, or to have had, disabling neurosis.72 Most subjects mentioned more than one influence as being contributory to their symptoms. Among personal and domestic reasons, those most commonly cited were family ill health, money worries and marital discord. Occupational influences included inability to cope with the job, monotony and job dissatisfaction.73 Similar concerns were raised by contributors to an international, interdisciplinary series of symposia on society, stress and disease that took place through the 1970s. In the fourth of a resulting series of publications edited by Lennart Levi, Swedenâs first Professor of Psychosocial Medicine, two Swedish authors examined stress and strain among Scandinavian, white-collar workers.74 They drew strong correlations between high levels of mental strain, the use of sedatives and tranquillisers, gastric disorders and nerves. The study did not include analysis of gendered patterns of illness, but nevertheless made the explicit observation that workers who reported psychological reactions to mental strain at work had âa much higher frequency of medical complaints, above all in the form of gastric and nervous troublesâ.75 Their conclusions were that psychological and psychosomatic reactions were likely to occur simultaneously.76"
77,169,0.988,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Social workers, and other members of the multidisciplinary CF team have an important role in helping people with CF navigate the welfare system, so that they are clear about the benefits that they are entitled to, and the support available to help people with chronic illness in the workplace. This is particularly important at the moment, in the context of the widespread changes to the welfare and benefits system in the UK, with the drive to reduce the number of people claiming Disability Living Allowance. A recent study by Nash et al. demonstrated that the majority of adult patients with CF claim some benefits, and the majority of these were concerned about the planned reforms (Nash et al. 2011). Furthermore, the concerns of the CF community regarding the changes to the welfare system were outlined in a submission by the CF Trust to the Department of Work and Pensions (2011). Further efforts are required to identify effective workplace, rehabilitation, and other interventions to reduce the employment disadvantage experienced by people with CF, particularly for those from more disadvantaged areas. A key question for practicing physicians raised by our studies is what role health care delivery plays in mitigating or potentiating health inequalities in CF. In the UK, we have demonstrated a mixed picture, and action is required to understand the inequalities in access to inhaled therapies uncovered, and to promote the pro-poor delivery of care demonstrated for other treatments, that may be effective in limiting increases in outcome inequality over time. The potential utility of systematically targeting more intensive therapy at children living in disadvantaged circumstances should be investigated further (Gupta et al. 2009). The adoption of system-based methods to optimize consistency in the use of best care practices might help further minimize variations in prescribed care (Schechter et al. 2009). Furthermore, the early appearance of inequalities, and the potential for decreasing inequality in weight in the first few years of life, focusses policies on the early years, and provides support for new-born screening programmes in CF. Ultimately, however, while individually focussed interventions may be of some limited success, the long term solution to health inequalities in people with CF and in the general population is likely to be one that takes broader action to address the âsocial determinants of healthâ (CSDH 2008). These are the âconditions in which we are born, grow up, work and liveâ, and include income and income distribution, education, employment and working conditions, housing, food insecurity, race/ethnicity, and gender roles. These factors provide a particularly important context for a family dealing with the stresses of caring for a child with a complex chronic illness like CF over a lifetime. The evidence is clear, unfortunately, that we have made little progress over the last few decades in reducing health inequalities (Marmot et al. 2010). However, the analysis presented in this chapter provides further evidence that the early years represent the key period for targeting interventions to reduce inequalities. An important place to start would be to renew efforts in the UK to reduce childrenâs exposure to poverty, by for instance (Marmot et al. 2010): â¢ maximising household incomes, by helping parents into employment; â¢ providing affordable housing;"
97,168,0.988,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Cities, if exposed to hazards, are hotspots of vulnerability due to the concentration of people and infrastructures. It is increasingly acknowledged that the human vulnerability to natural hazards is the result of the socio-economic, physical and environmental processes that characterise a social-ecological system and is thus socially constructed (Oliver-Smith 1999). This view of hazards is even more relevant in urban areas where the environment is highly modified by physical infrastructures and socio-economic activities. Cities are centres of interchange of knowledge, cultures, innovations and goods. To facilitate exchanges, these are often located in the proximity of rivers and seas making them exposed to a number of hazards such as storms, flooding, cyclones, coastal erosion and sea level rise (Sherbinin et al. 2007). Urban sprawl can exacerbate impacts of hazards through âpoor urban management, inadequate planning, high population density, inappropriate construction, ecological imbalances and infrastructure dependencyâ (Jacobs 2005). As a result, cities of developed countries may face the highest impacts in terms damages assets and economic losses (Dickson et al. 2012). In the US, catastrophic events have increased in the last 35 years according to MunichRe NatCatService.1 In healthy environments, ecosystems do not strictly experience disaster in the same way that we consider disaster in the human context. When discussing risks to ecosystems, ecologists tend to discuss this in terms of disturbance (e.g. Attiwill 1994; Swetnam and Betancourt 2010). In fact, variation and extremes in weather and climate and other disturbances have always been part of the functioning of natural ecosystems and provide a wide range of benefits such as soil fertilization in floodplains in the case of floods or groundwater recharge in the case of intense precipitation events associated, for instance, with typhoons. However, major impacts on the ecosystem might occur if hazards affect a degraded and less diverse ecosystems, as is often the case in and around cities (Alberti 2005). This could translate to a temporary or even permanent decline or impairment in supplying necessary ecosystem services to urban and peri-urban areas. Mitigating and adapting to climate change in and around cities thus needs to take into account the interacting effects of the built infrastructure and climate change on the ecological or biophysical components of local and regional ecosystems. If we are to utilize nature-based solutions (NBS) for CCA and DRR, then the health and function of urban ecosystems is of primary importance for providing effective climate regulating services. https://www.munichre.com/en/reinsurance/business/non-life/natcatservice/index.html (Retrieved on 13th of October 2016)."
38,65,0.988,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Trends in ecosystem extent and distribution are highly dependent on the scale of the evaluation being undertaken. For example, at a given scale, coastal wetlands may appear to be uninterrupted and uniform. However, at a more resolved scale, edges, patches, corridors associated with tidal creeks, and discontinuous distributions of species become evident. Forested and tree rich landscapes have a high connectivity for forest birds, but that may not be the case for carabid beetles and butterflies. Deï¬ning systems in terms of local organisation or dominant species facilitates discussion and analysis, but may also obscure the important linkages between systems across landscapes. It is therefore important to deï¬ne the systems under consideration and the appropriate scale and resolution at which to observe and analyse them, before discussing trends in their extent and distribution. Trends in the extent and distribution of ecological systems depend on the temporal and spatial scale of the assessment. Temporal changes occur naturally over long time scales, such as those associated with geological and climatological forces (e.g., glaciation). Change can also occur more quickly as a result of direct shifts in land use such as deforestation and urbanisation or the drainage of wetlands. Thus, trends can be the result of natural forces but may be accelerated by human pressure or exclusively due to human activities. RS products have a high potential for mapping habitat extent and distribution maps at various scales. Hyperspatial (very high resolution) and hyperspectral sensors have greatly enhanced the possibilities of distinguishing related habitat types at very ï¬ne scales. The end-users can use such maps for estimating range and area of habitats, but they could also serve to deï¬ne and update the sampling frame (the statistical âpopulationâ) of habitats for which ï¬eld sample surveys are in place."

Predick, Susanne Schwinning, Robert J. Steidl, and Steven R. Woods Abstract Woody vegetation in grasslands and savannas has increased worldwide over the past 100â200 years. This phenomenon of âwoody plant encroachmentâ (WPE) has been documented to occur at different times but at comparable rates in rangelands of the Americas, Australia, and southern Africa. The objectives of this chapter are to review (1) the process of WPE and its causes, (2) consequences for ecosystem function and the provision of services, and (3) the effectiveness of management interventions aimed at reducing woody cover. Explanations for WPE require consideration of multiple interacting drivers and constraints and their variation through time at a given site. Mean annual precipitation sets an upper limit to woody plant cover, but local patterns of disturbance (fire, browsing) and soil properties (texture, depth) prevent the realization of this potential. In the absence of these constraints, seasonality, interannual variation, and intensity of precipitation events determine the rate and extent of woody plant expansion. Although probably not a triggering factor, rising atmospheric CO2 levels may have favored C3 woody plant growth. WPE coincided with the global intensification of livestock grazing that by reducing fine fuels, hence fire frequency and intensity, facilitated WPE. From a conservation perspective, WPE threatens the maintenance of grassland and savanna"

In comparison between LWR-OT and LWR-PuT, reductions are observed in Pu amount, repository footprint, and decay time of toxicity, although they are not drastic. Important benefits of MOX utilization are Pu isotopic deterioration as a nuclear weapon and improved confinement of radionuclides by calcinations, as discussed by Nishihara et al. [7]. However, there remains 110 t of separated Pu that can raise concerns about proliferation. In comparison between conventional and transmutation scenarios, significant reductions of TRU amount, repository area, and decay time of toxicity are observed. The remaining Pu undergoes several irradiations in the transmuter and is highly resistant to weapon utilization. Repository area is about one fifth and decay time is reduced by one tenth in the maximum case. To achieve such benefit, a total of 15â32 transmuters have to be introduced for 180â240 years with corresponding reprocessing and fabrication facilities. Cost and risk during operation of these facilities would be high compared to their reduction in the repository in the further future. Comparing the transmutation scenarios, the number of units in the FR scenario is fewest owing to its high thermal output. However, transmutation performance is"
376,955,0.988,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Summary. Livestock (primarily including cattle, sheep, goats, equines, and camelids) provide the food and traditional economic basis for people living in the rangelands of developing countries; cultivation or wage employment opportunities are typically rare or nonexistent. The indigenous species and breeds are adapted to often harsh production conditions, and the flexibility of herd movement is very important for helping pastoralists cope with erratic rainfall patterns and disease outbreaks. Unlike the people on rangelands, population trends for livestock are more difficult to discern. Overall, livestock populations in some cases may exhibit âboom-and-bustâ patterns where growth periods are followed by sudden die-offs due to combinations of weather, disease, or level of forage competition among livestock. The spatial scale and frequency of herd crashes vary markedly. The difficulty in mitigating large herd losses is due to low levels of economic development and public investment. Mitigating such losses matters, however, because recurrent dieoffs translate into large economic losses for pastoral societies. For less-developed regions where human survival is most closely linked to livestock survival, the ratio of animals to people provides an important indicator of both food and asset security. Where this ratio has been monitored, the evidence shows that it has markedly"

Moreover, the risks of autonomous driving appear to be relatively minor in many respects. Technology-related accidents would occur with a certain probability, which could be minimized, but not eliminated, in an intensive test phase. Unlike in the case of nuclear energy, for example, their consequences would be relatively minor in geographic and temporal terms (compare the half-lives of radioactive materials) as well as with respect to the number of involved people and the property damage. A worst-case scenario of catastrophic proportions does not apply. Largely new is the digital networking potentially associated with the automation of driving, with all of its implications for possible systemic risks, vulnerabilities, privacy and surveillance. These will inevitably be major issues in any public debate on autonomous driving. But as these challenges are also present in a multitude of other ï¬elds (including, increasingly, non-autonomous driving), they would be unlikely to lead to risk concerns relating speciï¬cally to autonomous driving. One special case is the business risk assessment by manufacturers (Sect. 3.3), both in terms of the return on investment and potential reputation problems due to accidents. Any such business assessment must work with extremely uncertain assumptions, for instance concerning the mediaâs willingness to play up scandals as well as the effect of any such scandals in themselves. Here misperceptions can arise in both directions: exaggerated fears and naive optimism. It is to be expected, in any event, that from the public perspective, scandals would be speciï¬cally attributed to a particular brand rather than to autonomous driving as an abstract concept. That may hold no consolation for the affected brand; but it does indicateâat least insofar as the beneï¬ts of autonomous driving are undisputedâthat this type of problem would impact the competition between the manufacturers, but not autonomous driving as a technology in itself. And that is already the case for other technologies today. Overall, the public risk constellation tends towards being unproblematic. It cannot be compared with genetic engineering or nuclear technology: there is no catastrophic scenario, the beneï¬t is readily apparent, the introduction proceeds through a market and not by decree âfrom aboveâ. And it would probably not occur overnight âat the flip of a switch,â but gradually."

This should apply to both passengers and the entire trafï¬c system in which the autonomous vehicle is in motion. What this requirement means, and whether it would actually be fulï¬lled upon the introduction of the autonomous vehicle, is the focus of the following discussion. A starting point is provided by Gasser et al. [4]: The report from the German Federal Highway Research Institute considers the development of accident numbers upon the introduction of vehicle automation. Starting from the total number of accidents for conventional driving (see Fig. 21.1, blue and green ï¬eld) it is assumed that accidents (green ï¬eld) are avoided by means of vehicle automation. However, new accidents could also be caused by the risks of automation (yellow ï¬eld). This representation does not differentiate in terms of the severity of the accident, but the severity of the accident is also relevant when considering the impact on safety. Safety is generally described as the absence of unreasonable risks. This risk is deï¬ned as a product of the probability of an accident and the severity of that accident. Figure 21.2 illustrates in a qualitative way this theoretical risk avoidance potential depending on the severity of the accident. Here Fig. 21.2 adheres to the ï¬ndings of Heinrich [5] and HydÃ©n [6] that accidents of decreasing severity occur in larger numbers. The scale of the related severity of the accident is ordinal, meaning that there is clearly an order between the different degrees of severity: For example, a fatality is weighted as graver than a serious injury. However, academics are divided on the relative weighting of these different degrees. While degrees of severity are compared in terms of costs, this is contentious and will not be discussed further in this work."

Here policy options are seen not as solutions but as hypotheses to be tested under a regime where formalized learning and management are objectives for which experimentation is the key (Rist et al. 2013). Interventions can be risky, especially in riverine SES, which are â. . .open systems that cannot be isolated from their social contextâ (Konrad et al. 2011). However, some river managers do choose to actively intervene in response to some emerging problem. Often a lack of data challenges managers trying to understand and manage how environmental ï¬ows contribute to the serviceable functioning of a river. A history of water control structure construction has almost eliminated naturally ï¬owing rivers. In North America construction of more than 2.5 million control structures have left less than 2% of all rivers naturally ï¬owing (Lytle and Poff 2004), with a similarly small percentage of naturally ï¬owing rivers in Europe (see Chap. 6). This denies most managers naturally occurring reference ï¬ow conditions to use as performance criteria. Social awareness of this extreme state has been heightened by the growing recognition of societyâs dependence on increasingly fragile aquatic resources. Many rivers are stressed and over-allocated in order to serve the demands of growing populations through hydro-engineering (Chen et al. 2015). In response, societal values have shifted to question this history, and managers have been compelled to modify operations of these control structures to mitigate physical and biological impacts on aquatic ecosystems (Rood et al. 2003)."
344,185,0.988,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"The UNU, WHO and FAO (2004) recommend that energy needs cannot be considered in isolation of other nutrients as âthe lack of one will influence the others.â Ecker and Qaim (2011) maintain that micronutrient deficiencies, especially in minerals and vitamins, are often even more widespread in developing countries than calorie deficiencies, which contributes to severe health problems in these countries. Looking beyond caloric availability is therefore critical, particularly when people suffer from multiple nutritional deficiencies as is often the case in developing countries, Malawi included. Hence, in the Malawi microsimulation model, Ecker et al. (2012) focus on a wider range of nutritional indicators. Rather than using consumption changes observed in the CGE model directly in the nutrition model, Ecker et al. (2012) adopt the two-stage micro-econometric model developed by Ecker and Qaim (2011) to first estimate consumption changes in response to household income changes.4 In the first stage food demand elasticities are estimated assuming a quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS). In the second stage the technical coefficients from the first-stage estimation are translated into own-price, cross-price and income elasticities for different nutrients, including calories, protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins A, B3 (riboflavin), B9 (folate), B12, and C. Elasticities are estimated separately for rural and urban households across the different household quintiles. These form the basis of the microsimulation model: CGE results on income changes for different household groups are now fed into the microsimulation model where elasticities are applied to estimate new deficiency levels across the various nutrients. From the discussion it should be apparent that the main difference between the two model frameworks lies in the specification of the microsimulation components and the way in which results from the âmacroâ model are linked to the âmicroâ level. In the Tanzania model caloric availability is calculated directly on the basis of changes in consumption quantities for different consumption items included in the CGE model. As discussed, these consumption changes are determined in an LES demand system, subject to relative price and income changes. In contrast, in the Malawi model, only changes in real household income are passed down to the micro-level. Changes in nutrient availability are calculated on the basis of income elasticities derived from a QUAIDS, a somewhat more flexible and advanced demand system, but one that stands distinct from the CGE modelâs LES demand system."

Globally, we can conclude that VLV faced the challenge of fair inclusion of the poor in the survey with success. For functional health, the VLV estimates can be compared with two recent reports from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office on the elderly living in private households (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Statistik [OFS/BFS] 2014) and in institutions (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Statistik 2012). According to the findings of the VLV survey, 86.9 % of people aged 65 and more were found to be independent, as opposed to the 91 % claimed by the first OFS/BFS study. Moreover, VLV estimates that 6.9 % of elderly people are in a situation of difficulty, meaning that they are generally able to accomplish all activities of daily living themselves but uneasily for at least one of them. Additionally, an estimated 6.1 % are no longer capable of performing their daily activities independently, meaning that they require external help with at least one activity. Contrasting these results, the BFS/OFS report found 7 % of elderly people in Switzerland with difficulties5 and 2 % being completely dependent. Based on the comparison with this first report, VLV seems to have slightly over-reported the prevalence of dependence in the population. The differences between the VLV data and the aforementioned report, however, are most likely due to differences in their samples: whereas VLV also included people living in nursing-homes, the OFS/BFS study exclusively considered those living in private households. In the second report that focused exclusively on elderly people living in care institutions (Bundesamt fÃ¼r Statistik 2012) the numbers change drastically: 96 % of individuals were found to have trouble accomplishing at least 1 activity of daily living; thus, only 4 % of individuals were completely independent. The analysis was restricted to a population that was no longer living in their own households due to the importance of their restrictions in managing their daily lives, which explains these very high percentages. Given these two selective and therefore biased sources, however, it seems plausible that VLV generally captured a relatively representative sample of the general population, in terms of functional health, especially thanks to the proxy procedure. Finally, comparing the mental health findings in VLV with those from other sources was not a straightforward task, since there are many indicators to measure depressive symptoms, different classifications to determine the actual categories and statuses of psychic health or to measure the intensity of depressive disturbances, and generally very little research on the topic of elderly people with depression. A relatively exhaustive report on depression among the Swiss population by the Swiss Health Observatory (OBSAM) estimated the prevalence of depressive symptoms among the elderly population (Baer et al. 2013). The results are summarized and contrasted with VLV figures in Table 8."
353,201,0.988,"Disability, Health and Human Development","The association seems stronger and more consistent than in earlier studies (e.g., Filmer 2008; Mitra et al. 2013; Trani et al. 2015). These results support the inclusion of moderate and severe functional difficulties as potential correlates of deprivations in poverty monitoring, evaluation, and programmatic efforts in LMICs. It also supports a disaggregation by functional difficulty status of the indicators used to monitor the SDGs, in particular SDG #1, which states as a goal the eradication of hunger and poverty âin all its formsâ (UNDP 2016). The result on household-level economic insecurity is consistent with results from qualitative research that deprivations are not contained to the individual and are also a âfamily affairâ (Grech 2016). This result also implies that policies aimed to improve household wellbeing need to pay attention to functional difficulties. Indeed, despite the development of social protection programs in recent years in the four countries, deprivations in terms of material wellbeing and food insecurity are widespread, and disproportionately so among households with functional difficulties. 3. For some individual and household outcomes (job type, assets, total expenditures), results were not consistent across countries. In three countries, total expenditures do not differ across functional status, which is consistent with earlier results in the literature. Total expenditures may reflect additional expenditures associated with a functional difficulty (e.g., health, transportation and care expenditures). 4. This analysis also shows that not all persons with functional difficulties are poor; persons with disabilities are not always among the poorest of the poor. Some persons with functional difficulties do achieve levels of wellbeing comparable to persons with no difficulty. 5. The association between functional difficulties and deprivations was found for both severe and moderate functional difficulties, although it was typically larger and more often significant for the former. Moderate functional difficulties are also correlates of deprivations, and there is a severity gradient in the association between deprivations and functional difficulties, consistent with other findings in the literature (Banks et al. 2014). 6. Analyses should try to incorporate the degree of functional difficulties through several categories (e.g., moderate, severe) or a"

In such cases, AS (through the processes of primary succession) increase species richness and taxonomic diversity in a given area and increase and strengthen functional diversity and/or provide new services and goods (Bonsdorff 2006; Kotta et al. 2006). It must be emphasised that the Baltic Sea is âa sea of aliensâ (LeppÃ¤koski et al. 2002), since almost all marine organisms present today invaded the area sometime over the last 10,000 years. However, as it was mentioned previously, the invasion rate has accelerated enormously since the 1950s mainly due to human activities (such as maritime transportation and habitat change). Moreover, synergistic effects of factors such as pollution, eutrophication, overfishing and climate change stimulate new invasions (Fig. 4.2). Changes in environmental conditions and human pressure have on the one hand resulted in the elimination of highly specialised or sensitive native species from the Baltic ecosystem, while on the other hand they have generated and opened niches that have been quickly inhabited by new species. To some extent, the process of bioinvasion can be regarded as positive when species richness and taxonomic diversity are considered. For example, studies on the widespread Baltic invasive polychaete Marenzelleria spp. have shown that although this species has become dominant, it has not adversely affected deeper benthic communities, since it fills an âemptyâ niche. However, in shallow waters this has not been the case, and Marenzelleria spp. competes with the native polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor and affects the abundance of the amphipod Monoporeia affinis (DidÅ¾iulis 2006; Kotta and Olafsson 2003). Other positive consequences of alien species introduction include human benefits from both AS and IAS which has actually polarised public perceptions about bioinvasion. For example, Eriocheir sinensis (Chinese mitten crab), a famous"

This reconciliation must be founded on the acknowledgement that both the population and the stock of resources are mutually dependent. The arguments proposed by Boserup should be expanded with two decisive contributions of the Malthusian tradition: on the one hand, the acknowledgement that natural resources are finite and that the possibilities for transformation are limited; and on the other hand, that social systems have not stopped growing since they first appeared. Precisely for that reason, reconciliation would entail assuming a more complex vision of population growth that does not only consider demographic components but also their level of consumption and the ways in which they relate to one another. Ultimately, the intensification of production can lead to the generalisation of unsustainable management practices and, therefore, to soil degradation. However, this is not a linear process; instead, it responds to the conditions established in each metabolic regime. In this respect, the case study examined here allows us to identify two key phases in this process. The first phase was in the late nineteenth century, when erosion reached high levels, and nutrients were mined, which would have ensured sustainability in the medium term. The second phase was in the final few decades of the twentieth century, when soil losses were greatest and over-fertilisation appeared as one of the most serious environmental problems in the history of agriculture. The first phase was the result of the exhaustion of productive possibilities within a still organic or solar agrarian metabolic regime, which was therefore incapable of meeting the needs of the entire population, especially the poorest peasants. The agrarian liberal reforms favoured access to land for a very large group of peasants, and thus fostered population growth. Both factors, in the context of a solar energybased economy (Sieferle 2001), forced productive intensity14 to unsustainable levels. Although the development of a Boserupian strategy can be perceived over the course of the nineteenth century through the intensification of farming land, for example, by reducing fallow, this did not prevent the situation from later bordering on a Malthusian crisis, which resulted in sharp declines in biological standards of living and emigration (CÃ¡mara 2007). In the late twentieth century, in contrast, within the context of an industrial metabolic regime and with a declining population, the pressure on the agro-ecosystem of MontefrÃ­o increased to levels hitherto unseen. The current economic situation of the sector, in which farmers are losing purchasing power, has been an incentive to opt for more invasive technologies, which in theory would allow them to multiply yields whilst saving on labour (Beaufoy 2001), following a pattern repeated elsewhere (Ananda and Herath 2003). The lack of adequate compensation for the costs derived from introducing plant cover also explains why the use of weed killers and the overuse of nitrogenous fertilisers continue to occur in spite of the negative effects on the soil."
151,449,0.988,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Several models were also used to estimate upper-limit exposure of honey bees to CPY through consumption of water from puddles or dew. All models suggest that the risk of CPY is below the LOC for this pathway. Laboratory experiments with field-treated foliage, and semi-field and field tests with honey bees, bumble bees, and alfalfa leafcutting bees indicate that exposure to foliage, pollen and/or nectar is hazardous to bees up to 3 d after application of CPY to a crop. Pollinators exposed to foliage, pollen or nectar after this time should be minimally affected. Several data gaps and areas of uncertainty were identified, which apply to CPY and other foliar insecticides. These primarily concern the lack of exposure and toxicological data on non-Apis pollinators. Overall, the rarity of reported bee kill incidents involving CPY indicates that compliance with the label precautions and good agricultural practice with the product is the norm in North American agriculture. Overall, we concluded that, provided label directions and good agricultural practices are followed, the use of CPY in agriculture in North America does not present an unacceptable risk to honeybees.

386,153,0.988,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"is animal production. One of the first studies in this field (Mann and KÃ¶gl 2003) was motivated by the experience of failed investments in northeast Germany. By that time, the animal density in the sparsely populated region was extremely low, so that politicians managed to attract some investors for large-scale (capacity 10,000 animals) pig fattening stables. However, only nine out of the 18 investments were realized, whereas the rest was prevented by local resistance. A combination of a survey and interviews with local mayors revealed some patterns important for acceptance, which differed considerably between villages with investments and villages without investment. In villages without investment, the economic argument was the main driving factor. If residents believed a pig stable would generate new jobs and added value for the local economy, they would be in favour of it, but not if they did not believe in this economic effect. This economic concern faded as soon as the stables were built. From this time on, environmental factors became important. People who found the odour of pig farms problematic and who expected water pollution were now the ones against the investment. Another factor that was crucial for the acceptance of the investment project and surfaced in the study was the social integration of the potential investor. Persons with a network in the village, perhaps by being sponsors of the local fire brigade, had much better chances to succeed with their investment project than foreigners with little relation to the target community. A related finding was validated when Soland et al. (2013) analysed the acceptance of Swiss biogas plants: Information offered to the local population increased trust and perceived benefits while reducing scepticism. Gerlach and Spiller (2008) could not prove that decisions on new stables in rural areas would be based on negotiations. They considered farmers in a position so weak that the lack of clear legal guidelines would prevent many new investments. Given that the economic effects of animal production goes beyond the locality, their point may be an important one. Whereas radioactive waste depositories are often built without majority support of the local population, a society that wants to produce (or at least eat) meat should be able to define mechanisms that enable the investment in efficient production sites."
161,173,0.988,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"number of clinic visits within a community before and after implementation of mHealth services. Concrete cases of health outcomes derived from mHealth have been few and far between (Hall, Fottrell, Wilkinson, & Byass, 2014). Moreover, many of the proposed beneï¬ts of mHealth have been largely speculative in the literature (see Hall et al., 2014). For example, scholars may speculate about mHealthâs potential in transforming health care (Steinhubl, Muse, & Topol, 2013), posit psychological mechanisms in using mHealth to combat obesity (Castelnuovo et al., 2014), recommend the potential use of mHealth apps for managing cannabis use (Norberg et al., 2015), or opine that mHealth has the potential to aid asthma self-management (Pinnock, Slack, Pagliari, Price, & Sheikh, 2007). However, such postulations remain largely unsubstantiated and there is yet to be concrete evidence justifying the use of mHealth, prompting scholars to pause for a âreality checkâ (PLOS Medicine Editors, 2013). In other words, the claims of large âeffectsâ often remain unsubstantiated. According to Tomlinson et al., (2013), there is little evidence regarding the likely uptake, efï¬cacy and effectiveness of mHealth initiatives, many of which do not progress beyond pilot studies. Hall et al. (2014) concur with the dearth of evidence for health outcomes, suggesting that most âevidenceâ related to mHealth is predicated on pilot studies and small-scale implementations and are sometimes merely anecdotal [see also Kahn, Yang, & Kahn (2010) and Gurman, Rubin, & Roess, 2012]. Chib (2013) posited that the majority of studies on mHealth in low income and low- and upper-middle-income countries have techno-optimistic views and have little theoretical support. The potential effectiveness of mHealth also appears to be contingent upon the environment it is employed in; mHealth may be more effective in a community that is technologically fluent, has strong organizational infrastructure, and has adequate resources to implement an mHealth initiative. In contrast, mHealth may not operate as effectively within a community that is not technologically proï¬cient, is lacking in infrastructure, and has limited staff and ï¬nances to carry out an mHealth initiative. For example, an mHealth app that works with a community in New York City may notâand would most likely notâwork as well in a different community, say, in rural India. As another example, Bullen (2013) suggested that implementation of mHealth in Cambodia would be challenging because of the countryâs system, culture, and dynamics; Bullen opined there were four hurdles: ï¬rst, most Cambodians have multiple Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards, thus the frequent switching of SIM cards may compromise mHealth efforts. Second, most mobile phones used by Cambodians are not smartphones, and thus there are limited functionalities. Furthermore, most mobile phones do not support the national language, Khmer, and most Cambodians do not understand English. Third, many Cambodians do not own mobile phones but share phones instead. Fourth, as there is much unregulated commercial spam in Cambodia, phone users may mistake mHealth efforts as spam. Because the lived experiences, values, beliefs, and culture of âwesternâ countries are markedly different from Asia, an mHealth app cannot be expected to replicate results from one"
365,1009,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Our analyses show that while sustainable farming practices improve productivity and profitability on average, the timing and variations of climatic conditions significantly impact results, and are even shown in some cases to have a negative impact. This means that achieving adaptation benefits for individual households requires sufficient understanding of specific climate patterns, particularly during âcritical growing periodsâ of crops. Our results indicate the high returns to including climate change effects directly into agricultural development planning and investments. The findings of this study imply that NMR agricultural policies should prioritize MT for upland maize, especially where the rainfall at the beginning of the season is a constraint, and SIP on paddy in more productive irrigated flat lands especially where high temperatures during heading stage are a limiting factor. However, sustainable practices often have higher upfront capital and labour requirements, which may prevent or impede adoption. Our findings suggest the importance of local climate and socio-economic contexts in determining which practices will actually be climate-smart. In some cases we find that sustainable land management practices will be the best CSA option â however in others this is not the case. For example, SIP generates benefits under high temperatures, but is not a good option in places where the long-term average of maximum temperatures during critical periods for rice growth is high. MT is effective under low rainfall conditions and thus could reduce the negative impact of changes in rainfall variation at critical stages of maize cropping. These results indicate the importance of using climate information for targeting the promotion of improved practices, and building adaptive capacity amongst the farming population. Another important finding of this work is the role of extension. Access to extension information is among the major enablers of adoption identified in the analysis. The results suggest that extension is found to have important spillover effects as adoption is higher where the proportion of adopters in the commune is higher. Returns to extension investments could be quite high in terms of increasing adoption and adaptive capacity of farmers."
230,564,0.988,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"13.6 Conclusions and Future Work This short account has identified some of the most widely encountered plastics in everyday use and illustrated some of the attempts that have been made to assess their potential hazards to human health. Different routes of exposure to human populations, both of plastic additives, micro- and nanoplastics from food items and from discarded debris are discussed in relation to the existing literature for nanomedicines and nanocomposite packaging materials, for which an increasing body of knowledge exists. It is clear that our understanding of the potential contamination of the human population by micro- or nanoplastics sourced from the environment is in its infancy, leaving many questions unanswered: â¢ Does significant bioaccumulation and trophic transfer for micro- and nanoplastics occur in the environment? If so, what species are most at risk? â¢ How does ageing of plastics affect their physico-chemical properties and subsequent toxicity? â¢ Following ingestion, does uptake of micro- and nanoplastics occur? Do proteins bind to the surface of the particles to form a protein corona? How does this vary for different plastic litter types and what cell types are most vulnerable to toxicity? â¢ What methods should we be using for locating, identifying and quantifying micro- and nanoplastics in complex matrices including biological tissues? Techniques mentioned in this chapter include field flow fractionation, multiangled light scattering (MALS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and non-linear optical bioimaging. Further development of suitable methods for extracting micro- and nanoplastics from biological materials and for studying them in situ remains a compelling research gap for the future.

92,141,0.988,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Considerable investments have been made in maternal and child health data management in South Africa. South Africa has governmental, academic, and community infrastructure facilities that are active in maternal and child health suggesting that this country would be able to source and monitor data on child and maternal health. Despite advancements in maternal and child health, South Africa still has significant numbers of under-five mortality or mother-child HIV transmission (Groenewald et al. 2014; Cock et al. 2000) so the interest to improve data capturing and management persists. Disparities in access to health have been in existence pre- and post-apartheid in this country, which unfortunately impact directly on the quality of health data that exist, and on the dissemination and translation to practice. For example, national data on child and maternal health do not include data from private sectors, making it impossible to accurately report on the status of the country with regard to this (Weimann et al. 2016). According to a study by Oni and Mayosi (2016), gaps in data management on the subject exist, at province and even at country level, underreporting on both child and maternal mortality rates. In Limpopo, a rural province in SA, public hospitals do not properly report maternal mortality, because there are no standardised tools to accurately document maternal mortality. Additionally, some pregnant patients are admitted in different wards (not maternity wards) for other ailments, and when they die in those wards, they are not recorded as maternal mortality cases. In those tertiary hospitals where mortality recording tools are in place, there is a paucity of information that is recorded, depending on the experience of the person who is recording the incidence of maternal mortality. There is an urgent need to focus on urban health in South Africa as four of the top 20 fastest growing cities in Africa are located in South Africa such as Cape Town (African Development Bank Group 2014). At the heart of this growth, migration to this city has been increasing in large proportions, in a quest to seek employment opportunities. Therefore, our health data analysis reflects the current conditions within a specific urban setting and does not allow a conclusion concerning other African settings. We rather emphasize the value of health relevant data and identify existing data and their structure, as well as recognizing data gaps."

In Asia and Europe, the higher shares of land degradation and of people residing in degrading areas are found in areas where land degradation might be masked by chemical fertilizer application. Whereas in other regions, visible decline and masking effects of rainfall and atmospheric fertilization seem to dominate. One caveat, these are still somewhat conservative estimates of the livelihoods which have potentially been affected by land degradation, because the number of people affected by land degradation is likely to be higher due to off-site and indirect externalities of land degradation."
321,16,0.988,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"Overview of This Book In Chap. 1 I begin by explaining the true nature of the demand shortage in advanced nations. Introducing the concepts of âdiffusive demandâ and âcreative demandââ namely, demand for things that already exist and demand for things that have not yet taken shape, respectivelyâI explain that diffusive demand will necessarily saturate as a given man-made object, such as an automobile, a house, or a television, reaches every part of the population in sufficient quantity. When a man-made object reaches saturation, new demand, which arises when people who do not possess something acquire it for the first time, vanishes, leaving only replacement demand, which comes from replacing or renewing something acquired previously. Concrete examples of the saturation process for housing, automobiles, and televisions in Japan and other advanced nations are given. I argue that the fundamental shift in the nature of demand to replacement or renewal demand, caused by the saturation of population and of man-made objects, lies at the heart of the demand shortage that plagues advanced economies. Moreover, many advanced nations such as Japan are now seeking relief from the demand shortages they are experiencing in their saturated domestic markets by expanding into developing countries such as China and India. However, by looking in detail at examples such as cement and automobiles, I show that developing nations like China are themselves following the same trajectory toward saturation that Japan once traced. Therefore, sooner or later China and other developing nations will likewise reach a condition of saturation. Furthermore, because the quantity of demand is necessarily higher before the saturation condition is reached as compared to after it is reached, an overcapacity of production is bound to be introduced in the pre-saturation phase that will saddle the economy in the post-saturation phase. As an example, Japanâs automobile industry has been able to cope thus far with the saturation of the domestic market (and accompanying domestic production overcapacity) by using the excess capacity for exports first to the United States, and now to China, and to India in the future."

The knowledge one can extract for the EU is that deprivation is much higher in eastern member states than, say, in Germany and Austria, but what the data we presented does not show is that within these two countries, one can easily find significant differences between regions and neighborhood.

231,209,0.988,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Situated in northern central Europe, the North Sea exhibits large climate variability with inflow of a wide range of air masses from arctic to subtropical. For this reason, it is difï¬cult to differentiate between natural and externally forced variability, despite large amounts of historical data. This chapter examines past and present studies of variability and changes in atmospheric variables over the instrumental period; roughly the last 200 years. Research areas lacking consensus in the scientiï¬c community are highlighted to stimulate further research. The main driver of atmospheric variability in the North Sea region is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Despite its apparent long-term irregularity, the NAO exhibits extended periods of positive or negative index values. No consensus exists with respect to the size of the fraction of interannual NAO variance that cannot be explained by random forcing and is therefore probably influenced by external forcing. Slowly varying natural factors with an effect on European climate, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), may superimpose long-term trends on atmospheric variability and so be difï¬cult to distinguish from the anthropogenic climate change signal. The source of atmospheric and surface data influences the results obtained, even in the comparatively data-rich North Sea region. Based on reanalysis data, several studies ï¬nd positive trends in storm activity over the North Sea region and a northeast shift in storm tracks over the past few decades. However, studies based on direct or indirect historical records of long-term variations in pressure, wind or wind-related proxies, mostly do not identify robust long-term trends. This counter-intuitive result is explained by uncertainties in the long-term historical wind and atmospheric pressure observations, and additional uncertainties arising from the lack of quality control when digitising old data as well as potential biases in the reanalyses due to the fact that the underlying amount of available data is not constant in time. Nevertheless, the northeast shift in storm tracks appears to be a new phenomenon. In contrast, the increase in wind speed and storminess in the latter half of the 20th century does not seem to be unprecedented within the context of historical observations. There are indications of an increase in the number of deep cyclones (but not in the total number of cyclones). There are also indications that the persistence of circulation types has increased over the past century. Temperatures have increased both over land and over the North Sea. There is a distinct signal in the number of frost days and the number of summer days. While there is a clear winter and spring warming signal over the Baltic Sea region, this is not as clear for the North Sea region. As expected, the"
365,426,0.988,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The analysis of impact evaluation studies show that cash transfer programmes overall have important implications for household resilience. By providing a steady and predictable source of income, cash transfer programmes can build human capital and improve food security and potentially strengthen householdsâ ability to respond to and cope with exogenous shocks, and allow them to diversity and strengthen their livelihoods to prevent future fluctuations in consumption. Many of the programmes studied increased investment in agricultural inputs and assets, including farm implements and livestock. Beneficiaries in the studied country programmes generally increased crop production and value of crop production. Although differing across countries, food security indicators revealed increases in the proportion of households being food secure as a result of cash transfer programmes. This too was met by increases in consumption and dietary diversity. Although the impacts on risk management are less uniform, the cash transfer programmes seem to strengthen community ties (via increased giving and receiving of transfers) allow households to save and pay off debts, and decrease the need to rely on adverse risk coping mechanisms. Finally, the case study of the CGP in Zambia demonstrates the potential for cash transfers to help poor households manage climate risk. Not only was CGP receipt associated with increases in total/food and non-food expenditure, and subsequently the quantity and quality of food consumed, but the CGP was also found to benefit households even when they were facing climate shocks. The CGPâs climate mitigating effect is particularly evident for households at the lowest quintiles of the distribution, meaning that the CGP better protects poorer households against climate variability than richer households. Thus cash transfers can improve poor householdsâ resilience for an uncertain future in terms of climate change. The differences in impacts across countries can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the availability of labour given the demographic profile of beneficiary households, the relative distribution of productive assets, the local economic context, the relevance of messaging and soft conditions on spending and the regularity and predictability of the transfers themselves. In the case of LEAP in Ghana, irregular payments may have prevented households from increasing consumption, as consumption is driven by permanent income. Instead, the lumpy flow of cash seems to have promoted declines in the number of households with outstanding loans and increases in the number of households with savings. In Ethiopia, the SCTPP targeted households that were particularly made up with either the elderly"

The effectiveness of landslide disaster risk reduction measures depends on scientiï¬c and technological developments for understanding disaster risk (natural hazards or events and social vulnerability), political âbuy-inâ, and on increased public awareness and education. â¢ At a higher level, social and ï¬nancial investment is vital for understanding and reducing landslide disaster risk, in particular social and institutional vulnerability through coordination of policies, planning, research, capacity development, and the production of publications and tools that are accessible, available free of charge and are easy to use for everyone in both developing and developed countries. We agree on the following initial ï¬elds of cooperation in research and capacity building, coupled with social and ï¬nancial investment: â¢ Development of people-centered early warning technology for landslides with increased precision and reliable prediction both in time and location, especially in a changing climate context. â¢ Development of hazard and vulnerability mapping, vulnerability and risk assessment with increased precision and reliability, as part of multi-hazard risk identiï¬cation and management. â¢ Development of improved technologies for monitoring, testing, analyzing, simulating, and effective early warning for landslides. â¢ Development of international teaching tools that are always updated and may be used free of charge by national and local leaders and practitioners, in developed and developing countries through the Sendai Partnerships 2015â2025. â¢ Open communication with society through integrated research, capacity building, knowledge transfer, awareness-raising, training, and educational activities to enable societies to develop effective policies and strategies for reducing landslide disaster risk, to strengthen their capacities for preventing hazards from developing into major disasters, and to enhance the effectiveness and efï¬ciency of relief programs. â¢ Development of new initiatives to study research frontiers in understanding landslide disaster risk, such as the effect of climate change on large-scale landslides and debris flows, the effective prediction of localized rainfall to provide earlier warning and evacuation, especially in developing countries, the mechanism and dynamics of submarine landslides during earthquakes that may cause or enhance tsunamis, and geotechnical studies of catastrophic megaslides for prediction and hazard assessment. All of the items above came from the discussions of ICL and its partners. Within those items, one of the most discussed parts are the effects of climate change on landslides. It was mentioned in two places as a high priority. Climate changes are studied by meteorologists, but not studied by landslide scientists and engineers. It is not easy to prove the effects of climate change on landslides in a decisive and a quantitative way. However, all agreed, in the following sentence, to add âin some landslide prone areas.â Climate change will intensify the risk of landslides in some landslide-prone areas through an increase in the frequency and/or magnitude of heavy rainfall, and shifts in the location and periodicity of heavy rainfall.

253,908,0.988,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Fundamental state duties even with regard to road trafï¬c accidents can be traced back to the constitution. In view of the hazards associated with road trafï¬c, the basic rights relating to life and physical integrity [protected by article 2, paragraph 2, clause 1 of Germanyâs Fundamental Law (GG)] are paramount. The scope of protection afforded by the basic right to life includes protection for all (universal fundamental right) not only against targeted homicide, but also against behaviors that may unintentionally (unintended interventions such as the effects of accidents) cause death. The stateâs duty to provide protection is comprehensive and also affords protection against illicit interventions by third parties. This ultimately leads, where interventions cannot be justiï¬ed, to a state duty to prohibit such interventions, for example by establishing rule of law [3]. Here a discrepancy between the realities of life in society and constitutionally grounded rights comes into focus. Notable in particular is the fact that âtrafï¬c safety [is barely discussed], although the still large number of trafï¬c deaths and permanently severely injured accident victims provide ample reason to do just thatâ [3]. Indeed, in the media major trafï¬c accidents are regularly treated as relatively insigniï¬cant matters of merely regional interest. The phenomenon that emerges from this view, namely that the dangers associated with the current trafï¬c situation, excites so little interest and plays such a minor role in the socio-political discussion [4], which can at least be seen as an indicator of broad societal acceptance of this state of affairs. At the same time, the duty to protect vis-Ã -vis the ârisks of technologyâ is critically important with regard to road trafï¬c as well. Statistics are recorded on (severe) road trafï¬c accidents (as per section 5, paragraph 3 of the Law on the Statistics of Road Trafï¬c Accidents (StVUnfStatG), with research conducted by the Federal Highway Research Institute), which enables precise monitoring of trafï¬c safety trends and accident causes (bearing in mind that the number of road trafï¬c deaths has shown an overall decline for many years). Yet the signiï¬cance of trafï¬c safety extends far beyond this as a critical factor in trafï¬c policy overall, including in (but not limited to) the establishment and adaptation of trafï¬c-related (driver permission, vehicle technology, behavioral and many other) legal regulations, but also in the design of roadways, road maintenance, road equipment, and so on. In spite of these various efforts and ongoing improvements, the status quo of 3339 deaths and 374,142 injuries (in Germany in 2013) remains a reality with which no one can truly be satisï¬ed. Finally, from a very fundamentally legal perspective, the question arises as to the constitutional rationale for these interventions in the fundamental rights to life and physical integrity. It can be argued on the basis of the mobility requirements of other fundamental rights-bearers associated with motor vehicle trafï¬c and their willingness to subject themselves to the concomitant hazards of such trafï¬c on account of the beneï¬ts associated with it. But even that is not universally valid, in particular if one considers that the dangers that flow from motor vehicles, in view of the considerable operational hazards in comparison to"
232,172,0.987,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"Table 1 shows that the tendency over the last twenty years has been to provide an estimation of the cost of nuclear accidents which would account for as many consequences as possible. This emphasis on completeness, which is particularly stressed in the IRSN study, is indeed necessary for the goals mentioned in the introduction of this paper. Ex ante policy making and ex post compensations both need to rely on a complete assessment of the consequences of a nuclear accident, since an incomplete assessment might lead to an underestimation of the cost and entail an underinvestment in nuclear safety, a disproportionate share of nuclear power in the electricity mix, or an inadequate compensation of victims [43, 44]. This quest for completeness also has its drawbacks. First, it fosters the aggregation of numbers that differ by nature. As we have seen, all costs of consequences are not assessed using the same methodologies, and are thus not subject to the same uncertainties. Summing them up to provide a global cost of nuclear accidents propagates the highest uncertainty to the ï¬nal result. Second, completeness can be detrimental to scientiï¬c rigor. Some costs currently have no corresponding assessment methods. It is the case for food bans; which are estimated in the most recent study by comparison with recent non-nuclear food bans [16]. Their integration in cost assessments is thus parochial, since they donât stand on robust economic grounds. Finally, to achieve completeness, existing studies have focused on damage and consequences, and tried to identify new consequences, or âlines of costâ. By doing so, most studies overlook the impact of nuclear countermeasures, which is the object of the next part of this paper."

10,381,0.987,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"As the Visit Somerset website (www.visitsomerset.co.ukâJune 2015) describes: âThe Internationally important Somerset Levels and Moors form a unique patchwork landscape steeped in history and brimming with rare wildlife. Today the area is mostly grassland and arable with willow grown commerciallyâ. Not surprisingly, with its rich wildlife, including the largest lowland population of breeding wading birds, the area is specially protected and supports a number of protected areas. The quote shows both the important natural value of the area, and the fact that it currently is and historically has been used for human purposes. However, the area is vulnerable to both floods and droughts. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of both events. Water shortages due to prolonged droughts can be quite harmful for the wetlands, particularly habitat and peat loss. Agriculture and villages, however, are more afraid of flooding. After some years of severe drought in 2010â2012, a lengthy flood submerged much of the area in the winter of 2013â2014. The peat soils provide various ecosystem services not only for nature itself, but also for carbon storage, food production, and the protection of the historic environment. The impacts of dry periods can create irreversible changes, such as compaction and land subsidence, which not only decreases the buffer capacity of the land, but also increases flood risks down the line. The water authority of Vechtstromen produced analysis that concentrated on the Twente region. In the region, various nature areas suffer from desiccation in dry periods. About 90 % of the creeks run (almost) dry in the summer. Much of this region is dependent on rain and groundwater. While the area does not have one large designated nature area, it includes many valuable woods, heather ï¬elds and wetlands of various sizes in a mostly small-scale landscape. For this reason it was considered an ofï¬cial âNational Landscapeâ, and is, despite the termination of this national policy programme, still considered so by all regional actors involved. Due to climate change the annual water balance gets dryer affecting also groundwater levels. This in turn can influence river discharge while in dry summers creeks are often fed by groundwater. Not only in streams and their valleys, but also on higher ground nature will deteriorate with desiccation. The map below shows both the patchwork of existing nature areas and the areas in dotted green and yellow where even smaller spots of nature that are mingled with agriculture will be developed with a priority for nature. For most of these nature areas desiccation is a serious challenge, but often nitrogen from air pollution and farming is an even bigger one. The map also shows some main waterways in the rain and sometimes even groundwater fed creek system (Fig. 12.1). The development of drought resilience measures with farmers always has to cope with some distrust that nature development is restricting rather than codeveloping with farming, which can actually be true in some instances. The overview in this section shows that most areas involved in the DROP project do have drought sensitive nature areas, even though their nature and the extent to which they are threatened by droughts vary. While it is very hard to ï¬nd data on drought impacts on Flemish nature areas, given the characteristics of the area it is"

What is missing from these concerns and the entire OâKane (2013) report is an apparent lack of a rigorous all-encompassing pro-active environmental risk assessment tool as well as one that in addition to environmental and economic attributes considers the incorporation of community or social impacts as a risk factor. Instead, the Report recommends compliance with Australian/New Zealand/ISO Standard AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009 Risk management-Principles and Guidelines (ISO 31000), a generic risk Standard which although mandatorily required by the 2012 NSW Code of Practice for Coal Seam Gas Fracture Stimulation Activities does not include a risk âtoolâ precluding it from conducting a comprehensive risk assessment unless a risk methodology is incorporated into the already overcomplicated risk process of the Standard. In addition, there is no compliance requirement to use ISO 31000 under the 2012 NSW Code of Practice for Coal Seam Gas Well Integrity an inexplicable divergence of risk management policy which is discussed further below. In Queensland there are two Codes of Practice (CoPs) which have application to CSG; the Code of Practice for constructing and abandoning coal seam gas wells and associated bores in Queensland and the Code of Practice for coal seam gas well head emissions detection and reporting, neither of which mandate a speciï¬c risk assessment tool. Further, the latter of the two is speciï¬c to CSG leaks only whereas the former applies to CSG wells and water bores but, unlike in NSW, there is no CoP which has application to fracking. The lack of speciï¬city relative to fracking in all probability leads to evasion of legal requirements to make the exploration and extraction of CSG safe for groundwater, aquifers and the environment generically."

The traditional approach to environmental risk assessment of chemical substances cannot do justice to the multitude of microplastic particles and intervening variables and, therefore, cannot be applied to determining âsafeâ or âhazardousâ levels of microplastics in natural environments [37]. Microplastics are not a homogenous group of substances, and they stem from various sources. The physicochemical properties of microplastics are as diverse as their sources. They differ in their polymeric composition, their additives, and have various shapes and sizesâ all characteristics that can influence their biological effects. Microplastics can be toxic due to associated substances like phthalates and BPA [38], they can result in physical damage due to their shape [39], and they can induce indirect effects after being ingested, such as reduced food consumption due to satiation (malnutrition or even starvation) or intestinal blockage leading to death. Furthermore, biological effects are linked to other environmental contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are absorbed by microplastic particles [40]. The lack of specific adverse effects leads to great uncertainty regarding predictions of the environmental consequences. These uncertainties were already expressed in early studies of microplastics around 30 years ago. However, despite these knowledge gaps, the problem was addressed pragmatically at that time: microplastics detected in natural waters and proven to be ingested by aquatic organisms were denoted as an âunnecessary contaminantâ [33] that is âin all likelihood not beneficialâ [41]."
230,310,0.987,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Hence, considerable quantities of end-of-life plastics are accumulating in land fills and in the natural environment. The quantity of end-of-life plastic in the marine environment is substantial but as yet there are few reliable estimates of the total amount, or the relative proportions of different types of debris such as microplastic. Recent studies have attempted to assess global distributions (CÃ³zar et al. 2014; Eriksen et al. 2014), the logical next step could be to estimate total production, current tonnage in use and accumulated disposal via recognized waste management in order to establish via a mass balance the amount of plastic that is missing and potentially in the environment (Jambeck et al. 2015). It is apparent that end-of-life plastic items are abundant and widely distributed in the oceans and that these items are progressively fragmenting into small pieces which are now abundant in the environment (Fig. 7.6). In some locations, it is evident that microplastics are numerically, as opposed to by mass, the most abundant type of solid debris present (Browne et al. 2010). However, despite the deterioration of plastic items into plastic fragments, conventional plastics will not readily biodegrade and it is considered that all of the plastics that have ever been produced are still present Fig. 7.6 Accumulation of plastic debris on a shoreline in Europe. Small fragments of plastic including microplastics pieces <5 mm are often overlooked during routine beach monitoring, but are now the most abundant items on many shorelines (Photo: R.C. Thompson)"

Till date several concerted efforts have been made in the literature to propose and design new techniques of vigilance detection with the help of features like, heart rate variability [6], galvanic skin response [6], pupil diameter, eye blink frequency [3] and brain activity measurement [7â9] (namely, EEG (Electroencephalogram), MEG (Magnetoencephalogram), fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy), ECoG (electrocorticogram), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), etc.). Although, the techniques mentioned above are good contender for vigilance detection, yet, they have several serious limitations associated with them. For instance, eye related features show strong inter-personal and intrapersonal variability, EEG suffers from poor spatial resolution, MEG requires special operating environment for its functioning, ECoG involves implantation of electrodes in an invasive manner, fMRI is associated with high equipment overhead and fNIRS suffers from low spatial resolution. Amongst the above-mentioned methods, designed for vigilance detection, EEG is the most commonly studied physiological measure despite of its poor spatial resolution. The prime reasons behind its tremendous popularity amongst researchers are: (1) its high time resolution, (2) its non-invasive nature and simplicity of operation and (3) relatively cheap cost compared to other devices. Furthermore, as vigilance deteriorates with time it seems plausible to study the brain signals in time bound fashion to assess the vigilance status in real-time. In this regard, the Event Related Potentials (ERPs) present in the EEG signals have successfully been utilized to study the changes occurring in the human brain with passing time [10]. For instance, ERP features namely P100-N200 have been utilized for studying emotional information processing in [11]; frontal midline theta and N200 ERP have been shown to reflect complementary information about expectancy and outcome evaluation in [12]; in [13] authors utilized N200 ERP for word recognition; in [14], N100, P200, N200 and P300 ERP components have been used to study the impact of depression on attention. Further, ERPs have also been used for understanding reaction times in response to pictures of people depicting pain [15]; in [16] ERPs have been utilized to understand the state of brain in schizophrenia patients; in [17] authors demonstrated the association of mMMN, P200 and P500 ERP components with artificial grammar learning in the primate brain; in [18], N400 and the P200 components have been utilized in the investigation of semantic and phonological processing in skilled and less-skilled comprehenders; besides, ERPs have also found utility in studying multisensory integration (MSI) ability of the brain in school-aged children [19]. From the above literature, we observe that P200 and N200 ERPs (see Fig. 1) have been instrumental in studying cognitive behaviour of humans and is prospective for real-time assessment of vigilance. Here, concisely P200 ERP refers to a positive spike in EEG signals which is generally observed within 150 to 250 ms after the exhibition of a target stimulus (auditory or visual event) [20], while N200 is a negative potential usually evoked between 180 to 325 ms after"
4,28,0.987,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"Brain development can be considered a process of production and disposal of synapses. In the first three years of life, production is greater than disposal; for the rest of the first decade of life, production and disposal reach a certain balance; and upon entering adolescence, elimination is the dominant process (Bedregal and Pardo 2004). In the brainâs process of producing and disposing synapses, the individualâs interaction with the environment (reaction to stimuli; collection, processing, and storage of information) plays a major role (Fox, Levitt, and Nelson 2010). Apparently, brain activity is directed by genetically configured neural patterns, while the details of such patterns (the amount and type of synaptic connections) are largely determined by the interaction with the environment (Greenough, Black, and Wallace 1987). The brain is able to modify its organization and functions according to experienceâan ability known as brain plasticity (Greenough, Black, and Wallace 1987; Masten and Coatsworth 1998). When a stimulus activates a neural pathway, all the synapses that comprise that pathway will receive and store a chemical signal and will be strengthened by the repetition of that incoming signal. When the signal exceeds a certain threshold (which varies depending on the area of the brain), that synapse is exempt from elimination. Similarly, synapses that are not sufficiently reinforced by the stimulus are candidates for removal. Different regions of the brainâs cortex increase their size (via the increasing number of dendrites in each neuron) when exposed to stimulating conditions; the longer the stimulation, the larger the growth of dendrites in each neuron and the larger the dendrite trees. Brain plasticity is particularly high during the first decade of life; after that, synaptic density decreases. Recent neurological research (Weaver and others 2004; Rommeck and others 2009, 2011; Nelson, Fox, and Zeanah 2014) suggests that warm, stimulating childcare has a profound impact on brain development via the development of neural connections and patterns. For example, research on institutionalized Romanian orphans has shown that profound and prolonged neglect in early childhood is associated with lower IQ and a variety of psychiatric illnesses (including ADHD and conduct disorders). Among these children, those who were placed in early foster care showed substantial improvements relative to those left in institutionalized care, although they generally did not catch up with other children who had never been institutionalized (Nelson, Fox, and Zeanah 2014; Rutter and the ERA Study Team 1998)."
220,10,0.987,The Ecological Scarcity Method for the European Union: A Volkswagen Research Initiative: Environmental Assessments,"1 Management Summary The Ecological Scarcity Method (ESM) enables measurement and assessment of the environmental impacts caused, for example, by manufacturing sites. Developed in Switzerland in 1990, where it has since been in use, the method is constantly being developed and updated. It has already gained regulatory status in Switzerland, for example for the purpose of proving entitlement for tax exemptions, in particular for environmentally friendly production of bio-fuels1. A data set has been available for Germany since 2014. The method assesses all important environmental impacts on the air, on water, the consumption of energy, the generation of waste and the consumption of freshwater. Assessments of this kind are necessary, in particular for manufacturing companies, for assessing the environmental impacts caused by economic activity. They may, for example, take the form of environmental impact assessments of manufacturing sites or even of individual production processes. Such assessments are also a tool for identifying which amount of capital expenditure in field will have the greatest effect on the environment. When it comes to answering these questions, the reliability and traceability of the assessment is of vital significance to the companies basing decisions on these results. The name âEcological Scarcity Methodâ is derived from the fact that the environment's capacity for pollutants is limited up to a critical state, i.e. is scarce. In the ESM, the scarcity situation is defined by the current, existing environmental impact and the capacity, as defined by a country's highest environmental authorities, to withstand this impact as a target state. This ensures that the various users of the assessment method will make use of a common basis of assessment, so making the assessment user-neutral, objective and reproducible at any time. The scarcity situation of the environment with regard to a pollutant thus depends on the difference between the current environmental impact, for instance in tonnes of pollutant per year, and the quantity or âcritical environmental impactâ which, on the basis of the environmental objectives, is still just about acceptable. Each pollutant discharge or also each consumption of resources takes place against the background of a corresponding scarcity situation. The consequent relative deterioration in the scarcity situation, a ratio, can be added up for all such impacts, giving rise to the total environmental impact, for example for a manufacturing site in a specific year. Before the assessment method can be applied, it is vital for the most important environmental impacts for the country under consideration to have been investigated as completely as possible. Such is the case in the EU and also in many other countries."
151,235,0.987,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Transparency of data was scored from 1 to 5 (Table 1). If critical data were not provided, a score of 1 was assigned. If full raw data were provided, the score was 5. If data were provided in tables and graphs, intermediate scores were assigned depending on the clarity of the data and the description of variance, etc. Most concentration-response study guidelines require that five concentrations be used in a toxicity test; therefore, five test concentrations were used to define a maximum score (5). It was recognized that, in some circumstances, the use of fewer concentrations could still provide useful data, particularly if the concentrationresponse curve was steep. These studies were, however, assigned lesser scores. The overall evaluation of the strength of the methods was obtained from the computed average of the scores. Toxicity data for inclusion in the risk assessment were selected based on the overall score. Guideline and GLP studies with full QA and QC, and studies with scores of â¥4, were preferred. Studies with scores of <4 â¥3 were included as qualified values and those with scores <3 were not included. Additional information was also used to select data for use when multiple results were available for the same species. For example, flow-through exposures were selected over renewal and renewal over static. However, if only data from static exposures were available, they were used with caution. Where several stages of the same species were tested, the more sensitive stage (based on the EC or LC value) was used. For example, data from larval amphibians were selected over embryos, which are generally less sensitive (Richards and Kendall 2002). The details of toxicity data included and excluded from SSDs are indicated in SI Table 1. Data for saltwater and freshwater, Palearctic and Nearctic, tropical and temperate organisms were not separated, as differences in sensitivity between these groups have been shown to be minimal, and their 5th centile concentrations (HC5s) are not significantly different (Maltby et al. 2005). Data from studies that used the formulated product were included as were those with the active ingredient; however, if data on both formulated and active ingredient were available, only data for the active ingredient were used. If toxicity values for more than one study were available for a species and they were of equal quality, the geometric mean of these values was used to construct the SSD. For aquatic organisms, the most frequently reported toxicity data were effect concentrations (ECs) that cause some magnitude of effect. For instance, the EC50 is the concentration that causes a 50% change in a measurement endpoint, such as growth or reproduction. When the effect is mortality, it is expressed as the lethal concentration that causes 50% mortality in a specified duration of exposure, i.e., 96-h LC50. The HC5, based on acute LC50 values, has been found to be protective of responses to CPY at the ecosystem level (Maltby et al. 2005). All durations of exposure from 2 to 5 d were included; durations >5 d were excluded from the SSDs. Analysis of the exposure profiles (Williams et al. 2014) showed that concentrations greater than toxicity values were of short duration (median = 1 d) and that acute toxicity data were the most appropriate for the assessment. When toxicity values were reported for different periods of exposure, data for the longest period of exposure up to 5 d were included in the SSDs. Toxicity values excluded from the data set were LOEL, LOEC, NOEL, NOEC, MATC, unspecified"

Most social objectives are only indirectly related to hydrological attributes or other measures of water resource system performance. Economic, environmental, and ecological impacts resulting from water management policies directly affect people. One social performance criterion that has been considered in some water resources development projects, especially in developing regions, has been employment. Where employment is considered important, alternatives that provide more jobs may be preferred to those that use more heavy machinery in place of labor, for example. Another social performance criterion is human settlement displacement. The number of families that must move from their homes because of, for example, flood plain restoration or reservoir construction, is always of concern. These impacts can be expressed as a function of the extent of flood plain restoration or reservoir storage capacity, respectively. Often the people most affected are in the lower-income groups, and this raises legitimate issues of social justice and equity. Human resettlement impacts have both social and economic dimensions. Social objectives are often the more fundamental objectives discussed earlier in this chapter. Asking âwhyâ identiï¬es them. Why improve"

As the achievements, 10,149 historic landslides were mapped by ï¬eld surveys and 9405 locations with landslide signs were interpreted from air-photos and analysis of 3D relief. Approximately 83% of the surveyed landslides locate in accessible areas, with small and medium dimensions and partly as a result of the slope cuts. About 76% of the interpreted landslides locate in inaccessible areas, and only 24% of the interpreted locate in accessible areas, of which 65% were found active landslides at the time of surveying, naturally occurred with large dimensions. However, the inventory exposes some major drawbacks: (1) The unavailability of multi-date air-photos; (2) The lack of human resources with enough experiences in image interpretation; (3) The difï¬culties of verifying the interpreted landslides, especially for the inaccessible sites; (4) Few or no sources of historic information due to the isolated sites or little memory of small or medium size events; (5) No updates developed by the surveyors after they ï¬nished their tasks. Those drawbacks can lead to the insufï¬ciency of adequate data on the types, sizes and characteristics of the slope failures, especially the exact dates of occurrences. Despite of those difï¬culties, the achieved inventory database have been updated and then used as basic input for the susceptibility and hazard mapping as well as preliminary results of SFLP to inform the local authorities and communities about real situations of landslides in their areas.

If one day such tribes disappear, the end of the first chapter of our evolutionary book will have been written. The greatest majority of people today still live historically, in societies that rely on ICTs to record and transmit data of all kinds. In such historical societies, ICTs have not yet overtaken other technologies, especially energy-related ones, in terms of their vital importance. Then there are some people around the world who are already living hyperhistorically, in societies or environments where ICTs and their data processing1 capabilities are the necessary condition for the maintenance and any further development of societal welfare, personal well-being, as well as overall flourishing. The nature of conflicts provides a sad test for the reliability of this tripartite interpretation of human evolution. Only a society that lives hyperhistorically can be vitally threatened informationally, by a cyber attack. Only those who live by the digit may die by the digit (Floridi and Taddeo forthcoming). To summarise, human evolution may be visualised as a three-stage rocket: in prehistory, there are no ICTs; in history, there are ICTs, they record and transmit data, but human societies depend mainly on other kinds of technologies concerning primary resources and energy; in hyperhistory, there are ICTs, they record, transmit and, above all, process data, increasingly autonomously, and human societies become vitally dependent on them and on information as a fundamental resource.

HCC typically do not show contrast retention of liver-specific contrast medium in the hepatobiliary phase, which can add confidence toward the detection and characterization of HCC (Fig. 17.15) [57]. It has been shown that using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI can improve the detection of small or early HCCs, as it is superior for detecting HCC measuring <1â2 cm in size compared with CT [58]. In addition, subcentimeter lesions detected by gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI are likely to be or can transform to become HCC within a short interval [59]. Hence, several evolving guidelines for the imaging evaluation of HCC are incorporating the role of liver-specific contrast media for the diagnosis of subcentimeter HCC. Subcentimeter HCC may be treated by locoregional therapy, thus avoiding the morbidity and mortality associated with radical surgery. However, it is important to note some potential pitfalls of using liver-specific contrast media for HCC evaluation. Some benign regenerating nodules may appear hypointense at the hepatobiliary phase of contrast enhancement, although the majority appears isointense of the liver [60]. In addition, some well-differentiated or moderately differentiated HCC may appear isointense or hyperintense on delayed images due to higher levels of OATP1B3 and MRP3 receptor expression. For this reason, the use of ancillary imaging features at MRI can improve the confidence of HCC diagnosis. These include mild to high T2 signal intensity and impeded diffusion on high b-value DWI. The use of liver-specific contrast agents may also help toward the identification of isoenhancing or hypoenhancing HCC that do not show typical hypervascularity in the arterial phase of contrast enhancement. With regard to the use of diffusionweighted MRI for HCC evaluation, higher b-value (e.g., 800 s/mm2) DWI may help in the identification of disease, particularly if the suspected nodule also demonstrates typical vascularity pattern at contrast-enhanced MRI. Because of background liver cirrhosis, higher-grade/poorly differentiated HCC are more likely to show impeded diffusion and lower ADC values compared with low-grade/well-differentiated HCC. To summarize, many MR characteristics are often associated with HCC (arterial-phase hyperintensity, T2 hyperintensity, venous- or equilibrium-phase washout, lack of hepatobiliary MR contrast agent uptake on hepatobiliary phase images, and restricted diffusion on high-b-value DWI). However, for each of these findings, there is only ~60â80% sensitivity, and benign lesions show these findings in 16â65% of cases, depending on finding, contrast agent used, and series reported [60, 61].

For example, during the low flow periods the two major direct uses of the river waters (water supply and pollutant carrier) are in conflict with each other and results in critical water stressed situations due to the inadequate quantity and poor quality. Over 89 % of the respondents from all DSDs view their resource uses are threatened or are in conflict situation at present. Ninety one percent of stakeholders believe their resource uses to be threatened in the near future under the assumption that no change will take place in the river system. The stakeholders were requested to identify the user sectors, which have created conflict situations with other uses or are already threatened by other use sectors. Three resource use sectors emerged as being principally responsible for negatively impacting the other resource users. Sand mining is identified by a large majority 60 % (180) as the single resource use sector which impacts the other users (Fig. 9.7). This was followed by clay mining on river banks and dumping waste which were identified by 17 % (51) and 13 % (40) respectively. Interestingly, all of the above three sectors have a direct relationship to the urbanisation taking place in the surrounding areas. In the first two uses (i.e. Sand and Clay mining industries) the beneficiaries are mostly away from the river basin itself. With the rapid increase in urban construction activities both types of mining have been mechanised during the past two decades resulting in severe negative social and environmental impacts.

114,317,0.987,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Implications for Patients, Carers and Families The engagement of patients in patient safety has been a slow and difficult process. Much of the initial effort has gone into engaging patients alongside staff in reporting and acting on safety issues. This has been a valuable exercise but there is always (rightly) going to be a limit on what it is reasonable or feasible for patients to take on in hospital. We should now turn our attention to the home and community which will pose very different safety challenges. For instance, nosocomial infections are common in hospitals but we have developed effective ways of countering them which rely on close monitoring and a rapid clinical and organisational response. In the home, the risk of nosocomial infections may be less but other risks arise from the open environment, frequent visitors and varying standards of hygiene. Safety is a moving balance between accepted risks and available solutions; you can improve safety either by changing the exposure to risk or improving solutions. In the home and community patients are in charge of care, and therefore responsible for safety, capable of making errors and being influenced by the many factors that affect safety. This is more than engagement, shared decision making or partnership. Patients and families are taking on roles and responsibilities that are in other settings restricted to professionals. This raises a host of issues for the management of risk and indeed for the delivery of services generally. Â© The Author(s) 2016 C. Vincent, R.

36,499,0.987,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"12.5.2 Determining Hunting Impacts on Bat Populations To directly study the impacts of hunting, research must measure and compare hunting mortality rates to a bat populationsâ size and capacity for growth. To date, there are only a few studies that have tried to evaluate the sustainability of bat hunting. The first was Halsteadâs (1977) on the Ile-Ife campus of the University in Nigeria, which was unfortunately cut short by his return to the UK. Brooke and Tschapka (2002) modeled what would be âsustainable takeâ on Niue, based on the current bat population size and estimated reproductive rates. Comparing their modeled sustainable take to the numbers of bats hunted on Niue, they determined current hunting rates were unsustainable. Epstein et al. (2009) estimated potential harvest rates of P. vampyrus in Malaysia as a function of the number of hunting licenses issued. Incorporating these hunting mortality rates into their estimated bat population growth matrix, they projected declines in the Malaysian bat population using even the most conservative measures of hunting pressure. On Madagascar, Goodman (2006) extrapolated total hunting pressure on hipposiderids from a single hunter he interviewed. Comparing this estimated mortality rate to the local bat population surveyed, he then inferred hunting levels were detrimental, because take exceeded the breeding potential of the local bat populations. Caveats. Rarely will information be available on harvest levels, population sizes, and reproductive rates for the same bat species. The studies described here work around missing information by using indices of bat harvest levels (e.g. licenses), estimates of reproduction rates from better known congenerics, and models of sustainable take based on rules of thumb from other harvested species (e.g. âRRâ production method, named after its authors, Robinson and Redford 1991). When indices, estimates, and models based on other species are used, there are caveats to consider. Researchers should be sure that the relationship between the index and the measure of interest is known and does not vary. Estimates based on similar species may differ from the species of interest. With population growth rates in particular, ignoring density-dependent factors could lead to inaccurate estimates of reproduction and population growth capability. Finally, models for determining sustainable hunting rates, such as the RR method used by Brooke and Tschapka (2002), predict a sustainable take rate of 40 % of the annual growth for species with life spans the length of fruit bats. However, this rate is based on similar species with potentially different life histories and may not take into account the other stressors that bats face today."

This allows researchers to measure levels of integration with less or more established groups that have some migration history in common. In such instances, however, issues of measurement, cohort, and context require special attention. Secondly, the children of immigrants can be compared inter-generationally in a more demographic sense of the term, in that the outcomes of the children of immigrants can be compared to that of their parents (above and beyond using parental characteristics as controls in a regression model). This makes it possible to assess the extent to which the children of immigrants fare in the parentsâ host countries and are able to reproduce or avoid the (dis)advantages experienced by their parents. Special attention to the variations in context and cohorts, as well as similar trends for individuals without an immigrant parentage ought to be taken into account when trying to assess integration outcomes in this manner. Quite a few of the surveys we have highlighted in Table 2.3 allow for both types of comparisons. Immigrant intergenerational comparisons are possible in the surveys that have a more inclusive target group, in that it is possible to separate the second from other generations. SCIICS, for example, enables comparisons with more established groups in the host societies. As interesting as these comparisons are, the fact that some of the groupsâ numbers are small or that not a significant proportion of individuals exist of the âappropriateâ generation restricts researchers in performing meaningful analyses or comparing across national or ethnic groups. In order to compare the children of immigrants with their parents, information about parental characteristics is necessary. One important barrier to conducting such intergenerational comparisons comes from the matter of accurate measurement of parental socio-economic status and more specifically of the pre-migration status and the possible downward mobility in post-migration occupations. These measurement issues make it difficult to truthfully compare outcomes between children and parents. Moreover, there is a heightened risk to practice some undue sociocentric nominalism that takes the educational and occupational hierarchy of the"

The consequences of action or inaction are as stark as they are uncertain. Regulatory acts or omissions could cost lives in the near term by delaying or raising the price of automation technologies [28]. But they could also save lives in the longer term by protecting broad classes of innovation from the potential reputational damage that early tragedies or controversies could inflict. Charting the currents of abstract social gain and concrete human loss from vehicle automation requires appreciating the risks that regulation presents as well as those that it addresses. This chapter first considers the nature of risk, the nature of regulation, and the challenge of regulating â in a broad sense â the increasing automation of motor vehicles. It then introduces four pairs of potential strategies to respond to this challenge, as summarized in Table 27.1 (above). These strategies are not exhaustive. They may be unnecessary. And they may be insufficient. Some are obvious, some are unconventional, and some may well be both. Their purpose is to advance discussion of the proper role of the public sector â legislatures, administrative agencies, and courts â in addressing automationâs challenges and opportunities."

Potions were said to âKill Athleteâs Foot Germs on Contactâ, to cure âFactory Feetâ and warned âYOU PROBABLY HAVE ATHLETEâS FOOT or will get itâ. Brands had names like âSoretoneâ, âKoriumâ, âOctofenâ and âDesitinâ. Some remedies were cure-alls, such as â3XB â, which also helped with âminor wounds, blisters resulting from ivy poisoning, or similar conditions, corns, calluses, tired feet, chafing, prickly heat or similar skin conditionsâ. Underwood and his colleagues reported analyses of 106 popular remedies, finding the most common ingredients were phenol, ethyl aminobenzoate and, most worryingly, mercurial compounds. The Mennem Companyâs leading brand âQuinsanaâ, whose advertising regularly featured the threat of catching athleteâs foot on the beach, contained Hydroxy-Quinolene, Magnesium stearate and boric acid. Underwood and his colleagues ended with a plea to dermatologists to âtake steps to prevent the commercial commandeering of scientific reports and formulasâ, and called for the regulation of popular skin treatments. Whether the rash of new products was due to a real increase in the incidence of fungal skin infections is unclear, but the post-war increase in tinea capitis in American schools suggests that there was more ringworm in communities.76 Infected children were treated with X-rays, as well as topical remedies and there were calls for public health agencies to take up the matter.77 Laboratory reports showed that the main cause was no longer Microsporon canis caught from pet and farm animals, but Microsporon audouini, the main European ringworm species.78 State and county authorities started campaigns, which were claimed to be effective. The reported incidence of tinea capitis fell in the 1950s, even though X-rays, the former treatment of choice, was dropped because of concern about the long term health effects of exposure to radiation.79 The most notorious example of the enthusiasm for developing and trialling treatments for athleteâs foot were the investigations on prisoners undertaken by Arthur Kligman in Pennsylvania and discussed in Arthur M. Hornblumâs book Acres of Skin.80 Kligman worked in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, then headed by David Pillsbury.

In what is known as the environmental impact of products from its cradle to its grave, impact categories of a product and the corresponding indicators and model(s) are identiï¬ed (Reap et al. 2008). The impact results are then grouped into different categories (Ibid). Despite its popularity of LCA and codiï¬cation in the International Standardization Organization, LCA has a number of weaknesses (ibid.). There is no consensus on types of stressors, impacts, the models to use and corresponding indicators under consideration (ibid). Like TEV, double counting remains a major problem of LCA (ibid). Due to these problems and given that TEV methods also trace the on-site and off-site impacts of the ecosystem services, the studies in this book will use the TEV approach. Many of the services provided by ecosystems are not traded in markets, so the different actors do not pay for negative or positive effects on those ecosystems. The value of such externalities may not be considered in the farmerâs land use decision, which leads to an undervaluation of land and its provision of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services should be considered as capital assets, or natural capital (Daily et al. 2011; Barbier 2011c). This natural capital should be properly valuated and managed as any other form of capital assets (Daily et al. 2000). The failure to capture these values for land ecosystems could lead to undervaluing the impact of higher rates of land degradation. To adequately account for ecosystem services in decision making, the economic values of those services have to be determined. There exist various methods to evaluate ecosystem services (Barbier 2010, 2011a, b; Nkonya et al. 2011). However, attributing economic values to ecosystem services is challenging, due to many unknowns and actual measurement constraints. The valuation of the natural capital, therefore, should follow three stages (Daily et al. 2000): (i) evaluation of alternative options, for example, degrading soil ecosystem services versus their sustainable management, (ii) measurement and identiï¬cation of costs and beneï¬ts for each alternative, and (iii) comparison of costs and beneï¬ts of each of the alternatives including their long-term effects (ibid.). However, identifying and aggregating individual preferences and attached values to ecosystem services, including over time, for each alternative option, is not a straightforward task (ibid.) As economic values are linked to the number of (human) beneï¬ciaries and the socioeconomic context, these services depend on local or regional conditions. This dependence contributes to the variability of the values (TEEB 2010). The green square box in Fig. 2.1 deals with the economic analysis to be carried out, and the green arrow shows the flow of information that is necessary to perform the different elements of the global economic analysis. Ideally, all indirect and off-site effects should be accounted for in the economic analysis to ensure that the assessment is from societyâs point of view and includes all existing externalities, in addition to the private costs that are usually considered when individuals decide on land use. This assessment has to be conducted at the margin, which means that costs of small changes in the level of land degradation, which may accumulate over time, have to be identiï¬ed. Bringing together the different cost and value types to fully assess total costs and beneï¬ts over time and their interactions can be done within the framework of costâbeneï¬t analysis and mathematical modeling. In doing this, care should be taken in the choice of the discount rates because the size of the"

If the yearly catches are smaller than the surplus production, the stock can be maintained at a high level. But if the resources approach the carrying capacity, the surplus production decreases, and this is not effective utilization. If, on the other hand, the catch amount is larger than the MSY, the stock decreases until extinction. Catch at the MSY seems to be desirable from the viewpoint of sustainability, but fishery operators rarely know the true MSY level. Consequently, fishing is continued at a higher rate than the MSY, thus endangering many fish species. Indiscriminate fishing damages not only the ecosystem but also economic profits over the long run. But why do attempts to increase production not succeed? The reasons are roughly divided into two types, as has long been pointed out in the science of fishery (Clark 1990); they include economic discounting and the tragedy of the commons. We do not explain these in depth here, however, as a bigger problem is the very assumption that the relationship as shown in Fig. 9.1 exists. The ecosystem is uncertain, non-equilibrium, and complex, yet in Fig. 9.1 these three factors are not considered. They will be explained sequentially below. First, unless the reproduction relationship as shown in Fig. 9.1 is known, the MSY cannot be achieved. If 600,000 t is continuously caught when the MSY is 500,000 t, the resources will be exhausted. Next, Fig. 9.1 implies that if catches are continued at a certain level, the stock will settle at a certain amount, but this notion would in fact be laughed off by fishery operators. Populations of marine organisms fluctuate greatly depending on the environment, and while prohibition of fishing may even decrease populations in some cases, in other cases populations may not decrease even if many more individuals are caught. That is to say, the ecosystem is unsteady, and dynamic sustainability must be considered accordingly.This challenge can, however, be overcome by the adaptive management described later. In such cases, the prospects for resource recovery can be shown only in a probabilistic way. That is, risk management is required. Finally, Fig. 9.1 relates only to the fish species to be caught, but an increased population of a certain fish species concerns not only the stock of that particular species, but also the population sizes of the organisms on which they prey and their natural enemies. The MSY theory does not consider this point, either. The effects of such interaction among species lead to a need to manage the ecosystem as a whole. Theoretically, this differs considerably from population management (Matsuda and Abrams 2004, 2006, 2013). The southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) was intensively caught from the 1960s to the 1980s, resulting in stringent fishery controls being agreed on by an international management organization, the Commission for Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). They set a numerical target to recover the stock to its 1980 level by 2020, and in the latter half of the 1990s signs finally appeared to suggest that the resources would eventually be recovered. Then Japan substantially increased its catches without obtaining the consent of other countries, and was brought to the international court. Yet, after Japan reduced its catches again, southern bluefin tuna resources did not recover as expected. One reason was that the resource recovery prediction at the beginning was too optimistic (Mori et al 2001, see Fig. 9.2)"

There are many environmental risks associated with stubble burning. If followed continuously burning can reduce soil quality and make land more susceptible to erosion. Moreover, continuous burning is not a sustainable agricultural practice. Smoke from burning straw also contributes to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere which may affect greenhouse gas build-up. The Department of Science, Technology and Environment and NonConventional Sources of Energy, Government of Punjab, constituted a task force in September, 2006 for formulation of policy to mitigate the problem due to the severity of burning of agricultural waste in the open fields after harvest and its consequent effects on soil, ambient air and health effects on living organism.

110,260,0.987,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"x Production risk concerns variations in crop yields and in livestock production due to weather conditions, diseases, and pests; x Market risk is related to the variations in commodity prices and quantities that can be marketed; x Financial risk relates to the ability to pay bills when due, to have money to continue farming, and to avoid bankruptcy; x Legal and environmental risk concerns the possibility of lawsuits initiated by other businesses or individuals, and changes in government regulation related to environment; x Human resources risk concerns the possibility that family or employees will not be available to provide labor or management to the farming business. It is clear from the classification above that not all of the risks are specific to agriculture but that some are rather common to all businesses. This is true for most of the financial, legal, and human resources risks. Among the risks that affect agriculture more specifically are production risks (due to weather, pests, and diseases) as well as market and price risks. In recent years, climate change has appeared as a new phenomenon and risk category. Across the globe, it has a considerable influence on agricultural production and in some parts of the world has led to fundamental changes in production patterns and conditions. For the following discussion it is useful to differentiate between these principal (or common) risks and specific risks. Risks in Agricultural Finance Fundamentally, the risks in lending essentially hinge on the borrowerâs capacity and willingness to repay a loan, with the former depending on the viability of the business and the latter on the borrowerâs character. This is no different in agricultural lending. Here again, it is useful to differentiate between principal and specific risks. The risks in agricultural finance comprise to a considerable extent common risks associated with the viability of the farm business and the farmerâs character, not much different from the risks of micro and small businesses in other economic sectors. In addition, farm businesses are exposed to specific production and market risks that may affect their repayment capacity. Finally, given the strategic importance of agriculture for food security, agricultural finance is subject to political interference in many countries. This poses significant political risks to agricultural lending institutions since political interventions often turn out to be detrimental to lending to farmers. Hence, the following sections discuss these three categories: principal credit risks, specific risks related to agriculture, and political risks. 2.2 Principal Credit Risks Lending to small farmers exposes credit institutions to principal credit risks that are similar to those of micro and small enterprises in general.

Bantanto, Gomone, and Niassene communitiesâ assessment of land degradation was consistent with all three satellite data while only one community which remote sensing data showed improvement (Diakha Madina) was perceived by FGD participants to have improved (Table 19.13). As Anderson and Johnson (2014) argue, the inability of satellite data to capture speciï¬c type of land degradation is complemented by the its ability to reflect the reduced vegetative health of plants growing on saline soils, eroded soils and other forms of non-vegetative cover land degradation. However, the inability of satellite data to capture some form of land degradation is revealed in sites that experienced improvement. For example, FGD at Dakha Madina, observed a decrease in crop value due to soil erosion. There may, in fact, be a number of competing processes at work as increasing cropland area is causing deforestation, but regeneration of fallowed ï¬elds increases natural vegetation cover. Similarly the site has experienced water erosion and a perceived decrease in crop values but also reports an increased yields in recent years."
349,81,0.987,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change contributes a sizeable portion of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, accounting for an estimated 12.5 % of carbon emissions from 1990 to 2010 (Houghton et al. 2012). Signiï¬cant demographic and socioeconomic pressures are exerted on carbon storing land uses such as forests in the tropics yet distribution and rates of change (e.g., loss of forests and agricultural intensiï¬cation) in tropical smallholder landscapes remain very uncertain (Achard et al. 2002). Much of this uncertainty stems from the substantial heterogeneity of LULC that exists, often at very ï¬ne spatial scales, in such landscapes. Even within LULC categories, signiï¬cant heterogeneity in carbon stocks often occurs as a result of drivers speciï¬c to smallholder agriculture, such as fallow rotations, uneven canopy age distribution, and integrated cropâlivestock systems (Maniatis and Mollicone 2010; Verburg et al. 2009). These factors result in the need for monitoring strategies different from those developed for more commonly monitored LULC transitions such as large-scale deforestation and urban expansion (Ellis 2004). Here we present general considerations and a suite of methods for estimating net changes in GHG emissions that speciï¬cally address the conditions of smallholder agriculture. In the process we illustrate the relative trade-offs between costs of analysis, precision, and accuracy. There are four basic steps required to calculate GHG emissions/removals from LULC change: â¢ Determine change in LULC. Changes in the areal extent of LULC classes must be determined by comparing data collected from two or more points in time. â¢ Develop a baseline. Observed changes in carbon stocks must be compared against a âbusiness as usualâ scenario of what would have happened in the absence of project activities. This step is generally carried out by either developing a baseline scenario or through direct observation of a reference region. â¢ Calculate carbon stock changes. Carbon stocks associated with LULC classes must be quantiï¬ed for each point in time or emission factors must be used to calculate carbon stock changes and associated GHG emissions or removals. â¢ Assess accuracy and calculate uncertainty. Accuracy of each step must be assessed in order to determine the uncertainty associated with ï¬nal emission/removal estimates associated with LULC changes. It is important to note that these steps are not necessarily chronological. For example a baseline scenario could be developed prior to LULC change detection. Accuracy assessments should be done concurrently with each phase of data collection and analysis. In order to carry out the above steps, two basic types of data are required, deï¬ned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as activity data and emission factors (IPCC 2006). Activity data refer to the areal extent of chosen LULC categories, subcategories, and strata and are generally presented in hectares. Emission factors refer to the data used to calculate carbon stocks associated with activity data and are usually presented as metric tons of carbon (or carbon dioxide equivalents) per hectare. Emission factors may not be required for all carbon pools when carbon"

Currently, there are no comprehensive measures to address the water scarcity and drought from cross-sectorial perspectives, such as the monitoring or metering of irrigation water use at the ï¬eld level or the enforcement of the new irrigation policy also for the existing groundwater wells. Nevertheless, there is a growing awareness on the impacts of drought and other climate extremes. In the Vilaine region, the demand from the agricultural sector does not constitute a signiï¬cant pressure on other uses, except the eastern part of the upstream Vilaine, where irrigation and nature protection are the two competing water uses. Similar to the Salland and Vechtstromen cases, water withdrawals by agro-industries and farmers are not monitored, yet it is planned. Furthermore, the CAP impacts the agricultural water use as well as the consumption of different products, while the measures related to the implementation of the CAP do not address potential interactions with the water policy. However, an agro-environmental measure is funded by the SAGE and implemented by the IAV, through offering contractual measures over ï¬ve years to farmers who manage wet meadows in the marshes and can receive ï¬nancial subsidies to maintain the marshes. In Somerset, there are cross-boundary issues that span drinking water supply, environmental flow, and agricultural water use, but planning activities are not coherent. The Environment Agency has a drought plan that covers both water supply and agriculture and irrigation that covers a region rather than a water company. But the water companies have drought plans which cover drinking water supply (in balance with other environmental factors like flow). A more integrated approach could improve the activities. Furthermore, in Somerset it is clear to all actors (it was at least before the flood) that water scarcity and drought is a problem and will probably increase. A difference was in the recognition of the extent of the water scarcity and drought issues and the measures which should be taken up. Problem perceptions were largely deï¬ned by sectorial interests, particularly agriculture and nature on the Levels and Moors. For the Levels and Moors there are no real mechanisms to persuade landowners to keep their stock out of the grass and to keep the water levels up for delivery of other ecosystems services other than agriculture and no reason not to intensify agricultural production in those ï¬elds. Higher tier agriculture Sites of Special Scientiï¬c Interest (SSSIs) focused on exclusivity but not interconnectivity, for example they are not linked-up special sites. Although there are designated SSSI areas there is seen to be not enough guidance for farmers outside these specially designated areas, and little opportunity to âenforceâ. The range of measures are largely positive, however, in the context of decreased regulation and public spending the extent to which these are monitored and enforced going forward is uncertain. Furthermore, the subsidy regime was not developed with the aim that farmers should directly manage water and a system of monitoring or enforcement related to this was not established. For example, issues such as soil compaction were seen as voluntary actions as opposed to embedded in subsidized actions. A fuller range of agricultural measures could still be implemented, e.g. agricultural mitigation measures and the adoption of clearer monitoring and enforcement."
180,210,0.987,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Newborn bloodspot screening (NBS) is the process in which a small blood sample is collected from the heel of a newborn, sent to a laboratory, and tested for serious and life-limiting conditions. If diseases are detected in the newborn period, treatment can begin immediately. NBS is conducted on almost 100 % of the newborn population in North America, roughly four million infants per year in the United States (Botkin et al. 2012). Screening panels have steadily increased the number of conditions tested, with upward of 40 conditions included in some NBS programs. This momentum to include more conditions in screening panels reflects a transition away from an âemergencyâ model to a âpublic health serviceâ model. In the emergency model, testing identifies conditions amenable to treatment or associated with catastrophic morbidity or mortality. In contrast, a key goal of the public health service model is to inform decision making or avoid a âdiagnostic odysseyâ (Bailey et al. 2006; Buchbinder and Timmermans 2011; Metcalfe et al. 2012). Advances in newborn screening have increased our ability to detect previously unidentifiable conditions. However, they have also raised a number of ethical challenges about how to best use the information. For example, testing can now reveal someoneâs carrier status (i.e., the person carries a recessive copy of a genetic disorder without being affected by the condition). Knowing a childâs carrier status can inform future reproductive decision making but may induce anxiety, lead to potential stigma, or reveal non-paternity (Hayeems et al. 2008). Newborn screening is a routine practice in many states. In the U.S. state of Nebraska, for example, screening is mandatory without exception (Schweers 2012; Foral 2006). In other U.S. states, screening proceeds on an opt-out basis, although studies indicate that often parents are not afforded the opportunity to consent or are poorly informed about the opt-out option (Botkin et al. 2012). This may even be the case where screening proceeds in an ostensibly informed choice manner, such as in the United Kingdom (Nicholls 2012; Nicholls and Southern 2012). Dried bloodspot samples are often stored for a number of years after collection, but the length of storage varies by jurisdiction (Botkin et al. 2012). Samples are retained for various reasons including repeat testing, quality control of testing procedures, or as part of diagnosis. In addition, samples also may be used (anonymously) for external quality assurance and research. While there is no consensus, a recent expert panel recommended a minimum storage period of about 3 months to allow for quality assurance, and indefinite storage when initial positive (i.e., disease suspected) results are confirmed by diagnostic testing (Botkin et al. 2012). In five U.S. states, a parent has the legal right to request destruction or release of dried bloodspot samples, and in three states children may do so when they reach the age of majority (Lewis"
278,297,0.987,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Two words in this question require further explanation: âimpactsâ and âembodiedâ. The term âimpactâ is used here in a very wide sense, comprising both pressure and impact indicators as defined by the causal DPSIR framework (Driving ForcesPressures-State-Impacts-Responses) that describes interactions between society and the environment.2 Environmental pressures include the use of resources, such as land, water or materials as well as the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) or pollutants. In the stricter definition provided by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards (ISO 2006; Hellweg et al. 2014), environmental impacts represent the (actual or potential) damage exerted by pressures, e.g. global warming, toxicity or biodiversity loss. Especially in the context of international trade, the expression environmental âburdenâ or âloadâ has been used as well as âburden shiftingâ (e.g. Giljum and Eisenmenger 2008; SchÃ¼tz et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2013) or âdisplacement of pressuresâ (e.g. Steen-Olsen et al. 2012) to describe the change of location where environmental pressures or impacts occur when resources from other countries are used indirectly through trade. For social and economic indicators, the distinction between pressures and impacts is less well defined. For the sake of simplicity, the term âimpactâ has been used for all indicators in this chapter (see also Table 8.1). The word âembodiedâ describes indirect impacts that can be âattributed toâ, are âassociated withâ or are âembedded inâ activities that are not directly linked to the impacts. In the context of trade, consuming a product in one country can lead to impacts in many other countries, depending on where the production and supply chain processes occur that are required to produce the final consumer product.

376,72,0.987,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","might be a consequence of a CO2-mediated correction in the competitive relationships between C3 and C4 plants (Idso 1992; Polley 1997). However, this cannot entirely explain WPE at the global scale, as woody plants also encroach into grasslands dominated by C3 grasses. Woody plants have other structural and functional advantages over herbaceous vegetation, which increase their ecological opportunities under accelerated growth conditions (Poorter and Navas 2003). Whereas herbaceous plants lose most annual biomass accumulation to herbivory, combustion, or decomposition, woody plants build up woody biomass and carbohydrate storage over decades, thereby strengthening their ability to persist in the face of stress and disturbance. Woody plants are most vulnerable to injury, physiological stress, and competition when they are small, and faster growth would expedite their transition to more resilient and competitive life stages. Global vegetation models have solidified support for the connection between atmospheric CO2 and âwoody thickening,â both within woodlands and forests and through the expansion of woodlands into grasslands. Importantly, these models have set WPE into the context of a millennial-scale global transition that started during the last glacial maximum when atmospheric CO2 was at a low point (Prentice et al. 2011). Examination of sediment records in the Chihuahuan Desert concluded that woody encroachment during the past 200 years is unprecedented in the context of the preceding 5500 years, that it was not related to droughts or changes in ENSO event frequency, and that it was contemporaneous with the rise in atmospheric CO2 and known grazing impacts (Brunelle et al. 2014). However, it has been argued that WPE clearly outpaced the gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 and the modestly elevated concentrations present in the early- to mid-1900s, by which time substantial encroachment had occurred (Archer et al. 1995). This suggests that while changes in atmospheric CO2 might have been contributed to WPE in the early to mid-1900s, it was not a driver per se. Continuing increases in atmospheric CO2, however, may increasingly favor woody plants. For example, dynamic global vegetation models suggest that with fire multiple stable biome states are possible across broad areas of Africa, but that the potential for multiple stable states will decline with further increases in atmospheric CO2 as biomes will become deterministically tree dominated (Moncrieff et al. 2014). Growth advantages realized by woody plants under high CO2 conditions may enable them to minimize the time during which they are vulnerable to disturbance. For example, frequent fires are a major limitation to tree recruitment in subtropical savannas. These fires may kill saplings outright, necessitating recruitment from seed, or they may force saplings to regenerate from basal sprouts. In either case, the woody plants are kept in a fire-susceptible size class. In this scenario shrub or tree recruits are able to mature into tall savanna trees only during rare periods of infrequent fires when saplings can grow large to escape the flame zone. All else equal, an acceleration of sapling growth by CO2 fertilization would increase the probability of escaping the flame zone and increase tree density (Bond and Midgley 2000)."

At the moment of writing, and excepting the work performed in the DROP pilot (see next section), only a ï¬rst prognosis on water quantity in the Rur system within different climate change scenarios has been developed (within the AMICE project, a further INTERREG IV-B project). A prognosis on water quality is to the moment also lacking.3 North Rhine-Westphalia has as yet not much experience with drought episodes; it has a comparatively humid climate due to its proximity to the Atlantic. In the case of the Waterboard Eifel-Rur, the few droughts in the past have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis: water management measures have been developed that alleviate a particular impact over a short period of time. The requirement for action has arisen not due to considerations related to droughts themselves (e.g. anticipatory management in early stages of drought to prepare for possible worsening), but due to other requirements, such as upholding water quality commitments."

232,74,0.987,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"2 What Did not Change After Fukushima After Fukushima, many people including the press condemned that the myth of nuclear safety was over and the thoughts of experts were totally wrong. The accident, however, has shown clearly that the most basic strategy of defense-in-depth principle is still valid, because the accident was caused exactly from the lack of defense-in-depth. The single safety barrier that had protected the Fukushima Daiichi plants against tsunamis was the seawalls. Since the largest scale of tsunamis that may possibly occur in the area is uncertain, multiple barriers should have been implemented for protecting the plants against tsunamis. In this situation, the tsunami caused by Tohoku Earthquake that exceeded the design basis was fatal. In addition to the seawalls of an insufï¬cient height, the areas of safety-relevant equipment in the plants were not watertight. The emergency power supply such as metal clad switchboards as well as diesel generators were located under the ground level. All these equipment were therefore submerged and lost functions just after the tsunami hit the plants. The backup systems against station blackout were insufï¬cient, either, both in the emergency power supply and the means of water injection. Safety barriers were not well prepared for mitigation of the consequence of an accident. Before the JCO criticality accident (JCO) [2], which occurred in 1999, emergency response that requires evacuation of nearby residents had been a taboo in Japanese nuclear development. As an aftermath of JCO, Act on Special Measures Concerning Nuclear Emergency Preparedness was enacted, and emergency response drills were enforced in each prefecture of major facility sites. It was revealed, however, in Fukushima that these efforts were totally ineffective, because the scale of accident was far beyond the prescribed scenarios of emergency response plans. As described above, the disaster of Fukushima occurred, not because the very basis of nuclear safety was wrong, but because it was not implemented and maintained properly. Defense-in-depth is the most basic strategy of nuclear safety that had been established at an early stage of nuclear development, before sophisticated methods of risk-informed safety management were introduced. After Fukushima, some people claim that we should rely more on risk-informed methods for safety management and we should evaluate more precisely the risks of external hazards. It is necessary to do so, but only introducing more sophisticated risk-informed methods is not the ï¬nal answer. Figure 1 shows an overview of the safety management based on a probabilistic concept of risk, which is a combination of the scale and probability of damage. A certain risk limit can be chosen as the curve shown on the scale-probability plane in the ï¬gure. The region above this curve is called an unacceptable region, and that"
167,299,0.987,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"In general, it can be concluded that the peculiarities of employment in the High North of Russia are based on the specifics of labour supply and labour demand in those regions. A dynamic fixed effects model estimated using the aggregated regional panel data for the High North regions of Russia from 2005 to 2013 demonstrated that wage significantly and positively affects interregional migration to the northern regions. The estimations showed that even in the case where there is a need for additional employees in the High North regions, such a need will be covered only partly by immigrants and partly by the unemployed already living in those regions. This finding indirectly tells us about the surplus of labour supply with respect to labour demand in the High North regions of Russia. The growth of wages attracts immigrants from other regions of the country and eventually leads to lower wages and higher unemployment in the northern territories. It can be assumed that the artificial suppression of emigration from the High North regions of Russia may strengthen these negative consequences.

Improved targeting would be an effective means for the Indonesian government to improve program benefits for the poor, but the costs and feasibility of more narrow targeting need to be assessed in order to identify economically optimal targeting methods. The results presented in Table 14.3 show that even a targeted social protection effort for the poor can be subject to errors of inclusion. The errors of inclusion in the implementation of the Rice for the Poor program have several implications. Based on the latest IFLS community data, the program was the most well-known among the poorest and was considered the most beneficial social protection program. However, it was also the second most criticized program due to the lack of program socialization and a suitable mechanism for filing complaints.3 There were other consequences related to the limited program impact on the poorest households. In a similar case of a conditional transfer program in Honduras, there was no positive impact on household nutritional status due to implementation problems (Adato and Hoddinott 2009). In the case of the Rice for the Poor program in Indonesia, targeting seems to be a bottleneck that limited the programâs impacts. The evidence that the Rice for the Poor program had limited impacts on the poorest is presented in Table 14.4. The programâs impacts on food consumption were evaluated at the household level after program implementation and the resulting changes in consumption are presented. The program benefitted the poorest households by increasing meat consumption by 50 % at the time of post-exposure program disbursement. âDairy productsâ category expenditures increased by about 90 % among the poorest households. Though animal source foods such as meat and dairy products contain more nutrients, the increased consumption of these categories by the poorest households was attributed to a shift to âbetter-tastingâ food (Jensen and Miller 2008; Banerjee and Duflo 2011). As previously mentioned, the food security program seems to have had many loopholes. By design the Rice for the Poor program provided generous support to the households that were suffering most from the crisis. Although it was found that the program reached the intended households, the mistargeting of households was also clear and lead to unintended program effects. Since the poorest households have limited understanding of dietary nutrition, accompaniment of the food subsidy intervention seems to be a prudent option. Changing food consumption behavior of the poor might require time and education rather than be an immediate response to improved food availability. In addition, the fact that extra resources from cash transfers are often used to purchase unhealthy goods that are consumed by adult males such as cigarettes is another indication that government intervention to improve household food consumption should consider an accompanying educational component. According to the IFLS community data from 2007 the unconditional cash transfer and the Rice for the Poor program received the most complaints from communities. Among 321 enumeration areas, complaints about the unconditional cash transfer and the Rice for the Poor programs were made by 69 and 16 % of the areas respectively. Despite this level of complaints, more than 60 % of the areas reported that the Rice for the Poor program was the most accepted program because it indeed helped the poor."

A total of 505 offenders were executed and 292 were subsequently pardoned, usually on condition of transportation, imprisonment or banishment.20 The relatively low number of executions in this period, when compared to England, goes some way towards explaining the limited historiography focused upon the use of capital punishment in Scotland, especially when compared to the vast field focused upon the subject south of the border. However, this study will demonstrate that these figures are by no means insignificant. Instead, they are statistically manageable and thus allow for an in-depth and systematic analysis of the malefactors who met their fate on the scaffolds of Scotland. In addition, this study demonstrates that the Scottish courts, while perhaps more discretionary in their use of the death sentence, were not averse to using the full weight of the law.

180,322,0.987,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Environmental health and occupational health and safety have long been established subfields of public health research, policy, and practice (Frumkin 2010). More so perhaps than areas such as infectious disease or health promotion, environmental and occupational health remind us that the health of a society is profoundly affected by its economic system and economic development. Today, the environmental health field is largely concerned with a human-made (anthropogenic) environment brought about by urbanization, the extraction of natural resources, industrial manufacture, the physical separation of home and workplace, and the transportation systems needed to support this mode of economy and pattern of living. Economic development alters the natural environment and sometimes harms ecosystems in terms of the humanly useful services they provide, their diversity, and their resilience. We are coming to understand that all of this has significant consequences for human health. Environmental health has been understood as a public health issue in relation to air quality, water quality, and exposure to environmental pollutants that are toxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic or are chemically bioactive in other ways. The rise of fossil fuels as the energy base for economic production and transportation, the industrial-scale advances in mining and metallurgy, and the creation and widespread presence of synthetic chemical substances have contributed to environmental health risks throughout the past two centuries.

Presently large groups of people in poor countries already suffer from malnutrition. Even if they have sufficient energy in their diets, these are deficient in micronutrients, just like sailorsâ diets did. Even in wealthy countries there are deficiencies of micronutrients, and people concerned about their health take precautionary supplements of micronutrients. Hence there is a large and growing demand for micronutrients, including Vitamin C. All over the world, even in developing countries, concerns about food quality and food safety are increasing, so food additives and supplements have to comply with high standards of quality and safety. Finally there are concerns about the environmental impact, including land use, of the activities required to feed the growing population. These concerns also lead to questions about the contribution of additives and supplements to food (environmental) footprint.

302,384,0.987,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), which deals with risks to human health, published a statement saying on the one hand that they could not detect microplastics in honey and beer in their laboratory studies. On the other hand, they stated that the health risk posed by microplastic-contaminated food and beverages cannot be assessed, due to the lack of reliable data and analytical methods [54]. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) started taking first steps toward a future assessment of the potential risks to consumers from microplastics and nanoplastics in food, especially seafood. Uncertainty exists, first, about the scope and quality of the contamination and, second, about the negative health effects for the public. The media reports led to a raised public awareness of health risks, but the risk management authorities could not clear up the concerns, because despite that their studies had not verified the claim of microplastics in honey and beer, the question remains, if negative effects for human health exist. This feeling of insecurity is also reflected in the consumer survey by the BfR [55], which shows that 63% of the respondents had heard about âmicroplastics in foodâ and 52% answered that they were âconcerned about microplastics in foodâ. This case shows that there are only single observations of microplastics in food for human consumption and no scientific evidence for negative effects for human health exists. No general statement about risk for human health can be made; nevertheless, people are worried since a hypothetical risk has been communicated. Thus, due to the communication about the hypothetical risk, it becomes symbolically relevant in the first place, and a risk for human health is constructed. Therefore, risk communication is a very important aspect of risk management, with regard to the perception and psychological reactions of people who feel they are at risk. To reduce the social amplification of risk, it is important for laypersons that experts address risks and contextualize them in relations to other risks. Research on risk perception has pointed out that public opinion is steered by media reports scandalizing or exaggerating minor risks, leading to the spending of money to reduce them, while other major risks that failed to attract public attention are insufficiently considered [56, 57]. Risk managers should be sensitive to this and not become misguided by media and public concerns."
365,509,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The impact of adapting the design of reservoir or irrigation area to a wetter or dryer climate is quantified by calculating the avoided regrets. The regrets of using historical climate as a basis for planning and design of irrigation are typically between 10% (storage optimization, minimum average regrets) and 40% (irrigated area optimization, minimum maximum regrets) of the investment cost. Results of the analysis show that these regrets can be greatly reduced by optimizing the design of irrigation schemes. On average, the regrets decrease 30â50% depending on the type of optimization. Moreover, the results vary greatly among case studies, with up to 90% of the regrets that can be avoided in some locations. Different classes of avoided regrets were defined based on their value compared to the investment cost. Optimizing the design has a high (low) impact if the avoided regrets exceed 20% (are less than 5%) of the investment cost, while the impact is moderate if the avoided regrets are between 5% and 20% of the investment cost. Results show that, in about half of the case studies, taking into account climate change in the design has a moderate to high impact, whichever optimization method is considered. Results obtained by optimizing the storage and the irrigated area optimization are illustrated on maps in Figs. 12 and 13. The reduction in regrets exceeded 50% of the investment cost in two case studies in the northern part of the country. In these areas, the climate is projected to be much wetter than the historical scenario for all the perturbed models, as shown by the mean annual runoff and the storage-yield curves. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to build smaller dams to irrigate a given area (or larger irrigated area for a given storage). Nevertheless, these results should be taken with caution because of the significant uncertainties in climate models and the hydrological model, and should be completed with additional ensemble members (e.g. emission scenarios, climate models, hydrological model parameterization)."

This is grounded on scholarly work that has emphasised the necessity to distinguish between the various facets of a varied repertoire of individual action (Teorell et al. 2007); in our study this analysis of individual actions must also include instances where individuals participate in larger, collective forms of mobilisation (Tilly 1978). In particular, we analyse âdonating moneyâ and âdonating timeâ as types of solidarity actions that are individually based and less direct while also taking into account actions such as âprotestingâ and âbuying or refusing to buy specific productsâ, which are collective and more direct forms of mobilisation. The figures in Table 9.1 reflect the relative importance of these four types of solidarity action across the three fields. The large cross-field variations (cf. the totals in first column) clearly show that solidarity actions vary substantially depending on the specific vulnerable groups that they target. Our first important finding is that a large majority of the people in our sample (54.7% out of 2098 respondents) engage in multiple forms of solidarity action at the same time (as suggested by the fact that the percentages add up to more than 100%). The individuals who take part in these actions are particularly mobilised by disability issues, while their level of participation decreases steeply when the focus is on unemployment, and even more so when actions are meant to help refugees. More specifically, Table 9.1 shows that when all variables are combined, 47% of the individuals in the sample are willing to support the disabled: in this case the most common types of solidarity actions carried out are âdonating moneyâ and âdonating timeâ, which account for respectively 27% and 17% of the actions carried out by the surveyed population. âBuying or refusing to buy specific productsâ only concerns 12.9% of the sample, while protest actions Table 9.1"
170,156,0.987,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4 Measuring ICTs in Developing Countries As following the guidance from poverty research, the theoretical use of Sen (1999) capability approach has dominated recent ICTD landscape. Utilising the human development approach, ICTs are explored theoretically as a broader and more holistic way to understand wellbeing as helping to expand the choices and freedoms of the actors themselves and their âfunctioningsâ or actions which in turn can lead to changes of wellbeing (Attwood et al. 2013). Further acceptance of multiple dimensions of poverty is seen in ICTD literature. Data before 2007 was found to be sparse in providing accurate ICT usage information in datasets available such as in Africa (James and Versteeg 2007) and more so among the poor. The ICT statistics administered by International Telecommunications Union (ITU) have helped to portray global supply of ICT. Developing countries today are outweighing the growth of ICT uptake over developed countries (ITU 2012). The ITU also hosts the ICT Development Index (IDI) which ranks countries based on a composite number of ICT readiness, intensity and impact. The IDI includes countries classified on the United Nationsâ HDI ranking as âlowâ or âmediumâ. Table 1 presents some of these aggregate ICT supply side indicators for some âlowâ to âmediumâ human development countries in Africa. From this African region set, South Africa is leading in the ICT provision and HDI rank across indicators. The HDI ranks seem to also align with the sequence of the countryâs IDI rank. Furthermore, the other three African countries may have low HDI and IDI but now have over 50 % of inhabitants with mobile phone subscriptions. Nevertheless one sees regional disparity of ICT access. In review of this global data, some âlowâ human development countries are experiencing high uptake in mobile phone subscriptions but low uptake of Internet usage (ITU 2011; Stork et al. 2013): Technology is the tool, NOT the outcome.

97,226,0.987,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Despite the strong drivers and manifold benefits, SUDS have not been exploited or implemented to their full potential. Uncertainty about long-term maintenance, performance and (cost-) effectiveness both independently and as compared to purely grey infrastructure solutions serve as limitations to wider uptake. These informational limitations are particularly challenging to address as the restricted implementation in turn prohibits new data and evidence from being generated. Furthermore, the data and quantification of these aspects that do already exist are not widely known by the necessary actors, and therefore are commonly not considered alongside âgreyâ infrastructure. Given that SUDS are a rapidly evolving technology and are very site-specific in nature, another complication is that the levels of effectiveness, fulfilment of associated land requirements, costs and benefits vary greatly from case to case (Green Nylen and Kiparsky 2015). Technical, institutional/political, financial and social barriers relating to the above considerations are further impediments. Key challenges include obtaining the revenue to undertake maintenance, the potential land take and physical requirements involved in new developments, and the role of regulation (Ashley et al. 2015). Strategies, regulatory frameworks and national level targets which exist to support SUDS implementation are currently scattered, with the majority of information on implementation and case studies limited to only a few countries (e.g. the UK, United States and Australia). For example, as a frontrunner in the field, the UK has SUDS legislation in place as part of the National Planning Policy Framework, which requires local authorities to include SUDS on new developments of 10 or more homes and all major new commercial and mixed use developments, unless demonstrated to be inappropriate. In consultation with the Lead Local Flood Authority, the Local Planning Authority then needs to approve drainage schemes (in line with nonstatutory standards6). Also in the UK, CIRIA7 has published an extensive guidance manual addressing the planning, design, construction and maintenance of SUDS as well as tools for maximising amenity and biodiversity benefits alongside flood risk reduction and water quality improvement (see Woods Ballard et al. 2015). However, even in the limited contexts where SUDS are comparatively more widely implemented, such as in the UK, the challenge remains to overcome silo thinking. SUDS are often raised as a possible approach only when targeting surface water and flooding issues, despite their potential to also address water quality challenges and deliver wider benefits in parallel. This stems in part from dispersed responsibilities amongst agencies for these topics as well as a problematic disconnect between research/development activities and implementation in many cases, leading to limited knowledge of available data and potential scepticism regarding its validity."

Beneï¬ts of carbon footprint as an indicator are that it is easily understandable, globally interesting, broadly applicable and easy to implement for different strategies (Alvarez et al. 2016). The carbon footprint of products standard (ISO/TS 14067:2013) provides principles, requirements and guidelines for the quantiï¬cation and communication of the carbon footprint of products, including both goods and services. Calculations can also be made at an organisational level (ISO/TR 14069). The CO2 equivalent of a speciï¬c amount of a GHG is calculated as the mass of a given GHG multiplied by its global warming potential factor given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The factors describe the global warming potential of emissions over the next 100 years. The CO2 equivalents are then summed up and reported as carbon footprint. The factors for the most important GHG are reported in Table 1. The ï¬gures show that the impacts of different GHG on climate change vary so notably per physical unit that they cannot be directly compared and summed together at the inventory result level, but need to be converted into the impact assessment level instead (Fang and Heijungs 2015). The typical sources of GHG emissions in carbon footprint calculations are energy production and consumption in the forms of electricity, heat or fuels, transportation and selection of raw materials. As in the LCA calculations, the results of footprint calculations can be divided into life cycle steps, and thus the most important emission sources are shown. Carbon neutrality is a term that has been widely used in public discussion, although its meaning varies rather widely. It can be understood as zero fossil GHG emissions to the atmosphere, or as a situation in which the amount of released emissions is compensated by investing in projects that are mitigating GHG emissions elsewhere. Both perspectives have deï¬ciencies, since the dynamics of biogenic carbon and land use change are very complex in the ï¬rst approach, and the compensation does not remove the released emissions and their impacts from the atmosphere in the second approach. Thus the background and assumptions of carbon neutrality should always be reported in a high level of detail. The term âOffsettingâ refers to compensating for all or for a part of the Carbon Footprint in a process outside the boundary of the product system through prevention, reduction or removal of GHG emissions, but it is not permitted in carbon footprint calculations (ISO/TS 14067 2013)."

The possible answers ranged from 1 (no obstacle) to 5 (very large obstacle).8 The importance accorded to competition from entities operating in the shadow economy is lower for companies with foreign equity, while the type of entity (entrepreneur and VAT payer), legal form, and ownership are not statistically significant. Small businesses (by number of workers) are aware of the existence and importance of informal activity to a greater degree. When viewed by sector of activity, construction and transportation are particularly exposed to competition from the shadow economy. The likelihood of detection is statistically significant: the easier these entities believe it is for informal operations to be detected, the smaller the extent of such competition.9 It should be noted that these results are similar to those obtained for South Eastern Europe using the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Study (BEEPS) database by Hudson et al. (2012). Some research has concluded that the greatest concerns about corruption from the informal sector are voiced by those entities that most resemble the informal sector. These are small businesses faced with financial constraints that are oriented towards smaller clients, have under-utilised capacities, and operate in a market with low entry costs.10 The only part of this conclusion that seems to be applicable in Serbia is that which refers to small businesses, while the greatest problems are present in activities with high entry costs and large participation of unskilled labour. In other words, operating savingsâand, consequently, the pressure of competition from the informal sectorâare greater in sectors where regulatory obstacles to formalisation are more substantial and where it is more difficult to control workers. Similarly to the small number of those who believed informal operation was not an issue, a mere 17.8 % of all respondents claimed that unfair competition did not bring about a decline in their annual revenue. On average, lost revenue amounted to 27.8 %, affecting particularly the sectors of construction and transportation. In most cases lost revenue amounted to between 10 and 50 % (for about 70 % of all business entities), while 11.6 % of entities estimated that their revenues had been reduced by more than 50 % due to informal competition. It is interesting to note that the estimated loss in revenue (27.8 %) does not deviate significantly from the estimated share of the shadow economy in GDP as shown in Chap. 5. In addition to the financial effects reflected in the estimated loss of revenue, we can also cite other consequences of competition from the shadow economy. Respondents primarily mentioned lower turnover and greater difficulty in selling"
233,483,0.987,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Similar prioritizations for different taxa are also quite likely to produce different outcomes. Conservation is always driven by value judgments (Vane-Wright and Coppock 2009), and there is even a risk of purposefully setting goals in a manner that produces desired spatial outcomes. Since there necessarily are multiple potentially relevant objectives, a conservative, precautionary strategy would be to assess several of them and focus on areas where most priorities are in concordance, and consider as unimportant only the areas where no high priorities occur. However, in practice different types of conservation actions could be necessary to address the different objectives, and therefore the conflicts may be more apparent than real. For instance, regions with particularly low phylogenetic diversity may also be of conservation concern as they can represent areas of active diversification (Forest et al. 2007), but they might require different type of conservation from âmuseumâ areas with relict species, as these areas and species in them might be threatened by very different processes. Another open and closely related question is at what spatial scales should we operate when measuring and prioritizing evolutionary history? In our case the assumption was that phylogenetic diversity measured as the equivalent number of Raoâs quadratic entropy of the local community was the relevant unit, but especially when assessing the diversity across the study region, the delineation of the study region will have an impact on priorities as described above, but also through âpruningâ of the phylogenetic tree: A specific region will cover parts of a full phylogeny, and regional scale prioritization with such a partial tree may prioritize areas different from a global prioritization with a full tree. Considering the amount of literature on conservation of evolutionary history in general, it is surprising how rarely it is considered in systematic conservation planning applications. Phylogenetic data are increasing and the modern computational prioritization tools are better able to account for such data even at broad scales and for large numbers of species. These developments facilitate the inclusion of phylogenetic diversity into conservation planning. We hope that it will become a routine part of spatial conservation prioritization procedures, and that the message will also better reach the broader public through active communication.

Nitrates are a major source of water contamination, introduced not only through the use of chemical fertilizers, but also associated with the amalgamation of animal manure. Similarly, pesticide residues can be toxic to humans and animals in food, feed, or drinking water. They also may be hazardous to farm workers during application and have undesirable side effects on non-targeted living organisms within the natural ecosystem. It is of considerable importance to develop a mechanism to pay for ecosystem services involving the beneficiaries and producers of such services in the agricultural sector. This could address the externality and market failure issues in agriculture, and consequently, increase food production in a sustainable way. Intensive livestock production systems, especially confinement livestock operations, accumulate large amounts of animal waste in solid and liquid forms. Manure, in concentration or untreated, can be considered a potential hazard to the environment due to its high content of nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, and potassium. As manure decomposes, various microelements (zinc, copper, manganese, iron, etc.) are released directly into surface rivers and lakes, or are leached through the soil to groundwater sources. Other things being equal, high animal densities indicate strong potential for pollution problems that could translate into higher costs of production if waste management costs rise. Such high densities are frequently associated with technological developments found in modernized, large-scale livestock operations, as well as in China and other developing countries. What all these consequences imply is that we need to estimate the values of nonmarketed ecosystem services and develop a mechanism to pay for them in order to address such issues."

These effects persisted for at least 4 h after cessation of exposure to CPY, but it is not known if these were truly behavioral responses or symptoms of sublethal poisoning. A number of studies of sublethal effects of CPY on fish have been conducted, some of which have focused on olfactory perception and others on behavior. Much of the research on effects of CPY and other pesticides on behavior has focused on migratory species of salmon because of their societal importance and the need for migratory species to be able to sense chemicals in water to successfully navigate to breeding waters. Exposure of the olfactory epithelium of Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to 0.7 Î¼g CPY Lâ1 caused a 20% loss of sensory function as measured by neurophysiological response to salmonid bile salt and l-serine (Sandahl et al. 2004). Since these studies were conducted in the laboratory, the changes in sensory function were not evaluated at the level of the whole-animal. Several studies have linked effects of CPY on the sensory epithelium and behavior to inhibition of AChE. Working with juvenile Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) exposed to CPY at concentrations between 0.6 and 2.5 Î¼g Lâ1, Sandahl et al. (2005) showed that spontaneous swimming rate and food strikes were correlated (r2 0.58 and 0.53, respectively) with inhibition of AChE activity in the brain. Other studies of effects of CPY in the same species showed that thresholds for different behaviors were related to inhibition of AChE (Tierney et al. 2007). Thresholds for effects of CPY on swimming behavior ranged from 20 to 35% inhibition of AChE. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to 220 Î¼g CPY Lâ1 for 24 h exhibited impaired swimming behavior (p <0.01) and a concentration-response relationship was observed at concentrations greater than 35 Î¼g Lâ1 (Tilton et al. 2011). Similarly, locomotory behavior of mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis, was affected by exposure to 60 Î¼g CPY Lâ1 for 20 d (Rao et al. 2005). Although exposures to concentrations of CPY of 100 and 200 Î¼g Lâ1 caused depression of whole-body AChE (â60% of controls) in tadpoles of Rana sphenocephala, there were no effects on swim-speed or vulnerability to predation (Widder and Bidwell 2006). Most of the reported behavioral responses of fish to CPY were related to inhibition of AChE. These observations are consistent with current understanding of functions of AChE in the nervous system. It is also not surprising that mixtures of carbamate and organophosphorus pesticides have the same effect as single compounds and that they act additively and sometimes synergistically (Laetz et al. 2009). However, when assessed in the context of actual exposures in the environment, risks are small as the pesticides must co-occur temporally and spatially to cause ecological effects. Even when total potencies of mixtures of insecticides are considered, exposures that inhibit AChE at concentrations greater than the threshold for effects on behavior rarely occur in key locations for valued species, such as salmon in the Pacific NW (Moore and Teed 2012). Although effects on behavior due to inhibition of AChE can be observed in vertebrates, these have not been experimentally related to effects on survival, development, growth, and reproduction of individuals or ecosystem stability or function in a quantitative manner. Therefore, they cannot be incorporated into an ERA at this time."
36,413,0.987,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"10.6 Conclusion Bats harbour viruses that may become zoonotic. Circumstances facilitating spillover include direct contact with bats (bites, scratches, consumption of bats), contact with material contaminated by bat saliva, faeces or urine and amplification via intermediate hosts such as domestic animals or other wildlife species. Conservational actions are not only important to prevent spillovers, but also because emerging zoonotic viruses often lead to persecution of bats. In order to reduce the transmission risk of viruses from bats to human and livestock and to protect bat species at threat, educational efforts are needed. However, entrenched cultural and social components often act as barriers to efficient changes on how people think about and respond to bats. Whenever possible, educational efforts should be done in an informative, non-lurid way, presenting the facts rather than provoking additional fears to the already bad reputation of bats. Wherever possible, solutions should be found to enable the existence of bats in anthropogenic landscape, including the development of more affordable and readily available vaccinations (e.g. against rabies), and the reduction of potential contact between bats and humans and livestock. This however also includes that the natural habitats of bats need to be better protected to provide bat populations with sufficient space and to prevent range expansion into urban and suburban areas, where contact with humans and livestock may increase the risk of spillover events. Bat-borne viruses should be considered during bat conservation efforts, and it should be equally noticed that appropriate conservation measures may even reduce the risk of viral spillover from bat populations into human populations."

A majority of the respondents (73 %) believe that climate change is a very serious threat to the water resources of Punjab (Fig. 25.3). Only four local ofï¬cials were unaware of the severity of the climate change threat to water resources in Punjab. While only a small percentage (13 %) of respondents has a deeper understanding of climate change (Table 25.1), a large percentage is convinced of its adverse impacts on water resources.

241,1272,0.987,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"European cities including Stockholm (Michelozzi et al. 2009), the effect of heat on mortality in Stockholm and the Stockholm area (RocklÃ¶v et al. 2009; City of MalmÃ¶ 2011) and the link between the intensiï¬cation of thermal and humidity conditions with unfavourable bioclimatic effects including heat stroke on the urban population of Cracow (Piotrowicz 2009). Seasonal differences were examined for Cracow (Piotrowicz 2009) and Gothenburg (Thorsson et al. 2011). Results indicated more problems with excessive temperature in summer and different outcomes for other seasons. A future decrease in temperature stress and better outdoor thermal comfort in winter, spring and autumn was announced for Gothenburg (Thorsson et al. 2011). A study in Cracow found that more frequent mild winters could cause the human body to lose the ability to adapt in colder winters (Piotrowicz 2009). The costs of heat events can be signiï¬cant. For example, preventing the loss of 18,000 lives in the 2003 European heat wave could have rendered beneï¬ts of up to USD 72 billion (HalsnÃ¦s et al. 2007). The heat waves across Europe in 2003 and 2010 indicate the vulnerability of urban populations. This is despite the high levels of development in Europe (Lass et al. 2011). Identifying social vulnerability to heat waves is important. Urban populations are generally more vulnerable to heat waves than rural populations. Within the urban population, particularly vulnerable groups include elderly people and those suffering from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (Piotrowicz 2009). A study on the effects of temperature on the elderly in Sweden conï¬rmed the impact of heat on mortality (RocklÃ¶v and Forsberg 2010). The study also showed that the effects of high relative humidity and high temperature were greatest in the most densely populated area, Stockholm (RocklÃ¶v and Forsberg 2010). In circumpolar regions, the populations at greatest risk from the adverse health effects of cold are children, elderly people or people suffering from cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Factors such as ageing and urbanisation may contribute to the rise in cold-induced health problems (MÃ¤kinen 2007). Svensson et al. (2003), referring to Gothenburg, argued that climate at high latitudes presents a number of particular bioclimatic problems, both physiological and psychological, and cold stress is perhaps more important, since people in Scandinavia seldom complain that conditions are too hot. Changes in Air Quality A decrease in air quality is a health-related effect of climate change in cities. Cities often have higher concentrations of air pollutants than surrounding rural areas (Eliasson and Holmer 1990; Jacob and Winner 2009). During 2005â2007 in Sczcecin, thermal stress and overheating, together with high levels of air pollutants, accounted for a signiï¬cant and direct threat to human health, especially for people suffering"
151,87,0.987,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"A comprehensive ecotoxicological risk assessment of CYP was developed for birds and mammals (Solomon et al. 2001) and aquatic environments (Giesy et al. 1999) that were near areas of application. The analysis of LRT of CPY and CPYO presented here extends those assessments to regions downwind of points of application. The approach taken in this study was to compile and evaluate data on concentrations of CPY and CPYO at locations both near to applications and remote from sources. This assessment of LRT thus goes beyond determination of CTD to include estimates of concentrations of CPY and CPYO in other environmental media such as rain, snow, and terrestrial phases as well as in the atmosphere at more remote locations, including high altitudes. This was accomplished by developing a relatively simple mass-balance model, predictions from which could be compared to available measured concentrations of CYP in air and other media. This can provide an order-of-magnitude test of the accuracy of the predictions of the model, and, in this way, make an indirect assessment of the relative importance of the included processes and parameters. The model can then serve as a semi-quantitative predictive framework that is consistent with observations. The equations included in the model enable examination of the effect of changes in parameters such as application rate, temperature, meteorology, distance from source and precipitation. Estimated concentrations in terrestrial and aquatic environments remote from areas of application can be used, in combination with toxicological data, to assess risk to organisms in those media and locations. Monitoring data. Reports of concentrations of CPY in air at a variety of locations are presented in Table 1, with comments on other influencing factors such as altitude.

Given the limited number of such studies that were found and the high degree of variability in methods among these studies, chronic laboratory studies were not used in this risk assessment. Since the focus of this risk assessment was on endpoints and assessment measures related to survival, development, reproduction, and colony strength, studies that examined effects of CPY on pollinators using endpoints such as oxidative stress (Shafiq ur 2009) and localized cell death (Gregoric and Ellis 2011) were not included. Available higher-tier semi-field and field-tests provide data on mortality, foraging behavior, brood development, and overall vigor. These should receive greater weight than the results of sublethal testing because the net effect of multiple stressors and modes of action are integrated into these higher-tier tests (Thompson and Maus 2007). Semi-field and field tests were an important line of evidence in this risk assessment. The analysis conducted here consisted of four parts recommended by the USEPA Risk Assessment Framework (Fischer and Moriarty 2011; USEPA 1998, 2012): (1) characterization of the stressor; (2) characterization of potential exposures by various pathways; (3) characterization of effects in pollinator or surrogate species; and (4) risk characterization."

The agrarian change in India is different in different regions and hence problem of degradation is different. The regions with intensive cultivation which caused land degradation problems are, Punjab, Haryana, West Uttar Pradesh, and the deltaic regions of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This region is characterised by more intensive application of inputs, irrigation, fertiliser and pesticide, HYV seeds and mechanisation. Increasing demand for labour has resulted in higher wages and hence lower poverty. The other extreme is the region with more extension of area to ecologically fragile lands ranging from arid and semi-arid zones with low and uncertain rainfall, to hilly areas with assured rainfall. They have comparative advantage in animal husbandry, forestry and horticulture. They are characterised by increasing poverty and pressure for land under cultivation. In between these two types lies the majority of area. The progress of irrigation and land augmenting technological change is slow. Expansion of area under cultivation is moderate and mechanisation is slow. They exert pressure on common lands. The existing studies on the link between land degradation and socioeconomic variables are very few. In fact there is only one systematic attempt on the determinants of land degradation in India (Reddy 2003). But this study deals only with district level and state level data and not at the household level. Some empirical studies have rejected the direct relation between poverty and resource degradation (Nadkarni 1990; Jodha 1986; Reddy 1999). These studies argue that the poor have greater motivation to conserve the resource because their livelihood depends on it; they are often victims of degradation and not the cause of degradation. Reddy (2003) has conducted an empirical exercise using a regression technique to ï¬nd the determinants of degradation at the district level and at the state level. The proportion of area degraded under various components to the total geographical area of the region (Source: NRSA) is the dependent variable. The regressors consist of: Socioeconomic, demographic, technological, institutional and climatic factors. At the district level, the period of analysis is 1986â93, while at the state level, the analysis was conducted for the 3 periods, 1981â82, 1988â89 and 1986â93. The state-wise analysis reveals that land-man ratio (deï¬ned as rural population per hectare of net sown area) exerts signiï¬cantly positive influence on degradation, meaning that higher population pressure on agricultural land is not the cause of land degradation. The regions of intensive cultivation are actually less prone to degradation. In the district level analysis, there were 3 different regressions, one each for total degraded, salt affected and water logged area. For the salt affected land, percentage of irrigated area and population density, as expected, imposed a signiï¬cantly positive influence; output per hectare imposed a negative influence. From Reddyâs (2003) analysis it appeared that better carrying capacity of lands support higher population densities. Hence no direct relationship was revealed between poverty and degradation. Per capita income does not exert any influence on degradation. Output per hectare is inversely related to land degradation indicating that regions with higher productive land are less prone to degradation. Rainfall does"

Dedicated equipment such as stethoscopes or blood pressure cuffs should remain in the patientâs room and not be used for other patients. CP may include single-room isolation, an entire isolation ward or cohorting of a group of patients (with or without designated staff). The aim of CP is preventing transmission of epidemiologically important pathogens from a colonized or infected patient through direct (patient or healthcare personnel) or indirect (surfaces or roommates in the patientâs environment) contact. In addition to hand hygiene, appropriate CP measures should decrease the risk of MDRO transmission. Current controversies remain whether patients only colonized, rather than infected, with MDROs should be subjected to isolation. Another issue is the impact of CP on patientâs well-being. Healthcare workers who care for patients in contact isolation enter their rooms less frequently and have significantly less direct contact with them. Patients express greater dissatisfaction with their treatment and have less documented care (Landelle et al. 2013). A review by Cohen et al. (2015) reports that CP do not represent a statistically significant improvement in MDRO infection control. Five of the six reviewed studies did not find significant association between CP and reduction in MDRO transmission (Cohen et al. 2015)."
187,360,0.987,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"8 Consequence Analysis After having deï¬ned the damages produced by a natural event or by a man-made incident and recognised the impacts that those damages might produce on the functioning of CI, the CIPCast system attempts to estimate, as the ï¬nal step, the consequences produced on society by the events striking a given area. As the Service Continuity indicator (kmin) is one of the major KPI of an electrical Utility, CIPCast performs the estimate of such an indicator. The service standard requested to the operator by Public Authorities (expressed in terms of minutes of LT outages per year) takes in some way a social meaning as this value represents a socially acceptable duration of loss of a relevant service as electrical power and users are retained as equally important. Moreover, CIPCast attempts to estimate the possible consequences of a crisis scenario taking into account other metrics weighting losses that any outage might create to the different societal sectors. It is worth noting that although we mostly refer to natural events, the same Consequence Analysis model could be usefully applied to any event (also of anthropic origin) on CI which produces an impact on their services. In order to deï¬ne the scope of the Consequence Analysis (CA hereafter) it is useful to point out that, in general, a natural event produces two types of consequences: â¢ direct consequences encompassing all the effects due to the direct damages produced by the event (disruptions, contingencies etc.); â¢ indirect consequences considering the loss of the well-being produced by the unavailability of Primary Services (PS) supplied by CI, which are â electricity (provided by the electrical system, i.e. transmission and distribution grids) â telecommunication (voice and data communication types) â water (drinkable water) â gas (and other energetic products) â mobility (unavailability of public transports induced by other PS outages). Taking an earthquake as a case study, for example, we will ascribe to the direct consequences the number of casualties (due to buildings collapse following the earthquake) and the economic cost needed to restore/retroï¬t (or rebuild) the damaged buildings. In turn, we attribute to indirect consequences the social and economic costs inflicted to the society by the unavailability (or partial availability) of the primary services (electricity, telecommunications, drinkable water, mobility etc.). Thus damages on CI elements produce impacts on their services which inflict"
223,234,0.987,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Decisions from Experience: A Key to Otherwise Puzzling Human Behavior The most famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius occurred in 79 AD, destroying many neighboring towns, among them Pompeii, the luxurious resort of wealthy Romans and now the most renowned still life of volcanic doom. This eruption, however, was not the most devastating one. As recent volcanological and archaeoanthropological studies have revealed, an earlier, Bronze Age eruption (around 3780 BC) covered the surrounding area as far as 25 km away, burying land and villages, causing a global climatic disturbance and the abandonment of the entire area for centuries. The loss of life and property was less extensive in the Bronze Age cataclysm than in the eruption of AD 79, but researchers recently discovered evidence of a mass exodus: a huge number of human and animal footprints pressed into the ash bed and all leading away from the volcano (Mastrolorenzo, Petrone, Pappalardo, & Sheridan,2006). At present, at least three million people live within the area that was destroyed by the Bronze Age eruption. In fact, the periphery of Mount Vesuvius, which includes a significant chunk of the Naples metropolitan area, is among the most populated of any active volcano (Bruni, 2003). According to simulations by Mastrolorenzo et al. (2006), an eruption comparable in magnitude to the Bronze Age eruption would cause total devastation and mortality within a radius of at least 12 km (7Â½ miles). In addition, great quantities of fine ash in more distant zones might cause severe respiratory-tract injuries and fatalities due to acute asphyxia. Although it is impossible to predict the exact probability of such a catastrophe happening, volcanologists such as Michael Sheridan have argued that roughly 2000 years have passed since Pompeiiâs destruction and that âwith each year, the statistical probability increases that there will be another violent eruptionâ of Vesuvius (Wilford, 2006). In light of these dire forecasts, one might expect that local residents would be keen to move away from the danger zone. On the contrary, relocating residents has proven extremely difficult, despite considerable incentives offered by the regional authorities. âIn the shadow of Vesuvius, those residents have cultivated a remarkable optimism, a transcendent fatalism and a form of denial as deep as the earthâs molten coreâ (Bruni, 2003, par. 12). How can one explain the willingness of residents to defy fate? Perhaps it has become clear by now why the distinction between description-based and experiencebased decisions may be key to understanding this and other puzzling risk-taking behavior. Personal experience tells residents in the vicinity of Mount Vesuvius that violent eruptions are extremely rare; in fact, in most peopleâs lifetime, they have been nonexistent. Unless catastrophes have occurred recently, the relative indifference with which citizens and politicians often consider rare, but high-consequence, events like bursting levies, catastrophic earthquakes, and eruptions of volcanoes"
231,1171,0.987,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Alheit et al. (2012), the anchovy population from the western Channel (not from the Bay of Biscay) invaded the North Sea and Baltic Sea during positive periods of the AMO. Given this evidence and according to the rules of ârelative stabilityâ within the EU Common Fisheries Policy, Spanish and French vessels would not necessarily be granted exclusive access to this expanding resource, unlike the present situation in the Bay of Biscay. Under the EU Common Fisheries Policy, a number of closed areas have been implemented as âtechnical measuresâ to conserve particular species and to protect nursery or spawning grounds. In the North Sea, these include closure areas to protect plaice, herring, Norway pout and sandeel. If species shift their distribution in response to climate change then it is possible that such measures will become less effective in the future (van Keeken et al. 2007). Juvenile plaice are typically concentrated in shallow inshore waters of the southeast North Sea and move gradually offshore as they grow. In order to reduce discarding of undersized plaice, thereby decreasing mortality and enhancing recruitment to the ï¬shery, the EU âPlaice Boxâ was introduced in 1989, excluding access to beam and otter trawlers larger than 300 hp. However recent surveys in the Wadden Sea have shown that 1-group plaice are now completely absent from the area where they were once very abundant. Consequently, the âPlaice Boxâ is now less effective as a management measure for plaice than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The boundaries of, and expected beneï¬ts from marine protected areas (MPAs) may need to be âadaptiveâ in the future in the context of climate change. Cheung et al. (2012) looked at other ï¬shery closure areas in the North Sea and noted that they will most likely experience between 2 and 3 Â°C increases in temperature over the next 80â100 years and consequently it is unlikely that the species they are designed to protect now will occur there in the same numbers in the future given deï¬ned temperature tolerances or preferences of speciï¬c ï¬shes (Freitas et al. 2007; PÃ¶rtner and Peck 2010). Fishers have witnessed and responded to a number of new opportunities in recent years, as warm-water species have moved into the North Sea and/or their exploitation has become commercially viable for the ï¬rst time. Notable examples include new or expanding ï¬sheries for seabass, red mullet, John dory Zeus faber, anchovy and squid Loligo forbesi. Biomass estimates for seabass in the eastern Channel quadrupled from around 500 tonnes in 1985, to in excess of 2100 tonnes in 2004/2005, with populations also increasing rapidly in the southern North Sea (Pawson et al. 2007). This was attributed to an increase in seawater temperature, especially in the winter and has resulted in a dramatic expansion of seabass ï¬sheries both within the commercial sector and the recreational ï¬shing sector. Seabass are caught by angling on the east coast of Scotland and in Norway, but"
246,136,0.987,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The Pervasive Impact of Humans Despite the existence of many large protected areas where human impacts are minimised, just about all predator-prey systems on earth are impacted by humans in various ways. The most obvious and immediate effect is through human induced mortality of both predators and prey. While some of the planetâs largest protected areas may insulate some large herbivores from human exploitation, there is still pervasive human impact through poaching and legal harvest within protected areas or on the herbivores that seasonally migrate outside the borders. For large carnivores, the situation is even worse as their wide-ranging movements more often carry them beyond protected area borders (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998). In a European context, where protected areas are often small, there are probably very few large predator individuals, let alone populations, that live their lives entirely inside protected areas (Linnell et al. 2001). In addition to the deliberate targeting of these species, there are many other sources of mortality which humans induce, such as through vehicle collisions (Langbein et al. 2011) and cases where disease is transferred from domestic to wild species. Furthermore, humans have very strong impacts on herbivores through their manipulation of habitats (see Chap. 8). Forestry and agricultural practices have dramatic impacts on vegetation structure and productivity that can have both positive and negative impacts on herbivore and carnivore populations (e.g. Gill et al. 1996; Torres et al. 2011). In general, small scale forestry and agriculture lead to situations that increase productivity and benefit many herbivores. The winter feeding of wild herbivores is a widespread activity across most of northern, eastern and central Europe which has the potential to greatly influence herbivore distribution and density (Putman et al. 2011). Long-term deposition of nitrogen and climate change can also have dramatic impacts on the productivity of vegetation (Holland et al. 2005). Another impact comes from competition between domestic and wild species. Domestic herbivore densities tend to exceed those of wild herbivores and can have dramatic impacts on habitat structure and the productivity of vegetation, as well as providing potential prey items for predators. In many areas, animals of domestic origin have been, and still are, critical prey for large carnivores (Mattisson et al. 2011; Peterson and Ciucci 2003). Even predators of domestic origin (domestic cats and dogs) can compete with wild predators. A final impact occurs through the behavioural disturbance that human presence and activity can induce in both predators and prey (Moen et al. 2012). Given the mobility of both large carnivores and large"
260,75,0.987,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"The commercial trade of ranavirus hosts is likely a significant factor facilitating the global distribution of ranaviruses, as well as interclass transmission of the pathogen. If novel strains of ranaviruses are introduced into naÃ¯ve populations, experimental evidence suggests that there could be devastating effects (e.g., Pearman et al. 2004; Storfer et al. 2007; Hoverman et al. 2010). With the trade in animals being truly global and ranaviruses accompanying them (e.g., Schloegel et al. 2009; Kolby et al. 2014), it is important to understand what ranaviruses are being transported and where they end up. Understanding the geographical distribution and host range of ranaviruses is becoming increasingly important as the World Health Organization for Animals has declared that EHNV and ranaviruses that infect amphibians are âreportable infections of wildlifeâ (OIE 2008). This designation requires countries that have agreed to OIE policies to screen a sample of ranavirus hosts that are crossing international borders for the presence of ranaviruses (Schloegel et al. 2010). However, few countries have yet taken steps to implement import policies that require declaration of ranavirus-free animals. Moreover, infection of fish by ranaviruses (other than EHNV) and reptiles (for any ranavirus species) are not included in the OIE regulations. We are just beginning to understand the distribution and host range of ranaviruses. Continued surveillance of wild and captive populations, as well as, commercially traded animals combined with the characterization of the ranavirus strains are necessary to fully understand the distribution and host diversity of ranaviruses. Therefore, when ranavirus studies are undertaken, sufficient funding should be obtained to at least partially characterize the virus if detected. This approach will require that researchers work in interdisciplinary groups. Acknowledgments Funding has been provided by a Presidentâs Initiative Faculty Development Grant Type A to ALJD.

10,243,0.987,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"In Flanders, pressure on water resources is high, which is amongst others due to the high population density. Water managers have historically paid much attention to guaranteeing water supply and water quality and mitigating the risk of flooding. Nevertheless, drought and water scarcity resulting from drought, are well known problems in speciï¬c sectors relying on a good water supply, such as agriculture. In the past, Flanders, as most European regions, has experienced droughts in the years 1976, 1996, 2003, 2006 and 2011 [for further information see Chap. 6 ]. In recent years, droughts have had several consequences in Flanders. On some occasions water extraction from the Albertkanaal has been restricted. The 1996, 2006 and 2011 droughts were recognized as agricultural disasters and affected farmers were ï¬nancially compensated. Temporary restrictions have been placed on the draft of ships on the Meuse river and in 2003 also on the use of the locks. Furthermore, Flanders experienced also other problems related to droughts; due to the wildï¬re in the nature reserve Kalmthoutse Heide in 2011, about 600 ha of heathland has been burned. Drought policy in Flanders is based on the implementation of the European guidelines laid out in the WFD (EC 2000), resource efï¬ciency policy (EC 2011), Blueprint to Safeguard Europeâs Water Resources (EC 2012) and the Communication on drought and water scarcity (EC 2007). The management of water resources in Flanders, and hence the implementation of measures concerning drought and water scarcity, is delegated to a number of water managers with speciï¬c competences. The Division of Operational Water Management of the VMM is competent for the management of about 1,400 km of the larger unnavigable watercourses. As part of the DROP project, the VMM pilot is focussed on the improvement of drought risk management and the improvement of knowledge and data collection, which were listed as policy options in the European Commissionâs Communication on drought and water scarcity (EC 2007)."
365,584,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"have the unintended consequence of modernization â even vice versa, where modernization leads to adaptation. However, the extent to which this occurs depends on the ability to attract financial capital to areas most suited to expansion. It is quite likely that better managed, informed and more agile players, big or small, will be the ones that take advantage of these new opportunities. Moreover, climate change may exacerbate differences between agile and nonagile actors. One of the main unintended consequences of climate change is an increasing of the gap between more traditional and less mobile farming communities with more entrepreneurial, mobile groups. This means that policies that assist in relocation and provide access to new opportunities may help overcome some of the negative distributional effects of adaptation to climate change. Similarly, climate change may cause migration of farm workers from areas that suffer from worsening conditions. Migration is a difficult process and one may expect to see the emergence of networks of labor contractors that will enable movement of labor across regions. These types of labor movements are sometimes associated with illicit activities and human rights violations, and thus may require regulation and policy interventions, but the migration itself may provide better outcomes for people who live in regions that suffer from climate change. Finally, one of the important challenges of public research is to develop and disseminate technologies that will slow the impacts of migrating weather. Even relatively small changes in temperature may have significant impact that require adaptation (Di Falco and Veronesi 2014). Moreover, slightly higher temperatures may increase vulnerability to pests and reduces chill days, which are required for blooming of some tree crops. Addressing these changes may require significant science-based adaptation. This may include new varieties better suited to changing agro-climatic conditions as well as practices to decrease the negative side effects of warming that may include new pests and shorter tree bloom. While government in developed countries may engage in supporting this type of research and development, in some developing countries the private sector may be engaged in pursuing appropriate technologies to assure availability of inputs. For example, multinationals which depend on the production of cacao, rubber, and other tropical crops, may engage in enhancing the capacity of producers to withstand the impacts of a changing climate. At the same time, these organizations may also encourage investment in production of these crops in new regions."

During the seismic activity period, a parallel socio-political crisis developed, as controversy arose regarding the âdecisions and best-suited measures required to prevent a potential disaster.â A study by Soule (2012) reported on the factors that led to the socio-political crisis, which was centered on the perception (and eventual realization) of an imminent disaster, and makes recommendations for improving risk management as a result. Soule concludes that these findings âmust be connected to a broader tendency to reject technocratic and centralized risk managementâ and calls for the incorporation of social science information during the assessment and decision making stages of risk management. Hurricane Katrina made US landfall in Louisiana on August 29, 2005 as a large Category 3 hurricane. The levee system protecting New Orleans was breached, and over 75 % of the city and nearby parishes were flooded. The storm (and subsequent flooding) led to 1,833 deaths and over $81 billion dollars in property damage. A relatively large social science literature has emerged about the event, much of it based on data collected during or immediately after the crisis. For example, Millin et al. (2006) examined disaster medical assistance in both Mississippi and a volunteer site near New Orleans. Treatment of chronic disease, primary health care and routine emergency care not related to the hurricane were the most common needs. The authors suggested that in addition to acute medical needs, âdisaster planners should prepare to provide primary health care, administer vaccinations, and provide missing long-term medications.â Vu and Van Landingham (2012) took advantage of survey work done just weeks prior to Hurricane Katrina, and were able to conduct a pre- and post-disaster assessment of physical and mental health consequences for working-age Vietnamese immigrants to New Orleans. The researchers located and re-assessed more than two-thirds of the original study cohort. They found statistically significant declines in physical and mental health status after the first anniversary of the storm, and substantial recovery by the second anniversary. Recovery varied by a number of key sociological variables (such as occupational type and marital status), and the authors suggested the results âpresent clear opportunities for targeted interventions.â"

248,171,0.987,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","overwhelming importance of what I referred to as vastogenic (waste-creating, waste-proï¬ting) systems. The article went on to cover research pointing out that over the 70 years since the end of World War II, a determinable set of political and social initiatives have shaped global corporate food regimes in Europe, the US, and elsewhere into social systems that sit outside the control of all but a few of the most powerful nation-statesâsocial food mobilizing systems that proï¬t from their vastogenic components. Food security (however deï¬ned) is increasingly dependent on the internal structures and processes of a diminishing number of corporate food wholesalers and retailers, plus those controlling the production factor chains of global agriculture such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. Critically, food waste is not just some regrettable side effect of these systems that will be taken care of by technical, regulatory, and organizational ï¬xing; it has become a core component of the way these systems have developedâwaste speeds up the proï¬table through-flow of food and is an increasing part of the proï¬t mechanism. To combat the ofï¬cial and institutional systemic myopia, a shift of global geographical vision is required, away from the productivity and population biases that comprise the current food security discourse, and towards the spatiality and biopolitical aspects of these vastogenic systems (including their social, political and economic embeddedness), what Misselhorn et al. (2012) describe as a food systems approach. Global food production systems for instance do not just passively distribute food from zones of mass food production to an increasingly spatially diverse and growing range of zones of mass food consumption, they are dynamic systems with the agency, power and proï¬t-motive to ceaselessly create new appetites and diets, particularly now amongst the fast-growing consumer classes of South and East Asia. Essentially, the proï¬tability of these systems is built on the gradient between higher priced means of delivery in higher income zones and lower cost methods of production in low-income areasâareas where food insecurity is a substantial issue. That gradient can be made steeper by a contractual dominance over small food producers acting to cheapen production factor costs, and through a range of measures to speed up food waste (and thus turnover) once it exits the doors of the system. It is worth reviewing some of the ï¬gures to illustrate the size of (and increase in) food waste. The EU points out that up to 50 % of the edible food passing through them is wasted by European households, supermarkets, and restaurants each year; a quantity which it is estimated will grow by 40 % by 2020 under current circumstances (European Parliament 2012). In the US 40 % of all food production is wasted, 25 % of which is thrown away by Americans when they get home (Buzby and Hyman 2012)âthe quantity being wasted in the US has also increased by about 50 % since the 1970s from 30 % of the total to 40 % (Hall et al. 2009). Globally, the ï¬gure for overall waste is about one third of all food (Hall et al. 2009; FAO 2011), but food waste is overwhelmingly dominated by consumers in zones of mass food consumption: âConsumers in rich countries waste almost as much food, 222 million tonnes, as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (FAO 2011: 5).â In some food categories (seafood, fresh vegetables), the systemic"
214,274,0.987,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Climate observations and climate projections provide a background for discussion. Essential in the application was evaluation of local weather processes and whether or not models represented these processes. This helped to develop trust of the expert guidance to interpret model information. Attention is naturally drawn to recent extreme events and whether or not these extremes are consistent with projections, for example, more precipitation occurring in extreme events. Warm and dry spells in the winter and spring that alter greening of forests, followed by damaging cold, is another example. Convolution of climate, extreme events, and ecological responses sit at the foundation of plausible futures. For example, if there is large-scale disruption offorests by drought, ï¬re, or wind that leads to the death of many trees, then the future forest will be recovering in a much different mean climate than in which it originally evolved. Since Isle Royaleâs forests are at the southern extent of the subarctic (or boreal) forest, and that extent may well move northward in a warmer climate, it is unlikely that a boreal forest disrupted by drought, ï¬re, or wind will be regenerated. Given the importance of speciï¬c tree species to moose food supply, this would be a negative indicator for moose populations. Evaluation of the combined influence of climate drivers was largely negative for maintaining the wolf-moose ecosystem. Though climate change is only part of the portfolio of factors in the decision-making package, it demonstrates that in the future it will be even more difï¬cult to sustain this precarious ecosystem. A driving conclusion from this exercise is the need to plan for best possible futures rather than manage toward preservation or conservation of the past."

46,108,0.987,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"children who are once again born poor and have fewer life chances and a higher risk of staying poor and being less healthy. An example of how child poverty affects physical health, affecting as a consequence other important functionings, is the issue of obesity. It is now well established that childhood poverty increases the probability of being obese, an effect that can already be observed in very young children and babies (Conrad and Capewell 2012). Obesity is therefore not a lifestyle choice of these children but the result of the environment they are born into (Johnson, Pratt and Wardle 2011). Obesity during childhood is connected to a wide range of further health risks, being linked, in particular, to cardiovascular disease and diabetes but also to mental health problems, such as depression (Levine 2011; Pizzi and Vroman 2013). Again, we by no means wish to deny that obesity during childhood also happens in well-off families but rather opt to reinforce the idea that more children in poverty are affected due to their being poor, which is sufficient for our claim that child poverty violates the claims of these children to be healthy. In an older review, Richard Reading presented good reasons why poverty is, in fact, the cause for ill health and health disparities in a society, reasons that still hold: research is consistent; the relation between poverty and child health can be found in every country; there is historical evidence that shows this relation is not new; there is an incremental relation; and the relation between health and poverty has been shown for many different forms of material and social deprivation (Reading 1997). In conclusion, the evidence we presented here shows that child poverty and physical and mental health are connected; child poverty influences it negatively and has negative effects on adult health as well. It undermines the equality of opportunity to well-being. Epidemiological studies, however, can give an insight as to the extent of the problem. A recent estimation for the USA concluded that approximately 245,000 deaths in the year 2000 were attributable to low levels of education, 176,000 to racial segregation, 162,000 to low social support, 133,000 to individual-level poverty, 119,000 to income inequality and 39,000 to area-level poverty (Galea et al. 2011). Another study suggests that in the European Union, 700,000 deaths and 33 million prevalent cases of ill health were caused by socioeconomic inequality (Huisman et al. 2013). We cannot put a definite number on the injustice of ill health caused by child poverty, but statistics attest that millions of children are living in poverty in modern welfare states. If there is sufficient evidence that many of them are ill simply because they are poor and that being poor puts them at a higher risk of becoming ill than their nonpoor peers, it is enough to criticize this situation as unjust as well as to claim that"
118,402,0.987,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"The accidents that occurred at the Three Mile Island (TMI) Unit 2 plant in Pennsylvania in March 1979 and the Fukushima Daiichi plants in Japan in March 2011 are generally and correctly regarded as two of the three most serious in the history of commercial nuclear power (Chernobyl, of course, is the third). For that reason, both accidents need to be carefully studied and appropriate lessons need to be learned. Although TMI and Fukushima differed in causes and consequences, they provide powerful incentives to investigate what happened and to draw conclusions that, if properly applied, can help to prevent, or at least mitigate the effects of, nuclear power accidents in the future. Any account of TMI and Fukushima must recognize their important dissimilarities. TMI is usually and erroneously described as a disaster. Although it was a gut-wrenching crisis and although a significant portion of the core melted, it did not result in large"
126,340,0.987,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Some of the ï¬gures obtained were markedly below certain non-governmental organization estimatesâeven radically so, as in the case of Kalokol town, which was recorded by several nonproï¬t groups as 55,000 whereas the SONT estimate (from consultations with local elders and aid agency ï¬gures) was closer to 30,000. Since the population of Kalokol fluctuates greatly with economic and environmental conditions, this is not surprising. Other estimates, such as those by Oxfam for a number of village/town locales along the lakeârecorded in 2007 (prior to the 2007â2010 drought) , were lower. The highest population ï¬gures, however, provide the best indication of the central and northern Turkanaâs vulnerability to the decline or disappearance of Lake Turkanaâs waters and living resources. Local Turkana administrators and council of elders members consistently described to SONT researchers that the GOKâs 2009 census takers: â¢ Recorded populations only in major centers, avoiding the more populous outskirts. â¢ Avoided rural areas near the lake where most Turkana live (all local administrators questioned by SONT attest to the fact that there are often more people living between main village complexes than within them). The GOK Census states that census takers recorded very large areas (often hundreds of square kilometers around towns). Local ofï¬cials questioned gave contrary accountsânamely, that GOK census takers did not record the large and diffuse populations in lands surrounding those towns visited. â¢ Did not request the direct cooperation of locally chosen administratorsâindividuals who are trusted by local residents and far more knowledgeable about their communities and population sizes. â¢ Recorded information from children and others unlikely to report accurately, rather than from heads of household. Population estimates from SONT efforts with community members were taken primarily during the dry season. As noted earlier, the populations of these complexes can fluctuate widely with changing environmental and social conditions. Even a conservative estimate of the population dependent on the lakeâs resources points to at least 300,000 Turkana who are dependent on the lakeâs watersâfor household membersâ daily consumption, for ï¬shing and/or for livestock watering and grazing, and many exchange relations involving lake resources. â¢ The Turkana population surrounding Fergusonâs Gulf is particularly vulnerable to major hunger and disease conditions brought about by the retreat of Gulf waters, accompanied by ï¬shery collapse. Together with council of elders members, SONT conducted a preliminary survey of villages around the Gulf, and continued data collection at Kalokol and northward along the western shoreline. This work consistently produced larger ï¬gures than those released by the 2009 GOK census. Moreover, this population is overwhelmingly likely to swell as environmental and economic ârefugeesâ move southward along the lake and toward the lake from the upland plains. Fergusonâs Gulf, along with the northern reaches of the lake, must be anticipated to suffer the most immediate effects of early lake level drop from the developments underway (see Fig. 9.11). â¢ Lake retreat caused by the Gibe III damâs inevitable radical reduction of Omo River inflow, even during the presumed reservoir-ï¬ll, would desiccate Fergusonâs Gulf as indicated in the bathymetric of Figs. 9.10 and 9.11.11 â¢ The extremely shallow waters and biochemical characteristics of Fergusonâs Gulf support major reproductive habitats for ï¬sh species critical to the Turkana and intensive ï¬shing activity during parts of the year. These critical ï¬sh habitats would be eliminated by even the ï¬rst phase of lake retreat (Figs. 5.2 and 9.11). As this book goes into print, there is substantial evidence of major river flow reduction from closure of the Gibe III dam and reservoir ï¬lling, and early reports from villagers in both the lowermost Omo at Lake Turkana suggest both that recession agriculture in the delta and riverside environments and the riverâs annual pulse of freshwater, sediment and nutrients into the lake are fully compromised. All communities contacted report ï¬sh catches reduced, although to date, no systematic"
175,81,0.987,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Water resources planning and management activities are usually motivated, as they were in each of the previous sectionâs case examples, by the realization that there are problems to solve and/or opportunities to obtain increased beneï¬ts by changing the management and use of water and related land resources. These beneï¬ts can be measured in many different ways. The best way to do it is often not obvious. Whatever way is proposed may provoke conflict. Hence there is the need for careful study and research, as well as full stakeholder involvement, in the search for the best compromise plan or management policy.

Other reasons include the identiï¬cation and evaluation of alternative measures that may increase the available water supplies, hydropower, improve"
77,236,0.987,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Discussion This research examines whether age-related BMI trajectories among older men vary by veteran status. In order to compare veterans and non-veterans who came of age during different historical periods, we constructed a measure of birth cohort that corresponds to when respondents turned age 18 and became eligible to serve in the military, regardless of whether they actually entered the military. This approach allows us to examine intra-cohort veteran status differences and to account for those who served, respectively, during war and peacetime. While there are many reasons to expect that military service will contribute to lower body weight later in life, we find that veterans have slightly higher BMI than non-veterans and they have similar trajectories of weight change with age. Our key findings emerge across a set of hierarchical models. Without any controls in the models, veterans exhibit lower BMI, on average, than non-veterans. This would support the argument that military service provides protective effects against weight gain over the life course. However, since veterans are over-represented in older cohorts that have lower BMI, on average, the effect of veteran status reverses once cohort is controlled. Once we add controls for early-life characteristics that occur prior to military service, potentially mediating mid- to late-life characteristics, and methodological controls for proxy report, attrition, and death during the study period, the effect of veteran status is small, marginally significant, and positiveâwithin each cohort, veterans are marginally heavier than their non-veteran counterparts. Although the effect of veteran status is small relative to the very large effect of cohort membership, the same can be said for other covariates that have been the focus of other individual-level studies of BMI, such as childhood disadvantage, Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity, and household income. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate the over-riding effect of the secular trend in increased weight across"
200,247,0.987,"Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Nuclear Risks","5. Secrecy develops across different sectors and blurs the locus of agents responsible for the problems in question. The author does not step into precise and point-to-point review of Fukushima contaminated water management case to determine if it meets the conditions above here, due to the limit of pages, but let him just point out some pertinent facts with those characteristics in the cases described in the previous section. For example, the several causes of the delay of consensus-building and technical practice of the contaminated water treatment at Fukushima Daiichi site (both of groundwater bypass and lightly contaminated water release programs) can be considered as the cases of these elements. So-called âKokusaku-Min-eiâ (planned by the national Government, operated by private industry) scheme was not effective to gain public and stakeholdersâ trust for those measures, but TEPCO had acted as the front-end of those activities especially before the Governmental decision on September 2013. This fact can be interpreted as a result of elements 1 and 3. âKokusaku-Min-eiâ scheme was considered as the standard format of any nuclear activity. This belief was strongly shared by many of the important stakeholders, such as the governments, TEPCO themselves, other member of industry, and even some of journalists and the general public. This seemed to be realized not by some formal consensus explicitly formed after the accident but by shared belief taken over from pre-Fukushima custom in nuclear industry in Japan. This point can also be interpreted as a sign of element 5, because the reason of âswitchâ of initiative from TEPCO to the government was not clearly discussed in public and explained well. Also, too many relevant bodies and complicated network among them due to incremental development of the governance system for the contaminated water treatment can be seen as appearance of elements 2. Moreover, the âfor the time beingâ strategy is a strong sign of element 4, of course. In this way, the twists and turns story described in this paper shows many signs of those five conditions. It is obvious that the deficits identified by Taniguchi seem to be strongly related to the mechanism of âstructural disaster.â"
133,268,0.987,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","evidence that women evaluate their health worse than men already in young and middle adulthood. In line with previous literature, age and education are positively associated with subjective well-being (Bardage et al. 2005). Moreover, educational and gender speciï¬c differences become evident, stemming from both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches: Poor health in complex families is observed among people with less education, whereas highly educated people in a stepfamily context do not report worse health. Age and education turned out to be crucial mediators for poor health. For example, we anticipated negative health outcome for mothers of two or more children. In fact, this group reported poor health more often than women with their partner and one child only. But when controlling for age and education, the effect for mothers of two and more children became insigniï¬cant. Controlling for socio-economic factors also appreciably reduced the effect for single mothers. The latter is consistent with earlier ï¬ndings from a study in the US (McLanahan and Sandefur 1994), which asserts that single parent families are not inherently problematic but rather are affected by deprivation in economic, parental, and community resources. The deï¬cits for single mothers are reduced when making ends meet is controlled for. Having a higher education and fewer economic constraints contribute to better health assessments. This suggests that structural disadvantages can help to create health disadvantages for people through the family environment in which they live. Single parents and stepfamilies are not âinherently problematic, but are likely to occur in concert with demographic, economic, psychosocial, and behavioural risk factorsâ which more directly influence health (Heard et al. 2008, p. 775f). In the longitudinal approach, the effect of new parenthood turned out to be strong. Our expectations that the arrival of a newborn child has a positive effect on health was conï¬rmed. Nevertheless, the birth of two children within a rather short period of four years tended to be associated with poor health, indicating stressful situations for the new parents. According to existing research, our expectation was that separation harms subjective health in the short- and medium term, which is expressed by lower self-assessed health after separation. Looking into the longitudinal analyses we observe that individuals who changed from a couple-context to a non-couple context within four years reported poor health more often at the second point in time compared to those who changed from a non-couple to a couple-context. But this difference vanished when controlling for age, education, and existence of LAT partnership, indicating at a complex relationship between different life domains and age. A further important result is that the association with age, education, economic constraints, and having no partner became even stronger from a longitudinal perspective. These results conï¬rm our cross-sectional ï¬ndings and reflect that transitions against the norm (e.g. union dissolution and separation) generate lasting negative health effects. It also implies that such transitions underlie age and socio-structural mechanisms such as education and economic status that are well-known determinants of health (Avendano et al. 2009; Stutzer and Frey 2010). Some limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, this study is limited to self-perceived health and we are not able to disentangle the various dimensions of"
255,8,0.987,Railway Ecology,"Organization We have divided the book into two parts. The ï¬rst aims at reviewing the main ideas and methods related to the identiï¬cation, monitoring, and mitigation of railway impacts on biodiversity, with emphasis on wildlife mortality, barrier effects, biological invasions, and the effects of other railway environmental impacts such as noise and chemical pollution. We begin by setting the scene (Chap. 1âRailway Ecology), framing railways in their economic context, and providing several examples of how railways can impact biodiversity. In Chap. 2 (Wildlife Mortality on Railways), Sara Santos and her colleagues provide a comprehensive review of mortality rates on railways, paying particular attention to the sources of bias when estimating mortality rates. In Chap. 3 (Methods for Monitoring and Mitigating Wildlife Mortality on Railways), Filipe Carvalho and his colleagues have further developed the theme of wildlife mortality, focusing on monitoring and mitigation. They discuss the application to railways of mitigation procedures routinely used in road ecology, and provide an overview of wildlife crossing structures and their role in reducing mortality and barrier effects. In Chap. 4 (Railways as Barriers for Wildlife: Current Knowledge and Future Steps), Rafael Barrientos and LuÃ­s Borda-de-Ãgua examine the barrier effects of railways, reviewing the evidence and providing an overview on procedures used to quantify barrier effects, with emphasis on genetic methods and individual-based computer simulations. They then discuss mitigation measures and their effectiveness, providing guidelines for monitoring and mitigation. In Chap. 5 (Aliens on the Move: Transportation Networks and Non-native Species), Fernando AscensÃ£o and CÃ©sar Capinha examine the role of railways in the spread of invasive species, showing that land transportation systems have greatly contributed to species introductions with high economic and environmental costs. They discuss measures to decrease the risk of alien species introductions, paying special attention to verges and associated vegetation corridors. In Chap. 6 (Railway Disturbances: Types, Effects on Wildlife and Mitigation Measures), Silva Lucas and her colleagues look at biodiversity impacts caused by railways due to noise, air, soil and water pollution, as well as soil erosion. They conclude that impacts are species-speciï¬c, depending largely on species traits, and that impacts can be minimized through improvements in the railway structure and the implementation of mitigation measures. The second part of the book provides a set of case studies from around the world that illustrate the impacts of railways on wildlife and ways to reduce those impacts. Reflecting the strong interest in the topic of wildlife mortality, four chapters focus on the patterns of mortality resulting from collisions with trains and railway structures, each of which suggests several mitigation measures to reduce such mortality. In Chap. 7 (Bird Collisions in a Railway Crossing a Wetland of International Importance â Sado Estuary, Portugal), Carlos Godinho and colleagues examine the risk of aquatic bird mortality due to railway bridge crossing wetland habitats, by combining data from surveys on carcasses and the observation of bird movements. They have found that this bridge had a low risk for aquatic birds, as"
4,115,0.987,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"In Ecuador, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH) program made transfers equivalent to 10 percent of consumption for the mean recipient household. Transfers were not explicitly conditional on any prespecified behaviors (like health check-ups) for households with young children. Two studies consider the impact of the BDH program on child cognitive and language development in Ecuador. One study, which focused on children aged 12â35 months, found that the transfers increased the number of words young children could say, as reported by their mothers (Fernald and Hidrobo 2011). Another study, which focused on children aged 36â59 months, found that the transfers did not improve child outcomes among beneficiaries overall. However, transfers had a significant impact on cognitive and behavioral outcomes among children in the poorest households, with an effect size of 0.18 standard deviations (Paxson and Schady 2010). In Nicaragua, the AtenciÃ³n a Crisis pilot program randomly assigned communities to one of three groups: a control group and two treatment groups, one of which received transfers that were substantially larger in magnitude (26 percent, rather than 15 percent of mean consumption).10 Once again, transfers were not explicitly conditional. On average, the program improved the cognitive, language, and behavioral development of children 0â5 years of age by 0.12 standard deviations (Macours, Schady, and Vakis 2012). The evaluation design in Nicaragua also allows for an analysis of the effects of bigger and smaller transfers. Comparisons between the two treatment groups show that overall consumption increased by much in the group that received the larger transfers, as expected. However, child development outcomes did not improve by much in this group, suggesting that something other than (or in addition to) the cash was at work. The AtenciÃ³n a Crisis program also changed various behaviors that are associated with better child outcomes (e.g., parents were more likely to tell stories, sing, or read to their children). Moreover, the changes in these behaviors are larger than what would be expected from the income transfer alone (Macours, Schady, and Vakis 2012). In sum, rigorous evaluations show that cash transfers programs in the region have had positive, albeit modest impacts on child cognitive, language, and behavioral development, particularly when transfers are made to the very poorest households.11 These results echo those"
31,108,0.987,Remembering and Disremembering the Dead,"The first mistake is to think that improper removal, retention and storage are the only issues that matter concerning posthumous harm. Alder Hey represents a breakdown of trust in healthcare and can be reframed in such terms (Harrison et al. 2003; Pilgrim et al. 2011). The second mistake is to think of retention at Alder Hey as an isolated occurrence. Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, reported in February 2001 that improper retention and disposal of organs was widespread in the UK. Alder Hey got most of the bad press, and was probably only unique in the scale of retention and in the furore it caused. Importantly, Donaldson discovered that other NHS institutions around the UK were also guilty of flouting the HTA and improperly removing and retaining organs: â¦elsewhere in the NHS it is clear that organ retention without relativesâ full knowledge and agreement was widespread. The recent national summit on organ retention organised by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor Liam Donaldson, confirmed that this was also the experience of parents in many other parts of the country. Professor Donaldsonâs census shows that 105,000 organs are retained across the country. Poor standards of cataloguing and record-keeping mean that these figures may not be wholly accurate. Twenty-five thousand hospitals account for 88% of the organs. At least 16,500 of these organs and tissues have been retained in apparent contravention of the law because they came about as a result of coronersâ post-mortems where the organs should not have been kept beyond the time needed to establish cause.

347,134,0.987,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"There are a number of definitions of alien species, invasive species and invasive alien species. If not stated otherwise, within this chapter we concentrate on IAS. The most common definition of IAS is the one proposed by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; COP 6 Decision VI/232), namely, âalien species whose introduction and spread threatens ecosystems, habitats or species with economic or environmental harmâ. The process of IAS invasion is referred to as bioinvasion (or biological invasion). There are several routes to IAS introduction, both natural and man-made, but ballast waters used in maritime transportation are currently seen as the main source of the problem because of the fact that maritime transportation has increased enormously not only worldwide but also in the Baltic Sea region (HELCOM 2009a, b; Olenin et al. 2010). Within the Baltic Sea, despite its relatively small size, ship traffic is one of the densest in the world, both in terms of ship numbers and tonnage. Based on information from the HELCOM AIS (Automatic Identification System) database, more than 50,000 vessels cross the Danish straits per year, and at any time, approximately 2,000 vessels can be found in the Baltic Sea.3 Therefore, according to the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare 2012), the Baltic Sea is one of the sea basins with the greatest environmental pressure due to shipping activities. Globally, IAS is considered to be one of the greatest threats to marine biodiversity, entailing both direct and indirect consequences for ecosystems with various"

Thomas and colleagues in 1957, following radio- or chemotherapy. Preclinical animal studies revealed that transplantation of splenocytes from non-oncogenic donor strains facilitated haematopoietic recovery but led to a severe illness characterised by anorexia, reduced weight, diarrhoea, ruffled fur and eventual death. It was labelled at the time âsecondaryâ or âruntâs diseaseâ and later became known as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). It was clear that the effect was not one of the conditioning therapies but was associated with an immune-mediated syndrome (Wolf et al. 2012). GvHD remains a leading cause of non-relapse mortality and is associated with a high morbidity that increasingly affects quality of life (Lee et al. 2003; Dignan et al. 2012). However, the success of allogeneic HSCT depends on simultaneous graft-versus-tumour (GvT) effects. Therefore, broad-based immunosuppressive strategies are less attractive as these may dampen the GvT benefit. Relapse accounts for a significant proportion of treatment failures after HSCT; thus strategies for GvHD prevention with minimal impact on GvT are the holy grail of transplantation (Magenau and Reddy 2014). Historically, GvHD is termed âacuteâ before day 100 and âchronicâ any time after day 100. However, it has since been recognised that there can sometimes be âoverlapâ between the types, so signs and symptoms are used to aid and determine the diagnosis. The skin is the most common organ affected followed by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and then the liver. Typically, the skin develops a rash which often but not always appears on the palms of hands and soles of the feet first and can rapidly spread to the rest of the"

This fact could be directly related to the persistence of the male breadwinner model among a large percentage of Ukrainian immigrant households. The geographical dispersion of the family was a very significant factor determining strategies related to remittances. More than half of the immigrants who belonged to multi-local families were sending money at least once a month. This number contrasts with that of immigrants whose entire immediate family was living in Spain. There were no significant differences between irregular and regular immigrants in the proportion of those who send money and those who do not. However, it is striking that irregular immigrants sent money to Ukraine more than twice as frequently as documented immigrants. While Stanek and HosnedlovÃ¡âs research offers the most complete work so far on transnational behaviour, it also suffers from substantial shortcomings related to data. First, the analysis is based on statistical information from the National Immigrant Survey where the variables regarding transnational activities are very limited. The operationalization of key variables related to transnational behaviour was based on proxy measures, which has a considerable impact on the empirical and conceptual reliability of particular conclusions inferred from their analyses. Second, the interpretation of results focuses mainly on family dynamics and individual decisions, and does not take into account other hypothetical structural factors such as labour market policies, legal framework or international relations at state level."

In India, Uzbekistan, Tanzania, and Ethiopia, these sites were chosen randomly. The processes of land degradation or improvement are identiï¬ed and analyzed at each site using FGDs conducted with the communities as well as a number of remote sensing-based analyses. The FGD questions are synthesized into ï¬ve major categories for this portion of our analysis: (1) changes in land cover, (2) deforestation, (3) crop intensity/yield changes, (4) community perception of trends in land degradation/improvement, and (5) processes that would be unobservable using remote sensing. Each of these categories are designed to elicit, either directly or indirectly, the presence or absence of land degradation and the associated impacts. Unfortunately surveys in India, Uzbekistan, Tanzania, and Ethiopia did not contain information relating to numbers 4 and 5 above. These surveys were conducted by independent researchers. The beneï¬t of using survey information from these study sites is to see how randomly chosen areas agree or disagree with remote sensing datasets. The immediately visible forms of potential land degradationâdeforestation, land clearing, etc.âare relatively easy to identify using remote sensing. The strength of the ï¬eld survey is in identifying attributes that may not be immediately visible using satellite sensors such as changes in forest productivity through selective logging, erosion, salinization, or nutrient depletion leading to decreased crop yields. The ï¬eld surveys also provide robust information that is not confounded by complex surface processes such as invasive species acting to increase vegetative cover or systematic fallowing of crop ï¬elds, both of which would lead to erroneous remote sensing assessments. The limitation of the FGDs, however, is the time frame available. Community members cannot be expected to remember speciï¬cs of land cover, yields, or cropping intensity as far back as three decades, so those questions are limited to the years since 2000. More general questions do elicit information on land degradation dating back to 1982, but do not gather information in the same manner as the speciï¬c questions designed to identify those physical processes on which the land degradation map is based. The ï¬rst three categories of FGD questions (changes in land cover, cropping intensity and yields, and deforestation) are designed to allow direct comparison to available remote sensing estimates in our analysis. This direct comparison isolates reliability of remote sensing estimates of land degrading processes without the complication of differing time frames or unobservable processes. Building on established methods and those proposed by Bai and Dent in their evaluation of the GLADIS framework, we conduct the remote sensing analyses using a buffer radius of 8 km around each site as a means of approximating the resolution of the land degradation dataset as well as to account for errors in geo-location. Each remote sensing analysis consists of three parts: an analysis of the change in Landsat NDVI from 2000 to 2005, an accounting of changes in MODIS land cover from 2001 to 2006, and an assessment of trends in Landsat NDVI using GLS data from 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2005."

In the case of mixed chimerism, the schema in Fig. 12.1 can be followed. Relapse usually occurs in the BM but may also be at extramedullary sites, thought to be due to immune escape from patrolling lymphocytes. It is also thought that leukaemia can escape from the immune control provided by the donorâs T cells by mutating or becoming a more resistant clone of the original disease. The cause of the relapse may also be different in different haematological malignancies. While relapses can occur many years after HSCT suggesting that perhaps the underlying disease was never eradicated and was held in control by the donor immune system, it is more common with CML, and in this disease, the administration of DLI can often restore remission."

Feedbacks between land change and decision making are not always straightforward and direct. Often the feedback operates across different spatial or temporal scales. Local land changes add up to impacts on the global climate system, in turn leading to local impacts in vulnerable regions in terms of changes in cropping conditions or increased flood risks to which people adapt their decision. The importance of such feedbacks was stressed by van Noordwijk et al. (2011) and Meyfroidt (2012). Unfortunately, only a small number of examples of the study of such feedbacks are available in the land science literature, mostly due to the difficulty of observing and quantifying such feedback mechanisms (Claessens et al. 2009; Verburg 2006)."

The origins of the mima mounds in North America are no less controversial, but in this case small mammals (gophers) appear to be the primary drivers for the accumulation of materials (Whitford and Kay 1999; Jackson et al. 2003; Horwath and Johnson 2006; Johnson and Horwath-Burnham 2012). Whether or not that proves to be the sole explanation, these features also accumulate materials and alter the ecohydrology of the landscape. These important soil modifications justify the need for further research into the ecohydrological consequences of soil (Westbrook et al. 2013). As noted by Vivoni (2012), our understanding of the role of scale and spatial variability in ecohydrological processes on rangelands will certainly increase in the future as remote-sensing and computational capabilities continue to progress."
219,760,0.987,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"The Household Plot Level Analysis This section presents the analysis of drivers of land degradation on the household level as described in the methodology. Since soil erosion induced by water is unambiguously the major symptom of land degradation in India, as shown in Table 15.2, it is regarded as a suitable proxy for land degradation in a broader sense. Table 15.13 displays descriptive statistics of all the variables used in the analysis. The main results are depicted in Table 15.14, ï¬rst column. They show that the higher the frequency of application of organic manure, as well as chemical fertilizers, the lower the likelihood of soil erosion, given equal characteristics, where the effects are signiï¬cant at 1 %. The use of pesticides, in contrast, is found to increase the occurrence of soil erosion. The number of different crops grown within the time span of the monthly survey also signiï¬cantly (p < 0.001) drives the extent of soil erosion. The quality of drainage exposes a U-shaped influence on erosion, where a good drainage system fosters erosion and a mediocre one works against it, compared to bad quality drainage. Erosion is rather present on large ï¬elds, as shown by the positive signiï¬cant coefï¬cient of the plot area. Other variables that are negatively associated with erosion are the education dummies (relative to the category âilliterateâ) and the time of the household head devoted to work on the parcel. Interestingly, land property is positively associated with soil erosion, which might hint at a certain degree of insecurity in land tenure. The second column of Table 15.14 displays results with state ï¬xed effects, which account for some variation. While some variables display lower coefï¬cients, the main explanatory variables, namely application of manure and fertilizer, respectively, remain signiï¬cant in their explanatory power. The last two columns run a usual probit, where erosion is measured with two outcomes, âyesâ or ânoâ, regardless of the extent. The results are qualitatively similar, with the coefï¬cients for use of manure and fertilizer still on a high level, while use of pesticides does not signiï¬cantly explain erosion. The positive effect of organic manure application than the effect of fertilizer application is stronger in all four speciï¬cations. Thus, the application of manure seems to be more sustainable way in terms of land conservation compared to the utilization of chemical fertilizer or pesticides."

However, laboratory studies have shown the formation of nanoplastics down to sizes of 30 nm during artificial weathering of larger plastic materials, using nanoparticle tracking analysis [6]. This is a strong indication that this process can also take place in the environment. Particles as emerging environmental pollutants call for a better understanding of their environmental behaviour and potentially harmful effects on organisms. Ecotoxicity testing of particles represents a shift in test paradigm away from testing of soluble chemicals and demands reconsideration of existing test methods and procedures, including the standardised methods developed by OECD and ISO [7, 8]. On the one hand, parallels can generally be drawn between ecotoxicological testing of particles, independent of whether those particles are engineered nanomaterials or plastic particles [9]. On the other hand, it is important to understand where the similarities end, in order to avoid redundant testing, use of inappropriate test methods and generation of meaningless data. Nano- and microplastics cover a wide range in terms of particle sizes. To illustrate this: If a 1 mm particle corresponded to the size of the Earth, then a nanosized particle would correspond to the International Space Station in the orbit around it, i.e. differing in size by six orders of magnitude. Resemblances, in terms of behaviour, fate and effects, are more likely to occur for particles that are similar in size. Therefore the similarities between engineered nanomaterials and nano- and microplastic particles are more likely to apply for smaller microplastics of up to a few microns as well as the submicron-sized nanoplastic particles, which will be the main focus of this chapter. Further noteworthy differences exist in terms of their chemical properties, sources and their related methodological challenges, as described in further detail below."
182,200,0.987,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"By the mid-1950s, international experts had reached a consensus that the developing world required more animal food, particularly the vitamin- and protein-rich foods derived from bovine bodies.90 Ralph Wesley Phillips, an American specialist in animal husbandry and breeding, who oversaw the Zebu study and became the first director of the fAOâs Department of Agriculture, recognized that âthere are many areas in the world where human needs for animal protein are not adequately metâ. Highlighting the âstriking variationâ in food availability in underdeveloped and developed regions, he aimed to address the significant shortfalls in production in countries outside North America, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.91 One way of achieving this goal was to increase livestock numbers. This had been a short-term strategy in post-war Europe but seemed less applicable on a global scale. The world livestock population was already largeâroughly equivalent to the human population (soon to reach 3 billion), or double if domesticated fowl were included.92 Although on average the protein that animals supplied seemed adequate, the highest levels of production and consumption were concentrated in the developed world, which contained less than 40% of the worldâs livestock but produced nearly 80% of its meat and eggs.93 The problem elsewhere was not livestock numbers but productivity. In a review of world cattle for Scientific American, Phillips noted that âthe best zebu performances have been far below those of European breeds. In India a few well-handled Sahiwal cows have 88 McClaren (1974), Tappan (2013). 89 for example, see fAO (1957) pp. 19â20. 90 Autret, who had carried out a study of kwashiorkor in Africa, declared that âprotein malnutrition is without doubt the main nutritional problem in the underdeveloped countries todayâ. fAO (1960) p. 1. 91 Phillips (1951) p. 244. 92 Phillips (1963b) p. 15.

255,379,0.987,Railway Ecology,"The diachronic analysis of the local connectivity values shows that the impact of the HSR line ranges from a few meters to several kilometers. The impact is often located near the infrastructure but, in some sections, it may occur up to 12 km from the line. This variability is related to the landscape conï¬guration and the initial state of the connectivity of the habitat patches. Indeed, all impacted habitat patches are into components fragmented by the HSR line. The extent of disturbance therefore depends on the size of these components, with a large component increasing the distance of the impact as in the north-east of the study area. This highlights the value of a regional-scale analysis for taking into account the long-distance effect of an infrastructure on connectivity. From this perspective, graph-based methods are interesting because they include both structural and functional aspects of connectivity. Our results are consistent with several previous studies that highlighted the importance of integrating the barrier effect in addition to the direct loss of habitat in environmental impact assessment (Clauzel et al. 2013; Forman and Alexander 1998; Fu et al. 2010; Girardet et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2014). This graph-based approach provides an approximation of the potential impact but not a hard and fast measurement of the true impact. In order to validate our approach, these ï¬ndings could be conï¬rmed by ï¬eld observations to test whether the real impact of the infrastructure is similar to that predicted by the model. In June 2011, a speciï¬c ï¬eld survey was conducted in the Ognon valley to observe the tree frog presence after the construction of the HSR line. A total of 227 sites was visited with 42 presences and 185 absences. The results from this survey were compared with the connectivity changes predicted by the model. All presence points were located where there was no impact according to the model. The absence points were located in more or less affected areas, with a potential connectivity change between 0 and â90%. These survey results should be considered carefully because the Spring of 2011 was very unfavorable for the tree frog due to early drying up of water bodies. These climatic conditions could therefore explain the many points of absence of the species. Furthermore, the time delay between the construction of the HSR line and the surveys was not sufï¬cient to assess the real impact of the infrastructure. Other ï¬eld surveys should be conducted in the coming years to assess precisely the conservation status of the tree frog populations and of their habitats in the region. These surveys will also identify the causes of extinction of breeding populations, as several environmental factors may lie behind the extinction process, and be compounded to the long-distance effects of the infrastructure. The method used to identify the best locations for new amphibian crossings goes beyond the prioritization of candidate sites developed by GarcÃ­a-Feced et al. (2011). It is cumulative and so includes changes made to graph topology by adding previous links before searching for the next one. Graph modelling is used to include broad-scale connectivity as a criterion to be maximized, which is a key factor for the ecological sustainability of landscapes and for the viability of metapopulations (Opdam et al. 2006). In this study, the tested locations corresponded to the links, i.e. corridors potentially used by the tree frog, cut by the HSR line. Relying on the initial network of the species increases the likelihood of functional crossings because these links already connected habitat patches before the implementation of"

The Google Analytics âadvanced segmentâ for social media, as personally defined and used by Europeana, contains 20 sources (referrer domains), some of which have registered insignificant or even no traffic at all during the last six months (October 2012âMarch 2013) See Table 2.

We shall return to individual performance later in this section, here we shall confine ourselves to the problems of definition. An interesting definitional case is Twitter. The Twitter traffic is identified by âinclude Source containing ât.coââ. Patently, this is too loose a definition as it will not only pick up ât.coâ, but any domain containing that sequence of characters e.g. search.bt.com.

183,341,0.987,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"18.1 Introduction The poor face different levels of impact when exposed to natural hazards than the nonpoor (Hallegatte et al. 2016). In addition, data on the risks poor and vulnerable face and the actual impact they experience is often lacking. The digital divide plays an important role in this as developing countries and within these developing countries, the poor and vulnerable have less access to digital technologies (Leidig and Teeuw 2015). Apart from technological reasons, there are also political and social reasons. For example, the poor often get their income through the informal economy, and their land and resource rights are usually not registered. This lack of data affects the actions of different actors in the preparedness and response phase. Three main actors can be distinguished in the response and preparedness phase (van den Homberg and Neef 2015). The affected community are the people directly and indirectly adversely affected and in need of urgent (humanitarian) assistance. The responding community consists of local or outside community members that support in relief or recovery but are not trained in crisis response. The responding professionals are part of the professional community in the field of disaster management, such as national and local governments, NGOs, and national crisis coordination centers. All these three groups have to decide based on the data and information available to themâin the period just before the disaster hitsâwhich"
126,275,0.987,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Company boats easily overwhelm the poorly equipped indigenous Dasanech and Turkana ï¬shers. Villagers in the delta describe enormous ï¬sh discard (waste) by the motorized commercial boats, including large deposits of ï¬sh bones and other waste, that create major problems for their small nets and also destroy ï¬sh reproductive and feeding habitats. One Dasanech ï¬sher responded this way when asked for his view of the foreign ï¬shing boats: What is bad about them is the amount of ï¬sh they kill. Some of them [ï¬llet] the ï¬sh right there and throw the waste in the lake, so this makes the lake water poisoned. We get small nets from some of them, but mostly we are losing our ï¬sh, so nets donât help us if the ï¬sh are gone. The Ethiopia-based ï¬shing corporations have steadily increased their catch range into Kenyaâs Lake Turkana, where they are in clear violation of that nationâs sovereignty. These company boats extend their ï¬shing ventures as far southward as North Island (Figs. 1.3 and 5.2), often display the Ethiopian flag and are often accompanied by Ethiopian guard boats. They pay no fees to Kenya, nor do they obtain ï¬shing licenses or make catch reports to Kenyaâs local Beach Management Units. Turkana representatives from villages along the northwestern shoreline have appealed to the Kenyan government numerous times to expel the foreign fleets, and Kenyan ï¬sheries ofï¬cials are fully aware of the situation. As of early 2015, the Kenyan government had taken no effective action, despite innumerable requests by Turkana ï¬shers and their representativesâ including in the locally based Beach Management Units. Nor have the development banks, in their assessments of lake conditions, ï¬shery status or socioeconomic conditions (AFDB 2009 and 2010) raised the issue of the incursion and impact of Ethiopian commercial fleets in these Kenyan waters on ï¬sh stocks and on the worsening interethnic conflict among ï¬shers. What amounts to state-sponsored piracy into Kenyan waters is a matter of international sovereignty, but also greatly worsens the crisis faced by vast numbers of Kenyaâs Turkana whose livelihood is dependent upon the lakeâs ï¬shery. â¢ Violent conflicts between Dasanech and Turkana ï¬shers who are increasingly desperate to secure catch from these northern waters constitute a major problem in the region. The northernmost portion of the lake accounts for many of the âhotspotsâ of conflict expansion (Fig.5.3). The frequent violence over gear theft and sporadic killings noted above frequently spreads to pastoral and agropastoral communities in the region (and visa versa) with extensive series of reprisals between the two ethnic groups. The frequent points of conflict among ï¬shersâindicated in the map of Fig. 5.3âare also the likely points of major expansion of local conflicts into regional ones. This trend is already well underway and is greatly ampliï¬ed by the plummeting of livelihood resources as a result of Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural development. Governmental, non-governmental and U.N.-based accounts of conflicts among ï¬shers and in the border region generally exclude consideration of the actual causes of this mounting crisis. Instead, the âsolutionsâ prescribed are most often either interethnic âmediationââwithout account of the real dynamics at playâor additional militarization by the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments, or both."
35,468,0.987,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Declining catches of Atlantic cod lead to a growing interest in aquaculture of this species. For more than thirty years, the intensive production of cod has been established (Moksness et al. 2004). The rearing of G. morhua requires the production of live food of different sizes and feeding protocols need to be followed strictly (Moksness et al. 2004). Of all the gadoid species, cod is thought to have the greatest potential for future development for aquaculture and some scientists believe that within the next 20 years similarly high production levels can be achieved as for the Atlantic salmon (Rosenlund and Skretting 2006). The suitability of G. morhua for offshore aquaculture has been successfully demonstrated in 3000 m3 submersible cages including automatic feeding buoys by the company Sea Stationâ¢ off the coast of New Hampshire (Chambers and Howell 2006). As G. morhua is a physoclist species, necessary pauses need to be included during vertical movements of the cage (KorsÃ¸en 2011). One major problem for cod aquaculture is their ability to bite through the mesh or other materials, which makes them the ï¬sh species with the highest escapee rate (Jensen et al. 2010), which could have a negative impact on wild population by cross-breeding (Davies et al. 2008). The extreme temperature tolerance range from â1 to 23 Â°C and an optimum temperature range from 8 to 12 Â°C (Jobling 1988) make this species a candidate for aquaculture in the German Bight. However, aquaculture companies should be aware that the relatively high summer temperatures in the German Bight could enhance the risk of infections, as G. morhua is prone to bacterial ï¬sh pathogens such as Franciscella spec. or Aeromonas salmonicidae at prolonged temperatures of more than 12 Â°C (Buck et al. 2012)."

229,167,0.987,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"Despite the considerable pain this must have caused Fuchsiusâs patients, they were virtually invisible in this account, having neither voices to assent or protest, nor any discernible role in their own treatment and recovery. Tellingly, it was the cancer, not the patient, which was deemed âcurableâ, but which could become anthropomorphically âangryâ upon application of the powder. The ferocity of the arsenic powder, which caused tumours to âfall offâ, is equally telling. Chosen because its âeatingâ properties matched that of the malignant cancer, one may see the curative agent in these accounts as an extension of the practitionerâs own strength. Indeed, even as he warned of the difficulty of employing chemical caustics, Wiseman reported that âthey do your work in less than an hourâ.104 Just as cancerous disease was construed in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic terms, portrayals of potent cancer remedies aligned the substances with a sentient agent â in this case, the ministering physician. Arsenic and mercury were not the most commonplace remedies for cancer in the early modern period. In the imaginations of medical writers and their audiences, however, they loomed large, as much for their dangerous side-effects as for their potential to cure. Many medical practitioners, and presumably their patients, were nervous about using substances which caused such drastic collateral damage. For some, the risks seemed unjustifiable, and edged the physician or apothecary over the tenuous boundary between healing and harming, at which point they became no better than âmurtherersâ. However, many others continued to employ heavy metal and metalloid ingredients in their cancer remedies. The appeal of such potent substances was of a piece with the discursive estrangement of patients from their alien, invasive tumours. In the battle against cruel, ârebelliousâ cancers, arsenic and mercury were powerful armaments."
376,662,0.987,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","together with wild ungulates in East Africa during the wet season they achieve higher weight gains than in foraging areas from which wild ungulates are excluded (Odadi et al. 2011). That is probably because zebras (Equus quagga), being comparatively large hind-gut fermenters, reduce the stem:leaf ratio in the sward and thereby facilitate conditions for grazing ruminants such as cattle. Even though competition occurs in the dry season, weight gains from the facilitative effect in the wet season are sufficient that a net benefit might be achievable with management. In theory, managers could impose seasonal shifts in both the foraging areas used by livestock (currently common) and the mixes of livestock and wildlife species foraging together in each season and area (currently uncommon). In practice, however, there are few areas of rangeland in which livestock and wildlife can be actively managed together in a commercial operation at the landscape scale. Yet there are mounting scientific arguments in favor of selectively exploiting the diverse functional properties of wildlife species (du Toit 2011), despite the barriers of command-and-control laws and societal inertia. The megafaunal extinctions that occurred on all continents other than Africa in the late Quaternary Period are attributed to a suite of factors that include overhunting by humans (Brook and Bowman 2004). Now, introducing morphologically and ecologically similar surrogatesâmostly from Africaâhas been proposed to restore the ecosystem processes once driven by those now-extinct megaherbivores in North America (Donlan et al. 2005) and Australia (Bowman 2012). Those ârewildingâ proposals are contentious because benchmark conditions of archaic ecosystems are unknown, the global climate is continually changing, and the practicalities are prohibitive (Rubenstein et al. 2006). Also, sociopolitical acceptance of the rewilding argument requires a leap of faith in the net benefits of quasi-Pleistocene assemblages replete with large predators and megaherbivores (SoulÃ© and Noss 1998). Nevertheless, âhybridâ or ânovelâ ecosystems (Hobbs et al. 2009) are emerging all the time mainly as a result of unintended species invasions and climate change, as well as the intended engineering activities of humans. For example, in the Netherlands 6000 ha of grazing land was created from seabed less than 50 years ago and is now a popular wildlife refuge called Oostvaardersplassen (Marris 2009). The bold approach adopted there was to stock the area with relict breeds of cattle and horses, together with indigenous cervids, lagomorphs, and waterfowl that moved in, and allow competitive and facilitative interactions to play out through time. With minimal intervention from managers, Oostvaardersplassen now supports one of Western Europeâs richest terrestrial faunas occupying a patchwork of grassland, woodland, and wetland habitats. Those plant communities were established naturally, mainly from seeds brought in by birds, and the landscapeâs heterogeneity is maintained by interactions among top-down and bottom-up processes operating through herbivory, the climate, and soil. The ongoing global changes that define the Anthropocene epoch (Zalasiewicz et al. 2010) mean that the reference state of an ecosystem cannot be an historic condition, but is the most desired of the potential alternative states at some"

One can measure ecologically unequal trade in terms of the inequality of various dimensions, such as hours of labour, hectares of land, tonnes of materials, water footprints, and joules or calories. When all or most indicators point in a similar direction, then we can state that there has been an unequal exchange (Hornborg, 2006). Ecologically unequal exchange arises from the structural fact that the metropolitan regions or countries require increasing amounts of energy and materials at cheap prices for their metabolism. The terms of trade are persistently negative for South America as a whole and for most countries individually (one tonne of imports is always more expensive than one tonne of exports, from two to ï¬ve times) in the very long term. However, the terms of trade improved somewhat in the ï¬rst decade of the twenty-ï¬rst century, fuelling a wave of optimism regarding economic growth but later deteriorating again (Samaniego, Vallejo and Martinez-Alier, 2014). Currently, the large physical exports can scarcely pay for the imports in most South American countries. A large physical trade deï¬cit does not imply a positive MTB, and, on the contrary, recent LA trends point to simultaneous physical and monetary deï¬cits. Either in 2013 or 2014, or in both years, there were commercial deï¬cits in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and other countries. While Argentinaâs commercial surplus has been much reduced, there is now a need to ï¬nance commercial deï¬cits (Samaniego, Vallejo and Martinez-Alier, 2014). For Argentina, our analysis of the external trade over a long period (1970â2009) shows (Figure 2.2) small monetary surpluses since the end of the 1990s (in 2001â2002 the surplus increased because the economic crisis violently reduced imports). Such small monetary surpluses almost disappeared in 2013â2014. From a physical point of view, Argentina has exported increasing amounts (in tonnes) since the early 1990s (between three and four times its imports in tonnes), thus demonstrating structurally negative terms of trade. We do not enter into a detailed study here of the physical structure of external trade in the sense of looking at its biomass, mineral and fossil-fuel components (Perez-Manrique et al., 2013; West and Schandl, 2013). We point out, however, that Argentina exports â like Brazil â large amounts of biomass. In comparison, another large South American country, Colombia, does not export large amounts of biomass products but it does export large amounts of coal. The PTB of Colombia shows long-term trends that are not very different from those of Argentina,"
246,78,0.987,Rewilding European Landscapes,"areas and many wild populations have already begun to recover, especially in the case of mammals (Enserink and Vogel 2006). In the case of birds, the literature reports significant changes in the community patterns due to abandonment, especially negative effects on populations of farmland birds with narrow habitat preferences (Sirami et al. 2008). The correlation between the number of mammal species and the percentage of projected abandoned area in a grid cell is Ï = 0.14 ( p < 0.001) whereas for bird species it is negative at Ï = â 0.15 ( p < 0.001). Thus megafauna mammal species might be in a better position to take advantage of the new resources and space made available by farmland abandonment. We did not consider here the possible spatial autocorrelation of the data because we were interested only in the spatial coincidence between abandonment and megafauna. However, some of the future abandoned areas have been affected by invasive species, fire suppression practices, and missing trophic links during thousands of years of human use (ProenÃ§a et al. 2010; Wehn et al. 2011). Thus abandonment may not be sufficient to return these areas to a vegetation close to PNV in a short term without management actions (see Chap. 8). But even in these areas the abandonment will have immediate positive effects on wildlife by reducing human disturbance, increasing landscape connectivity, and releasing ecological processes from human control and thus increasing the wilderness value of the land (see Chap. 1). Aplet et al. (2000) describe the two dimensional space defined by the axes of freedom and naturalness as a framework for wilderness management. Freedom is understood as the absence of human control over ecological processes (i.e selfwilled) while naturalness is the degree to which ecosystems are close to an accepted ecological benchmark. Such a framework is readily usable for mapping the tradeoffs related to human management in areas affected by invasive and exotic species, thus increasing naturalness but decreasing freedom (Landres et al. 2000; Sydoriak et al. 2000), but also the current views on rewilding as some advocate for serious management commitments in order to achieve a certain perception of wilderness (Donlan et al. 2006). However, we consider that the ultimate aim of rewilding is not to recreate some image of pre-human ecosystems, but to facilitate new, selfregulating systems that appear naturally out of the current conditions. A realistic expectation is that in the absence of human management, the new rewilded areas will form novel ecosystems that share elements with the pre-human past but also integrate current factors. Minimum human management and this new wilderness of natural and self-sustaining ecosystems should be the goal of rewilding."

18,302,0.987,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"revealing that heavily contaminated areas were generated mainly in a northwesterly direction from FDNPS [2]. It is thus of great importance to understand the magnitude of individual doses to populations in affected areas from the aspect of foreseeing health effects attributed to radiation exposure in the accident. Preliminary dose estimations for inhabitants in Fukushima Prefecture and the whole of Japan have been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) [3]. The Fukushima government has also initiated dose estimations of the inhabitants inside the prefecture and results obtained are described as follows. External dose estimations of 228,512 inhabitants have been completed as of the end of October 2012, demonstrating that 99.6 % of these are 5 mSv in effective dose for the first 4 months after the accident [4]. These estimations have been performed using a system for calculating individual external doses based on time-series maps of ambient dose rates in Fukushima Prefecture and personal behavior records. Human measurements of the inhabitants with whole-body counters (WBCs) have been performed for estimating their internal doses. It has been reported that 26 of 90,050 subjects exceeded 1 mSv in the committed effective dose (CED) [5]. However, it should be noted that this result is for internal doses only from 134Cs and 137Cs. The early internal dose, which is expected to be received by the intake of short-lived nuclides (e.g., 131I, 132I, 132Te) during the first few months after the accident, still remains unknown because of limited information available. Concern is thus raised concerning thyroid exposure to small children from the intake of radioiodine, as with situations found after Chernobyl accident [6]. In 2012, the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS) launched a project on the reconstruction of the early internal dose to the inhabitants in Fukushima and adjacent prefectures. As the first action of this project, the 1st NIRS symposium on âReconstruction of early internal dose in the TEPCO Fukushima nuclear power station accidentâ was held on 10â11 July 2012. The main aims of this symposium were twofold: (1) to collect human and environmental measurement data available for estimating the early internal dose to the inhabitants and (2) to discuss methods for reconstructing the thyroid equivalent dose (hereinafter, thyroid dose) among invited experts from Japan and overseas. The proceedings of the symposium, including 17 peer-reviewed 17 papers and the summary of the discussion, have been published by NIRS [7]. Table 16.1 lists authors and titles of the papers included in the proceedings. The goals of the project this year are set as (1) to propose best methods for the internal dose estimation and (2) to estimate representative doses to the inhabitants of each area in Fukushima prefecture. This chapter briefly describes the current status of the project."
278,314,0.987,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"As mentioned previously, most of the indicators described in this chapter represent pressures rather than impacts in the strict sense defined by LCA. Most footprint indicators (and consumption-based accounting studies) are designed to portray indirect pressures (Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014), but there are recent attempts to introduce (environmental) impact assessment in footprint analysis. This is perhaps most prominently the case for water footprinting where it has been argued that the scarcity of water needs to be incorporated into the metric (Chenoweth et al. 2014; ISO 2014; Kounina et al. 2013; Ridoutt and Pfister 2010). Some recent studies related to trade weight water use with data on water scarcity (e.g. Lenzen et al. 2013; Orlowsky et al. 2014). A similar case can be made for the material footprint which sums up the mass of different raw materials into one number, thus reflecting an unweighted physical measure of pressure and potential impact (Wiedmann et al. 2015). Weighting according to actual environmental impacts has not been tried yet and is difficult, because different materials have different impacts, one material may have several impacts and characterisation data and models for localised impacts are not yet well developed. However, preliminary attempts of weighting resource footprints based on resource depletion have been presented (Fang and Heijungs 2014a). Yet, there remains value in reporting footprints based on pressures alone. The pure mass or volume of resource use is practical information that relates to physical reality, i.e. how much actually is flowing. It allows, for example, to address questions of allocation of limited supplies or security of supply and sustainability of overall production and consumption. The ultimate goal of footprint accounting in general (and the assessment of impacts embodied in trade specifically) should be an evaluation of whether or not particular activities are sustainable (Fang and Heijungs 2014b). Environmental footprints measure human appropriation of natural resources and need to be interpreted in the context of maximum sustainable levels at the local and the global scale (Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014). Exactly how high the sustainable thresholds of earth systems are is the subject of intense research (Steffen et al. 2015)."
255,232,0.987,Railway Ecology,"On the other hand, our analysis of the flight initiation distance of different groups of birds showed that they do not seem to respond to trains as if they were predators, but rather human-associated elements (MÃ¸ller et al. 2013; Neumann et al. 2013). Thus, species that are more tolerant of people or even anthropophilic (e.g., passerines and pigeons) show flight initiation distances that are signiï¬cantly shorter than those of crows and birds of prey, which are more predatory (Table 8.5). Some species that are frequently observed around railways (e.g., the crested lark, doves, and pigeons) do not take flight in response to incoming trains, putting themselves at risk of being hit or dragged by the turbulence of the passing train. In short, it is evident that at least some of the birds living in the surroundings of the HSR do not treat trains as a natural threat, and exhibit some habituation to HSR train circulation. However, HSR train speed often proves fatal when birds enter the collision risk area. Both factors could explain the high mortality rates near the HSR relative to rates near other linear infrastructures, though further research on other HSR stretches should be done to determine if this pattern of ï¬ndings is representative of broader HSR areas."

73,122,0.987,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"IWM has undergone several transformations, and although DRR is a more recent concept, it too has been moulded to suit speciï¬c local conditions at different scales. These evolutionary changes in both ï¬elds have sought to develop âself-generated processes of dynamic changeâ by a âsubstantial devolution of power to smaller territorial unitsâ within an overall system, thus we now see the emergence of community-based disaster risk reduction (Twig 2004) and participatory watershed management (McGregor et al. 2006; Gregersen et al. 2007), both of which can be suitably characterised by using elements of Friedmann and Weaverâs (1979) approach. However, the related connection between the two planning approaches is effected through the medium of water: as Gregersen et al. (2007: 2) highlight, âwater ï¬ows downstream, ignoring all political boundaries en routeâ and âmost of the things that people do to their land and water upstream affects the water quantity, timing of ï¬ow and quality downstream and, as a consequence, downstream land productivity in its various forms.â This applies equally in the context of disaster risk reduction as land use changes in the watershed can have profound implications for vulnerability as experienced by others (rural, urban and peri-urban) located downstream. This has clear ramiï¬cations in the context of rapid peri-urban change, particularly where marginalised lands are settled, and compounds vulnerability issues stemming from agricultural productivity in surrounding rural areas as well as urban water scarcity and food insecurity. In such scenarios, the watershed approach could be a crucial planning and policy tool for effective and efï¬cient management of natural resources, particularly in regard to reducing disaster risk and maintaining future food security in expanding populous urban cores, where high quality agricultural land is often a primary focus of conversion to other, more urban land uses. The watershed approach is equally important in the tackling of âwildlandâ ï¬res in the PUI, as water resources can form effective physical barriers for mitigation and ï¬re breaks, and natural water storage features become water reservoirs for ï¬re ï¬ghting operations. Wildï¬res regularly cause extensive devastation, affecting both poor and rich, in the USA, Australia, Europe (including Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece); and South Africa (Goldammer 2005; Ye 2005). The vulnerability stemming from problems associated with wildland ï¬res is particularly acute when the PUI is characterised by extensive forestry and tree-based systems as opposed to lands predominantly used for agricultural purposes. The demand for, and high value proï¬ts from, suburban development set in woodland areas exacerbates these issues which is one reason that wildï¬res often occur on the fringes of Australian, European and North American cities (Goldammer 2005; Ye 2005), although such risks and vulnerabilities are not unique to high-income countries; for example, wildï¬res have also devastated many periurban areas in Indonesia (Tacconi et al. 2007)."

241,1205,0.987,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The impact of climate change on coasts is exacerbated by the increasing need for coastal protection by human activities (Bardach 1989; Beukema et al. 1990; van der Meulen et al. 1991). There are two main types of management strategy. The ï¬rst is to stabilise the existing coastline and thus protect coastal and neighbouring areas from future change. The second, which is more resilient and depends on human adaptation to coastal change, accepts that in some places the coast would be not protected and would be left in its natural state. The costs for adapting to climate change are generally much lower than the costs of damage incurred through a lack of adaptation. Local communities are currently better prepared for extreme events; but still very few local administrations are attempting to estimate costs associated with the risks of future climate change. Projecting future costs is also complicated because different local authorities may prefer different coastal development and management policies, for example, for protection against coastal erosion. European projects such as ASTRA (Astra-project 2007), EUROSION (European Commission 2004), SINCOS (Richter et al. 2007) or MICORE (Ferreira et al. 2009) have provided new data and insights regarding storm effects on the Baltic Sea coast. Administrative borders in coastal areas and efforts for coastal protection differ among Baltic Sea countries, even between neighbouring nations. Some management actions are complicated by the morphodynamic changes caused by artiï¬cial coastal stabilisation in some places and its natural disruption in others. The coastal zone is a linear environment that knows no national or decision-making boundaries. Decadal-scale climatic change and variability may initiate a pulse of activity that results in a complex, nonlinear landscape response.

Larval stages of amphibians have been observed to be less sensitive than fish to a range of chemicals (Weltje et al. 2013), and the toxicity data for fish can be extrapolated to and be protective of amphibians. Therefore, aquatic stages of amphibians were not considered further in the ERA. Other invertebrates. Toxicity data for four other invertebrates were found (Table 2). The LC50 of 12,000 Î¼g CPY Lâ1 for Brachionus calyciflorus is consistent with the lack of sensitivity of rotifers to pesticides in general (Brock et al. 2000). Similarly, the three LC/EC50 values for aquatic mollusks ranged from 154 to >806 Î¼g CPY Lâ1, which also is consistent with general lack of sensitivity of this taxon to insecticides (Brock et al. 2000).

10,215,0.987,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"success supports the coherence of actions relevant to water management at the catchment scale. Regarding the common perception of problems and goals ambitions, the very positive consensus on water management can be assessed by the fact of general acceptance, i.e. the acceptance, by all stakeholders representing the various water uses, of the priority given to drinking water. The availability of water provided by the dam supports this priority. However, the perception of the risk of drought and the potential impacts on freshwater availability is almost absent for the majority of stakeholders. This can be explained by the more frequent flooding issues in the area, which was, in particular, observed during the period of interviews in connection with the floods that occurred in Brittany early in 2014. As there is no comprehensive information about the quantity of water withdrawn by all water users, water managers are not really able to implement a truly coherent policy by soliciting coherent strategy and instruments. Moreover, the SAGE is a compromise between stakeholders, and some of them are more organized than others. As a result, some interests are taken into account more than others, especially those related to the drinking water supply. Furthermore, despite the work being conducted to integrate agricultural regulation in the WFD, agricultural policy is still declared by local stakeholders to be too thoroughly disconnected from the other instruments in the catchment due to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), which is decided at the European level and is not linked directly with water policy at the local level. A coherent implementation of strategy and instruments is, thus, hard to ï¬nd for water management as a whole in the area and even harder for drought management. The responsibilities of each actor with regard to the WFD are not obvious. Most actors think that the responsibility lies mainly in the hands of the State services as represented by the Water Agency. Most water users are not considering the link between their activities and water resource management. In fact, the LWCâs responsibility is to be a decision-making authority, but it has neither the ï¬nancial nor the technical means to implement decisions, so it has no resources to implement the plan of actions proposed.

364,246,0.987,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"The incidence of food insecurity can be viewed as the ultimate effect of several inter-related biophysical and socio-economic factors that comprise the main hazards and risks. Environmental degradation, for example, may be caused by a combination of manâs interaction with physical resources and naturally occurring hazards. It is evident in all the sites that the declining land resource base is adversely affecting farm and fishery householdsâ incomes and livelihoods, resulting in the threat of food insufficiency for the poorest. Across sites, households perceive that continued occurrence of climatic and other natural events in the years to come will have a major impact on their incomes, family health, food security, and the circumstances of the community as a whole. With these issues in mind, the following technical and policy concerns should be taken into consideration to develop a research agenda that would facilitate the creation of a plan for managing watersheds and implementing related strategies. 1. Developing an integrated approach to watershed management that covers both land and water resources entails convening the major stakeholders to: (1) develop and agree on a common vision, goals, and objectives for managing the watershed and lake resources (e.g., improved water quality for a given period of time); (2) identify issues and problems that may hinder the fulfilment of the vision, goals, and objectives; and (3) prioritize and develop an agreed action plan for dealing with the identified problems and/or constraints. 2. In trying to address issues relating to soil and land degradation, it is important to determine whether the causes are anthropogenic or geogenic, since the potential solutions would be different. For example, many problems related to soil and land degradation can be traced to watershed management practices that are dictated by stakeholdersâ socio-economic circumstances. Of research interest, therefore, are studies on the appropriateness of different technologies given different physical and biological conditions of the soil. Technologies that address different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions among farmers might include re-vegetation, erosion control measures, water conservation, agroforestry systems, organic farming, and use of organic pesticides. 3. When developing plans for the watershed areas, addressing poverty and providing the means to make a living at the household level should be a major consideration, given our understanding of the relationships between land and water resources"

364,253,0.987,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Flooding is a natural disaster caused by climatological factors such as temperature, rainfall distribution, evaporation, wind movements, and the natural terrain (Balek 1983). Fauchereau et al. (2003) and Camerlengo and Somchit (2000) have attributed the change in rainfall distribution to the global warming phenomenon. Flooding can be categorized into river flooding, flash floods, and storm surges. River flooding is caused by heavy and/or continuous rainfall over a period of a few days or weeks in a large area. An important characteristic of this type of flooding is the soil, which becomes saturated, exceeding its capacity to absorb water, and thereby increasing overland flow and water retention (Kron 2002; Berz et al. 2001). In Malaysia, the flood disasters that occur are due to flash floods, tropical storms, and monsoon storms. On the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the states of Terengganu, Kelantan, and Pahang, flooding normally occurs in the rainy season and the frequency of these floods is affected by changes in the monsoon seasons (Chan 1996; Jamaluddin and Sham 1987; Rose and Peter 2001). During the monsoon seasons there is a continuous and increased amount of rainfall, causing the river waters to overflow. Climate change is seen as a global phenomenon; however, its impacts are localized and long-term. The effects of climate change are evident in the increased occurrence of flooding in the coastal areas of Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and Johor. Continuation of this scenario will have a significant impact on the societyâs culture and economically sensitive sectors as well as on the well-being of those affected. Among the impacts of floods are pollution; erosion; damage to building structures; loss of property; loss of life; damage to the drainage system; contamination of food and water; disruption of socio-economic activities, including the transportation, telecommunications, and services network; and loss of environmental services resulting from effects such as the degradation of agricultural soil. Flood occurrences in 2006 and 2007 amounted to RM 1.1 billion and RM 776 million in losses, respectively. This amount reflects only the losses incurred by the Malaysian government, and does not take into consideration losses sustained by flood victims and by the local economy. Those worst affected by the floods are residents who are weak and less well prepared. One of the strategies for flood risk management, therefore, is to make those vulnerable to flood disasters more resilient and better prepared. Efforts need to be focused toward mitigation and enhancing the adaptability or coping capabilities of these residents."
241,1415,0.987,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"net radiation energy at the surface is used for vertical heat transfer than for evapotranspiration (see also Bonan 2008). However, woodland can also sustain its evapotranspiration rate when water availability is low, which leads to lower Bowen ratios than in grassland in dry conditions; that is, grassland becomes the source of excess heating instead of woodland. There are still important problems in relation to how ALCCs are explored in numerical experiments using climate models. Pielke et al. (2011) concluded that most studies were based on only one or two models, which did not reflect the uncertainty between models in their responses to increased CO2 levels or in the strength of their landâatmosphere interactions, an uncertainty that is evident in the LUCID multi-model study of Pitman et al. (2009). That study mainly focused on the Northern Hemisphere summer season, and the key result was a statistically signiï¬cant impact of ALCC on the simulated latent heat flux and air temperature over the regions where anthropogenic land cover changed, but the direction of the change in summer temperature was inconsistent among the models. In terms of rainfall, four of the coupled atmosphereâland models used showed a signiï¬cant impact on rainfall over regions with ALCC, while three models did not show impacts greater than the expected random variability of model outputs (Seneviratne et al. 2010). In their review, Pitman et al. (2009) did not ï¬nd statistically signiï¬cant impacts of ALCC on latent heat flux, temperature or rainfall remote from the actual ALCC, that is no teleconnections. The authors also suggested that robust conclusions on the effects of ALCCs on climate can only be drawn from multi-model experiments. Studies based on a single model only provide indications of possible feedback mechanisms and their implications. The goal of the most recently published part of the LUCID project (de Noblet-DucoudrÃ© et al. 2012) was to provide a detailed examination of why the LSMs diverge in their response to ALCC. For this purpose, the authors used seven atmosphereâland models with a common experimental design. For the vegetation distribution, each model used as a starting point the same distribution of crop and pasture, at a resolution of 0.5Â° Ã 0.5Â°, as extracted from Ramankutty and Foley (1999), combined with the pasture areas from Klein Goldewijk et al. (2011) (Fig. 25.8). However, as there are between-model differences in (i) the way land information was represented, (ii) sources of information to describe present-day and potential vegetation, and (iii) strategies to implement ALCC in the model, the resulting land-cover distribution (including natural vegetation) used in each model differed (de Noblet-DucoudrÃ© et al. 2012; Fig. 25.8). Although the areas covered by crops increased from AD 1870 to AD 1992 in all land-cover data sets used, the increase varied; all LSMs describe temperate deforestation, but at"

With respect to measuring resilience literature has shown that there are no universal or generally applicable indicators of resilience (or of vulnerability or adaptive capacity), as these phenomena are highly context-specific. However, a number of studies have sought to define dimensions of resilience, with each dimension gathering together a suite of related factors that might be represented by context-specific indicators (Alexander 201316; Nguyen and James 201317).

200,235,0.987,"Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Nuclear Risks","There were many deficits of nuclear risk governance in Japan before and after the Fukushima accident, as Taketoshi Taniguchi, the leading Japanese scholar in the field, illustrates by using the framework of ârisk governance deficits,â proposed by IRGC (International Risk Governance Council) [1, 2]. Not only were they created and embedded in the governance system before the Fukushima disaster, but it has been remained or even worsened after many accident reports were published and pointed out many problems which led the worst nuclear catastrophe in the history of Japanese nuclear utilization and suggested their recommendations to remedy them. In this paper, the author would analyze such remained problems found in the postaccident âon-site managementâ policy and measures, taking the case of contaminated water management at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. âOnsite managementâ includes many recovery works performed at the Fukushima Daiichi siteââstabilizationâ work in the language of the government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)âsuch as setting up building covers to limit the further dispersion of radioactive substances; reinforcing buildings feared to have lost structural strength due to the effects of hydrogen explosions; containing contaminated water with various concentrations of radioactive substances, generated as a result of continuous water injection and cooling; and collecting and transporting leftover spent fuel. It is one of the most difficult problems in the on-site management tasks mentioned above that the management of the highly radioactive contaminated water building up day by day. Due to various technical limitations, the temporary water injection and cooling system was built as not totally closed-cycle, and the damage caused by the accident allowed a huge amount of groundwater to flood the buildings. Inevitably, as the water gets contaminated with radioactive substances, highly radioactive contaminated water is continually produced. On top of this, since the path carrying the contaminated water to sea could not initially be identified or blocked, there were fears of marine pollution spreading. Regarding this contaminated water treatment at the Fukushima site, a series of âfollow-upâ measures have been taken and caused the delay of underground water pump-out. Finally, the âice wallâ project to block underground water intrusion seems to be failed. Failures result in the increase of total amount of contaminated water and further social distrust about the feasibility and progress of Fukushima decommission project in Fukushima residents, entire Japanese society, and international community. In the following sections, the author would describe the development of contaminated water management policy, measures, and institutional framework in chronological manner and then analyze the cause of their failure trajectory using a sociological concept âstructural disasterâ developed and suggested by Miwao Matsumoto, the pioneering sociologist of science who has shed light on the problems at the interfaces among science, technology and society, to understand"
230,306,0.987,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"7.3 Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Abundance of Microplastics Our understanding about the distribution and the factors affecting the distribution of microplastics in the oceans is limited and much of the sampling to date has been opportunistic utilizing existing research programs (research cruises, educational programs, routine plankton monitoring) to collect material. There has also been some targeted microplastic sampling and attempts to make formal comparisons in the abundance of microplastics between locations (Browne et al. 2010, 2011). Existing data indicate that microplastics are widely distributed in surface waters, in shallow waters (Browne et al. 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz et al. 2012), in deepsea sediments (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013) and in the digestive tract of a range of organisms living within these habitats (Lusher 2015). With the exception of heavily contaminated areas such as shipbreaking yards (Reddy et al. 2006), the abundance of microplastics would appear to be relatively low in surface waters and sediments (see Lusher 2015). By volume it is apparent, however, that sediments are more contaminated than surface waters. However, because of their ubiquity, the total quantity of microplastics in the environment is considerable and in some locations represents the most numerous type of debris present (Browne et al. 2010). This ubiquity is also demonstrated by encounters when considered by marine species, of which around 10 % are with microplastics (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel GEF 2012). In terms of spatial patterns in abundance, at a global scale Browne et al. (2011) detected a weak relationship between the abundance of microplastics and human population density. Extensive sampling by Law et al. (2010) demonstrated the role of large-scale physical factors leading to increased abundance in the North Atlantic gyre far from the nearest land. She matched abundance data form the ocean surface with model predictions based on physical factors indicating that, at large scales, factors driving the abundance of debris can be used to make predictions about relative abundance (Law et al. 2010; Fig. 7.5). Formal comparisons also demonstrated patterns at smaller spatial scales with locations previously used for the dumping of sewage sludge having greater quantities of microplastic than control areas (Browne et al. 2011). In addition, intertidal sediments on shores that were downwind in relation to prevailing wind direction can have greater quantities of microplastic than those on shorelines that were up-wind (Browne et al. 2010). Targeted sampling has also indicated extremely high microplastic abundance near to a plastic processing plant in Sweden (NorÃ©n 2008). However, while the role of some potential sources including sewage and industrial spillage have been demonstrated together with the influence of physical factors leading to accumulation of debris in particular locations, our collective understanding of the relative importance of these factors in influencing spatial patterns of distribution or in making predictions about such is limited. Only a handful of studies have considered temporal patterns in the abundance of microplastics. Thompson et al. (2004) in the northeast Atlantic and Goldstein"

Based on the above analysis it is clear that none of these âgrand theoriesâ can fully explain what has been experienced on Bellona Islandânot at the âisland scaleâ and even less so at the âhousehold scaleâ. Making use of the holistic understanding of livelihoods, and the assumption that people pursue a range of livelihood outcomes by drawing on a range of assets to pursue a variety of activities (Farrington et al. 1999) may help us understand the complexity and diversity in response to drivers of change. In their reflections on the development within livelihood research, de Haan and Zoomers (2005) advocate the analytical and methodological use of the concept âpathwaysâ to describe patterns of livelihood among particular social groups. Several more general livelihood pathways may be identified on the basis of different access to and availability of assets for the household. One such pathway is shown in Fig. 4.5.

386,163,0.987,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"5.3.2 Processing of Variables The variables described in the previous subsection are summarized in Table 5.1. The question for which countries these variables should be collected and processed is answered through data availability and conception issues. On the latter issue, most empirical studies restrict themselves to wealthier countries, because the âvarietiesâ otherwise would often just distinguish poorer from wealthier countries, as Solga (2014) explains. As another distinction from clustering exercises on general economic characteristics, it does not make sense to treat European countries separately. For more than 50 years, the European Union (EU) has enjoyed a common agricultural policy, so that important characteristics are no longer nation specific, particularly not the degree to which agriculture is subsidized. Therefore, the EU was treated as an entity in the analysis. K-means (Steinhaus 1956; Jain 2010) as the most established algorithm of cluster analysis was used in Stata. The average farm size was eventually transformed into a logarithmic scale to avoid a too-powerful influence on the outcome. After various attempts, we decided that dividing participating countries into three groups would generate the highest explanatory value."
255,145,0.987,Railway Ecology,"the area. Hence, reducing the disturbance of the existing communities as much as possible, may be itself a good management practice. Propagule pressure is also important. Christen and Matlack (2006) suggested that undisturbed areas are generally less invaded precisely because they may receive fewer non-native propagules. Avoiding the introduction of non-native propagules prevents not only the establishment of invasive species, but also offers much greater economic beneï¬ts than the management of invasive populations after their establishment (Keller et al. 2007). Equally important, management options available prior to invasion are more numerous and include legislation or quarantine rules (Keller et al. 2011; Buckley and Catford 2016). In this context, the inspection of cargo and their containers is of great importance, particularly for those having an international origin. For example, a recent inspection of international cargo entering the USA by rail enabled the identiï¬cation of dozens of undeclared organisms, among which were invasive insects, noxious weeds and vectors of human diseases (https://goo.gl/fJ1uMo). Following legal rulings, some of the inspected cargo was re-exported to its origin in order to prevent the dispersal of the unwanted pests. In many cases, however, prevention is not possible as the non-native species are already established in the landscape. In such cases, management actions should aim at containing or eradicating these species. However, the broad range of invasive species and the different ways that humans value the colonized ecosystems mean that few generalizations can be provided for management and policy guidelines. In other words, appropriate management and policies for invasive species is highly context dependent (Keller et al. 2011). However, based on the review provided by Catford et al. (2012), one can consider four not mutually exclusive main approaches for managing transportation corridor verges when attempting to control or eradicate invasive species: (1) âDo nothing;â (2) âControl at the introduction level by managing the propagule supply of non-native and native species;â (3) âManage environmental conditions;â and (4) âManage invasive species populations.â 1. Do nothing. This is an option when invaders are well established and are successional colonists. Several studies have shown that the proportion of invasive species can decrease with time since disturbanceânot only weedy plants (Bellingham et al. 2005), but also larger plants (Dewine and Cooper 2008). Hence, active management by removal of invasive species immediately following disturbance may be unnecessary and counterproductive. For example, tamarisk species (Tamarix ramosissima, T. chinensis, T. gallica and hybrids) have invaded riparian zones throughout western North America, southern Africa, Argentina, Hawaii, and Australia, demanding expensive control efforts. However, as a relatively recent addition to North American plant communities (the 1920sâ1960s was the period of main invasion), the competitive and successional processes are still ongoing. In fact, Dewine and Cooper (2008) demonstrated that box elder (Acer negundo), a native species found in canyons throughout western North America, is a superior competitor to tamarisk and is capable of becoming established under dense tamarisk canopies, overtopping and eventually killing the tamarisks. Thus, superior shade tolerance appears to"

157,370,0.987,"The Economy as a Complex Spatial System : Macro, Meso and Micro Perspectives","in a developed country, called country 1, and have the option to off-shore manufacturing activity to an emerging country, called country 2. The unit costs of production in country 1 are higher but are decreased by cost-reducing externalities, to which we refer as within-country spillovers. These within-country spillovers depend on the share of manufacturing activity in country 1. More specifically, the higher the level of manufacturing activity, the higher are the spillovers and the cost-reducing externalities. In this case, the level of spillovers co-evolves over time with the share of manufacturing activity and crucially influences the strategic location choices of firms. Manufacturing costs can also be reduced by cross-border spillovers that capture the benefit of knowledge developed in country i that spills over to the other country j and reduces the costs of production there. In line with empirical evidence which reveals that knowledge spillovers are geographically localized and that knowledge transfer decreases with distance even within the same firm (see, e.g., Adams and Jaffe (1996, Rosenthal and Strange 2003 and Jaffe et al. 1993)), we assume that cross-border spillovers per unit of production are smaller than (or equal to) within-country spillovers. In our framework, knowledge spillovers can also be developed within country 2, but the related cost-reducing externalities might differ from country 1. This assumption is motivated by empirical evidence which highlights that technological spillovers and innovation activity vary across locations due to differences in initial endowments, the actions of actors engaged in R&D (governments, universities and firms), the links among those actors, and the differences in educational systems and regulation, see, e.g., Nelson (1993) and Furman et al. (2002). The effect of endowment drivers are simply captured by an additional linear cost component â representing congestion costs â that depends on the level of activity in country 2. Congestion costs measure the level, the quality, and the (in)efficiencies of the infrastructure and facilities that a country can offer. It is an essential feature of a manufacturing site that has a crucial impact on the location choice of MNEs. Moreover, this feature is country-specific as it cannot be easily transferred from country to country and it cannot be modified in the short run. It depends on the level of education, the structural investments undertaken in the past, the resources invested in research in the last decades and the quality of the institutions. For the sake of simplicity, and without loss of generality, the congestion costs are assumed to be zero for country 1. The cost-reducing effect due to internal (within-country) and external (crossborder) spillovers are modeled as in Bischi et al. (2003a) and Bischi et al. (2003b) and we adopt their functional form for the unit costs of manufacturing. The novel element in our model is that we introduce congestion costs. The firmsâ location decisions are based on the relative performance of producing at home in country 1 and producing in the foreign country 2. The switching between decisions is described by a replicator dynamics, see, e.g., Hofbauer and Sigmund (2003). The evolutionary framework proposed in this chapter links firmâs location choices with internal and external knowledge spillovers and congestion costs. We illustrate how such a highly stylized dynamical model can be used to derive policy implications. We further shed light on aspects such as the combined impact of"

On the other hand, flexibility between species is allowed. Catches of species that are subject to the landing obligation and that are caught in excess of quotas of the stocks in question, or catches of species in respect of which the MS has no quota, may be deducted from the quota of the target species provided that they do not exceed 9% of the quota of the target species.86 This second possibilityâflexibility between speciesâhas been seen by some as a breach of RS in favor of the autonomy of MSs, as it allows applying not used-up quotas to other species for which there is no quota, or for which quotas have been exceeded.87 In summary, RS maintains its flexibility mechanisms (quota swapping and yearto-year flexibility), the landing obligation is not absolute (with the exemptions of high survivability, de minimis, prohibited species, and predator-damaged fish), the fishing opportunities that take into account the effect of discards are expected to increase, and some flexibility between species will be admitted. Will this be enough? The biggest concern is with the so-called choke species, which may even further reduce quota exchanges. MSs that previously got rid of certain quotas will now need them to cover the discard ban to prevent that other species strangle the catches of its target species. The real challenges lie with the demersal species. Although we will have to wait to see what happens on the fishing grounds, the experience with pelagic species has not been encouraging. In this case, the choke species have not stimulated quota exchanges but rather reduced them.88 At this point, it should be remembered that one of the objectives of the CFP is to increase productivity in fisheries by ensuring the rational development of fisheries production and the optimum utilization of the factors of production, in particular labor.89 A notion that must be understood in the light of other objectives, which include a fair standard of living for the fishing community and supply at reasonable prices.

This, in turn, prompted wider transformationsâ in the zoosâ physical structures as post-mortem rooms and more sanitary animal enclosures were built; in their ânaturalâ landscapes as unhealthy swamps were drained; and in their social organization, as new staff were employed to manage health and investigate disease. The health of zoo animals therefore provides a unique perspective on the history of the zoo and its animal inhabitants. In health, disease and death, zoo animals inspired medical men to engage with them, both directly within the zoo, and remotely via the traces they left on the medical record. This chapter has revealed how both humans and animals were produced through these relationships. Animals were transformed into patients, victims of their environments, pathological material, and points of comparison across species, while human doctors became healers and investigators of animals. In the process, perceptions of what it meant to be human or animal changed. âIn-houseâ efforts to improve animal health proceeded on the basis that animals were sufficiently close to humans to permit the application, by doctors, of ideas and practices drawn from human medical contexts. In practice, however, animalsâ resistance to handling and their unusual anatomiesâwhich attracted medical attention independently of the pathologies they displayedâplaced limits on the wholesale importation of human medicine into the zoo. Likewise, while investigations into comparative pathology reinforced notions that humans and animals (particularly monkeys) were sufficiently similar to allow deductions about the former to be drawn from the latter, they also highlighted key differences that were attributed to, and served to consolidate ideas about, their evolutionary relationships. In these ways, the practice of medicine within the zoo simultaneously brought humans and animals closer together, and demarcated the distances between them. Medical interventions in the zoo also had implications for animal, and to a lesser extent, human health. Some of the zoosâ more valuable mammalian inhabitants probably did benefit from zoological society efforts, especially those directed towards environmental improvements. Mortality statistics are not particularly useful in revealing such benefits because they refer to all species. Also, it should be noted that without medical interventions, mortality rates may have been even higher. Rickets provides the best example of a disease whose management in humans was advanced through investigations performed on zoo animals.

It was quickly forgotten that just days before this same city was regarded a risky âhotspotâ of unusually high inner city temperatures after a long heat wave that caused many creeks in its rural surroundings to completely dry out. This example is consistent with a general pattern in many areas in Northwest Europe: weathers are often more extreme than they used to be and water management will have to cope with that, through increasing the resilience of our water systems. This book, based on the many insights that are gathered from the project âBeneï¬t of governance in drought adaptationâ (DROP, Interreg IVb NWE) provides an overview of a variety of drought situations in six areas in Northwest Europe, the measures taken to improve these situations and especially an in-depth treatment of the governance conditions that support or restrict the realization of these measures. The people in Northwest Europe that have always, and rightfully so, regarded themselves as living in a water rich area not only need to get used to more weather extremes, but especially to one of the extremes: drought. The availability of sufï¬cient water of apt quality for purposes such as agriculture, nature, and service and drinking water production has become less self-evident and will likely even become less certain in the future. Each of these three functions gets special attention in the comparative chapters in this book. Sufï¬cient freshwater supply is also important for shipping, use, and discharge of cooling water, and for flushing waterways in the low-lying parts of the country to prevent saltwater intrusion in a country such as the Netherlands. Generally, sufï¬cient freshwater supply is a matter of utmost importance as part of a good investment climate for economic activities that are"
118,472,0.987,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"Abstract In this chapter, the biological effects of exposure to radiation are summarized and explained from the perspective of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. First, a series of fundamental concepts in radiation biology are addressed to define the different types and sources of ionizing radiation, and resulting paths of human exposure. The health effects prompted by exposure to radiation are then broadly categorized and correlated with the nature of exposure and its extent. Finally, those concepts are revisited to assess the potential health impacts and risks endured by the workers and general population affected by the uncontrolled release of radiation around the Fukushima area. In the wake of the 2011 accident, a surge of public concern over the safety of nuclear energy and potential health risks from radiation exposure has re-surfaced. To evaluate, understand, and mitigate those health risks, it is essential that scientific data be meticulously gathered, rigorously analyzed, and accurately communicated. Taking a systematic knowledge-based approach to accurately capture the risks of exposure to radiation will not only alleviate mass confusion, but also help public health officials and emergency responders better prepare and implement logistics, should another such unfortunate event take place. The topics discussed in this chapter are intended to provide basic tools for understanding how health effects and risks related to radiation exposure are evaluated.

This divergence is even more pronounced when one looks at the full birth cohort, which includes those who dropped out of high school or completed high school but did not go on for further education or training (see Chap. 7, Fig. 7.13). Gradients is a metaphor for the strength of the relationships between the dimensions of human capital on the one hand, and various life outcomes on the other. Life outcomes include whether the individual is employed, the nature and remuneration (salary and benefits) of that employment, the possibility of obtaining further education/training, accumulation of wealth, the likelihood of forming stable family units, and having children in the context of those partnerships. The data show that the gradients are typically quite steep; that is, modest differences in human capital can result in substantial differences in outcomes. For example, both the likelihood of full-time employment and the likelihood of having children in the context of a twoparent family are strongly correlated with levels of educational attainment and cognitive skills. Gradients are critical because they account for much of the relative advantage or disadvantage that is passed on to the next generation. It is worth pointing out that gradients are typically not linear. That is, there are inflection points such that there can be large differences in outcomes for individuals who are close in many facets of human capital. For example, individuals with similar cognitive skills but who differ in whether they obtained a college degree can have very different adult trajectories. On the other hand, differences between inflection points may be less consequential. In the remainder of the chapter, the gates/gaps/gradients framework will be used to organize some of the voluminous literature concerning the forces and processes driving differences in opportunity, as well as the extent of those differences."
38,542,0.987,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"there were no invasion indicators that had been developed for reporting at a global scale (Genovesi et al. 2013). There were many sources of information, but no collated body of data with global coverage on which species were where, and what impact they were having, particularly not for a range of taxonomic groups (McGeoch et al. 2012). Apart from many local case studies and a few regional ones (notably for Europe) there were also very few data on changes in the numbers of species threatening biodiversity over time. The solution was to tackle the problem from three angles (McGeoch et al. 2010). First, using an operational deï¬nition that distinguished alien from invasive species (McGeoch et al. 2012), a stratiï¬ed, random subset of countries was chosen to calculate the number of invasive species per country. This provided a robust, representative baseline measure of invasion pressure on countries that can now be tracked over time. Second, the well-known IUCN Red List Index (http://www.bipindicators.net/rli/2010; Butchart 2008) was used to illustrate trends in the extinction risk of a subset of species threatened by invasive species. Finally, information on policy trends relevant to invasion was used to indicate how countries were responding to the problem. In sum, by using a combination of systematic data collation, adaptation of an existing indicator, and data on policy trends, an informative indicator for biological invasion was born. Certain metrics can be used to create multiple indicators for different purposes, as illustrated earlier for forest extent (see also Box 12.2). This demonstrates the value and importance of focusing on the key metrics, or Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs; Pereira et al. 2013) that, when cut in certain ways and/or combined with ancillary data, can provide the most information on biodiversity change. Indicators for many of the Aichi Targets can be derived from a relatively small set of such metrics (Geijzendorffer et al. 2016; for an example, see Fig. 1.2). Equally, where metrics can be standardised across scales, there is great potential for efï¬ciency. Although national priorities are generally to develop indicators for speciï¬c national needs (including national goals and targets), there is a lot to be said for exploring and enhancing harmonised indicator use as a means of (i) increasing the availability of data for tracking progress towards broader scale, regional and global goals and targets and (ii) unlocking the value of global data sets, such as those in products derived from satellite remote sensing, for wider national use (Han et al. 2014).

365,879,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"This paper investigated the implications of farm householdsâ past decision to adapt to climate change on current downside risk exposure. We used a moment-based approach that captures the third moment of a stochastic production function as a measure of downside yield uncertainty. Then, we estimated a simultaneous equations model with endogenous switching to account for unobservable factors that influence downside risk exposure and the decision to adapt. The first step of the analysis highlighted that the risk associated with the environmental characteristics of the farm such as soil fertility and access to information are key determinants of adaptation. These findings are consistent with Di Falco et al. (2011) on climate change adaption and food productivity, and Koundouri et al. (2006) on irrigation technology adoption under production uncertainty. Koundouri et al. (2006) emphasize that farm households that are better informed may value less the option to wait, and so are more likely to adopt new technologies than other farmers. This implies that waiting for gathering more and better information might have a positive value, and the provision of information on climate change might reduce the quasi-option value associated with adaptation. In addition, in this study we find that also education and past climatic factors significantly affect the adaptation decision. In particular, rainfall in both rainy seasons displays an U-shape behaviour, being literate or having experienced a flood in the past has a positive effect on the likelihood to adapt. Development policies that aim to increase education level can have positive spillovers in terms of adaptation and technology adoption in general."

365,717,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"1 Introduction In its most general definition, resilience is the ability of a system to react or cope with change. More specifically, the concept refers to the ability of a system to respond to shocks (temporary) or more persistent adverse trends (stressors) (Hoddinott 2014). In the context of food security, resilience means being able to achieve or maintain food security in spite of shocks or permanent stressors. This implies reducing the risk of becoming food insecure, increasing adaptive capacity to cope with risks and effectively respond to change over time.1 From the standpoint of CSA, of which food security is one key pillar, the importance of understanding resilience arises from the need to address the vulnerability of farm households to climate change, which is determined by a combination of adaptive capacity and exposure to shocks and slower changes (Adger et al. 2004; IPCC 2007a; OECD 2009; IPCC 2014). A conceptual framework for thinking about resilience is illustrated in Fig. 1. Adaptive capacity is affected by both the internal state of the farm household (education, age, farm area, assets owned, land productivity) and the external state experienced at the local level (technologies available, institutions, policies, infrastructure, markets). This is a dynamic system where the internal state changes over time depending on the outcomes of household decisions such as the crop mix, input use, production methods and off-farm activities. The outcomes are affected by climate (through yields) and markets (through prices) which are out of the control of the household. For example, a good season combined with strong markets helps build financial capital reducing vulnerability, whereas a string of poor seasons may result in loss of financial or human capital (by the selling of assets or migration of family members to the city), increasing vulnerability of the household. Both the internal and external states can change over time depending on policies, for example education and extension improve the internal state (human capital), whereas R&D and transport infrastructure improve the external state by providing new technologies and improving access to markets. Climate change affects the internal state indirectly by changing the yield probability distributions, for example due to increasing frequency of dry spells, floods and storms. It can also affect the external state, as in the case of severe storms destroying transport and communication infrastructure. Individual households make decisions based on the options available to them (Fig. 1), and their actions result in outcomes (i.e. profits) whose probability distribution is determined by both the internal and external state as well as by the changing climate. These influences are represented as dotted lines in Fig. 1. The dynamic aspect of the problem is represented by the solid arrow between outcomes and the"

In particular for PTH-WBV group, these values were highest in all groups after 4 weeks of healing. In the cortical bone, RG value was significantly influenced by the loading (P < 0.01). In the trabecular bone, on the other hand, RG value was significantly influenced by the drug (P < 0.01). The RG values of the PTH-treated groups were significantly higher than those of other drug-treated groups (P < 0.01). The results reveal that LMHF loading and PTH act locally and synergistically on bone healing process, thereby strengthening implant osseointegration. Interestingly, a previous study reported that the combination of ALN and LMHF loading did not lead to a synergistic reaction influencing the bone healing response [41]. Similar to the present study, no obvious positive effect was found in the ALN and ALN+WBV groups. This might be because ALN inhibits osteoclastic bone activity, which is required in the process of bone adaptation and therefore of implant osseointegration. The results also indicate that PTH combined with LMHF loading has a bone-stimulating effect superior to that of ALN and LMHF loading."
151,267,0.987,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"The JPCs for the concentrations modeled in Orestimba Creek, CA (Fig. 7) showed that fish and insects were at de minimis risk. The line for crustaceans was slightly above the reference line for low risk, indicating that some species of crustaceans are at low (but not de minimis) risk of adverse effects in this use scenario. The JPC for concentrations modeled in another focus-scenario, Cedar Creek, MI (Fig. 8) indicated de minimis risk for crustaceans, insects, and fish. The modeled concentrations in the other focus-scenario, Dry Creek, GA were smaller than those in Cedar Creek, MI (Table 8 in Williams et al. 2014), hence, these risks also were de minimis (JPC not shown). Overall, the probabilistic analyses of these data suggest that risks from direct effects of CPY on fish are de minimis in all areas of use. In most areas of use, as exemplified by the modeling of concentrations in Cedar Creek, MI and Dry Creek, GA, risks to insects and crustaceans will be de minimis as well. Low risk is also predicted for crustaceans in Orestimba Creek, CA, an intensive-use scenario that reasonably exemplifies the worst-case. There were insufficient toxicity data for CPY in sediment to conduct a probabilistic assessment of risk. However, comparison of the 10-d LC50 toxicity values for H. azteca and C. dilutus (Table 3) to the maximum modeled values of 22.2, 0.067, and 0.074 Î¼g kgâ1 resulted in RQs of 0.06, <0.001, and <0.001 for Orestimba Creek, Cedar Creek, and Dry Creek, respectively. The RQs for Cedar Creek and Dry Creek are well below the Level of Concern for all species. The RQ for Orestimba Creek is slightly greater than the Level of Concern (0.05; EPA 2004) for endangered and threatened (listed) invertebrates, but below the Level of Concern for other (nonlisted) species."
199,79,0.987,Synchronized Factories : Latin America and the Caribbean in the Era of Global Value Chains,"Indeed, this test addresses the potential causality issue mentioned earlier. In particular, the test implies examining a cross-country, cross-sector interaction effect, the so-called difference-indifferences estimation. The estimation seeks to alleviate the potential endogeneity problem associated with cross-country regressions. The difference-in-differences estimator would suffer from reverse causality if the FDI flow of a given sector compared to those of other sectors had a causal effect on the overall level of logistics infrastructure. This seems much less likely to be the case than in the more common cross-country regressions, in which total FDI flows could have a causal effect on the overall level of logistics infrastructure investment. In particular, Appendix B âSpecification for the Model of Vertical FDI and Logistics Infrastructureâ shows that the main finding holds under least squares and negative binomial estimations, as well as after the inclusion of parent, subsidiary, and sector-fixed effects, and under the more stringent parent-subsidiary, sector-fixed effects. In a longer version of this analysis we also show that the results are sufficiently robust to explicitly include additional covariates in the model; see Blyde and Molina (2013)."

However, the water boards differ in terms of the practicality and costs of transferring water from other regions. For instance, WGS, the regional water authority of Salland, has abundant water that could be transferred to its region, whereas it is more difï¬cult for Vechtstromen to bring water from other regions. The positions regarding the responsibility of water authorities in providing water to farmers differs between the water boards that have sloping areas and those have mostly flat areas. The displacement chain is also implemented at the national level to balance the water supply and demand in cases of extreme water shortages by transferring water from abundant areas and sectors to scarce areas and sectors. The decisions are taken by a national committee that involves representatives from all provinces and the functioning of the whole system is controlled by the Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch national water authority. In the Vilaine catchment, there is little evidence on the interaction of national and subnational levels regarding agricultural measures on drought resilience. However, the implementation of CAP influences the agricultural production and water consumptions at the farm level. As explained in Sect. 10.3, measures that result from the CAP are fragmented from the other water- and agriculture-related measures, since there is no regional agricultural water planning and management. Regional water management plans however address drought and water scarcity through enforcing limitations and bans on irrigation, especially during the summer and in the sensitive areas. The different actors and levels in the Somerset region build up a strong relationship and culture of cooperation. But the vulnerability of such relationships can be seen after the flood events in 2013/2014. Discussions about the nature of the floods and possible solutions eroded the conï¬dence between the different stakeholders and actors pulled out of the circle. On the community level, especially relevant for the implementation of agri-environmental measures, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group was seen. They are seen as an in-between agent between environmental groups and farmers. But they are dependent on project funding and therefore exists the risk of reduced activities in case of a reduction of funding. Positive interlinkages between farmers and Internal Drainage Boards (IDB) exist. IDBs are risk management authorities responsible for maintaining rivers, drainage channels, pumping stations, etc. IDB was noticed as a group that is very responsive to farmersâ needs. A good relationship was also built up between the local National Farmers Union (NFU) and the farming community. Room for improvement is seen for the relationship between farmers and statutory bodies. Their relationship is not characterized by an open discussion culture but rather by punishment. A diversity of governance levels and their interactions is observed in the North-west Europe region. In Flanders and Somerset, subnational stakeholders such as farmer organizations and regional water authorities closely collaborate. In other cases, the relevant EU policies explicitly drive cross-level interactions, while there is little evidence that these directly influence the adaptation of the agricultural sector to drought and water scarcity conditions. In the Eifel-Rur, Salland and Twente cases, the WFD requirements create multilevel interactions, such as the"
10,394,0.987,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"12.6.2 Cognitions Cognitions refers to the observations of reality, the frames of reference, and the interpretations of the actors at hand. While motivations among actors tend to differ widely, all actors across case studies tend to share similar cognitions based on observed changes in the regional water balance. There are general observations among nature conservation actors that precipitation regimes are changing in unexpected ways and that these regime changes influence both flora and fauna habitats. In recent years, a large number of creeks have gone dry, leaving behind almost non-existent vegetation. Damages from droughts are increasingly affecting agricultural yields in rural areas, while cities and their urban infrastructure are also more and more at risk as a result of lower reservoirs. The visibility of drought has increased in recent years, both in the farming and urban contexts as well, which in turn has contributed to widespread cognitive shifts among all nature conservation-related actors. More and more, stakeholders coherently and consistently agree that water scarcity and drought is, and will increasingly become, a problem. In response, strategies to combat drought impacts have already been developed into guidelines that keep water longer in the ground and in surface waters, employ water use efï¬ciency schemes, and develop medium- and long-term possibilities for extra water transport. These strategies further contribute towards a more uniï¬ed cognitions in nature arenas. As a result, it is expected that coherence among stakeholders will increase moving forward, with more experience with drought and water scarcity likely to develop into the future. Nature-related regulations, including the WFD and the Habitats and Birds Directives, in addition to creating driving pressures, also contribute to shifting cognitions among relevant actors as drought protection measures become more ubiquitous. More broadly, there is general cognition and awareness regarding the need for collaboration across a wide range of actors, including both public and private, at all levels. Because water scarcity and drought can impact both land, marine and freshwater ecosystems, connectivity is key to addressing the crises. Such a cognitive approach is particularly important in moving away from strictly legal incentives as the main motivators. In an effort to place less reliance on legal incentives, improving communication between actors and providing the tools and space for negotiating the relationship is the key. This approach allows for competing motivations to ï¬nd more harmonious solutions before resorting to a priori legal recommendations."
219,666,0.987,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Drivers of Land Degradation in Ethiopia Poor land-use practices and population pressure are the major drivers of land degradation in Ethiopia (Genanew and Alemu 2012; Berry 2003). High population pressure, especially in the highland, has led to a decline in arable area, which in turn led to agricultural encroachment onto marginal areas. Several other factors contribute to the unsustainable land management in Ethiopia. The patterns of land ownership and government control, low levels of investment in agriculture and animal husbandry, poor rural infrastructure and markets and low levels of technology are cited as the underlying causes of land degradation by Berry (2003). Policy failures and lack of capacity to implement government interventions also contribute to land and other resource degradation (The Global Mechanism 2007; Wagayehu 2003). The less-than-desired and largely unsustainable impact of series of conservation measures usually involving physical structures such as terraces, bunds and tree planting, among others, is explained by lack of policy action or framework that is essential to address (or minimize the effect of) the externalities of beneï¬ts or costs associated with participation or lack of participation in such programs (by farmers). This problem is attributed to the relative negligence of policy and institutional factors in the numerous conservation programs ï¬nanced through food/cash aid projects (Berry 2003; Eyasu 2003). This problem is compounded by little evidence-based and action-oriented research (Shiferaw and Holden 1999; von Braun et al. 2013). Another key driver of the problem is a lack of capacity and/or commitment to address the problem appropriately. Inconsistent, partial or insufï¬cient interventions reinforce the problem while eroding the capacity of farmers/the real victims/and local authorities to deal with the problem fundamentally. Most interventions focus on addressing the symptoms of the problem (i.e. reducing the human cost of the problem, distress sales of assets) at the expense of long-term and long-lasting solutions. In other words, by focusing on short-term solutions, such interventions encourage inaction or the postponement of real-actions (i.e. actions by beneï¬ciaries and authorities to address the root cause of the problem). A review to document various proximate and underlying drivers of land degradation in Eastern Africa, including Ethiopia, has been carried out by Kirui and"
315,135,0.987,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"(marital status, children, and education). Model A3 adds variables related to culture (religion, country of residence). Part B of the multivariate analyses estimates the effects of a third-person presence on attitudes towards sensitive topics (Table 4.1). We used several dependent variables and display three steps for each analysis. First, we show the brut effect of the migrant status of women and men. Second, we control for the socio-demographic control variables. Third, the variable of the third person was added to the modelling process. The socio-demographic composition of the two groups showed significant differences consistent with the literature. We found that second-generation Turks were more likely to be married and had more children on average than the comparison group, despite having a younger age structure. These control variables were related to the opportunity structure and were significantly associated with the presence of a third party. On average, the Turkish descendants had less education and were more likely to report having had a religious upbringing (most in a Muslim faith) than natives (who were mostly Christians). (We did not include co-residence with the parents or employment status since these variables correlated with enrolment in education, marital status, and having children). In order to test whether the presence of a third person makes a difference in the respondentsâ answers, we used attitudes towards sensitive topics since we believe that a bias will be greater the more sensitive the topic is. We used four attitudinal variables that are important during early adulthood and that can be regarded as sensitive both among migrants and non-migrants: two questions were related to the acceptability of pre-marital sex (for women and for men) and two were related to the acceptability of abortion (for medical and non-medical reasons). The possible answers for each question were: always acceptable, acceptable in specific cases, and not acceptable (note: these questions were not included in the TIES questionnaire in Belgium). We built four dichotomous variables that distinguish between âalways acceptableâ and âacceptable in specific cases or not acceptableâ (due to very small numbers of natives who did not accept abortion or pre-marital sex at all). Table 4.1 shows that levels of acceptance of both pre-marital sex and abortions were significantly lower among the Turkish descendants than among the comparison group. The percentage of non-responses was about twice as high among the secondgeneration residents as it was among the natives."

A âsystemâ, from a systems thinking perspective, is made up of entities that are linked through flows and interactions, with inputs and outputs. For EWS as a âsystem of systemsâ this includes for example monitoring, forecasting, warning generation, communication, emergency response and feed-back systems as well as their legal and institutional basis, and the people involved. EWS need to focus on vulnerabilities as part of the day-to-day lives of the people they serve who display different forms and degrees of vulnerabilities and capacities. Kelman and Glantz (2014) argue that EWS are a social process that involves technical components embedded in their social context, which contrasts with technical views that an EWS comprises only the technical equipment detecting or forecasting a hazard event and sending its parameters to a decision-making authority. This process is on-going and rooted in day-to-day and decade-to-decade functioning of society and is not only triggered when a hazard is about to strike. It is used to educate people, train them about response (e.g. through drills), gather baseline data and map risks. In fact it can be observed that there is a narrower understanding of EWS (i.e. detection, monitoring, modelling, and forecasting of the hazards as well as warning preparation and dissemination, based on risk knowledge and legal/institutional arrangements), and a wider understanding of EWS (i.e. corresponding to the 4 components) as adopted by EWC III in 2006. Both are widely in use. The problem with this wider understanding of EWS is that an EWS then becomes almost indistinguishable from DRM. EWS also apply to long-term, âcreepingâ changes that can change baselines and indicate trends â often only recognised once a speciï¬c threshold is crossed and often not being hazards per se but influencing other hazards and slow-onset hazards in addition to the quick-onset ones. For example, while climate change may not be a hazard itself, the process could still be warned of, partly to address the causes and partly to deal with the consequences. In this regard the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) can be understood as an EWS for climate change by assessing and synthesising climate change science and presenting actions that are needed. In theory, the earlier a warning is available, the more time there is to prepare for and hopefully respond effectively to the potential impacts of stressors, threats and hazards. An EWS for slower and gradual changes should therefore give more time to design prevention and adaptation to new hazard regimes, plan a response and integrate that response into day-to-day life and longer-term development. No single agency can be responsible for all EWS-related activities. While there may be an ofï¬cially designated EWS"
102,394,0.987,Saving For Development : How Latin America and The Caribbean Can Save More and Better,"Frisancho (2016) summarizes recent experimental evidence on interventions that tackle a variety of saving constraints discussed in this subsection, including transaction costs, lack of trust and regulation, information and knowledge gaps, social pressure and behavioral biases. See Chapters 3 and 11 for an overview of the main factors that drive up bank costs in Latin America and the Caribbean. See Chapter 11 for other issues related to regulation barriers. Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of the annual consumption of people under 24 in Latin America and the Caribbean is financed by other members of the household, according to National Transfer Account (NTA)âs data. The elderly, on the other hand, give up 12% of their annual consumption in the form of private transfers (see http:// www.ntaccounts.org/doc/repository/NTA%20Data%20Sheet.pdf). These conclusions are drawn from an experiment in Kenya by Jakiela and Ozier (2016). Preliminary results from a similar experiment in Senegal confirm these patterns (Boltz, Marazyan, and villar, 2015). Data from the World Bankâs World Development Indicators. See Ortigueira and Siassi (2013) for more details on an intra-household insurance model. A word of caution is in order. Janssens, Kramer, and Swart (2015) discuss in detail the problems that arise when measuring hyperbolic discounting through hypothetical choices in a one-time cross section. They argue that agentsâ level of patience may change because their preferences are unstable over time rather than because of present-bias. To measure time inconsistency accurately, the authors recommend relying on a longitudinal design that allows stationarity, time consistency, and time invariance to be disentangled. To the extent that agents incorporate the probability of changing environments in their answers to one-time experiments, future efforts to measure time inconsistency should rely on longitudinal data when possible. For a model that shows why hyperbolic discounters cannot reach their predetermined choice of savings and how (costly) commitment devices are useful for them, see John (2014). versions of this model exist throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.

365,844,0.987,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"The survey was carried out in the Nile River Basin in Ethiopia in 2005.4 The household sampling frame was developed to ensure representation for the Nile River Basin at the woreda (an administrative division equivalent to a district) level regarding level of rainfall patterns in terms of both annual total and variation. The data used for the sample frame are from the Atlas of the Ethiopian Rural Economy (IFPRI 2010). The survey considered traditional typology of agro-ecological zones in the country (namely, Dega, Woina Dega, Kolla, and Berha), percent of cultivated land, degree of irrigation activity, average annual rainfall, rainfall variability, and vulnerability (number of food aid dependent population). The sampling frame selected the woredas in such a way that each stratum in the sample matched to the proportions for each stratum in the entire Nile basin. The procedure resulted in the inclusion of twenty woredas. Random sampling was then used in selecting fifty households from each woreda. The final dataset contains comprehensive observations from almost 1000 farms. Information on agricultural practices and production, costs, investments, and revenues as well as tenure security, past shocks, and access to credit were collected.5 One of the survey instruments was in particular designed to capture farmersâ perceptions and understanding on climate change, and their approaches for adaptation. Questions were included to investigate whether farmers have noticed changes in mean temperature and rainfall over the last two decades, and reasons for observed changes. Overall, increased temperature and declining rainfall are the predominant perceptions in our study sites. These perceptions do match with the existing evidence reported in the previous section. Furthermore, some questions investigated whether farm households made some adjustments in their farming practices in response to long-term changes in mean temperature and rainfall by adopting some particular strategies. Changing crop varieties and adoption of soil and water conservation strategies were major forms of adaptation strategies followed by the farm households in our study sites. These adaptation strategies are mainly yield-related and account for more than 95 per cent of the adaptation strategies followed by the farm households who actually undertook an adaptation strategy. The remaining adaptation strategies accounting for less"

A settlement of particles during dry weather periods and their re-suspension when the flow increases was described on the literature [22]. A similar behavior could be expected for the fibers. The level of fibers also depends on the previous rain events: the first sampling was conducted after a long period of heavy rainfall, which might have induced a decrease in the amount of fibers in the sewer system. Levels of fragments vary between 35 and 3,100 fragments L 1. The levels are especially high even if they vary by two orders of magnitude. Lower concentrations of fragments in comparison to fibers can be observed except for the event presenting the highest runoff contribution and volume."

347,305,0.987,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The short- and long-term ecosystem effects of oil discharges depend on a variety of factors including the season and weather, type and quantity of oil spilled, habitat, type of shoreline as well as the tidal energy and type of waves in the area of the spill (e.g. Rousi and KankaanpÃ¤Ã¤ 2012). Consequently, there is a substantial degree of scientific uncertainty linked to the assessment of ecosystem risks of oil discharges. However, this type of scientific uncertainty on ecosystem impacts is not of substantial importance for assessment-management interactions in this case (Hassler et al. 2010). That oil discharges are dangerous for the marine environment and should be avoided as much as possible within reasonable economic limits is not contested.7 The main issues of assessment-management interactions relating to oil spills rather concern (1) what the actual probabilities and prevalence of oil discharges are (i.e. mainly monitoring and surveillance activities) and (2) how the probability, extent and prevalence of oil spills can be reduced through improved technological safety, reductions in human errors and improved management measures to reduce intentional oil discharges. Consequently, compared with risks such as chemical pollution, the risks of oil discharge and uncertainty-related challenges concerning them are not as severe in the context of the Baltic Sea, barring a few exceptions. First, there is still a lack of aerial and satellite data of intentional oil discharges for monitoring and surveillance purposes in spite of a well-developed system for monitoring of larger vessels through the HELCOM AIS system (Hassler et al. 2010). This uncertainty linked to surveillance and monitoring impedes a comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of oil discharges (especially intentional discharges), as well as complicates attempts to enforce and monitor the efficiency of management strategies (such as the above-mentioned HELCOM no-special-fee system) (Hassler et al. 2010; Hassler 2011). Second, regarding safety improvements, there is scientific uncertainty linked to issues concerning the feasibility and cost-efficiency of various technical solutions. It can also be argued that the PSSA (particularly sensitive sea area) classification of the Baltic Sea by the IMO shows that there is an agreement (and substantial scientific knowledge) that the Baltic Sea is particularly sensitive to, e.g., oil discharges."
382,168,0.987,"A History of Male Psychological Disorders in Britain, 1945â1980","The environmental stresses of migration were nonetheless also considered to be important. The way in which an individual had prepared for the change and his or her general state of health prior to migrating were seen as important factors in the development of mental illness.92 The attitudes of those in the new community and the availability or otherwise of social support networks were also viewed as paramount. In Britain, immigrants from the New Commonwealth and Pakistan tended to settle in inner-city areas such as Tower Hamlets, Lambeth and Islington in London where the housing shortage was already acute. With the exception of those employed in the medical profession, the jobs taken by immigrants were often characterised by insecurity and low wages, and many lived in overcrowded housing with poor amenities.93 Recent scholarship, drawn from the Community Relations Commission in 1977 and the national census of 1971, has confirmed that many immigrants experienced significant disadvantage in housing, unemployment and family life.94 In addition to these factors, reports from the 1970s indicate that immigrants endured a range of discriminatory practices in recruitment for jobs and by private landlords.95 Most commentators were unable to conclude whether constitutional or environmental factors were responsible for the high rates of mental illness among immigrants and increasingly accepted that there might be a multiplicity of explanations. Existing studies were drawn from hospital in-patient data and dealt only with serious psychotic illness. Very little was known about the less severe affective disorders that remained undiagnosed in the community; however, as we shall see, oral history testimonies from GPs who worked in inner-city communities illuminate some of the problems faced by immigrant communities. Occupational health surveys also indicated distinct patterns of sickness and absenteeism between groups. Early international studies suggested that immigrant workers were absent from work more frequently than indigenous employees, but very little research existed on the subject in Britain.96 The first significant study at home focused on a large manufacturing company in south-east England. The authors began by explicitly stating that research on mental health and race had hitherto been inhibited by political and cultural sensitivities.97 The survey found that Asian employees had considerably more sickness absence in all categories. They had more individual spells of sickness and fewer employees in the âno certified absenceâ group. On average, Asian workers had twice as many days off work as Caucasians. However, most absences were of short duration, unlike Caucasians and West Indians who were more likely to take longer spells off work.98 The authors drew a range"

Fundamental to assessing and predicting LRT of CPY and CPYO are reliable values for physical-chemical properties and rates of reaction by different processes that determine partitioning and persistence in the environment. Data from the literature were compiled and critically assessed to obtain consistent values of these physical-chemical properties (Tables 5, 6, and 7)."
180,381,0.987,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) involves the death of apparently healthy sleeping infants, usually within the first year of life. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, that is, it denotes an unknown cause of death (Willinger et al. 1991; American Academy of Pediatrics 2011). It is also known as cot or crib death and is classified as a form of Sudden Death in Infancy (SUDI). Unlike many public health issues, SIDS unites clinical and forensic considerations, as this finding of cause of death can determine attribution of criminal (and moral) responsibility. Police collect evidence and coroners assess the circumstances of the death and release judgments. This is the method by which a SIDS death is determined. Context heightens the ethical significance of SIDS diagnosis, research, and prevention. In 1991, when the New Zealand Cot Death Study (NZCDS) commenced, New Zealandâs rate of SIDS was high by international standards at 4 deaths per 1,000 live births (Mitchell et al. 1997) compared, for example, to the Netherlands (1.3/1,000 in 1989) (de Jonge et al. 1989) and Hong Kong (0.3/1,000 in 1986â1987) (Lee et al. 1989). Within New Zealand, SIDS deaths occurred in the indigenous MÄori population at twice the rate of the non-MÄori population (Mitchell et al. 1994). The reason for this significant disparity was not well understood. The NZCDS was the first national case-control study designed to identify risk factors for SIDS. By comparing infants whose deaths were attributed to SIDS with a representative sample of live births, within a year, the NZCDS had identified a number of risk factors. The study confirmed an association between increased risk of SIDS and lower socioeconomic status, along with a range of associated maternal factors, including fewer years of education, younger age at first pregnancy, greater number of previous pregnancies, and lower attendance at prenatal classes (Mitchell et al. 1991). The NZCDS selected three risk factors to address among this range of findings: lack of breast-feeding, maternal smoking, and placing infants to sleep in a prone position (Mitchell et al. 1991). The ensuing national prevention campaign focused on publicizing these risks, which parents were seen as able to influence. These were categorized as âmodifiable risk factors.â Many parents changed their practices in response to the campaign (Cowan 2010). Abandonment of the prone sleeping position was the most readily and widely adopted measure and is credited with delivering the largest proportion of the national reduction in SIDS rates (Mitchell et al. 1997). Factors that were less susceptible to parental alteration were classified as ânonmodifiable risk factors.â Nonmodifiable factors included the babyâs sex, the motherâs age, and the familyâs socioeconomic status. Analysis of the second yearâs data revealed another risk factor: bed-sharing (Mitchell et al. 1992). Bed-sharing was categorized as a modifiable risk factor, and parents were advised to avoid sleeping on the same surface as their baby or allowing"

277,110,0.987,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"3.4 Conclusions The collection of migration statistics has always been an important component of official statistics and population research, which is also reflected in the close involvement of academics and public administrators in the process of data collection and analysis. In particular, the efforts of the European Union have led to considerable expansion of available data in the area of migration, notably through the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 which made it compulsory for EU member states to provide Eurostat with comprehensive data on migration issues. The increased availability of international data in the area of migration has led to an enormous expansion of opportunities for research, and the full potential of Eurostatâs newly collected data is still to be exhausted. However, on the conceptual level, several questions remain. In particular, the institutionalisation of certain demographic indicators, notably country of birth, begs the question as to how useful these concepts are and whether they need to be complemented by additional indicators which help to identify âmigrantsâ in a more nuanced and differentiated way. The production and use of social statistics differentiated by âmigration backgroundâ, be it on the basis of demographic, sociological or ethnic criteria, not only makes these groups visible, but also manifests their very existence and creates a reinforced perception of group differences. As pointed out by Nancy Fraser (2000) we have to be careful when recognising differences within our societies due to the potential effect of reinforcing group identities. Data producers and users, both from policy as well as academia, need to be flexible when dealing with statistics. Yet, this same flexibility, even though it may sometimes be required to cope with the limitations of available data, may also challenge the relevance of the outcomes, particularly in comparative research. This is the case in research on migration, but it is even more so in research on immigrant integration and the effectiveness"
18,32,0.987,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"Although an accurate estimation of the radiation dose was essential for predicting the health risks to residents and for adopting suitable and effective measures against the radiation risks, it was not easy to achieve an accurate dose assessment for residents because of the complexity of the exposure routes. Soon after the accident, environmental monitoring of air dose rates and measurements of the concentrations of radioactive nuclides in various environmental materials, including soil, tap water, and food, were widely implemented by the Japanese and local governments, institutes, universities, small groups, and individuals. Some of the results of such monitoring were reported by news media as well as on Internet websites, used for dose estimation for residents, and published in scientific papers. In contrast with this environmental monitoring and these surveys, direct monitoring or measurement of individual radiation doses was not widely carried out in the early stages after the accident. Compared with environmental monitoring, there have not been many attempts to estimate actual radiation doses in the residents, except for large-scale surveys by governmental organizations. The personal radiation dose is the most important parameter for planning and implementing suitable protective measures. Nevertheless, the attention of the public, governments, and even scientists has mainly been focused on environmental radiation dose and radioactivity, and not particularly on actual radiation dose in individuals, especially in the early stages after the accident. A detailed and easily understandable explanation of the concept of radiation dose assessment is provided in the excellent commentary article by Dr. Inaba in this book (see Chap. 4). In this chapter, we outline the activities performed in an attempt to monitor, measure, or estimate the personal radiation doses of the residents, based mainly on the information presented at the International Symposium on Environmental Monitoring and Dose Estimation of Residents after the Accident of TEPCOâs Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Stations, organized by Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute on December 2012 (hereafter referred to as âThe Symposiumâ)."
219,281,0.987,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"The global cost of land degradation for the three crops is about US$56.60 billion per year (Table 6.20), of which, East and South Asia accounted for the largest share of loss. However when the loss is expressed as percent of GDP, South Asia experiences the most severe cost of land degradation on cropland. The cost of land degradation shown is generally low than what has been reported in other studies largely due to DSSATâs assumption of much higher BAU fertilizer application rates. This reduces the actual cost of land degradation. Additionally, DSSAT assumes no salinity or soil erosion. This further demonstrates the underestimation of land degradation on static cropland. The total cost due to the loss of carbon sequestration accounts for 67 % of the total cost at global levelâsuggesting the cost of land degradation on static cropland is borne more heavily the global community than the farmers. The results also underscore the great potential of ISFM in carbon sequestration. The three crops account for about 42 % of the cropland in the world. If all cropland is assumed to experience the same level of degradation, the total cost of land degradation on cropland is about 0.25 % of the global GDP. As discussed in the introduction section, our estimates are conservative since we do not take into account other costs of land degradation. For example we do not include off-site cost of pesticide use, which are quite high. Pimental et al. (1995) estimated that the environmental and social costs were about US$8 billion per year, of which $5 billion are external social costs. The social costs considered were human health and the environmental effects were, pest resistance, loss of natural enemies, groundwater contamination, and loss of pollinating insects and other agents (Ibid). We also do not consider the point and nonpoint pollution of inorganic fertilizer that leads to eutrophication and other forms of surface and underground water"
255,54,0.987,Railway Ecology,"Hels and Buchwald 2001; Carvalho and Mira 2011), records for railways are much rarer (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998). Unfortunately, there are no studies that compare detectability and persistence rates of carcasses between road and railway surveys, so the difference in numbers remains an open question. Considering only the studies that aimed to survey train casualties of all species, the frequency of amphibians can reach up to 47% of all vertebrate records (Heske 2015), while the records of reptiles represent ca. 4% (Spain) and 6% (USA) of carcasses (Heske 2015; SCV 1996). In Netherlands, for example, no carcasses of amphibians or reptiles were ever found (van der Grift and Kuijsters 1998), while in Spain, only reptiles were recorded (SCV 1996). In Chicago state, USA, amphibians were the most abundant taxonomic group recorded in train collisions (Heske 2015), mainly northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and American toads (Bufo americanus), common species in the region. Mortalities of amphibians were particularly high after rain events, when these species are most active and are also frequently found dead on the roads (Heske 2015). Budzic and Budzic (2014) conducted a survey speciï¬cally aimed to estimate amphibian mortality on 34 km of Polish railways. They found that three species were most affected by train accidents: the common toad (Bufo bufo), the common frog (Rana temporaria) and the green frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus), and most of dead individuals (77%) were adult common toads. Although mortality rates can be high, all three species are considered common in Europe. In fact, two of the species affected by railway mortality (common toad and common frog), are among the most common European amphibians, for which there is also evidence of high road-mortality (Hels and Buchwald 2001; Matos et al. 2012; OrÅowski 2007). As in roads, the spring migration (or autumn migration, in some regions) seems to be the period of highest amphibian mortality on railway tracks, as 87% of all accidents occurred in that season (Budzic and Budzic 2014). Yet, railway mortality of amphibians seems to depend on animalsâ physical features (such as body size and limb length) and should be associated with the agility of the species (Budzic and Budzic 2014). While in the case of roads, the velocity of individuals is used as a proxy for agility (Hels and Buchwald 2001), in the case of railway tracks, agility relates mainly to the ability to overcome obstacles (Budzic and Budzic 2014; SCV 1996). Due to its physical features, the common toad was more likely to become trapped between rails, indicating that this species (and others with similar physical features) may be more vulnerable to railway mortality (Budzic and Budzic 2014). Some species of small size may be less vulnerable because they cannot cross the rail track (Heske 2015). However, they may be affected by railways at the level of gene flow due to barrier effects (Holderegger and Di Giulio 2010), which may be also a conservation problem. Concerning reptile mortality, 13 snakes (4%) were recorded across the whole Spanish railway network between 1990 and 1995. Only two species were identiï¬ed: the ladder snake (Elaphe scalaris) and the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), both common reptiles in the country (SCV 1996). The railway bed may be lethal itself for smaller animals that can become trapped between the rails, where they may be susceptible to predation or physiological"

Aquatic organisms for which ingestion of microplastics has been documented in the field include those from across the marine food web, including turtles, seabirds, fish, crustaceans and worms (reviewed by Wright et al. 2013). Laboratory studies have confirmed that many other organisms have the capacity to ingest microplastics including zooplankton (Cole et al. 2013; SetÃ¤lÃ¤ et al. 2012).

While the potential of these approaches for targeting the poor that are close to poverty lines is increasingly being recognized, the question remains: to what extent can business also help the extremely poor? In his influential book, The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid, Prahalad (2010, 8) acknowledges that â[t]here is a segment of the 4 billion who are so destitute, so deprived, and so consumed by war and disease that they need other forms of help,â such as government subsidies, multilateral aid, or philanthropy. How far can business approaches push the margin to also include those who are extremely poor? How can those who are currently excluded from development opportunities be brought into and benefit from marketbased systems to improve the quality of their lives? These are the questions that we examined in this chapter.1 What characterizes the extremely poor from the perspective of business? In some respects their situation is similar to that of the general poor, albeit more severe. As consumers their purchasing power is extremely low and they often struggle to follow regular payment schedules due to income fluctuations. While many may already operate in commercial markets, for instance by selling their time or engaging in small-scale trading, returns tend to be low due to limited skills and assets. These constraints, along with the lack of access to credit and additional barriers that may result from discrimination or spatial remoteness, also restrict their ability to expand their business activities. In other respects extreme poverty has particular characteristics, as highlighted by the extensive work undertaken by BRAC in Bangladesh to engage the ultra-poor. BRAC notes that the extremely poor are often subject to overlapping sets of constraints and deprivations that make them âstructurally different from other categories of the poor; they are not only poorer than others, but differently soâ (Matin et al. 2008, 5). Their main priority is survival, with little time or extra resources to invest in long-term strategies. As a result they get caught in â[a] below-subsistence trap from which it is difficult for them to break free using available resources and mechanismsâ (Matin et al. 2008, 2). The extremely poor are often marginalized, which also prevents them from realizing their potential (for an overview on marginality and extreme poverty issues see Gatzweiler et al. 2011). We define marginality according to Gatzweiler et al. (2011, 3) as: an involuntary position and condition of an individual or group at the margins of social, political, economic, ecological and biophysical systems, preventing them from access to resources, assets, services, restraining freedom of choice, preventing the development of capabilities, and eventually causing extreme poverty."

If birds cannot alter their timing sufï¬ciently or climate change makes historically adaptive cues maladaptive, then populations may suffer (Visser 2008). Focusing on coastal birds, there appears to be no general pattern in how timing of egg laying has responded, with for example northern lapwings Vanellus vanellus showing no response over the past decades, while egg laying in Eurasian oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus advanced in response to increased rainfall, and in ringed plovers Charadrius hiaticula advanced in response to rising temperatures (Crick and Sparks 1999). Studies have also identiï¬ed various cases where interannual variability in demographic rates was associated with climatic variability. The most common pattern is that annual juvenile and/or adult survival is strongly positively related to winter temperatures in many coastal birds (e.g. Peach et al. 1994; Yalden and Pearce-Higgins 1997; Atkinson et al. 2000). By contrast, a review has suggested that populations"
182,194,0.986,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"of animal protein consumption by humans.66 Throughout the developing world, cows were failing to perform their human-designated roles as food producers. India held 250,000 million or a quarter of all cattle and water buffaloes in the world, but the average annual yield per milk animal was only 200 kg compared with 4000 kg in the Netherlands.67 Whereas the average annual yield of an American beef cow was 75.6 kg, in Asia the figure was less than 12 kg. These unproductive bovine bodies caused particular alarm owing to unprecedented (and unexpected) population growth in the far East, Africa and Latin America. Population experts predicted an impending collapse as human numbers outstripped food supplies. The fAOâs first World Food Survey in 1946 estimated that two-thirds of the worldâs human population were hungry. Their findings added the threat of starvation to the persistent problem of malnutrition.68 As the Cold War set in and decolonization began, fears grew that hungry people would join disaffected rebel groups or turn to communism.69 In this context, cows were not only crucial sources of food but also political actors capable of influencing global security. As the fAOâs first director, Orr responded by attempting to implement earlier ideas of a marriage of food and agriculture.70 He sought to create a World food Board, which would centrally organize world food production according to actual needs rather than the market, with the ultimate aim of ensuring food as a basic human right. This radical vision never materialized, largely because of resistance from major agricultural powers. Instead it developed into a system for donating, disposing of or trading agricultural surpluses from the developed to the underdeveloped world through mechanisms such as the fAOâs World food Programme, the USA food for Peace Programme, and the United Nations Childrenâs fund (UNICEfâs) child healthâmilk initiatives.71 On taking control in"
10,304,0.986,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"process and thereafter drought resilience was ï¬rmly positioned on the agenda. Until then âwater shortageâ was to a large extent seen in relation to the huge need for freshwater in the polder areas in the west of the Netherlands, which regularly need to be flushed to prevent intrusion of salinity. The manifesto a/o. stated that 45 % of Dutch agricultural value is in fact produced on the higher grounds. In response to an invited advice from the national Advisory Committee on Water on freshwater supply, by 2013 the responsible Minister of Infrastructure and Environment emphasized that the system that supplies and distributes the water from source to user extends from the estuaries of big rivers all the way back to the capillaries of the regional water system. The steering of the fresh water supply should take place at all levels and scales: from the cross-boundary international river catchments up and to the local scale of individual users of stakeholder organizations. The main question is not at which level steering needs to take place, but which responsibilities are at which level and whether between those levels there is good collaboration. In the Netherlands the implementation of drought policy is thus seen as a matter of needed cooperation between various organizations, both public and private, at various levels. This is in fact not just the case with drought policies but with other water policies as well. Perhaps it is typically Dutch to interpret the necessary coherence as a matter of cooperation rather than coordination by a powerful central actor (compare OECD 2014). However, the complexity and dynamics of the water system itself make a governance context that facilitates good cooperation by all stakeholders with their various interests very valuable. Also there is a need for productive boundary spanning between an inspiring long-term vision and short-term opportunities to realize parts of it. While the Netherlands has been recalibrating its water policies in an enormous multi-stakeholder exercise called the Dutch Delta Programme, âfresh water supplyâ has become one of the main issues (sub-programmes). Droughts and water scarcity issues are not the same problem but they are actually highly related, while the water scarcity issues typically become most urgent in periods of drought. In the partial Delta programming on âFresh water supplyâ, the present and future policies are developed and implementation guided. In the Delta Decision 2015 some attention is given to the problematic of the âHigh Sandy Groundsâ, the areas in the east and south of the Netherlands that are often not able to receive water from the main water system, and thus depend on rainfall and rain fed small rivers and creeks for fresh water supply. Drinking water companies, food industries, other industries and farmers use often deep and shallow groundwater for their production processes. It is recognized that these areas (including Twente) suffer from droughts for dozens of years and that climate change can worsen these problems further, causing dry creeks and damages to human uses and nature. The preferred strategy to combat these developments consists of the following guidelines: 1. Keep the water longer in both the ground and the surface waters. No efforts will be made to enable major water transport to these areas. In the short run, the"

365,206,0.986,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"We begin with an approach of estimating the effects of climate on rice yields using a panel regression with a single growing season metric for each weather covariate (average min T, max T, and precipitation across the growing season). Using average seasonal conditions, we estimate a linear model for each rice production system. These are later used to predict yields under various climate scenarios. Here, we present a variation of the panel fixed effects (FE) model. This model is an accepted and commonly applied model in the literature (see e.g. Lobell and Burke 2010). Panel data contains repeated observations of the same units over time. In this case we repeatedly observe district rice outcomes. Panel data allows the use of fixed effects, which control for a variety of observations that are unobserved. By conditioning on fixed effects, county specific deviations in weather from the county averages are used to identify the effect of weather on yields. Specifically we chose to control for district and year fixed effects. District fixed effects control for any unobservable characteristic that varies across district but is constant over time. This accounts for important differences across districts such as soil conditions or areas with a higher prevalence of intensive production systems. Year fixed effects control for any unobservable characteristic that varies across years but is constant across all districts. This includes national time trends such as improved technology (irrigation, fertilizer use, or the introduction of improved seed varieties for example). Within this framework there are a number of choices/assumptions to be made. In each case, there is a tradeoff between controlling for unobserved factors and observing enough variation in the data to be able to make econometric estimations. In reality, we know that there are many factors that affect crop yields, including soil quality, technology, agrochemicals, endogenous behavior, etc. Here, we are only considering the impact of weather, while the other factors are unobserved by us. Thus we are trying to estimate the disaggregated yield impact of weather holding constant other explanatory variables. If district-level time-series data were available on other factors such as agricultural investment, fertilizer use, or pesticides, then we could include these explanatory variables in our model. However, to our knowledge these data do not exist at the required resolution. Fortunately, the fixed effects model attempts to control for these unobserved factors, so that we can still produce unbiased estimates of climate effects. In other words, we can control for a variety of unobserved characteristics but cannot estimate them in our model. We are not attempting to explain every factor that affects yields, but merely to identify the effect of temperature and rainfall. Given our interest is ultimately how yields will change in the face of new climate conditions this does not affect our analysis. The following reduced form model is our primary empirical specification. In our ideal specification we would have a vector of controls for the other factors that affect yields that we have previously discussed. This would include characteristics such as fertilizer use, pesticide use, soil quality, etc. However, data of this quality does not exist in Lao PDR, which is why we rely on fixed effects."
169,854,0.986,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"speciï¬c restoration strategies, and, lastly, integrating those again into effective management programs are a challenging task. Legacy effects have to be considered as human interventions may go back for several 100 years (see Chap. 2). Humans have polluted rivers since the ï¬rst larger population agglomerations were established. Sewage treatment plants are known to combat pollution efï¬ciently. However, diffuse inputs from agriculture require alternative land management strategies and protection of riparian vegetation and ï¬oodplains (see Chaps. 10 and 13). Toxicants still represent a relevant stressor in river ecosystems, despite major improvements of the situation over the last decades, at least in regions with a strong governmental regulation. Intelligent strategies are required to deal with how exposure to toxicants is complicated by mixtures, multiple stressors, and other features of the environmental context that all inï¬uence the magnitude of potential negative effects (see Chap. 12). Scale dependencies and upstream/downstream effects are evident in all riverine ecosystem elements. Long-term ï¬ow alterations may be as critical as short-term alterations (see Chaps. 4 and 5). Sediment seems to be as important as ï¬ow, but understanding of sediment processes lags behind, making it difï¬cult to identify effective and sustainable mitigation measures (see Chap. 8). While building ï¬sh passes is supposed to be an adequate mitigation measure for continuity disruptions, their efï¬ciency, in particular, for downstream migration, is still questionable. Furthermore, the overall response of ï¬sh communities to multiple stressors in the context of multi-fragmented, river systems has to be explored in more detail (see Chap. 9). By restoring habitats, providing environmental ï¬ow, and building ï¬sh passes, we can improve habitat quality and connectivity. However, some impacts are not reversible or are hard to mitigate. Large dams cause such altered ecosystems since dams fundamentally change former riverine ecosystems into lake-type or hybrid systems, and restoration measures are, in general, limited here (see Chaps. 6 and 24). In addition to the challenges described above, our current understanding of causal relationships underpinning ecological processes becomes increasingly obsolete over time and needs revision, as the environmental conditions drift away from ânaturalâ conditions due to climate change (see Chap. 11). Many methods and successful applications of river restoration at local scales are presented in this book. However, comprehensive restoration of running water is lacking in most of the rivers worldwide. We are increasingly running the risk of losing the necessary free space to experimentally explore alternative restoration interventions. For example, river widening, as one of the favorite morphological restoration measures, requires space that is increasingly becoming the limiting factor, particularly in areas with natural constraints and high levels of development, such as the Alps. But even if land is available, land owners have to be convinced, subsidies provided, and implementation procedures developed to be successful. Strategic planning at catchment and even larger scales is necessary to cope with conï¬icting interests and new infrastructure development. However, even with best intensions and maximal support, we might not be able to signiï¬cantly restore heavily impacted rivers in all cases due to how society (acceptance of existing land uses) and ecosystems have shifted over time and become irreversibly locked into a new regime. Accepting this fact may redirect our"
55,76,0.986,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"at a colliery in Allerton Bywater, near Leeds.62 There were issues with compliance and Holmes complained that miners showed a âlack of footconsciousness, thoughtlessness and in a few cases, selfishnessâ.63 A larger study of 2,101 men working in mines across the country was published in 1956.64 Clinical examinations found that 1,900 men (90%) had some abnormality of the skin of the foot, yet in only 438 cases (21%) was there laboratory-confirmed fungal infection. However, rates varied, from 50% in one East Midlands pit to 3.5% in the Yorkshire coalfield overall. The problems of reconciling clinical and laboratory diagnoses were shown by the fact that 75 patients âshowed so-called âdiagnosticâ lesions without any evidence of fungus being foundâ, while 4% of those with âclinically normal feetâ tested positive in the laboratory.65 The Medical Mycology Committeeâs post-war survey on the incidence of mycoses in Britain, published in 1948, confirmed a view widely held within the medical profession, that the incidence of tinea capitis, the new term for ringworm of the scalp, in children had risen during the war. The rise was attributed to the suspension of X-ray treatment, the relaxation in school hygiene, and to the evacuation of children, with a consequent decline in hygiene and greater exposure to cats, dogs and cattle.66 An increase in tinea pedis in adults was explained by continuing improvements in hygiene, the exposure of men to infection in military settings, and the circulation of ringworm species around the world with troop movements.67 A particular concern was the importation of T. rubrum to Europe from the Far East, as it was one of the most difficult ringworm species to treat. However, the reported incidence of tinea pedis in Britain was nowhere near that in the United States. In 1950, Jacqueline Walker reported on a survey of 1,010 army recruits, 857 of whom were free of infection and of the 123 suspected cases, only 39 (4%) were confirmed in the laboratory.68 One reason for the low incidence was the relative paucity of sports and college facilities, and there were certainly fewer homes with bathrooms where infection could spread within families. The place where the spread of tinea pedis was most common was in elite public schools, which had the best sports facilities.69 One problem in surveys was the discrepancy between clinical and laboratory diagnoses. Doctors accepted that microscopy and culturing were more reliable than clinical methods; however, there were few laboratories available to provide the tests and a reluctance amongst dermatologists to use them.70 For some, the reliability of laboratory results was a moot point. They depended on many factors: from the quality of the skin sample taken, through to the competence of staff in particular"
182,357,0.986,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"ANIMALS AS PATHOLOGICAL SPECIMENS The role of pathological specimen was performed after death by many of the animals that feature in this volume. Its frequency reveals how important animal bodies were to the building of pathological knowledgeâ about diseases that afflicted particular animals, the distribution of diseases across the species, and the disease relationships between species. We have seen how animals were transformed into pathological specimens through post-mortem examination. Their organs, tissues and bodily fluids could be observed directly, removed for exhibition to interested parties, preserved for deposition and inspection within museums, or prepared for microscopic examination within laboratories. In existing historical literature, these processes and practices are generally sidelined by, or conflated with, the animalâs role as experimental material. The key exception is in accounts of the state control of certain late nineteenth-century animal diseases. Woods shows that in Britain, policies for the eradication of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and swine fever were predicated on the belief that they could be diagnosed accurately during post-mortem examination. Experience demonstrated that this was not, in fact, the case: Abigail Woods. âfrom Practical Men to Scientific Experts: British Veterinary Surgeons and the Development of Government Scientific Expertise, c.1878â1919.â History of Science li (2013): 457â80. Other authors have explored the diagnosis, in animal pathological specimens, of diseases that spread to humans via meat consumption. Here the animals performed simultaneously as food, a role that is discussed further below. Starting in Germany, and spreading subsequently to other European countries and the USA, specimens of pig muscle were subjected to microscopic inspection to see if they contained the parasitic disease trichinosis, which could cause death to human consumers: J. Gignilliat. âPigs, Politics and Protection: The European Boycott of American Pork, 1879â1891.â Agricultural History 35 (1961): 3â12; J.

170,150,0.986,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"next industrial revolution after this latest growth of ICT innovation and services (Gordon 2012), others are more optimistic of the continuation of IT revolution (Byrne et al. 2013) and that the growth of ICTs within developing countries can continue unbounded in its potential economic prospects. The measure of ICT growth may well be a necessity as one may underestimate the ICT opportunities and policies which support inclusive growth for a national economy. In other words, the inclusion of ICTs as part of a countryâs inclusive growth policies may well provide another answer as to what factors can contribute towards the reduction of poverty. The acknowledgement of ICTs as a contributing element in poverty reduction has not been instant. Much of the earlier 1990s, literature on ICTs focused on economic growth, acknowledging mainly descriptive results around gross domestic product (GDP) changes in relation to ICT growth (RÃ¶ller and Waverman 2001; Teltscher and Korka 2005; Waverman et al. 2005). Furthermore, the efficiencies in industrial production via technological advancement leads to increased labour productivity or business-driven solutions and the way towards national economic growth (Oliner and Sichel 2000). While these studies have shown some evidence linking ICT to economic growth, such growth results may not necessarily be linked to poverty reduction. With that said, less emphasis was placed on the social analysis between people, structures and the ICTs within developing country communities and ICTâs disruption to peopleâs everyday life (Adeya 2002). Within this literature, we now have a poverty and ICTs literature baseline within ICTD research at a time when mobile phones were mainly held by the wealthy population due to high cost (Adeya 2002). Since this initial ICT and poverty literature review, communication technology has rapidly become available across the globe. Citizens of various income levels and geographical regions have shown numerous cases of having some ICT access. What is less clear is the consistent choice of ICT measurement and poverty measures used by researchers when exploring the nexus between ICTs and poverty. Understanding the choices available and what has been used round measurements for ICTs and poverty are important in order to steer a common language particularly when working in a multidisciplinary area like ICTD. While there is a good base of literature which now covers ICTs and poverty (Spence and Smith 2009), this review particularly covers what research ground has been covered around ICTs and poverty measurement. Firstly, the literature brings readers up to date on the accepted multitude of approaches and indicators for measuring poverty. The section which follows further explores what ICTD researchers have used to measure poverty. Finally, the last section addresses the various indicators around ICTs which are being used in the poverty and ICT literature."
284,200,0.986,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction Mining activity has undeniable environmental impacts due to the nature of its operations, processing plants and foundries. Mining companies proclaim their environmental responsibility by implementing policies that limit environmental risk and impact, while also applying new technologies and production processes that are more respectful of the environment. The degree of efï¬cacy of these sustainability measures and the degree to which companies voluntarily ensure environmental care cannot belie the fact that â no matter what â mining activity has and will always have environmental impacts. There are two major points of view about the subject, according to Whitmore (2006). On the one hand, there are the views of companies â that is to say, the actors who control the mining bulldozers and claim to ensure that everything goes well and that mining is, or can be, sustainable. On the other hand, there are the views of those who are affected by mining activity, such as the communities, peasants and indigenous peoples who are displaced without proper consultation, who suffer illnesses, and whose lifestyles, health and environment are impacted. This chapter will not address the mining problem from the conventional perspective of whether or not mining is sustainable. The majority of the socioenvironmental conï¬icts that arise around mining are focused on this problem.1 We refer to the fact that mining consumes large quantities of water and energy and is one of the most widespread productive activities. As AngloGold Ashantiâs sustainability report declares,2 mining activity has a direct impact on the environment"

175,1246,0.986,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","An adaptive management process begins with initial actions that have reasonable chances of succeeding. Future actions must be based on continued monitoring of the water body to determine how it responds to the actions taken. Plans for future regulatory rules and public spending should be subject to revision as stakeholders learn more about how the system responds to actions taken. Monitoring is an essential aspect of adaptive water quality management and modeling. Regardless of what immediate actions are taken, there may not be an immediate measurable response. For example there may be signiï¬cant time lags between when actions are taken to reduce nutrient loads and the resulting changes in nutrient concentrations. This is especially likely if nutrients from past activities are bound to sediments or if nutrient-contaminated groundwater has a long residence time before its release to surface water. For many reasons, lags between actions taken and responses must be expected. Water bodies should be monitored to establish whether the âtrajectoriesâ of the measured water quality criteria point toward attainment of the designated use. Waste load allocations will inevitably be required if quality standards are not being met. These allocations involve costs. Different allocations will have a different total costs and different distributions of those costs; hence they will have different perceived levels of fairness. A minimum cost policy may result in a cost distribution that places most of the burden on just some of the stakeholders. But until such a policy is identiï¬ed one will not know this. An alternative may be to reduce loads from all sources by the same proportion. Such a policy has prevailed in the US over the past several decades. Even though not very cost effective from the point of view of water quality management, the ease of administration and the fulï¬llment of other objectives must have made such a policy politically acceptable, even though expensive. However, more than these types of waste load allocations policies will be needed for many of"

97,533,0.986,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","With regard to disaster risk reduction, Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson also highlight the need for a long-term resilience thinking to tackle impacts from climate change and urbanisation. Reviewing the potentials but also the limitations of green and grey infrastructure for disaster risk reduction in urban areas, they suggest that intermediate âhybridâ approaches, combining both green and grey approaches, may be the most effective strategy for reducing risk from environmental hazards. This is especially the case when NBS approaches may be insufficient to meet the rising impacts of climate change, in case of space limitation or when resource limitations require cost effectiveness in the context of both climatic and economic uncertainty. A particular part of green infrastructure in cities â riparian forests and wetlands â are highlighted as NBS with particular benefits for dense urban areas. Dagmar Haase introduces the management of these habitats as a NBS with multiple benefits that include risk mitigation and adaptation concerning both climate extremes as well as enhanced flood and drought probabilities, while providing co-benefits such as a buffer against high air temperatures, water availability during heatwaves and recreation potential. The author presents several options that show wetland and riparian forestsâ functionality as NBS to better face the consequences of climate change in cities and urban regions and stresses that urban riparian forest and wetlands need to not only be conserved but also be restored in case of degradation. In line with the previous authors, Dagmar Haase also promotes a hybrid approach of combining natural remnants of wetlands and floodplain forests with technical solutions. To realise âmini-wetlandsâ and âriparian trenchesâ in areas disconnected from the river may also create new jobs. Following also suggestions by Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson, the complementarity of both NBS and technology may be a clever, pragmatic and at the same time innovative solution to complex socio-ecological problems. In addition, potential disservices from urban riparian forests and wetlands, including vector-borne diseases, e.g. transported via mosquitoes, may need to be considered as well with potential negative effects to human health. Careful consideration including such trade-offs can lead to more informed decision-making. Complementing the contributions by Yaella Depietri and Timon McPhearson as well as Dagmar Haase, in their chapter McKenna Davis and Sandra Naumann also focus on disaster risk reduction and introduce sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) as a NBS to flood risk management. Based on their case study analysis, including cost-benefit calculations in comparison with conventional piped drainage systems, the authors conclude that SUDS have a high potential as sustainable, costeffective approaches, which can complement pure âgreyâ infrastructure and can be applied within new developments or used to retrofit existing systems. Nevertheless, uncertainties about long-term maintenance, performance and cost (-effectiveness) are main barriers that limit the implementation of SUDS. Authors highlight that making lessons learned and data gathered from existing projects more widely available will support a larger uptake. Maybe most important to support the uptake of SUDS is the fact that NBS such as SUDS can provide multifunctionality, while purely grey and engineered solutions cannot."

They hypothesized that if, for example, kills were concentrated at specific turbines, then curtailment, removal, or relocating that turbine may reduce bat deaths. However, if fatalities are broadly distributed, then facilitywide mitigation strategies would be necessary (Arnett et al. 2008). Thus far, studies worldwide have failed to detect specific turbines responsible for most fatalities at any given facility. Other patterns at scales beyond individual turbines have been reported that may assist with assessing risk. Baerwald and Barclay (2011) found no differences in"

Use of gaps by forest bats following a decade or more of successional change is likely to be different, however, with overall declines in activity plausible as open/edge-space species disappear or decline in abundance with increasing gap clutter. Such temporal changes need to be identified along with the optimal gap size(s) and the density of gaps required by different species of bats to permit commercially viable, sustained yield harvests while fostering high levels of bat activity and provision of roosting habitat in managed forests. In contrast to many North American studies that have been undertaken in gaps soon after harvesting, in Australia, most bat research has focused on the use of older regrowth regenerating from group selection harvest, particularly characterising bat species by their traits in relation to the use of these dense stands. There is a general pattern of forest clutter increasing over time after group selection harvest so that old regrowth (>30 years) has significant higher clutter levels than young or older forest, which constrains use by bats to closed-space species with a low wing aspect ratio (Law and Chidel 2002; Webala et al. 2011). Less manoeuvrable edge-space species with a high wing aspect ratio tend to be scarce in regrowth forest (except on flyways provided by tracks and creeks), although their activity is greater in the subcanopy and canopy than understorey (Adams et al. 2009). Vegetation is more cluttered in regrowth at these upper heights (closer stems and less vertical space in the subcanopy), and this leads to less bat activity in such situations (Adams et al. 2009). It is not known whether open-space and low-frequency edge-space species are active above the canopy of these young forests, although this was confirmed by MÃ¼ller et al. (2013) for mature forests in Europe."
353,193,0.986,"Disability, Health and Human Development","where the expenditures survey questions were few and not detailed. Using a very detailed expenditure questionnaire from the LSMS, no significant difference is found here either. Some differences are found though for certain types of expenditures. Health expenditures information is available in three countries. Having a moderate or severe functional difficulty is associated with higher health expenditures in Malawi and Tanzania but not for Uganda. This result supports the hypothesis of conversion factors associated with functional difficulty as explained in Chapter 2. Households with functional difficulties have on average higher health expenditures in Malawi and Tanzania, which may make the conversion of income into wellbeing more challenging. In particular, higher health expenditures may crowd out other expenditures and indirectly make households more prone to worse living conditions, asset accumulation and food insecurity as shown earlier. Significantly lower education expenditures are associated with a severe functional difficulty in Ethiopia and Malawi, but not in Tanzania and Uganda. This might suggest an allocation of expenditures away from education and toward health or other expenditures affected by the functional difficulty as found in Mitra et al. (2016) for Vietnam. In the four countries, a consistent result is that having a moderate difficulty is less strongly associated with a household wellbeing deprivation than having a severe difficulty across all household wellbeing indicators. Nonetheless, households with a moderate difficulty are more often deprived, everything else held constant, than households with no functional difficulty especially with respect to food insecurity and shocks. Similar regressions are run with the household functional difficulty score15 in Table 5.8 instead of the severe and moderate difficulty binary variables in Table 5.7. The functional difficulty score is associated with worse household wellbeing outcomes for three to five wellbeing indicators by country. For instance, for a household in Ethiopia, a 10% higher functional difficulty score is associated with 13.4% higher odds of having experienced a recent shock and 11.2% higher odds of being food insecure. It is also associated with education expenditures lower by 16.3 ETB (Ethiopian Birr) and social protection transfers higher by 10.2 ETB. 5.3.2.1 Multidimensional Poverty Results of the multidimensional poverty analysis using Alkire and Foster (2011) and the dimensions, indicators and weights in Table 5.2 are first shown in the spider charts in Fig. 5.2, which gives the deprivation rates across functional difficulty status for each of the five dimensions."
167,189,0.986,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"Assuming that the complex Sami society is given account it can be argued that the Sami, in comparison with most indigenous peoples around the world, has a relatively good situation. The Sami in Sweden have experienced a unique and positive health development over the past centuries that has taken them from a very high mortality and low life expectancy to levels quite on par with the general average age in Sweden (Axelsson and SkÃ¶ld 2006). In a recent article published in The Lancet (Anderson et al. 2016) poorer outcomes for Indigenous populations for life expectancy, infant mortality, maternal mortality, high birthweight, child malnutrition, child and adult obesity, educational attainment, and economic status are documented. The differences between regions and countries are great, but the Sami has a relative advantage to other Indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, we should remember that reindeer herding is one of the most dangerous occupations with major accident hazards and that there are very worrying trends in high suicide rates among young reindeer herders. The Sami have increased their political influence. Since the early 1900s a relatively successful political mobilization, including the establishment of Sami Parliaments in Norway, Sweden and Finland, has occurred in the Sami society. Despite the advance in many areas the Sami are still dependent on decisions by the State and the majority society on most issues. And there is still vulnerability in the Sami society. Reindeer herding, which is an important part of the Sami culture, are working under difficult economic and legal conditions. The Sami languages are fighting for its survival. We know that language and identity are closely linked. A stereotyped image of the Sami is still prevalent today and a general ignorance has been due to inadequate teaching and learning materials ignoring. This is an essential part of the Sami issues of today. Traditional knowledge and values threatens to be lost in a shrinking cultural space, while the Sami complexity and modernization has meant that more and more lose their Sami identity. And a crucial question is how much we really know about the Sami health situation."

Consequently, beef production has fallen by 35 % between 2002 and 2009. As is the case for Patagonia, livestock population and number of farmers have also been falling. The number of farmers decreased by 19 % in 2002 compared to 1988 but the grazing area increased by 22 % during the same period. This is a reflection of land degradation which leads to expansion of grazing lands. Land management practice for addressing land degradation Tillage methods: A tillage experiment conducted in the SW of Buenos Aires province have shown that No tillage (NT) is more sustainable than the Conventional tillage (CT). NT used less energy, N and P to achieve the zero net balance of both nutrients. Conventional tillage (CT) also showed to have greater erosion risk than NT. However, CT showed lower risk of pesticide contamination than NT (Silenzi et al. 2004). Soil water content was comparable across all tillage method (Table 11.9). Wheat yield was slightly higher for the VT and NT than the conventional method. Adoption of NT is higher in the subhumid region than in arid and semiarid areas. One of the challenges of widespread adoption of NT is its difï¬culty to integrate into a mixed system agricultural livestock. The crop-livestock systems have been shown to be suited to climatic and market risks as they provide greater flexibility and stability to the local system than specialized crop or livestock production systems. Additionally, livestock-crop production systems increase demand for labor, and enable more efï¬cient land use, thus contributing to economic and social development"

Classification criteria for POPs were developed from the physical, chemical, biological, and environmental properties of the so-called âdirty dozenâ (Ritter et al. 1995a, b) and are based on trigger values for persistence (P) bioaccumulation (B), toxicity (T), and propensity for long range transport (LRT) (Table 12). Several other initiatives to assess chemicals for properties that might confer P, B, and T have been put in place. These are the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR 1992), the Toxic Substances Management Policy (Environment Canada 1995), the Toxics Release Inventory Reporting (USEPA 1999a), the New Chemicals Program (USEPA 1999b), REACH (European Community 2011). These initiatives exclude pesticides but EC regulation No. 1107/2009 (European Community 2009) is specifically directed towards pesticides and is the focus of further discussion here. EC regulation No. 1107 uses classification criteria similar to those of the POPs (Table 12), but these are somewhat more conservative for P and B.

175,637,0.986,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","probability models, and maximum likelihood estimators (Haas and Scheff 1990; Helsel 1990; Kroll and Stedinger 1996; MacBerthouex and Brown 2002). Historical and physical paleoflood data provide another example of censored data. Before the beginning of a continuous measurement program on a stream or river, the stages of unusually large floods can be estimated based on the memories of humans who have experienced these events and/or physical markings in the watershed (Stedinger and Baker 1987). Before continuous measurements were taken that provided this information, the annual maximum floods that were not unusual were not recorded. These missing data are censored data. They cover periods between occasionally large floods that have been recorded or that have left some evidence of their occurrence (Stedinger and Cohn 1986). The discussion below addresses probability plot methods for use with censored data. Probability plot methods have a long history of use with censored data because they are relatively simple to use and to understand. Moreover, recent research has shown that they are relatively efï¬cient when the majority of values are observed, and unobserved values are known only to be below (or above) some detection limit or perception threshold that serves as a lower (or upper) bound. In such cases, probability plot regression estimators of moments and quantiles are as accurate as maximum likelihood estimators. They are almost as good as estimators computed with complete samples (Helsel and Cohn 1988; Kroll and Stedinger 1996). Perhaps the simplest method for dealing with censored data is adoption of a conditional probability model. Such models implicitly assume that the data are drawn from one of two classes of observations: those below a single threshold, and those above the threshold. This model is appropriate for simple cases where censoring occurs because small observations are recorded as âzero,â as often happens with low-flow, low pollutant concentration, and some flood records. The conditional probability model introduces an extra parameter P0 to describe the probability that an observation is âzero.â If r of a total of"

If successful some designs, in particular shoreline and near-shoreline devices, could reach commercial status within a decade. Wave energy devices are expected to be highly susceptible to the projected changes in metocean conditions and especially to extreme weather events (see Chap. 5). The potential of tidal energy generated from either tidal impoundment or tidal streams is very low in the North Sea except near the UK coast, where it is slightly higher (Carbon Trust 2005).

166,111,0.986,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"2 Surveying Elderly Migrants as an Illustration of Surveying Vulnerability Many studies on survey methodology underline the difficulties in obtaining a representative sample of the target population. Results may be inferred to the whole (sub)population thanks to sampling methods, which determine the quality of the sample representativeness (Tabutin 2006; Gerville-RÃ©ache et al. 2011). Nevertheless, even if the sampling method promises representativeness, some subpopulations are hard to reach for availability, access, or monitoring reasons. This may lead to differences between the original sample and the size and profile of the responding sample (Groves and Couper 1998; Elcheroth et al. 2011). Groves and Couper (1998) identify several reasons explaining participation in surveys: individual characteristics such as social and/or psychological components (including attitudes, norms and values); demographic variables (age, marital status, household structure, education, income, place of residence); and from a heuristic perspective, features of the research design (data collection mode, number of contact attempts, period of data collection); the interviewersâ characteristics (sex, age, experience); and interactions between interviewers and respondents. VLV decided to deal with the elderly migrants in almost the same way as the other elderly sample members. Because of their life course, however, elderly migrants differ from the overall population in a number of specific ways. Their particular characteristics may interfere with their participation in the survey. These points are detailed below. In Switzerland, most elders of foreign origin arrived in the second half of the twentieth century. They mainly came from Italy in the 1950s, from Spain in the 1960s, and from Portugal and former Yugoslavia in the 1980s and early 1990s (Piguet 2004). After World War II, the main goal of Swiss migratory policy was to get temporary workers responding to the needs of a growing economy without competing with Swiss natives. Immigrants experienced severe legal restrictions (including the interdiction of family reunification, seasonal status) and a lack of integration policies until the early 1990s. A part of the Swiss population also openly expressed hostility against immigrants during the campaign for the socalled Schwarzenbach initiatives2 against âforeign overpopulation.â In this context, painful professional and health trajectories have been part of individual migration"

This is referred to as the ATE. The findings further show that among the exposed farmers, exposure causes adoption rates to increase by an average of 33% from the average of 0% that would have occurred if the farmers had not been exposed to agricultural technologies. This is the ATET. Potential outcome (PO) means indicate that the average rate of adoption for exposed farmers is 46% while for non-exposed farmers is only 3.2%. The actual adoption rate is 30.2% and the population adoption gap emanating from farmersâ incomplete exposure to agricultural technologies is 12.7%. There is potential to improve adoption rates of agricultural technologies by 12.7% in Hurungwe through making farmers aware of the existing technologies. The population selection bias measured by the difference between ATE and ATET was found to be 9.9% and statistically significant at 1% level. The statistically significant selection bias demonstrates that the probability of technology adoption for a farmer in the treated group is different from the probability of technology adoption for a farmer randomly selected from the population. This therefore justifies the application of treatment effects in this chapter. A two-step estimation technique was applied to a probit model with treatment effects in examining the drivers of agricultural technology adoption in Hurungwe. The estimated models are presented in Table 3.5 from column (1) to column (3).

The awareness of the adverse effects of antibiotics grew with the arrival in the late 1940s of tetracycline, which was both broad spectrum and taken orally, and could cause the yellowing of teeth in infants and photosensitivity. Initially, fungal overgrowth was well down the list of concerns, top of which were allergic and toxic reactions, vitamin deficiency, the development of resistance and bacterial overgrowth.59 Indeed, many reviewers implied that the extent and seriousness of fungal overgrowth had been overstated by medical mycologists talking up the importance of their specialism. The first clinical discussion of fungal overgrowth was in June 1949, when Harold Harris spoke at the New York Academy of Medicine on treating patients suffering from brucellosis with aureomycin and chloramphenicol.60 He suggested that overgrowth was due to a combination of C. albicans gaining virulence in the absence of bacterial competition, the destruction of intestinal bacterial flora, and the lowering of the vitality of gut tissues. He worried too about the permanence of the changes and the development of more virulent strains of the fungus. In June 1951, James Woods and colleagues, from the Watts and McPherson Hospitals in Durham, North Carolina, published a study of 25 patients who had developed C. albicans infection after treatment with various antibiotics.61 The study found no evidence that antibiotics had a stimulating effect of the fungus, but confirmed the view that the removal of competing bacteria cleared the gut for fungal colonisation. The report also suggested that treatment with vitamin B complex offered some amelioration, but could give no reason why, other than perhaps it improved the general nutritional status of the body. However, the immediate reason for the intervention of the Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry in June 1951 was because of reports that aureomycin, chloramphenicol and terramycin could precipitate fungal infection of the lungs, whereas the bowel infections noted previously had been âof little consequenceâ. Cases of broncho-pulmonary moniliasis had been reported in medical journals for decades.62 The increased attention given to tuberculosis after the Second World War, because of mass X-ray screening and effective antibiotic treatment, revealed a greater prevalence of broncho and pulmonary mycotic disease.63 A study by Robert Oblath and colleagues in California, published in July 1951, argued that C. albicans should be added to the list of mycotic pulmonary organisms alongside Coccidioides immitis and Histoplasma capsulatum, which we discuss in the next Chapter.64 There were also reports of C. albicans infection of the heart"

Water quality is a vital characteristic that determines how societies and humans use and value aquatic environments and other associated natural resources. Coastal and offshore environments are some of the greatest natural assets in the United States, and much of their value is critically dependent upon good water quality. Coastal, shelf, and deepwater environments are subject to numerous processes, interactions, influences, and stresses, which in turn determine the quality of the water they contain. The determinants, current status, and historical trends in water quality in the northern Gulf of Mexico are reviewed in Chapter 2, which is authored by Mahlon C. Kennicutt II, Professor Emeritus of Chemical Oceanography at Texas A&M University and long-time oceanographic researcher in the Gulf of Mexico. The information reviewed in Chapter 2 was drawn from periodic summaries of national coastal condition reports prepared by various federal, state, and local agencies and programs. These summaries were reviewed, but the underlying primary data that provided the basis for the reports was not reanalyzed. The assessments involved were produced by a large number of expert government and academic scientists based on a vast amount of data and information from primary sources and the peer-reviewed literature. Within this context, the synthesized data comes from hundreds of sources including national program reports; water quality reporting at the federal, state, and local levels; locally organized monitoring programs; and the published literature. The reports and data collection programs are primarily from the 1990s to the mid-2000s, and they often utilize differing metrics, indicators, and methodologies for assessing and rating water quality. These region-wide assessments in this time period of approximately 20 years are the most relevant and up-to-date means of defining the present day status and trends in water quality in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Good water quality is a concept derived from a suite of characteristics, so there is no single definition. Two key determinants of water quality in the Gulf of Mexico are physiographic setting and human activities. Several important measures of water quality include water clarity, degree of eutrophication (excessive aquatic plant growth caused by nutrient enrichment), and chemical (petroleum and nonpetroleum pollutants) and biological (pathogens) contamination. Natural and anthropogenic effects on water quality are dynamic on many scales, and this leads to considerable variability in space and time. Impacts on water quality caused by multiple factors can be additive and/or synergistic. Thus, the cumulative effects of natural and"

When the capacity for problem solving has been depleted due to the declining returns on complexification and the escalating cost for the maintenance of the existing level of complexity, only collapse remains because voluntary simplification is not a feasible option. The framework has sometimes been applied to the rise and fall of civilizations in history. For example, archaeologists such as Weiss (2000) and Ur (2010) have explained the rise and fall of ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia by the initial ability of these civilizations to respond to climatic stresses with more complexity, followed by a later inability to avoid collapse in the face of otherwise similar stresses (Fig. 4.10, from Friedrichs 2013, 62).13 The theory can be adapted for the diagnosis of current predicaments such as anthropogenic climate change, energy scarcity, or financial instability (Friedrichs 2013, Ch. 3; Korowicz 2010, 2012)."

We further hypothesize that in households where the respondent (household head) expresses a lower degree of risk aversion she is more likely to undertake adaption measures. In the model for Vietnam, we included ethnicity as a binary variable taking on the value 1 if household is the majority Kinh and 0 if household belongs to any of the many ethnic minorities. We expect that ethnic minorities are less likely to invest in climate change related adaptation measures due to their living in the remote areas and villages less endowed with infrastructure (Hung et al. 2010). To capture the effect of remoteness for all households we added the variable âDistance to district townâ from the village head questionnaire. Here we expect a negative relationship with climate change adaptation. Finally, we added province dummy variables to capture other differences among the study regions. In the selection Equation (1b), we use the respondent characteristics including age, education, gender and membership of socio-political organization as the independent variables. This is because the adaptation decision is made by the household head but the perception of climate change is given by the respondent of that household who in most cases is the household head. Age, a proxy of farming experience, is supposed to have a positive effect on the farmersâ awareness. We expect that more experienced farmers are more likely to observe changes in climate over time. Likewise, better educated farmers are believed to have more access to information on climate change (Deressa et al. 2008). Household size is assumed to have a positive effect as the chance to obtain information increases with the number of household members and the same mechanism we assume for income (Deressa et al. 2008). One important household characteristic included as an explanatory variable in the selection equation is the climate-related shock experience. This variable is computed by summing up the severity scores multiplied by the frequencies of all climatic events, namely drought, floods, storm and soil erosion experienced by a household in the reference period. We expect that more experience with negative climate-related shocks in the past increases the probability that a respondent is aware of climate change. The inclusion of the ethnicity variable in the model for Vietnam is based on the same arguments as in Equation 1a. We expect that the Kinh majority is more likely to be aware of climate change. Likewise, we have added province dummy variables. In order to control for country heterogeneity we estimate models for Thailand and Vietnam separately. In order to further explore the type of adaptation measures undertaken by farmers, we formulated a multinomial logit model (MNL) to assess the drives for four categories of adaptation measures, while not undertaking any adaptation was treated as the base category as follows: Pr (Yi = j ) ="

In this context, increased safety is primarily expected to be achieved by increasing the âprofessionalizationâ of these specialists who influence industrial activities by distinguishing themselves from the agents directly involved in the flow of operations. Professionalization goes hand in hand with the identiï¬cation of a profession or of a group of speciï¬c professions, both internally (specialised departments and services, etc.) and externally (training bodies, experts, consultants, etc.). As has been observed in various ways, this can lead to them becoming cut off from the reality in the ï¬eld. Depending on the option chosen, âprofessionalization and safetyâ can thus be understood in very different or even opposing ways. Besides the issues with terminology, this can largely explain the ambiguity that often exists in the way these matters are approached. Even more so because, within companies, greater safety can be sought simultaneously on both these levels with varying degrees of visibility."
126,398,0.986,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Given the evidence from the past seven decades of exploration, and current upsurges in interest in the broader northern Rift Valley Area and Horn of Africa, the oil companies are arguing this region is likely to become next West Africa. The convergence of this massive expansion of the oil industry in the same impact zone as that of the Gibe III dam will decimate livelihoods in this region. The impacts from all of these developments together far exceed the sum of the individual impacts, as livelihoods will already be stressed beyond their coping points by the Gibe III dam. Seismic exploration, while progressing for decades, has rapidly expanded in recent years. Additionally, two wells have already been drilled by Tullow Oil in the lower Omo area near the EthiopiaâKenya border by Tullow Oil, and many more South of the Lake in Kenya where development drilling is already in progress. These developments will directly and severely impact pastoral livelihoods in the region. Seismic exploration requires the clearing of vast swaths of land from flora, fauna and people including for the placement of explosives or large âthumper trucksâ every 100 m. This is carried out for distances of hundreds of kilometers in order to generate seismic waves. These operations involve security measures to prevent people from approaching the seismic lines during clearing, placing of trucks and explosives, and seismic testing itself which can extend for months. For pastoral peoples, these actions mean major disruption of settlements, livestock movements and access to grazing and water sources. Drilling involves the same securitization of the location of the drilling rigs. It also involves the production of a very large amount of drilling waste, including toxic drilling muds, drill cuttings (rock) contaminated with drilling muds and possibly hydrocarbons, and produced water (from injection during drilling) also contaminated with drilling muds and hydrocarbons. If the drilling is on land, in areas such as this region, the wastes will be left near the drill site in waste ponds, likely unlined, risking contamination of any groundwater that may be accessed in the region, as well as nearby land. If the drilling is on water, the wastes are generally dumped directly into the water system next to the drilling platform. This would be concern enough without the impacts on Lake Turkana water levels from the dam, as it can seriously impact benthic organisms, chemical oxygen demand, and ï¬sh life (Patin 1999; Satterly 2003). However, with any reduction in Lake level from the Dam itself, this would be far worse. Each of these phases of oil and gas development involve security, generally from either private security forces, or the military forces of the hosting country. In a region already experiencing the livelihood tensions noted in throughout this book, as well as the impending tensions from the impacts of the Dam itself, this increased militarization of the region will only augment armed conflict and humanitarian concerns. The exploration programs that have been progressing in the South Omo, North Turkana regions have already sparked conflict when residents of the region ï¬rst encountered oil company trucks that said they had authorization from the government to commence work in the region, despite community members knowing nothing about it."

As shown in Fig. 1.3, the positive relationships between seawater concentrations of DMSe and DMS and DMSe and coccolithophore carbon were interpreted to mean that, like DMS, DMSe is an algal product. On emission to the atmosphere, the volatile Se compounds will be oxidised and incorporated into particulate phases in pathways which are probably analogous to those discussed in Sect. 1.2.3 for DMS, although the four orders of magnitude smaller flux of volatile Se compared to S means that itâs significance for atmospheric properties will be negligible. However, some of the sea-to-air flux of Se will be dry and wet deposited to the land where it could have implications for human health (Rayman 2000). The pathway of Se from the oceans to land via the atmopshere is supported by measurements of the Se content of mosses in Norway which show decreased concentrations with distance from the sea, indicating a marine source (E.

Habitat characteristics were analysed in a radius of 100 m around the sampled point, using a detailed habitat classiï¬cation (Kerbiriou et al. 2010). Species calls were identiï¬ed through spectrogram analyses. At large scale, we found that activity of common bats in railway verges was of the same order of magnitude as in other habitats, except for aquatic habitats, which are known as key habitats for numerous European bat species (Russo and Jones 2003; Nicholls and Racey 2006). Furthermore, we found that activity was even greater in railway verges than in some other habitats for two aerial species: N. leislerii and P. pipistrellus. For P. pipistrellus, a very generalist species (Russ and Montgomery 2002), activity in railway verges was greater than in seven other habitats. Overall, bat activity among railway verges was not inferior to the activity in highly modiï¬ed habitats such as continuous artiï¬cial surfaces, discontinuous artiï¬cial surfaces and arable land (conï¬rmed for 4 of the 5 taxa studied). At local scale, we found a negative effect of railway areas on the Myotis spp. for the two sample periods and a positive effect on Nyctalus spp. for the post-reproductive period. When focusing the analysis on the site type, we detected few obvious signiï¬cant differences in bat activity between the verges of railways and the three other site types (ï¬eld verges, plain ï¬eld and plain wood). The signiï¬cant difference for Nyctalus spp. during the post-reproductive period (lower activity in woods than on railway verges) may seem contradictory with the positive effect of surrounding areas of wood for these species at the same period. The foraging ecology of these aerial hawking bats and their habitat requirements could explain these results: Nyctalus spp. are species that forage mainly along edges, thus more in forest verges than in the heart of forests, but otherwise inhabit the interior of the forests, thus the amount of woodland habitat at the landscape level would have also an overall positive effect. It must be noted that except for the Myotis spp. group in the reproductive period, we detected no difference between the verges of railways and those of ï¬elds. This result seems to indicate a similar functioning role for railway verges on bats as that of other linear verges, particularly on common aerial hawking bats (Verboom and Huitema 1997). Our results suggest that the presence of railway verges does not influence signiï¬cantly the foraging/commuting activity of common bats, except for species like those from the Myotis group, a group including mostly gleaner species, less generalist species (Dietz et al. 2007) and some threatened species (Temple and Terry 2009). In several cases (for P. pipistrellus at global scale and for Nyctalus spp. at local scale), railway verges even seem to provide a signiï¬cant habitat in intensive agricultural landscapes where semi-natural elements, in particular linear elements like hedgerows, tend to disappear. Railways, along with other artiï¬cial linear infrastructures, may thus contribute to maintaining common bat populations in such landscapes."
38,356,0.986,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"Some of the most common RS measurements of marine ecosystems include the extent and density (e.g., sparse versus dense seagrass beds) of habitats, but measuring condition is more difï¬cult to assess. This is partly attributed to the high variability of the marine environment, but also the effort needed to properly gather and couple in situ with RS data to calculate indices that can be used to estimate resource condition. These data are often combined into condition indices. For example, biophysical indices such as benthic complexity or rugosity (roughness) have been developed and compared to species diversity in marine applications, and changes in these indices can be indicative of changes in condition due to a disturbance event. SPOT multispectral images have been used to map the spatial distribution of kelps, which drive the biodiversity of many benthic communities, and decreased kelp bed extent can also indicate a change in condition. More generally, there are a variety of indices of biological diversity that use remotely sensed inputs; since diversity can change with condition this approach can help monitor condition itself. One rather direct measure that can help assess the condition of a coral reef is its reflectance, which is visible in satellite images; a bleaching event, such as caused by excessive temperatures, results in a rapid increase in reflectance as the corals expel their symbiotic zooxanthellae. Recent calls have been made for the development of indices that reflect the condition of commercially or ecologically important processes, such as the provision of nursery habitat, ï¬ltration by suspension-feeding invertebrates, sediment stabilisation in coastal environments by reef-forming species, and conditions that lead to the formation of blooms of nuisance and disease-causing organisms. Advancements in ocean colour product calibration are helping to provide water quality assessments in coastal areas (and large inland fresh or saltwater bodies) and making it easier to understand and monitor ecosystem conditions. Additionally, sophisticated condition indices that include multiple parameters such as temperature, light, pH, wind, seasonality, sediments and nutrients are under development."

In treatment 2 (drought index insurance with bank as policy holder), the demand for SI increased by 13.5 percent for canal irrigation and by 18.4 percent for drip irrigation. The differences between control and treatments groups are all significant. Although treatment 2 appears to have greater effect than treatment 1 in both canal and drip irrigation, their differences are not significant. Also, we could not find any significant difference of impact between canal and drip irrigation, except in the control group where the difference is significant at 5 percent level. For the impact with covariates, we estimated a LPM of WTP for SI with the treatment variable being a dummy indicating whether the individual was in one of the treatment groups or in the control group. The covariates are socioeconomic characteristics measured during the followup survey which took place just after the intervention. The specific variables included in the model were those highly correlated with the dependent variables (dummy WTP) in the control group (Gertler 2004). We first considered only the WTP bid as the only covariate. Table 9.11 provides the result of the treatments effect using LPM specification.

This is why the transition to a bio-based economy, which serves the goal of providing the public good âworld climateâ in a sustainable quality, will not happen without government support. Common-Pool Goods In the context of environmental protection and sustainability, the group of so-called commonpool goods plays an important role. These are goods which are rival in consumption, so that their quality is diminished when they are consumed (i.e., the marginal utility of consuming them is the smaller the more people are consuming them), while nobody can be excluded from utilizing them. Because of this combination of rivalry in consumption and the failure of the exclusion principle, rational individuals will consume as much as possible of such a good as fast as possible. The dominance of this consumption strategy will lead to what Garrett Hardin (1968) called the âtragedy of the commonsâ, i.e., a fast overuse of such resources which will lead to their premature extinction, if the government does not intervene. Examples of common-pool goods suffering from this kind of market failure are fish stocks in the open sea where everybody can catch as much as he desires, but also groundwater aquifers, rivers, or lakes which are exploited by different private parties or different countries, rain forests in countries where no government regulation for their exploitation is enforced, etc. Without strict utilization regimes which are enforced by governments, these resources will be lost within a short time. Besides setting up strict utilization schemes for such goods, the government can support their preservation also by encouraging the provision of alternative commodities serving the same purpose as the common-pool goods. In the case of endangered fish stocks, the government can, e.g., support financially the development of new kinds of marine food like algae-based nutrition. This branch of the bioeconomy has been flourishing over the past years, but this development has been possible only because of government subsidies. Therefore, the bioeconomy depends on government intervention also with respect to"
10,29,0.986,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"brook restoration measures were carried out, such as removing drainage systems, muting ditches, shoaling streams, and constructing water storage areas. Apart from that, water management plans were written for local farmers to aid drought adaptation on parcel level, and two studies were conducted (one about level-dependent drainage and one on surface run-off). In the region Salland, also in the Netherlands, two structures were built as part of a larger plan where the double-edged sword of too much water and too little water is addressed simultaneously by a set of structures that combine discharge and pumping functions. The project also paid attention to optimization of water management. In the region Flanders, Belgium, instruments for drought monitoring and impact modelling were set up, combined with information provision on drought. This resulted in among others the inclusion of drought as one of the four main themes on a web portal, where the developed drought indicators are published and disseminated. In the region Eifel-Rur, Germany, the focus was on preventing deterioration of water quality in the water reservoir system. This was done by investigating possible changes in the inflow over the last decades, to see if trends could be distinguished. Based on this study, the management plans for discharge downstream of the reservoir system can be checked and if necessary adapted. In the region Brittany, France, two strands of work were carried out. The practice partner developed an innovative lock for the dam of a reservoir that prevents salt water intrusion when boats pass the dam to and from the ocean. One of the scientiï¬c partners developed a tool that forecasts inflows to the reservoir during low flow season and therefore aids anticipation of critical situations. Last, in the region Somerset, United Kingdom, a whole set of innovative approaches was implemented to increase drought resilience, examples of which are modelling and technology transfer, water demand management, soil moisture data collection and analysis, different cover crops, and all kinds of measures aimed to conserve the peat soils, such as scrub clearance, re-grading peat soils and improvement of structures that retain rainwater. These six regions were grouped in three pilots. The pilot Nature predominantly focused on drought adaptation measures with regard to preservation of the natural environment. The two practice partners in this pilot were Twente and Somerset. The pilot Agriculture predominantly focused on drought adaptation measures in relation to agriculture. The two practice partners in this pilot were Salland and Flanders. The pilot Freshwater predominantly focused on drought adaptation measures for the preservation and management of freshwater reservoirs. The two practice partners in this pilot were Brittany and Eifel-Rur. The scientiï¬c partners in the DROP project team, called âthe governance teamâ, worked on governance assessment of these same six regions.

In order to have a comprehensive picture of the couple facing a stressful event, it is necessary to draw on the one hand on âobjectiveâ data, i.e. what the person receives, and on the other hand on âsubjectiveâ data, i.e. the perception the person has about received support. Getting objective data has two implications: first, several sources of information have to be solicited; second, at least one of these sources has to be an âexternal informantâ, that means a third person who evaluates the relationship between the partners. To date, social support in the domain of women breast cancer has been measured mainly by self-reported questionnaires completed by the women and, much more rarely, by their partners â the behavior of their partners is thus most often reported by the women themselves. Second, while a lot of attention has been given to the effect of the different types of social support (emotional, instrumental, informational) and to the effect of individual variables like coping strategies in women on adjustment to the stress of the illness, much less is known about the mechanisms though which social support is communicated and perceived in couples. It is difficult to draw a synthesis from the data available in the literature, as methodologies have been diverse and vary between studies. For example, Gerits (2000) found contradictory findings between studies using different assessment methods in the domain of breast cancer. He reported that studies using questionnaires did not find a link between coping strategies in women and disease outcomes, while studies measuring these variables by interviewing the women did find significant links between these variables."
10,282,0.986,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The levels and scales dimension has a supportive extent, as all governance levels ranging from the local level to the EU level are relevant. However, the regional level is the most prominent, since the irrigation policy is binding for the ï¬ve water authorities in the Rhine-East subbasin. At the national level, the displacement chain, which is explained in Sect. 8.3, is implemented to balance the water supply and demand in cases of extreme water shortages. Interactions between different levels also occur for the implementation of relevant EU policies such as the Water Framework Directive and the Birds and Habitats Directives. The national level plays an enforcing role regarding the implementation of these policies. For instance, the Birds and Habitats Directives have requirements on the nature areas that are designated as Natura 2000 sites. The areas where the water level will be higher are identiï¬ed in the provincial plan. Similarly, the measures that the provinces take for the nature sites are deï¬ned at the national level. The extent is also supportive in terms of actors and networks. Many actors are involved in the decision-making processes, mainly including the province of Overijssel, the ï¬ve water authorities, the LTO, the NMO and Vitens, the monopolistic drinking water company. Regarding groundwater management, the province and Vitens assume a role at the regional level. The province oversees the use and protection of groundwater by controlling the water authorities and issuing permits, whereas Vitens is interested in the influence on groundwater abstraction. Regarding problem perceptions and goal ambitions, the extent is neutral. Many actors adopt a supply-oriented approach to water, implying that their major goal is providing the right amount and quality of water to all users. The focus on supply has been shifting since other interests became important in the past few decades. It was realized that the amount of freshwater is limited and climate change is exacerbating this issue. Drought is becoming a problem to tackle for the agricultural sector, although in many areas flood protection is still the major goal. Additionally, drought is a relatively new issue and hard to explain to the general public, although 1/3 of the country is similar to the land in the eastern Netherlands, which has dry sandy soils that are prone to drought. Farmers are affected by dry lands but do not consider this to be as important an issue in terms of âprotecting their investmentsâ that should be taken over by the water authorities through longer term and larger scale investments. Several strategies and instruments are in place to deal with water scarcity and drought, indicating a high degree of extent. ZON is the ï¬rst strategy that addresses the water problems of the East-Netherlands. It involves various measures such as using long-term climate data to demonstrate changes and engaging the relevant actors at multiple levels. The irrigation regulation is the major instrument regarding water use in irrigation. One aspect of the irrigation policy that is lacking in extent is that it only applies to new wells and not existing ones. For surface water management at the national level, the displacement chain is implemented. In terms of priorities, agriculture is the ï¬rst sector that the water use is restricted through âirrigation bansâ, which are decided upon by the water authorities, whereas"
151,285,0.986,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"Mammals are far less sensitive than birds to acute exposures of chlorpyrifos (see review in Solomon et al. 2001). In addition, mammals are less exposed to granular CPY because they do not consume grit to aid digestion as do birds (Solomon et al. 2001). Therefore, risks due to exposure to CPY are likely to be greater for birds than for mammals. We did not conduct a refined risk assessment for mammals because any mitigations stemming from the avian risk assessment should also be protective of mammals foraging in treated fields. This assessment builds upon past assessments of CPY, including the most recent EPA re-registration assessment (USEPA 1999) and a refined risk assessment to birds by Solomon et al. (2001). Using a conservative, screening-level risk assessment approach, the USEPA (1999) concluded that single and multiple applications of CPY potentially pose risks to birds. However, a more refined assessment of exposure based on simulations and analyses of field studies and incident reports demonstrated that the risks of exposure to flowable and granular CPY were small (Solomon et al. 2001). Solomon et al. (2001) used a probabilistic individual-based model to predict mortality for eight focal species exposed to flowable and granular CPY in corn. The model predicted that the eight focal species would not experience any mortality. Since the completion of the assessments by USEPA (1999) and Solomon et al. (2001), the labels have been amended to require buffer zones, reduce single and seasonal application rates, reduce the number of applications per season, and increase the minimum re-treatment intervals (USEPA 2009). In addition, EPA is preparing a new assessment of risk of flowable and granular formulations of CPY to birds that will make use of their standard screening-level risk assessment approach (USEPA 2008a). An initial draft of the reassessment by EPA was to be released for public comment in the latter part of 2013 (USEPA 2009). A refined assessment of risks posed by labeled uses of CPY in agriculture in the USA was conducted to reflect changes made to the label and the availability of new information and methods for conducting exposure assessments of birds to insecticides. We initiated the preparation of this assessment by carefully formulating the problem to be addressed. Such problem formulation establishes the scope of the assessment, including defining the routes of exposure to be considered, focal species of birds and patterns of use. The problem formulation concludes with an analysis plan. Subsequent sections describe the methods and assumptions for assessing exposure and effects and characterization of risks. This paper is part of a series that describes the properties and environmental chemodynamics (Solomon et al. 2014), long-range atmospheric transport (Mackay et al. 2014), concentrations in aquatic environments (Williams et al. 2014), risks to aquatic organisms (Giddings et al. 2013), and risks to pollinators (Cutler et al. 2014) of CPY."
347,291,0.986,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"how to safely perform ballast water exchange before entering the Baltic Sea, as well as provide guidance on how to perform risk assessments and monitoring. Various research projects and databases have been initiated at the European and Baltic Sea level to compile inventories of IAS, as well as identify species and shipping practices connected with particularly high levels of environmental risks (HELCOM 2014; Smolarz et al. 2016). Hence, both management and assessment activities linked to IAS risks in the Baltic Sea are, despite some recent progress, still in need of further development, particularly in order to reach the ambitious objective set by HELCOM in the 2007 Baltic Sea Action Plan of no introduction of IAS from ships. For example, observations of new IAS often still build on incidental reporting, since targeted and coordinated monitoring is often lacking in high-risk areas. In a wider perspective, it has also been argued that management and science support needs to be improved for ânon-shippingâ sources of IAS such as aquaculture and that interdependence with other environmental issues such as fisheries, human-induced climate change and eutrophication need to be considered in risk assessments (Smolarz et al. 2016). Wide stakeholder involvement at the science-policy interface is lacking in the case of IAS. For most stakeholders and the general public, this seems to be due to a widespread lack of interest in the IAS issue and its management, which are seen as rather uncontroversial and straightforward. In contrast, stakeholders associated with the shipping and cargo sector have shown a strong interest in contributing knowledge and opinions as part of negotiations on development and implementation of regulations (Lemke et al. 2010). Negotiations leading up to the 2004 opening of the BWM Convention have been described by IMO as âcomplexâ. The subsequent rather long ratification process seems to have been influenced by discussions on, for example, technical possibilities and costs of ballast water management. It therefore remains to be seen whether or not these sector-based discussions will improve efficiency and effectiveness of IAS-related management in the Baltic Sea."
222,295,0.986,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Long-term upward trends in literacy rates have continued, with education levels much improved on their 2014 levels. Income levels are affected positively by a downturn in the importance of intermediaries in production processes, driven in part by rapid developments in mobile information technology and communications, price transparency and market access. Household storage of food has also increased, alleviating periods of scarcity somewhat. As a proportion of income, food is cheaper than it was in previous decades, with better eating habits and protein intake. However, this is offset by a slight increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases and conditions, such as hypertension, with vector-borne (and zoonotic) diseases also rising, mainly as a result of rising temperatures and climatic conditions. Increased household income coupled with continuing problems with significant disparities in income has resulted in a drop in inter-household equity, although this is complicated by broad advances in the participation of marginalised groups in society. Community power structures of patronage still govern much of rural society, but increasing involvement of the private sector and of Non-Governmental Orgaisations (NGOs) in local economic activities is changing the dynamic. Progress in the availability of mobile communications has enhanced awareness of legal rights and obligations, and improved access to information to a great degree. Enforcement of these rights has improved slightly, in line with some advancements in local enforcement capacity (through better local government empowerment), though these are somewhat restricted by a lack of progress in the capacity of local courts to process claims. This is highlighted by the disturbing lack of progress in tackling dakoits, which continues to blight the lives and economies of those who rely on fishing in particular."
35,289,0.986,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"stakeholderâs sectorâ (Tiller et al. 2013). During the workshop the participants nominated Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) as an additional driver. They even coined it a âsuperâ driver, and felt it necessary as a pre-condition for the discussion as a whole. The exercise Tiller et al. (2013) conducted was thus to explicitly identify what attitudes and risk perceptions stakeholders have for offshore aquaculture. The concrete risks or effects they identiï¬ed were, among others, related to loss of income, to extra costs incurring due to loss of gear, and to being excluded from the ï¬shing grounds. All the effects they considered ï¬t in the social typology category of Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests. Forster (2008) sets out to tackle some broader issues related to offshore aquaculture, including how the potential of offshore aquaculture ï¬t into the bigger picture of global food supply, how the assessed long term potential of offshore aquaculture may be important in evaluating current efforts to get it developed, and how offshore aquaculture should be judged in comparison to other methods of food production.2 He looked into the anticipated future need and demand for food and hence seafood, but also into other ways of making more productive use of the sea, including for energy production and animal feed. He further discussed some of the criteria to assess the sustainability of offshore aquaculture, as well as some of the major substantial issues. Thus, his deliberations point out to the typology item Effects on the wider economic and innovation system. Lastly, a recent study by Ferreira et al. (2014) in southern Portugal investigated interactions between inshore and offshore clam aquaculture through a modelling framework. This enabled them to consider production volumes in the two contrasting aquaculture settings, as well as the environmental effects and disease interactions between them. They could show that whilst the inshore aquaculture activity targets clams of high value, a substantial part of the primary production which is food for the clams originates from the offshore. The offshore area has one of the worldâs ï¬rst offshore aquaculture parks, 3.6 nm from the coast. The park has 60 leases for aquaculture production, 70% for ï¬nï¬sh cage culture and 30% for bivalve longline culture, covers 15 km2 and is at 30â60 m depth. Ferreira et al. (2014) found that the bivalve offshore production has caused a decrease of clam yields inshore. While this is replaced by the yields offshore, it is a source of stakeholder conflict. The authorsâ modelling of potential disease spread between the offshore and inshore systems made it possible to develop a risk exposure map. The authors argue that such quantitative models of interactions, including reduced yields for inshore stakeholder, demonstrate a need for âstrong governance to offset disease risksâ, and they stress âthe need to go beyond the conventional spatial planning toolset in order to ensure an ecosystem approach to aquaculture.â These ï¬ndings ï¬t into the social typology categories of Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution; Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests."
36,556,0.986,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Dependence on plant materials has also led to a long history of interactions between these bats and humans, particularly at shared food resources. Flying foxes with striped faces are depicted in aboriginal cave paintings in Kimberley, Australia, attributed to the Bradshaw people, between 17,000 and 60,000 years ago. Whether they brought such stripe-faced bats to the area or idolised the bat pollinator of a favoured tree, the baobab, in their drawings, is unknown. Genetic studies showed that baobab seeds were brought on their journey from Ethiopia to Australia, as an important provider of food, nutrients and building materials. This ancient rock art may be the first human recognition of the ecosystem services of pteropodids (Richards et al. 2012). Despite the documented benefits of bats, negative attitudes towards them persist among the general public (Marshall 1983; Fujita and Tuttle 1991; Kunz et al. 2011). Pteropodid bats, in particular flying foxes, are frequently shot, persecuted and even legally culled as agricultural pests (Bumrungsri et al. 2009; Epstein et al. 2009). In Thailand, for example, farmers of durian (Durio zibethinus) set nets to catch the dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) visiting their trees when in flower and leave the bats to die, because they see that flowers fall after bat visits and conclude that bats have destroyed them (S. Bumrungsri, unpublished). In fact, the flowers fall naturally after the bats have pollinated them, but unhelpful misconceptions such as this exacerbate the conflict between bats and humans. In addition, pteropodid bats are hunted intensively for food and medicinal uses (including commercial trade), leading to severe declines throughout their range (Epstein et al. 2009; Mickleburgh et al. 2009; Harrison et al. 2011). Estimates based on current deforestation rates in Southeast Asia project that many pteropodids may become globally extinct by the end of this century (Lane et al. 2006), with flying foxes being of particular concern in Southeast Asia due to intense hunting pressure (Struebig et al. 2007; Meyer et al. in press). The Old World Fruit Bat Action Plan (Mickleburgh et al. 1992) helped stimulate research on pteropodids but is now out of date and is being revised. The conservation status of these bats has worsened since the plan was published, and a quarter of all species are now endangered (IUCN 2014). Here, we review the current state of knowledge regarding humanâpteropodid interactions by geographic region, legal policies affecting pteropodid bats, and methods of mitigating the damage they cause to fruit crops."

Hoffman and Toan (2015), in a review of reviews, identified 59 systematic reviews covering 1150 primary studies of the likely population impact of measures that are part of the Framework Convention of Tobacco Control (FCTC). Evidence was most robust for the effect of smoking bans (they improve population health outcomes through reduced exposure to tobacco smoke, and reduced smoking) and raising tobacco prices (they decrease cigarette consumption, stimulate smoking cessation, and lower population smoking rates). Increasing the price of tobacco was by far the most effective policy instrument to reduce tobacco consumption (Chaloupka, Straif, & Leon, 2011; Chaloupka, Yurekli, & Fong, 2012; IARC, 2011). Positive results were also found for health warnings on cigarette packs and mass media campaigns, which are most effective as part of larger multicomponent programmes (Hoffman & Toan, 2015). Far more studies have been done on the effects of anti-tobacco media campaigns than on any other healthrelated topic, so that the evidence base is exceptionally strong (Wakefield, Loken, & Hornik, 2010). The US National Cancer Institute made an extensive review of the scientific literature and identified no less than 25 controlled field experiments with youth media campaigns, 40 with adult targeted campaigns, and 57 population-based state/national mass media campaigns (National Cancer Institute, 2008).

370,114,0.986,Investigating the Body in the Victorian Asylum,"as something close to the natural sciences, investigating the links between body and mind was a complex and ongoing exercise that was dictated by the barriers of the living body and reliant upon technologies and methods that could make those invisible processes visible and quantiï¬able. The outward signs of inner degenerative processes were actively elicited (or âsurfacedâ) by asylum doctors and as such, we might construe many of the tests described in this chapter as intrusive methods concerned less with therapeutics than with furthering the march of alienist science. Their employment, though, was directly connected to the belief of many asylum doctors that general paralysis offered a model of mental disease thatâif its mysteries could be solvedâheld out the hope of curing not just that condition, but a whole range of mental diseases. Yet many of the methods taken from physiologyâhowever controlled the circumstances in which they were employedâwere complicated in the asylum environment: a number of general paralytic patients either refused, or were physically unable, to cooperate with tests, and even when they did doctors were hesitant to take their responses as wholly accurate. One thing was certain, though: general paralysis was a disease that had a serious impact on the bodily fabric. The softening and atrophy of the muscles of the limbs, heart muscle, and even the cells made clear that doctors were dealing with a disease that required serious scientiï¬c and clinical attentionâboth to reduce its incidence and to ensure that those patients under their care"
231,1480,0.986,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The largest climate change impacts in the coastal zone result from extreme events which have a low probability of occurrence within a given time interval. The concept of risk, deï¬ned as the product of probability of occurrence and resulting damage, provides an objective measure for the need to adapt to such impacts. By evaluating what damage is avoided at what costs, informed choices can be made among different adaptation strategies. Coastal adaptation strategies of the North Sea countries are increasingly based on risk management considerations. Uncertainty in the probability of occurrence and uncertainty in the extent of damage can be incorporated in risk estimationâfor instance, by deï¬ning probability distributions for all variables and using a Monte Carlo method. The application of the risk concept in adaptation strategies is limited, however, by the difï¬culty of quantifying uncertainty in the probability of occurrence and by the more fundamental difï¬culty of predicting possible damage caused by rare extreme events. A further complication arises when a choice has to be made among different possible adaptation measures: which temporal and spatial scales must be considered when these measures are evaluated through ranking methods such as cost-beneï¬t, cost-effectiveness or multi-criteria analyses? This choice strongly influences the results. This complication is enhanced by uncertainty about the future in general. How are present values affected by other future global or local change, in addition to climate change? The combination of these different sources of uncertainty is sometimes termed âdeep uncertaintyâ. Scenarios provide a way to deal with limitations related to quantifying uncertainty (the probability that some damage will occur) and to quantifying possible damage (loss of certain values). Scenarios describe different futures that can be imagined. These scenarios should be internally consistent, but need not necessarily be expressed in terms of probability and money. Their main function is to open those who are involved in climate adaptation to the wide spectrum of situations and adaptation options that should be considered. Scenarios help in avoiding suboptimal sector approaches and a unilateral focus on certain adaptation options, which are major shortcomings of present coastal adaptation strategies"

At the economic level, the quantification of impacts reveals that investments are very profitable, 37â107% for the zaÃ¯, 23% for the stony ropes and 145% for the half-moons. There is therefore no doubt about the positive effects of SWC techniques, which are in the majority of cases supported by public investment projects or programs.

260,266,0.986,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"It is evident from the studies described here that anti-ranaviral immunity is multifaceted, complex, and likely species- and developmental stage-specific. Also evident are the many gaps in our understanding of the immune response to these pathogens as well as possible defects in the hostâs ability to mount effective responses that contain and eliminate these infections. It is particularly worrisome that Ranavirus and other genera within the family Iridoviridae have devised numerous, highly efficient strategies for evading, and even utilizing host immune components, to achieve persistence, facilitate dissemination and expand host range. Clearly, ranaviruses encode a large number of putative gene products, which represent both potential virulence factors as well as promising targets for future therapeutic interventions. While it is easy to dismiss lower vertebrate immune systems as functionally analogous to those of mammals, there is a growing literature suggesting otherwise. It is through the fundamental understanding of the physiological and ecological pressures governing these unique immune systems that we may begin to comprehend ranavirus infection strategies and the immune systems that may, or may not have adequately co-evolved to stop them. The investigation of ranavirus infection and immune subversion strategies should be approached not only by taking into account well-defined mammalian pathogens, but also by considering the possibility that ranaviruses may represent unique viral agents. In contrast to the majority of homeothermic vertebrate pathogens, ranaviruses are extraordinary in their ability to overcome cell and host tropism barriers, while their mechanisms of pathogenicity appear to be (at least partially) much less dependent on viral loads. Indeed, the immune systems of ectothermic hosts have evolved as the result of, and are subject to, different physiological and pathogenic pressures than those that have shaped the mammalian immune system. It stands to reason that ranavirus pathogens have co-evolved with these unique immune systems, thus we must garner greater insights into both to fully understand either.

It has become apparent during the last decades that SEP events pose important challenges for modern society. Due to their unpredictability, specifically for those that reach relativistic velocities (high energies) and peak values in very short time scales, they are of concern. SEPs ranging from protons to heavy ions up to iron have been found to have impacts on space systems (s/c, instruments, electronic components, solar arrays, : : : ), avionics and living organisms (e.g. Feynman and Gabriel 2000; Jiggens et al. 2014). It has even been suggested that systems with very high safety and reliability requirements (e.g. in the nuclear power industry) may need to take account of superstorm ground level radiation on microelectronic devices within the system. In the case of nuclear power a Carrington event may not be a sufficient case since relevant timescales for risk assessment may be as long as 10,000 years. (Paul Cannon (Cannon et al. 2013))"
165,258,0.986,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"Values of S and D can and sometimes do disagree. When the differences are large, the discrepancy will always be in a particular direction; D will be high and S will be low. This outcome is rich with sociological implications but its occurrence is rarely discussed. The example introduced earlier in which I contrasted median scores for White-Black segregation with White-Asian segregation illustrated this point. D was high for both group comparisons with scores of 72.1 and 64.6, respectively. In contrast, S for White-Black segregation (46.4) was more than three times higher than S for White-Asian segregation (13.2). This result suggests something potentially important about the difference between White-Black segregation and White-Asian segregation. It is that consistently high levels of displacement from even distribution are evident in both comparisons, but group separation and residential polarization are present only in White-Black segregation. Uneven distribution for White-Asian segregation does not involve group separation and residential polarization. Instead, Asian displacement from parity on area proportion White (p) involves dispersed displacement with quantitatively small departures from parity. Consequently, Asians live alongside Whites and experience similar residential outcomes. Blacks experience similar extensiveness of displacement from parity on area proportion White (p), but the departures from parity are much larger quantitatively and as a result Blacks do not live alongside Whites and do not experience similar residential outcomes with regard to area proportion White (and presumably also with area"

Only a few countries such as Denmark, Norway, France, Germany, Austria and the USA have estimates on the impact on learners and their subsequent capacities to gain employment and continue into formal learning.

165,427,0.986,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"In this chapter I pointed out that empirical studies of residential segregation are strongly influenced by concerns about index bias. These concerns are reflected in the study designs researchers adopt and in the methods of statistical analyses researchers use. One important consequence of this is that researchers carefully avoid studying segregation in situations where they suspect bias will render scores of standard versions of indices of uneven distribution untrustworthy. Accordingly, they avoid studying group comparisons involving small groups; they avoid studying group comparisons where groups are imbalanced in size; they avoid measuring segregation using smaller spatial units such as census blocks; and they avoid examining segregation in smaller communities. Even after adopting these restrictions on study design, researchers continue to have concerns that bias makes some index scores untrustworthy. Analysis reviewed in the chapter shows their concern is well justified. Motivated by these concerns researchers routinely weight cases differentially based on minority population size when performing statistical analyses on the assumption that this will minimize the impact cases with scores inflated by bias will have on results. In a very real sense this has the practical effect of reducing the sample size even further and skewing it toward a non-random subset of cases. Taken collectively, these several practices limit the scope of segregation studies so attention is focused disproportionately on patterns of segregation for large metropolitan areas with minority populations that are large in absolute and relative terms. And even among this subset of cases, results of statistical analyses disproportionately reflect segregation patterns for cities with larger minority populations. The adoption of these practices is well intentioned. But the current state of affairs is far from ideal. As things currently stand, even after restricting study designs to avoid problematic cases, researchers remain less than confident about scores for the individual cases in their studies and routinely weight cases differentially when performing statistical analysis to minimize the impact of index bias. This concern complicates elementary tasks in segregation analysis such as being confident about the index score for a given case, or comparing scores for two cases, or following the score for a single case over time. More importantly, concern about index bias leads researchers away from investigating segregation in a wide range of situations that would be theoretically relevant and sociologically interesting if index scores could be trusted. The better alternative is to deal with problem of index bias directly at the point of measurement. Previous suggestions for accomplishing this task have involved applying after the fact adjustments to standard versions of index scores. These âbias adjustedâ indices have never gained wide usage. In part this is because they have involved complex and often computationally demanding procedures. In addition many researchers find the resulting measures to be unfamiliar and therefore more difficult to interpret and explain to nontechnical audiences. Finally, researchers simply have not yet been convinced that the approach of applying corrective adjustments"

114,246,0.986,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"The Nature of Risk in Primary Care Doctors in primary care work together to present and solve problems in short consultations, typically 7â16 min across Europe. Patients often (but not invariably) present with early manifestations of illness, often against a backgrounds of preexisting psychosocial problems and physical co-morbidities. Diagnosis in such circumstances is necessarily provisional and general practitioners face an enormously difficult task in identifying the few cases of serious illness amongst the very large number of minor problems. To be âsafeâ in this context, in the sense of being certain that a patient does not have a serious illness, is not feasible. To investigate every problem to achieve diagnostic certainty would not be good practice; the anxiety generated, the risks of investigation and tests and the inconvenience to patients would be counter-productive. In addition any healthcare system would be bankrupt within months. Given this equation, time is often used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool, but always with considerable latitude. Patients in primary care are much freer than in any hospital system. They may decide not to comply with their nurse or doctorâs recommendations because they conflict with personal aims or lifestyle; this is typically the case of 30â50 % of patients (Barber 2002). Patients in primary care, because of their greater autonomy, may increase the risks of adverse events in some circumstances which poses many difficult ethical and medico-legal issues (Buetow et al. 2009). Until recently many general practitioners worked alone or in small groups. This model of practice, often combined with a very high workload, made it difficult to see risk at a system level or consider broad risk management strategies. General practitioners and other primary care staff may have high personal standards of care without being aware of the frequency or impact of any errors or the vulnerabilities and risks to patients in the wider system of care (Jacobson et al. 2003). The flexibility, diversity and personal approach for every patient that primary care clinicians rightly regard as a strength make it very challenging to define error and adverse events in a reasonable and consistent manner."

The functional difficulty trajectories of individuals are significantly associated with different levels of wellbeing. Persons with persistent functional difficulties are worse off than persons with functional difficulties in one or no period. Women with persistent difficulties and older persons with persistent difficulties are the most deprived groups. New functional difficulties lower the odds to continue working and no longer reporting any difficulty increases the odds of returning to work. Functional difficulties are also associated with mortality in the short-term.

The chances of therapeutic outcomes for the research participants are almost always zero. In this context, the risk of exploitation of low- and middle-income country (LMIC) participants is particularly high, as, due to low education levels, they are more likely to assume that they will beneï¬t personally. For this reason, phase I clinical studies have previously been carried out only in high-income countries. However, they are now increasingly also carried out in LMICs, especially in accordance with community engagement procedures and where the expected outcomes of the study mostly or exclusively beneï¬t LMICs. The same applies, with limitations, to phase II clinical trials, whose main purpose is to assess efï¬cacy. In phase I/II clinical trials in LMICs, it is therefore particularly important to protect research participants."

364,309,0.986,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"This chapter introduced some examples of environmental pollution and associated countermeasures in Japan. Successful pollution reductions are often achieved by in-process technological innovation and efforts, not by wastewater or flue gas treatment. In-process pollution reductions are referred to as âcleaner production,â and are often much more economical than end-of-pipe treatment. In addition, wise water use, such as recycling and counter flow washing, contributes to raising the concentration of pollutants in the water and making treatment more efficient. Perhaps the key lesson to be drawn from the Japanese experience, however, is that governmental regulation and guidance should be introduced carefully and adaptively.

376,840,0.986,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Rangeland systems have coped or adapted to a wide range of past extreme events, lowering the risk of these events in the future. Risk is quantified as the product of the probability of occurrence of hazardous events and the impact of these events. Climate change could increase the risk of loss of rangeland ecosystem functions such as regeneration and recovery, soil development, and nutrient cycling, and the risk of loss of biodiversity including domestic as well as native plants and animal species. Climate change, coincident with resource management, could increase the risk of degradation or desertification. Future extreme weather events could enhance the risk of loss of infrastructure (buildings, fences, equipment, water systems), enterprise assets (livestock including genetic stock, resource productivity through soil erosion and degradation), and social networks (transportation, informational, and financial). While many risks can be identified, the challenge is to identify those risks that are most important to the sustainability of the socio-ecological system in the future. Key risks to rangelands are those that portend potentially adverse consequences for humans and social-ecological systems resulting from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability of societies and systems exposed. Identifying these types of climate-related risks involves framing the risk as resulting from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard (Fig. 15.4). Risks in this climate-related context are considered âkeyâ due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. In this framework, emergent risks, not previously considered, can arise from indirect impacts of climate change. For example, encouraging the production of bioenergy crops may decrease food security by reducing the land area producing food crops. The following are identified as key risks (Oppenheimer et al. 2014): risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings; risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semiarid regions; and risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for human livelihoods. Risk perception influences human behavior. Risk perception of owners and managers of rangeland systems builds from past management of drought, wildfire, and extreme heat; however, social considerations, rather than physical vulnerability to climate change (e.g., availability of water), are known to determine managersâ perception of the risk of climate change (Marx et al. 2007; Moser and Ekstrom 2010;"

326,960,0.986,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","Autonomous vehicles (AVs) hold the promise of saving tens of thousands of lives each year in the U.S., and many more worldwide, reducing traffic, saving energy, and providing mobility to those who cannot drive conventional cars. Nonetheless, AVs will inevitably have some accidents. On balance, AVs are likely to prevent many more accidents than they cause, but there will be at least some accidents involving AVs that would not have occurred with conventional vehicles. Because of accidents involving AVs, some of which may be catastrophic, product liability litigation1 is inevitable, especially in cases where conventional vehicles would not have crashed. The threat of massive product liability litigation involving AVs is widely perceived as one of the chief obstacles to AV development and sales, if not the number one threat [3].2 Some believe that product liability suits may be an existential threat to autonomous driving [33].3 Crippling suits could force manufacturers to exit the market and may deter some manufacturers from entering the market because of a belief that the sales are not worth the risk. If these dire predictions come to pass, the U.S. and other parts of the world experiencing a flood of lawsuits may lose the use of a technology that would save many times more lives than it would endanger. If, however, the industry finds effective ways to manage the risk of product liability, it can bring to market a lifesaving technology while maintaining practices to minimize accidents and resulting liability, as well as the profitability needed to offer AVs in the market over time. The purpose of this chapter is to identify product liability risks in the U.S. to manufacturers of AVs, the source of those risks, and how manufacturers can manage those risks. A focus on U.S. product liability is important from a worldwide manufacturerâs perspective given the size of the U.S. market and the perception that the U.S. is a litigious country. Product liability is perceived as a greater threat in the U.S. than in any other country of the world. Section 26.2 discusses the circumstances giving rise to U.S. product liability litigation and the phenomenon of some U.S. cases resulting in huge awards to plaintiffs seeking compensation. It explains why these huge awards occur. Section 26.3 analyzes the human and financial impacts of more recent high profile product liability cases. Section 26.4 discusses U.S. product liability law, focusing on the types of claims and defenses arising in product liability cases. Section 26.5 covers design practices and procedures that manufacturers can use to reduce the risk of product liability, the use of 1 This chapter focuses mainly on product liability litigation, although there are also requirements to compel vehicle manufacturers to recall their vehicles to fix defects.

364,150,0.986,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Madagascar is the worldâs fourth largest island, situated in one of the most biodiverse regions on earth. However, large-scale environmental degradation has occurred on the island. From the 1980s onwards, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank advocated structural adjustment programs for most African countries, and these led to the establishment of environmental programs and the formulation of strategies for poverty reduction (World Bank 2002). Implementation of such programs and strategies has implicitly become a criterion of eligibility for debt reduction programs. Thus, in addition to a structural adjustment program including market liberalization and the privatization of state companies, in 1989 Madagascar adopted a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). It was based on a program spread over 15 years with the primary objective of conserving natural resources, and was monitored to ensure sustainable economic development and improved quality of life. Since the implementation of the NEAP and economic policies linked to foreign direct investment, several additional policies and strategies have also been implemented. Yet, despite more than 15 years of environmental programs and nearly USD400 million in financing, Madagascar's problems have never been solved. Indeed, in 1989, policymakers found that the relevant statistical data were inaccurate because of the general lack of tools to precisely assess the situation and the scale of its evolution. To this day Madagascar still has no tools to measure indicators of environmental quality. Agricultural production remains the dominant economic activity, providing one third of GDP and 80 % of foreign exchange earnings. However, because of slash and burn practices, persistent fires, and the resulting reduction in forest cover to protect the vast watershed of Madagascar, erosion is still present in almost all areas. This leads to lower soil fertility, increased costs associated with water and road infrastructure, and damage to marine ecosystems. Sustainable management of natural resources is therefore essential to avoid adverse environmental consequences, including loss of species, landslides, drying up of springs, and silting up of lowlands. Forests play a crucial role in stabilizing the agricultural system as well as the soil, and make an important contribution to reducing environmental risk. Despite the implementation of an environmental program in 1990 and a forest policy in 1997, the forests have continuously deteriorated. They are subject to the combined effects of skimming, which removes many of the species of commercial interest, and slash and burn, which completes the extraction of woody vegetation considered to be of no commercial value (Fig. 7.1). These two causes of forest degradation have never been eradicated because no reform has ever directly addressed the two practices in question. There were proposals to introduce the concept of KoloAla (sustainable production forests) to convert the logging industryâs mode of operation to a tender model (based on inventories of existing timber volume on forestry plots). However, no significant changes have been made so far. Meanwhile, the same slash and burn practices continue on the basis of a government ordinance dating back to 1960 (Ramamonjisoa 2004)."
230,573,0.986,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"14.2 Estimating the Economic Impacts of Marine Litter Measuring the full economic cost of marine litter is complex due to the wide range of economic, social and environmental impacts, the range of sectors impacted by marine litter and the geographic spread of those affected. Some of the impacts are easier to evaluate in economic terms because they are more direct, such as increased marine litter cleaning costs. Others are more complex, for example, the less direct and/or more intangible values such as the impacts of ecosystem deterioration or reductions in quality of life. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal complexity of the impacts related to marine litter result in costs, which may not always be immediate or conspicuous but are nevertheless significant for sustainability (National Research Council 2008). As regards ecosystem degradation, it is useful to differentiate between impacts on biodiversity (species and habitats) and the impact on the ecosystem services flowing from the ecosystem (e.g. provisioning services such as food provision, regulating services such as water and waste purification; and cultural services such as tourism and recreation). As regards economic costs it is important to differentiate between actual economic costs linked to expenditure (e.g. costs of cleanup of beaches; costs associated with damage to or loss of fishing gear or obstruction of motors; eventual cost of hospitalisation from marine debris related health impacts), economic costs of loss of output or revenue (e.g. loss of revenue from fish or loss of income from tourism) and assessment of welfare costs in economic terms (e.g. health impacts from marine debris; assessing the economic value of loss of cultural values such as recreation or landscape aesthetics). While marine litter has become an increasingly important issue in policy discussions, there is only a very sketchy (albeit growing) body of knowledge on the costs of the impacts. Because of a lack of recording even the direct economic costs of marine litter tend not to be measured (Mouat et al. 2010). Furthermore, even though there is a growing interest in ecosystem services (Costanza et al. 1997; MA 2005; TEEB 2010, 2011) little research has been done to date on the economic cost of marine litter on ecosystem service provision.

253,997,0.986,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","in many cases, individual loss is not fully compensable, most strikingly when that loss involves death: Whatever her actual detriment, a person who dies cannot be âmade whole.â And indeed, more than 30,000 people lose their lives on US roadways every year while more than 300 million obtain some direct or indirect beneï¬t from motorized transport. The promise that vehicle automation holds for highway safety raises difï¬cult questions about regulationâs social and individual objectives. Analyzing either objective requires topical and temporal deï¬nition of a manageable system in which costs and beneï¬ts can be identiï¬ed, valued, and compared. With respect to net social good, what is the statistical value of a human life? Is a reduction in organ donations a âcostâ of safer highways? Could aggressive deployment of particular technologies cause a backlash that ultimately undermines safety? Similarly, with respect to individual loss, how should injury or death be valued? Should culpability affect compensation? Who is entitled to it? The particular answers to these questions may depend on the domainâlaw, economics, ethics, the social sciencesâfrom which they are drawn. Vehicle automation exposes tension between the social and individual objectives. Externalities frequently accompany innovation: Inventors impose costs that they need not or cannot bear and create beneï¬ts that they cannot capture. Compensation of incidental injury may be one such cost, and socially desirable innovations like automation might be subsidized by shielding them from it. Calibrating net social good and individual loss can also create moral hazard: Safety might be discounted by innovators who are legally or effectively exempt from rules and immunized from lawsuits or by consumers who are assured of compensation for injury. This tension exists against two related background conditions. The ï¬rst is a preference for the status quoâa tendency that is reflected in administrative law, in tort law, and internationally in the precautionary principle. Many vehicle fatalities appear only in local obituaries, but a single automated vehicle fatality would end up on national front pages. The second is a failure by imperfectly probabilistic humans to accurately perceive risk. Drivers who speed around blind corners but fear traveling over bridges demonstrate this tendency to underestimate some risks and overestimate others. This complex regulatory context leads to two fundamental questions: How should risk be allocated in the face of signiï¬cant uncertaintyâand who should decide? The range of actors includes the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of national and subnational governments, companies, standards organizations, consumers, and the public at large. Regulation can be prospective or retrospective, but it cannot be nonexistent: Administrative agencies that decline to establish safety requirements for automated vehicles merely leave this task to judges and juries after incidents have occurred. The consequences of action or inaction are as stark as they are uncertain. Regulatory acts or omissions could cost lives in the near term by delaying or raising the price of automation technologies [1]. But they could also save lives in the longer term by protecting broad classes of innovation from the potential reputational damage that early tragedies or controversies could inflict.

10,356,0.986,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"This chapter presented a diagnosis on the current state of the governance of drought adaptation in North-west Europe from a cross-cutting perspective on agriculture. The ï¬ndings indicate both several common regional level implications, as well as issue-speciï¬c observations for the local contexts. Despite being a key user of freshwater resources and often sensitive to water availability during drought periods, the agricultural sector receives a lower priority compared to other water user sectors, which mainly include energy production and drinking water. Pressures to monitor water withdrawals and enforce water withdrawal limitations in agriculture can be expected to intensify with increasing demands not only from the agricultural sector, but also by cross-sectoral impacts of other water user sectors. This competitive disadvantage can lead to water efï¬ciency improvements in the sector through, for instance the dissemination of water saving and water reuse technologies. Additionally, the demand for crop insurances could increase as well as the need for further insurance products such as cooperative privateâpublic insurance products. Since agricultural production constitutes an economic sector in many areas of North-west Europe, multiple governance levels, ranging from the local to the EU level, interact regarding the associated water problems, including water scarcity and drought. However, there is a clustering of the local and subnational levels, which predominantly shape the implementation of water- and agriculture-related measures, and the EU-level measures that result from the corresponding water and agricultural policies, i.e. the WFD and the CAP. Although agriculture is a very vulnerable sector regarding the impacts of drought, the essential public and political awareness on drought is limited. The historical context of the North-west Europe region, which is dominated by events of too much water rather than water scarcity and drought, plays a signiï¬cant role in the relatively low awareness regarding the current and future impacts of drought. In the areas that are already affected by drought, especially the regional authorities, such as environmental agencies and water authorities, and the farmers and their organizations carry the greatest potential in terms of improving drought awareness in both public and political spheres."

Today technologies and the development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow us to easily demonstrate simple geographic spatial relationships and to analyze more complex ones. Mapping and GIS were applied here to illustrate spatial dimensions of marginality at continental and regional levels. We hereby sought to make the marginalized and poor more visible by identifying areas where many poor people live under difficult biophysical and socio-economic conditions. A broad set of variables covering ecological, social and economic dimensions were identified for this purpose and we used existing datasets to describe each variable in the first step of our marginality mapping approach. We focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA), where most of the worldâs poor, and in particular the poorest, live (Ahmed et al. 2007; von Braun et al. 2009). The number of extremely poor and hungry people remains unacceptably high. Being excluded from economic growth and other dimensions of societal development are indications of the extreme poor existing at the margins of society, which may trigger a downward spiral into poverty (Gatzweiler et al. 2011). Marginality is frequently cited as a root cause of poverty (von Braun et al. 2009) and is a complex issue that is not amenable to simple solutions or answers. It may be defined as: an involuntary position and condition of an individual or group at the margins of social, political, economic, ecological and biophysical systems, preventing them from access to resources, assets, services, restraining freedom of choice, preventing the development of capabilities, and eventually causing extreme poverty (Gatzweiler et al. 2011, 3)."

180,168,0.986,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"Infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have attuned the attention of policy makers and health practitioners to the importance of protecting and promoting the publicâs health in the face of increased care needs and extreme resource scarcity. In particular, acute care needs for the critically ill and discussions of treatment priorities have been the subject of much debate in pandemic planning (Hick et al. 2007; Melnychuk and Kenny 2006; Uscher-Pines et al. 2006). This is not surprising, as it has been estimated that more than 700,000 Americans may require mechanical ventilation during a pandemic, far outnumbering available ventilators (Rubinson et al. 2010; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2005). Additionally, shortages of hospital beds, personnel, and other equipment can be expected during a pandemic, which may limit the ability to meet an expected increase in patient volume (World Health Organization 2008).

At the same time, the Plastic Pollution Policy Project convened 18 organizations focused on zero waste initiatives to align on policy and campaigns and to create common messaging to counter industry-dominated narratives. A movement has emerged, while stakeholder positions have dug in their heels. Here we have discussed solutions to microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, which largely form in terrestrial environments from primary or secondary microplastics. We know that microplastics are global, increasingly toxic over time, and impacts to wildlife are pervasive, leading to the collective conclusion that plastic in the environment causes harm. We also know that capturing microplastic downstream is extremely difficult and requires upstream intervention."
241,891,0.986,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"This chapter has documented the changes in atmospheric chemical components over the Baltic Sea region, using a mixture of measurements, emissions estimates and modelling. The focus was on the period from around 1900 to 2050, since this period has received the most attention in the literature. The majority of the information concerns sulphur and Nr compounds, as well as O3, since these pollutants have signiï¬cant ecosystem and health impacts. Emissions of sulphur and nitrogen species, and of other ozone precursors such as hydrocarbons, have changed signiï¬cantly over the last 100 years, although very differently for land- and sea-based sources. Land-based emissions generally peaked around 1980â1990 and have since been reduced as a result of emissions control measures. Emissions from shipping have been steadily increasing for decades, but recent measures have reduced sulphur and particulate emissions. Future developments depend strongly on policy developments. In general, the main driver of changes in atmospheric concentration and deposition with time is found to be changes in emissions rather than impacts of meteorological changes. The dramatic increase in emissions after the 1940s, in Europe and North America, resulted in substantial changes in Nr and sulphur deposition and in O3 levels. Reductions in emissions in Europe starting around the 1980s have resulted in signiï¬cant reductions in sulphur and oxidised Nr compounds in the European atmosphere. Emissions of reduced Nr compounds have not declined to the same extent, and indeed in some areas, NH3 emissions are increasing. For the future development of air pollution in Europe, some climate-induced changes are potentially important, however. For example, potential increased shipping activity and new shipping routes within the Arctic may lead to increased nitrogen deposition in environmentally sensitive areas and even to increased phytotoxic ozone uptake. A new understanding is also that higher temperatures may increase NH3 emissions from evaporative sources over land by very substantial amounts (e.g. 20â50 %), a process that is not yet included in NH3 emission inventories. In summary, while it seems likely that air pollution impacts from sulphur and oxidised nitrogen will be substantially reduced in future"
169,18,0.986,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(Kagalou et al. 2012). Gari et al. (2015) conclude that two factors explain the widespread use of DPSIR, especially in the realm of policy-related science: â. . .it structures the indicators with reference to the political objectives related to the environmental problem addressed; and . . . it focuses on supposed causal relationships in a clear way that appeals to policy actors (Smeets and Weterings 1999).â However, the use of DPSIR has been complicated by discrepancies in its application, such as the placement of the same variables in different categories (Gari et al. 2015). As applied by the EEA (2003), the categories of the DPSIR framework are described as follows. Driving forces are created by the patterns of production and consumption that emerge from the intertwined social, demographic, and economic developments of society. These forces of societyâs metabolism drive the pressures that impact SES, e.g., emissions of chemical, physical, and biological substances and agents and shifts in land use and land cover. In response to these pressures, the state of an SES can shift physically (temperature), biologically (ï¬sh stocks), and/or chemically (atmospheric CO2, water column nitrogen). Impacts resulting from shifts in ecosystem state are reï¬ected in diminished functioning of the environment, e.g., lower human or ecosystem health, resource availability, and/or biodiversity. Any or all such impacts can precipitate responses to mitigate or adapt, which can emerge at the level of individuals and groups at different levels of organizations (Gari et al. 2015). Management decisions to hold steady or change course beneï¬t from precise measurements, but such choices grow out of many critical decisions that come beforehand. What should be measured, how, to answer what questions or policy dictates, and whose perspective should be included in the discussion? These are among a plethora of decisions that face river managers. With regard to measurements, who decides how to deï¬ne the space and time dimensions of the reference condition? What is the baseline in time against which one measures change (degradation or progress) in ecosystem properties? For example, radically different conclusions can be drawn from the number of salmon found in 2002 in the Northwestern US Columbia River basin depending on when one sets the baseline. The baselineâs date can inspire optimism (200% increase since 1930) or pessimism (90% decline since 1866) (Olson 2002). To shape sound research as well as policy, management must account for the false optimism inherent in such a shifting baseline syndrome (Pauly 1995), which can be reversed if management can integrate ecological restoration within the larger social context, restoring habitat connectivity, local ï¬sh populations, as well as local ï¬sheries (McClenachan et al. 2015). Constructive and effective engagement with these questions can help build a comprehensive overview and a ï¬exible approach that managers need to deal with uncertainty. However, the global decline of river socio-ecosystems reï¬ects a history of management that did not meet these challenges but defaulted to convention and tradition based on previous knowledge and historical relationships. Historically, river management regimes have evolved as complex webs of relationships that reinforce each other and create a momentum carrying them down a development path. In this way, a river system advances along a trajectory determined by complex feedbacks of interacting actors, policies, technologies, and concepts (Sendzimir et al. 2007)."
98,186,0.986,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","The previous chapter shows that the TSE organizations and volunteers are a significant economic sector of activity in Europe. In this chapter, we have assessed the available evidence about the contribution of this TSE sector to the socioeconomic development and democratic governance of European societies through systematic reviews of research and new analyses of data. This indicates that the impact of the TSE sector is significant albeit difficult to assess empirically. This is because the activities of organizations and volunteers can have impacts in different social domains and on different levels, from individuals to local communities and society in general, and the research front is less advanced in some of these areas than others are. However, there is no support for unconditional and general claims about the third sectorâs contribution to improvement of health, well-being, innovation, social capital, empowerment or economic development. There is a potential for individual benefits of membership or volunteering in TSOs. However, these positive impacts are not equally accessible or do not spread among the population. Individuals who already have better wellbeing, health and social trust are more likely to be active as members or volunteers in the third sector. Groups and individuals with fewer resources or who are already less advantaged are less likely to become"
214,429,0.986,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"11.3.2 Uncertain Predictions: Where to Be Cautious Precipitation is a classic case where some aspects of the impacts of climate change are well known, and some are much more uncertain. As noted briefly in Chap. 10, as the spatial scale of interest decreases, the large-scale constraints fall away, and potential model structural errors start to become larger.9 While models agree on the sign and even some of the magnitude of global trends, they do not agree on the magnitude (even the magnitude of global changes), and particularly on what happens in different regions. These projections are less certain, or âas likely as notâ in IPCC language from Table 11.1. For temperature and precipitation, the broad regional patterns (wetter tropics, drier subtropics, warming high latitudes) are known, but the details of those patterns are highly uncertain, as is clear from Figs. 11.4 and 11.5. âBroad scaleâ means relying on the global energy budget, and global trends are fairly certain, but other classes of results are less certain. In particular, the magnitude of many of these changes is not well known. While most models predict that the polar regions will warm faster than the rest of the planet (Fig. 11.4), the magnitude and speed of the warming is not well constrained. In addition, along with such warming as we have already seen in the Arctic has come a dramatic reduction in the sea-ice coverage (area).10 This is illustrated in Fig. 11.6a from models. The region in gray is the spread of model simulations of the historical period. Models are pretty good at following the observed decline of the Arctic sea-ice extent, but they do not fully capture the magnitude (steepness) of the trend. Here is a case where projections indicate that in September the Arctic will likely be mostly free of ice by some date in the 21st century; it is mostly a question of when. But that is not to say the models are doing that well. If we look in the Antarctic sea ice (Fig. 11.6b), which is generally more stable than the Arctic sea ice, models are predicting slight declines over the past 30 years, whereas the observations indicate increases in the extent of late summer sea ice. The spread of models is also very large. So while models seem to represent the Arctic well, it is not clear that they represent the Antarctic well. The reasons are complex and likely have to do"

We applied an experimental design that provides a spatial and temporal context to integrate the evaluation of potential impacts of railways and other line infrastructures on wetlands. Our approach surpasses the usual estimators of mortality due to the effect of barrier and evaluates the effects on the spatial and temporal distribution, survival and behaviour. This decision was made due to the nature of this railway and the mitigation measures that were decided a priori to decrease the probability of negative impacts over the aquatic birds that uses the area crossed by this infrastructure. Indeed, the construction of a viaduct over the most critical areas was a decision that decreased land reclamation on the saltpans. On the other hand, this railway was meant from the start to be used for commercial purposes, transporting containers from the harbor to the main national line. The expected trafï¬c and speed of the trains was thus limited and conditioned to speciï¬c daily periods, thus decreasing the barrier effect of this infrastructure and, hopefully, lowered the expected mortality due to collisions with the trains. In fact, during the study period, only two casualties were reported: a common Sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos) and an unidentiï¬ed gull. The main guidelines described in this book pertaining to future studies in railway ecology seem mostly designed to terrestrial environments (and species) and long stretches of continuous railway beds. This study dealt (albeit in a preliminary way) with some of them, namely by (1) studying species with different ecological traits (even if belonging to the same taxonomic group), (2) using an experimental analysis, which includes comparison between a control phase with the period of construction and after, (3) studying the effect of habitat fragmentation (in this case, how the birds responded to the loss/degradation of the impacted saltpans both in the breeding season and in winter, and (4) a preliminary study of the population persistence in the area after the railway construction. In our view, the most interesting feature of the present study is the integration of several spatial scales, from the macroscale of other case studies (see Chaps. 7 and 11) to the microscale of the habitat. This option was imposed by the nature of the problem itself and allowed us to go beyond the usual evaluation of mortality of adult birds due to collisions (Chap. 7) or the general patterns of disturbance and habitat loss (Chap. 11), and changed the focus of analysis to the impact of disturbance (both on the breeding and wintering birds) and chick mortality at smaller scales (habitat), a feature that is seldom attempted. We have developed a conceptual methodology where the rationale is hypothesis-based and uses a Before-After-Control-Impact comparative approach (as advised in the guidelines of Chap. 19). We think that it can be easily extended to the same or other aquatic bird species and habitats affected by railways in the wetland areas, enabling a multi-scale habitat analysis that can be combined with the usual broad scope procedures. Although the method has the potential to be improved and reï¬ned, we feel that it represents an add-on to the arsenal of methods of analysis in future studies of railway ecology, as those proposed in Chap. 19."
98,162,0.986,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","A review of the literature on TSIs on human resources and community by KamerÄde (2015) reveals the complexity of assessing the impact of the third sector at different levels. Indeed, impacts can be, first, assessed in terms of the consequences of voluntary participation for individuals involved in TSOs. The same literature review (KamerÄde 2015) concludes that evidence from a range of studies in different disciplinary fields suggests that the third sector makes an important impact; however, this impact is not equally accessible or widespread. The presence of TSOs is not an easy or straightforward solution for inequalities in participation and representation, or social integration problems, as their effects again vary between different social groups and types of organizations. This literature review highlights the unequal distribution of positive effects on individuals of participation in TSOs. More specifically, individuals who already have better wellbeing and health, and higher social trust, are more likely to be involved in the third sector, which, in turn, contributes to better health and wellbeing. In addition, individuals and groups who have fewer resources or who are already less advantaged in society are less likely to become involved in voluntary associations to promote their interests, satisfy their needs or make changes in policy favorable to them. Moreover, the effects of voluntary participation are gendered and can vary by age, employment status, income, type of association and type of involvement. In some cases, for particular groups, involvement in voluntary associations can have negative consequences. This review points toward a major methodological issue plaguing TSI studies: many studies rely almost exclusively on analyses of cross-sectional data where volunteering and its hypothesized impact have been measured simultaneously. Although these studies provide valuable empirical evidence that is an important link in a chain of causal reasoning, in many of these studies, the causal relationships often have been assumed rather than demonstratedâin important part, because of the absence of data enabling the use of adequate methods for demonstrating the causal relationships."

In the last 50 years, plastics have become the workhorse material of the global economy and led to enormous progress for modern societies [23]. And that is the dilemma: society benefits from the attributes of plastic products (they are lightweight, inexpensive, and durable), and at the same time, mass production and durability lead to growing amounts of plastic waste accumulating in the environment [21, 26]. Although plastic has been perceived as a pollutant for a long time, and environmental awareness continues to grow, the per capita consumption of packaging is still increasing [27], so that with the increasing accumulation of (micro)plastics, the associated risks are growing."

Are there differences in the way bats use buildings between areas or continents where buildings have been in place for many centuries compared with areas where humans have only built houses recently. 6. Do tropical and subtropical bats also use buildings for extended periods of torpor, similar to hibernation of temperate zone bats? 7. What is the selective benefit for synanthropic bats inhabiting roosts in buildings compared with conspecifics inhabiting natural roosts? Why do some species commonly hibernate in buildings and others do not (see also Rintoul and Brigham 2014)? 8. Do tropical and subtropical bats exhibit similar expansions of geographic ranges when thermal benefits of using buildings as roosts are not the predominant driving benefit? 9. Is it possible to estimate the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by synanthropic bats? 10. To what extent have the geographic ranges of synanthropic bats changed in response to the coinhabitation of buildings? Apart from these basic research questions, we need to engage in larger conservation efforts to protect synanthropic bats in developing countries, taking into account their ecological and economic value. Synanthropic bats face an uncertain future in many temperate countries due to political measures and specific programs to improve building standards, e.g., building modernization in the European Union that involves increased insulation of exterior walls has led to the large-scale eviction of synanthropic bats from buildings. We also see a strong incentive to coordinate conservation efforts to protect populations of synanthropic bats. Bats that live in the same buildings as humans could be ambassadors for the conservation of bats if other successful outcomes are replicated and publicized to a general audience. We conclude that synanthropic bats coinhabiting buildings with humans may provide good opportunities to teach humans in both urban and rural environments about wildlife species, particularly bats.

In addition to these considerations, we are also controlling for the exposure of individuals to specific media discourses building from research that has identified newspaper readership as a factor which shapes attitudes towards each of our three vulnerable groups (Golding and Middleton 1982; Greenslade 2005; Briant et al. 2011). Consistent with this literature, we hypothesise that reading more right-wing and prejudicial newspapers (e.g. tabloids) will likely be associated with lower inclination to solidarity in comparison to progressive newspaper readership. Moreover, building upon the findings of earlier studies that âidentity sharingâ is a factor facilitating solidarity, we also control for direct exposure to vulnerability and hypothesise that those who are more directly exposed to vulnerability through being in one of our vulnerable categories (disabled, unemployed, migrants, or refugees) will likely be more solidaristic than those who are not.

Moreover, trade credit, leasing and factoring are strictly connected to business activities of the companies, and their function of reserve (buffer) during recessions could be limited by a reduction in the trade of goods and services. Taking a look at the elements that determine the financial structure of enterprises, we can observe that with regard to SMEs, during the years of the crisis, profits, interventions on equity and the relationships with the banks all recorded lower values than those of large companies.

165,272,0.986,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"The discussion to this point raises the concern that all aspects of segregation in general and group separation and residential polarization in particular may not always be assessed accurately in studies that investigate segregation involving small groups using tract data. Earlier I suggested a ârule of thumbâ that the size of the smaller group in the analysis should be 3â5 times the size of the areal units used to assess segregation. This informal guideline provides a basis for diagnosing the situation and considering alternative options for research design. I summarize the implications of this guideline for studies using blocks, block groups, and tracts in Fig. 8.5. Note that the guidelines do not focus on relative size per se. That is appropriate because for this issue relative size is not the true source of the problem. The guidelines instead focus instead on group population counts and indicate that to be âsafeâ the population size of both groups in the comparison should be at least 3â5 times the typical population size for the areal unit used. In addition, I have added an even more conservative factor of 10 to 1 and then have listed the associated group size âthresholdsâ for being able to âsafelyâ analysis of displacement from even distribution and group separation and residential polarization when using data for blocks, block groups, and tracts:"
114,213,0.986,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"The Home Environment as Risk Factor The role of design in either degrading or promoting patient safety is increasingly understood. New hospitals may now be built with safety in mind, using good design to reduce equipment problems, assist infection control and reduce errors of all kinds (Reiling 2006). Once we move into the home, this hard won gain in understanding is largely lost. Stressful and potentially hazardous conditions, such as poor lighting, excessive clutter, presence of vermin, and aggressive family members, inadequate or unavailable sharps containers, and lack of readily accessible personal protective equipment, can directly or indirectly greatly increase the risk of adverse events in this population (Gershon et al. 2009, 2012). In some homes performing clean or sterile procedures may be almost impossible. There is also the possibility that home care staff may transmit infections between homes, particularly when patients have been discharged after contacting MRSA or C-difficile. Hand washing provides some protection but cleaning equipment in the home environment is challenging (MacDonald et al. 2011). The Household safety survey checklist (Table 8.1) includes the checking of fire and electrical risks, ergonomic (falls hazards), biological (unsanitary conditions), chemical, and other problems such as noise, temperature, poor security and violence. Additional items address various patient characteristics that influence safety. These include age, sex, health status, ability to walk without help, number of people in the household, daily medication, methods patients use to keep track of medications, presence of any medication in the home that patients no longer take, hearing aid use and the use of durable medical equipment and safety devices."

Insects are a poor source of calcium and several studies have shown that calcium levels in the bones of female bats are lowest during lactation, as calcium is mobilized and transferred to the young in milk (Kwiecinski et al. 1987; Booher and Hood 2010). This led Barclay (1994, 1995) to suggest that shortage of calcium may be a greater constraint on reproduction than meeting its energy demands and that one of the reasons that bats roost in karst caves is that they acquire calcium by licking the walls, which is a common observation (Codd et al. 1999). There has been only one study to test this hypothesis, which was not supported by the evidence, since bats were distributed across all underground sites in a wide range of geological formations and were not concentrated in karst landscapes (Bernard and Davison 1996). Nevertheless, the fact that Adams et al. (2003) captured more female and juvenile bats over water holes with harder water (indicating higher calcium levels) suggests that environmental calcium is important, particularly for reproducing females and their young."

In biomedical terms, dementia is not a disease, but a syndrome produced in large part by diseases such as Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs and vascular disease, to name merely a few (Haeusermann 2017). It is a cluster of symptoms and signs linked to the deterioration of cognitive abilities as a person ages.

This chapter highlights the links between drought governance and the vulnerability of freshwater for drinking water supply, with a focus on drought adaptation. The main issues presented here are illustrated with how freshwater issues are managed in the DROP project cases with a particular focus on the two âfreshwater reservoirâ pilot sites: the Arzal dam in Brittany France (see Chap. 6) and the Eifel-Rur in Germany (see Chap. 4).

In this case, it could be concluded that winter 2009/2010 was a cold winter despite global warming and an exceptionally cold winter given global warming. Identiï¬ed proximate causes of extreme events are often perceived as contradicting a potential human influence. This is generally not the case. An extreme event is by deï¬nition rare and thus will only occur under particular conditions. Therefore, a large fraction of the intensity of an extreme event may be due to internal variability or, equivalently, an extreme event may not occur due to external forcing alone. This gave rise to the widespread public belief that it is not possible to attribute a single event to climate change. External forcing, however, can have a strong influence on the frequency of occurrence of extreme events as events that are exceedingly rare (or common) in the pre-industrial climate may become more (less) frequent due to external forcing. The subtleties and importance of clarity in relation to the question asked in event attribution are illustrated by the case of the Russian heat wave of 2010. Dole et al. (2011) identiï¬ed atmospheric blocking and thus natural internal variability as the main contributor to the intensity of the heat wave. In contrast, Rahmstorf and Coumou (2011) concluded that with a probability of 80 % the Russian heat wave would not have occurred without the recent large-scale warming (most of which is attributable to human influence). The apparent contradiction is resolved by Otto et al. (2012), pointing out that whereas anthropogenic forcing only contributed relatively little to the intensity of the heat wave, it increased the estimated return time of such an event considerably (see Fig. 23.4). In addition to the challenging distinction between the roles of proximate and ultimate causes, attribution of extreme events may be subject to selection bias. This selection bias relates to the fact that it is usually time series with recent extreme events that are studied (see for example Stott et al. 2004 and Coumou and Rahmstorf 2012). Selection biases could be avoided by using operationalised systems that routinely assess the attribution question for a set of pre-speciï¬ed indices. Attribution of extreme events (and climate change in general) to both proximate and ultimate causes is important to improve understanding of the climate system and to enhance predictability of extreme events. The communication of often seemingly contradictory ï¬ndings arising from the two different approaches, however, will remain challenging."

Moreover, various problems might occur and different parameters have to be tested and optimized. This (usually) leads to a vast amount of discrepancy in the recorded performance of the device, which each should be clearly markedâespecially in the early stages of testing.

Ultra-poverty was also highly concentratedâten countries accounted for 75 % of the worldâs total ultra-poor in 2008. In 2008 Nigeria accounted for 23 % of the worldâs ultra-poor. Understanding who the poorest are is crucial for the design of effective interventions to improve their welfare. Without context-specific and timely information, it is difficult to design programs that fit their needs. It is thus important to broaden the collection of and access to accurate data on the worldâs poorest. The evidence presented in this chapter suggests that for interventions to reach those living on less than US$0.63/day effectively, remote households that are traditionally excluded from resources and markets should be targeted, and both the low-levels of education and in the case of Asia, landlessness should be taken into account. Our findings suggest that interventions to protect the poor against health shocks, to address the exclusion of social groups, to prevent child malnutrition, and to enable investmentsâparticularly in educationâare essential for helping them rise out of poverty."
302,201,0.986,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Most of African freshwater bodies are transboundary (see Table 1), and therefore their management requires cooperation and effective, coherent regional environmental policies [58]. However, the management of most African transboundary lakes and rivers ecosystems is largely compromised by conflicting political standings among the riparian countries [59]. A good example of this is Lake Victoria which is shared by Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Its management has been challenging due to a lack of good cooperation and harmonized policies mainly following the collapse of East African Community of 1977. Despite its reformation, there are still country-specific political issues hindering the management of the lake. This is also the case for other African Great Lakes like Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi. However, when policies, conventions, and cooperations do occur, the major focus is often on how natural resources can be shared [60], rather than the control of pollutants. Thus, at an international level, the political will to combat issues like MP pollution is not strong and is equally problematic at the local level. In most African countries, MP pollution is not recognized as emergent issue of concern, although the efforts to levy, reduce, and ban the use of plastic bags [26, 27] would suggest that the plastic issue is not entirely ignored. It is perhaps stereotypical to consider, but in many African nations, the challenges faced are greater than MP pollution â war, famine, literacy rate, infrastructure, clean drinking water, poverty, and corruption [61]. Moreover, most African countries have insufficient budgets from which to plan and execute governmental projects including research activities. A number of countries receive financial aid, and under these circumstances, and understandably, the study of MP pollution is not of the highest priority. Based on this, the current financial challenges of working with MPs in African waters may not be solved by local budgets but rather by bringing together different stakeholders (i.e., local community, local and national governments, NGOs, researchers), in order to first collect data, evaluate steps forward, and implement effective measure to halt MP pollution."

And, finally, predictive tools for the impacts of future environmental variability on these gases are required (Chap. 5). In the chapter we have tried to rationalise the use of units wherever possible. However, different units are used by, for example, the atmospheric and ocean communities, the former often using volume units (e.g. ppt by volume), whereas the latter use mass or molar units (both of which are found widely). So, to avoid confusion, we have not tried to standardise on a common unit for all measurements reported here but have allowed the most common usage to remain. In the case of mass units we have tried to use molar units as much as possible but for instance have allowed mass units for global fluxes, since this is what is routinely done in that community."

On a less positive note, this civilian missionâs legitimacy has been seriously eroded by the cases of corruption among EULEX staff and the criticism of its reluctance to prosecute political and economic elites allegedly involved in organised crime and corruption. In this respect, our research corresponds with several analyses conducted by other scholars (see Chap. 4 for details). Thus, it is no surprise that a signiï¬cant majority of the Kosovar population and local institutions would prefer to see the termination and withdrawal of this mission. Regarding the efï¬cient use of resources needed to achieve the required level of functioning of Kosovoâs customs, police and judiciary, the picture is also not promising. The majority of âlocalsâ and âinternationalsâ believe EULEX has spent signiï¬cantly too many resources (ï¬nancial, human, material etc.) for its relatively modest contribution to the rule of law and sustainable peace. Some authors like Capussela (2015) even claim notwithstanding this enormous investmentâfar bigger than in other countries in the region in which the EU is also engagedâthe improved functioning of these three sectors has been too slow. He adds the EUâs efforts to bolster the rule of law in Kosovo have mostly failed. This is consistent with World Bank (2014) worldwide governance indicators from 2014 showing that Kosovo continues to score lowest in the Western Balkan region for the rule of law.1 With regard to the normativity of EULEXâs approach to Kosovar institutions, it is noted that the target institutions have beneï¬ted from EULEXâs policy, which calls for a balance in the ethnic and gender composition of local law-enforcement institutions. The representation of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities within them reflects the actual composition of society relatively well, with some minor deviations. What remains a challenge is the relatively small number of female police and customs ofï¬cers. Several structural and cultural factors might explain this. Theoretical and policy implications of the research In spite of almost two decades of engagement by the EU and other international actors, Kosovo remains a partly free and semi-consolidated authoritarian regime. This is not something a country that supposedly adheres to the rule of law can be proud of. However, certain progress has been made and should be acknowledged (Freedom House 2016). In addition, Kosovo remains economically one of the least developed countries in Europe, with widespread unemployment and inactivity, especially among women and youth, âwhich leaves an ample amount of human potential unused, misused or underusedâ (UNDP 2016). Hence, when discussing the theoretical and policy implications of this research, one should recall that EULEX is only one, albeit a very robust and resourceful, international actor"
353,69,0.986,"Disability, Health and Human Development","people to report, usually in only one question, if they are limited in their capabilities (opportunities) or functionings (achievements) due to an impairment/health condition. Such an approach has in fact been used in applied disability research under questions on broad activity limitations.1 Many countries have in their general surveys broad activity limitation questions that can be considered as direct measures of limitations in deprivations (in capabilities or functionings) due to impairments or health conditions, as reported directly by respondents. For instance, in South Africa, the General Household Survey had for several years a broad activity limitation question as follows: âIs the person limited in his/her daily activities, at home, at work or at school, because of a long-term physical, sensory, hearing, intellectual, or psychological condition, lasting six months or more?â (Mitra 2008). This direct approach is convenient as it takes little time and space in a survey. It, however, poses two main challenges. A direct approach operationalizes in one variable a mix of concepts (health deprivations and wellbeing) and factors (e.g., the environment) and thus does not allow the researcher to investigate the empirical relations between different concepts of the human development model.2 Moreover, this direct approach does not provide the necessary data to monitor peopleâs lives over time. As an example, let us use a broad activity limitation question related to schooling among children: âis your child limited in the amount or the type of schooling you can have due to a physical, mental or emotional condition?â Such question does identify persons with perceived limited schooling opportunities due to a health condition, so it can be a way to identify children with deprivations due to health conditions. This question does not identify children with health conditions who have been able to access schooling, which is problematic. Using such a question, for example in an environment where education becomes more inclusive through the provision of accommodations in schools, one would get a decline in the prevalence of disability over time but the negative association between schooling attendance and disability would persist and perhaps worsen as people with disabilities would likely include more and more people with the more severe health conditions. This could lead to the misleading result that inclusive education is not working. It is therefore necessary to identify people with impairments or health conditions and the subset who are deprived, which is an indirect measurement."
77,173,0.986,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"CF offers a valuable case for understanding how health inequalities develop. It is an autosomal recessive disease with an asymptomatic (and, until recently, undetectable) carrier state, so unlike many other diseases, SES does not influence who gets CF. SES-related outcome inequalities develop due to the different patterns of exposure to harmful and protective or therapeutic influences over the course of peopleâs lives. Studies from the US and UK show that significant inequalities in key intermediate CF outcomes such as growth and lung function begin early in childhood (Taylor-Robinson et al. 2013a; Schechter et al. 2001; OâConnor et al. 2003) and then persist over time. The early appearance and persistence of inequalities supports the need for interventions that are targeted at the early (and perhaps prenatal) years.

114,117,0.986,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Amalberti and colleagues (2011) have previously argued that we should extent the time frame of analysis to consider an âevent journeyâ (Amalberti et al. 2011). However to examine safety over longer time periods, particularly in community settings, we now believe that we should speak simply of the patient journey. This means looking back through the medical history of the patient in search for all events that have defined the patientâs journey and contributed to the final outcome, whether or not these events have been perceived as serious at the time they occurred and assessing whether the problem was detected and resolved. Most important of all, the event would ideally be examined through the eyes of the patient and family as well as the eyes of the professionals. The selection of the time frame of the analysis depends on the conditions suffered by the patient, the nature of the problems identified and the complexity of the patient journey. Standard episodes of care are easily identified; a hip replacement for instance could cover the period between the initial decision to operate and the completion of the rehabilitation process. Alternatively, depending on the nature of the safety issues identified, one might focus on a particular period such as from the original operation through to rehabilitation at home. The most important development is to begin by examining a period of care rather than a specific incident and its antecedents. Consider three different timeframes to detect and analyse events associated with the occurrence of complications. The shortest timeframe (A) would cover simple problems relating to the direct coupling between a wrong action and the immediate consequence to the patient (such as mistaken identification). A somewhat longer timeframe (B) would cover the events leading up to a medical complications and its subsequent management which might encompass an entire acute care episode from initial admission, to discharge and rehabilitation. The longest timeframe (C) might cover several months leading up to an avoidable hospital admission, the time spent in hospital and subsequent recovery. In-hospital and short-term (30- or 60-day) postdischarge mortality might be used as a starting point to investigate opportunity targets, avoidable mortality, and other indicators for complications. The original ALARM/LONDON protocol proposed that, after the initial care delivery problems were identified, each should be analysed separately to consider the contributory factors (Vincent et al. 2000). In a sequence of problems different sets of contributory factors may be associated with each specific problem. For instance a young nurse or doctor might fail to ask for advice about a deteriorating patient due to inexperience, poor supervision and deficiencies in teamwork; in contrast the same patient might later fail to receive the correct medication, but this might be due to inadequate staffing and poor organisation of care. In practice the full analysis is seldom done and all the contributory factors are considered together as if all were relevant to the single event. However, this more subtle perspective becomes much more important with a longer timescale as a series of problems may be identified which are clearly separated in time and context. Each of these can be separately analysed using the ALARM grid to build up a much more detailed picture of system vulnerabilities. Figure 5.2, describing the causes and response to an adverse drug event, provides an example of the new approach. The example shows the triple value of"
365,537,0.986,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Resilience has been defined in a number of ways in the scientific literature. In ecology, resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to maintain its form and function in response to a shock or disruption (Folke 2006; Nelson et al. 2007). In economic terms, resilience can be defined as the capacity to restore or maintain economic values, such as farm income (Antle et al. 2006; Antle and Capalbo 2010), or to minimize the loss from an adverse disruption or âdisasterâ over the time it takes for a system to return to its ânormalâ state (Hallegate 2014). Resilience to climate change can also be defined more broadly as the capacity to cope with change and minimize losses from change and enhance possible benefits of change, and thus can incorporate longer-term responses through adaptation (Malone 2009). The definition of resilience as the capacity to withstand disruptions refers to the properties of a given systemâs performance, and is most relevant to analysis of relatively short-term events such as a storm or drought where it can be expected that the system will return to its normal state. In contrast, the capability to adapt or respond by making purposeful changes in a system seems most relevant to longer-term permanent changes in climate, and can include adaptations that are designed to improve the capability to withstand shocks or disruptions. Clearly, both concepts of resilience â the ability to minimize the effects of temporary shocks and disruptions, as well as the capacity to cope with the long-term shifts in weather patterns associated with climate change â are relevant to analysis of agricultural system performance. The AgMIP RIA framework illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 can be used to quantify resilience using the various indicators identified above. As noted above, vulnerability is measured as the proportion of farm households that experience a loss over a specified period of time. Loss can be measured in economic terms as reduced income or loss of the capitalized value of income plus assets, and also in noneconomic terms such as reduced health or degraded environmental conditions. To see how resilience can be quantified, define the minimum possible loss for a given system as Lossmin and define the realized loss as Loss. This minimum loss can be measured in various ways depending on the context. For example, it could be the loss that would be incurred if the best coping actions are undertaken as soon as possible and as effectively as possible. A resilience indicator can be calculated as 100 (Lossmin / Loss), similar to what Hallegate (2014) defines as âmicroeconomic resilienceâ. Thus, if a system can achieve the minimum possible loss its resilience is 100%, and otherwise its resilience is less than 100%. This measure of resilience fits the situation where there is a loss, whereas with climate change and other types of change there can be net aggregate gains in some cases, and even when there are losers, there are also likely to be some gainers. To accommodate both gains and losses, we adopt the convention that resilience is 100% for gainers. Letting v be the percent of vulnerable population, the resilience indicator for the population of gainers and losers is then calculated as 100 (1 â v) + v Lossmin / Loss."

For example, change from one hectare of forest to one hectare of cropland could lead to a loss of ecosystem services since the total economic value (TEV) of a forest is usually higher than the value of cropland. We focus on ï¬ve major land use types: cropland, grassland, forest, woodland, shrublands and barren land. We do not include wetlands because of their small extent (5 %). (ii) Using land degrading management practices on a static land use, i.e. land use did not change from the baseline to endline period. Due to lack of data and other constraints, we focus on cropland only. The approach used for cost of land degradation due to LUCC and use of land degrading management practices on static cropland is discussed in detail in Chap. 6. The approach for determining the cost of action for degradation due to LUCC is also discussed in Chap. 6. Analytical methods for cost of land degradation on static grazing are discussed in Chap. 8. For analysis of cost of land degradation due to use of land degrading management practices on static cropland, we focus on four major crops: maize, rice, soybean and wheat, which in total cover about 67 % of cropland Argentina (Table 11.1). Maize, wheat and rice yields have been increasing in most countries despite land degradation. As Fig. 11.2 shows, this is the case for all four crops considered. Use of improved seeds and higher fertilizer application rates account for the yield increase. Nitrogen fertilizer rate increased signiï¬cantly over the past two decades from 12 to 21 kg/ha (FAOSTAT). We also use some case studies to illustrate the cost of land degradation for crops and livestock for selected sites. The analytical methods used for each case study are discussed briefly in the case study section."
198,87,0.986,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"overnight. This takes time; in fact the impact assessment done at the end of the project asked for âadequate timeâ to pass and for a stable situation to be achieved before impact is assessed (Ittyerah et al. 2005, p. xv). And if individual projects need adequate time to have an impact, it follows that market change can only be observed and measured over even longer stretches of time. Longer time lapses are well known in environmental circles and on environmental impact, as HildeÌn (2009) and Rowe (2014, 54â55) have pointed out, but they tend to be less associated with market change. The slow pace of market change is more often observed with impatience, raising the question why no change is happening, which led Wâ¬orlen (2014) in her study of climate mitigation evaluations to reformulate the âtheory of changeâ approach to a âtheory of no change approachâ that focuses on a better understanding of market barriers and how they can be overcome. In general environmental boundaries do not follow jurisdictional boundaries. One ecosystem may spread over several countries, and one country may have several ecosystems. Rowe (2012) asked attention for the fact that location may differ conceptually and practically between a social and economic system that is targeted for change and an ecosystem that is influenced through the same intervention or action. But this is not only an issue of different locations of systems, but also of scope of an intervention: it may be focused on a direct impact in the villages in which it is implemented, while other areas are still outside the scope of the project or have not yet been approached by suppliers, or invited to participate by State or Federal government. It is an issue of scale when impact needs to be observed at several levels: that of energy supply and demand, of greenhouse gas emissions related to energy, of greenhouse gas emissions including deforestation and alternative sources of energy, of livelihood and financial resources issues in the villages, of hilly rural areas in general, and perhaps somewhat more removed, whether greenhouse gas emissions in India are positively influenced by what happens in remote hilly areas. The last does not seem likely, and it may lead to a feeling of disenchantment â if it does not help India, it does not help the world, and it does not stop climate change.3 But that was the reason the project was co-funded by the Global Environment Facility in the first place! Scale is not easily defined. It seems clear that while interventions or actions move from one actor to multiple, from one location to many, from a âlocalâ to a ânationalâ or even âglobalâ level that moving up scales is involved, but scales can also be understood in terms of different dimensions or sectors. Kennedy et al. (2009) recognises jurisdictional and management dimensions as different scales, and Bruyninckx (2009) asks attention for overlap and discrepancies between social, economic, environmental and spatial scales. Yet even though there is no universal agreement on how scales should be defined or what their boundaries are,"
320,485,0.986,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Since 2007, it has been widely accepted that the global climate is warming and that human-induced increases in greenhouse gas emissions are mostly the cause (Kerr 2007). Global warming has been recognised to have profound impact on physical and biological systems. Of particular concern is the effect of global warming on biological diversity. Predictions of extinction have estimated that 20â30 % of species might face increasingly high risk of extinction. However, mechanisms of species persistence could lower the estimated extinction rate, while taking into consideration other human impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, landscape fragmentation or alien species introduction) could account for additional biodiversity loss (Botkin et al. 2007). Invasive species have been recognised as one of the most salient threats to biodiversity. Non-native species occurring in habitats where they were not present before the introduction are termed invaders or alien species. Rapidly increasing problems caused by invasive alien species worldwide demand the effective implementation of various policies aimed at reducing the impact of potentially or currently problematic non-native species (Richardson and PysÌek 2004). To understand changes in biodiversity, we must take into consideration at least the effects of global warming and the possibility that alien species might benefit from them. The future impact of global climate warming will vary from region to region. The most striking variation will involve changes in precipitation, and drought is expected in some areas like the Mediterranean (Kerr 2007). To these changes local species might respond with forced migrations. On the other hand, the alien invasive species already found in the Mediterranean might respond"
98,161,0.986,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","For each of the roles played by TSOs, it is possible to infer a set of expected impacts at the individual, organizational, community and societal levels. Some of these impacts are likely to be distinctive (idiosyncratic) to TSOs, whereas other impacts can be common to those of other types of social actors. For example, if there were no TSE organizations with paid employment in social services funded by the governmentâsuch as institutions for elderly careâthere probably would be public and for-profit providers performing those services. This is not to say that the social impacts of for-profit or government organizations providing the same services would be identical to those resulting from third sector provision, as TSOs, because of their distinctive features, innovate services in numerous fields, serve a more needy clientele, deliver services at a more human scale, stay in the game when government funding declines and so on. Hence, it is possible to differentiate the âmainstreamâ contributions of these organizationsâthat is, what TSOs have in common with governmental and for-profit organizationsâfrom their distinctive contributionsâthat is, the functional features that are more characteristic, if not exclusive, to these organizations. Based on reviews of previous research, these functions and roles can be translated into five domains of impact (Simsa et al. 2014; Enjolras 2015a, b): â¢ Well-being and quality of life â¢ Innovation â¢ Civic engagement, empowerment, advocacy and community building â¢ Economic impacts â¢ Human resources impacts In the following section we will present some evidence of TSI based on analyses and reviews of research conducted by this project (on the basis of available data) related to the impact domains outlined above: civic engagement and advocacy; wellbeing and quality of life; human resources; and social innovation.

255,240,0.986,Railway Ecology,"Introduction Like roads, railroads affect wildlife through direct mortality, habitat loss and habitat fragmentation (van der Grift 1999; Forman et al. 2003; Davenport and Davenport 2006). Direct mortalities result when trains strike wildlife. Strikes can be a signiï¬cant source of mortality for some wildlife populations and have been reported for decades (Child 1983; Gundersen et al. 1998; Bertch and Gibeau 2010a). Studies have reported strike rates for large mammals such as grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) (Bertch and Gibeau 2010a, b) and moose (Alces alces) (Child 1983, 1991; Modafferi 1991). In Canadaâs Rocky Mountain National Parks, train strikes are a leading source of mortality for grizzly bears (0.35 yearâ1) and black bears (1.95 yearâ1), and the second largest source of mortality for deer (Odocoileus spp.), elk (Cervus elaphus) and moose (Bertch and Gibeau 2010a, b) in the Banff and Yoho National Parks. It is likely that true mortality rates due to train strikes are higher than reported. For example, as few as 50% of strikes with large mammals were reported by standard observers (train engineers) along the Canadian Paciï¬c Railroad (CPR) during a six-year period (Wells et al. 1999). In other cases, strikes may not be reported except when large groups (>450) of wildlife are killed (Chaney 2011) or when strikes occur within protected areas (Waller and Servheen 2005). Long-term data of train strikes along the CPR exist because strikes have been reported to Parks Canada for at least 30 years. However, other railroads may not report or record strikes with such consistency. Studies on roads have analyzed the spatial pattern of road-kills, which showed that these occurred in clusters (Finder et al. 1999; Clevenger et al. 2003; Malo et al. 2004). The spatial pattern of road-kills has been explained by landscape, environmental and infrastructure variables (Finder et al. 1999; Hubbard and Danielson 2000; Gunson et al. 2006; Kassar 2005). These studies have helped inform management actions targeted at reducing road-kills (Clevenger et al. 2001; Grilo et al. 2009). At least ï¬ve general factors are thought to affect the spatial pattern of road-kills and train strikes (Seiler and Helldin 2006). Along railroads, these include: animal (e.g., wildlife abundance and behavior); train (e.g., train speed and frequency); railroad design (e.g., curvature or alignment); and landscape (e.g., vegetation type) variables (Huber et al. 1998; Bashore et al. 1985; Finder et al. 1999; Seiler and Helldin 2006). Driver behavior variables are largely removed from train strike analyses because trains generally cannot stop or swerve to avoid animals. Landscape variables derived from land cover data have been found to be the best predictors of road-kill rates (Bashore et al. 1985; Finder et al. 1999; Roger and Ramp 2009). We suggest that estimates of relative abundance be used to assess the spatial pattern of road-kills and train strikes. The importance of including wildlife abundance in the analysis of factors contributing to wildlife strikes was demonstrated for moose: strikes coincided with locations of high moose abundance in wintering areas and on migration routes (Gundersen et al. 1998; Ito et al. 2008). Train variables and railroad design, as well as animal abundance, vary along the CPR and may also affect strike rates. If train or railroad variables altered the probability of a strike, the rate of"

Through its support to one or more of these realms, GEF support aims to bring about conditions and behavior that if broadly adopted can result in transformations in the long run. The framework identifies the following as pathways for broader adoption: sustainability, mainstreaming, replication, upscaling and market change. Depending on the intervention, one or more of these pathways can be at play. Thus while some carbon emission reduction can take place over the short run, emission reduction at scale is assumed to take place gradually over a longer period of time as behavior changes and systems transform. It is also assumed that the extent and trajectory of change is likely to be affected by multiple factors, some of which may have been addressed by the project, while others may not have been envisioned during project preparation and/or addressed through project design. In time, the spread of tested approaches and behavior that reduce environmental stress (carbon emission reductions) result in changes leading to improved environmental status and human wellbeing. This process is assumed to be unpredictable, non-linearand affected by multiple confounding factors, thus requiring constant attention and adaptation to emerging conditions (Zazueta and Garcia 2014). In case of GEF support for climate change mitigation activities the expected long term impact includes reduction in GHG emissions through the transformation of the structure and function of targeted markets (Fig. 9.1). The TOC framework was used to develop theory of change for specific project clusters that were covered in the evaluation. The specific theories relevant to the projects were used in this evaluation to develop instruments that would ensure comparability of the information gathered. Information gathered on the specific contributions of GEF support to conditions (knowledge and information, institutional capacities and effective implementation strategies) to reduce CO2 emissions as well as expected impact pathways, along with information on the rival hypothesis on observed changes, formed a basis to assess GEF contributions to observed changes in the targeted markets."

Being the initiator enables the individual to control the event, which thus may lead to better adaptation after separation (Wang and Amato 2000). The study of Wang and Amato (2000) showed that initiators report a better overall adjustment than non-initiators, however, only short-term effects (on average 16 months after the divorce) were investigated. The relevance of the initiator status has been confirmed by the study of Hewitt and Turrell (2011). Women and men who self-initiated or jointly initiated the separation reported better well-being and mental health than non-initiators. Again, the results refer to short-term effects within 2 years after separation. Another possible and often discussed determinant of psychological adaptation is marital history (e.g. couplesâ perception of marital quality), however its role is controversially discussed in literature. While some studies suggest that persons from low-distress marriages have more difficulties in adapting than those from high-distress ones (Amato and Hohmann-Marriott 2007), other studies could not replicate these findings (Waite et al. 2009). An important aspect of the debate is furthermore whether men and women differ in the process of adaptation to marital dissolution. Do women exhibit more vulnerability than men to impacts of divorce or vice versa? Simon (2002) showed in her longitudinal analyses that women have lower adjustment to divorce with regard to depression (higher depression rates), whereas the benefit of remarriage among persons who were previously divorced or separated was greater for men regarding health behavior (lower alcohol consumption). Menâs and womenâs vulnerability to distress after marital breakup may be shaped by cultural and gender-typical norms for emotional display (Simon 2002). Analyzing data from 16 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, AndreÃ and BrÃ¶ckel (2007) found that women reported significantly higher life satisfaction than men within the first 2 years after the separation. However, Strohschein et al. (2005) did not find any gender differences in the short-term effects of marital breakup. To sum up it can be said that there is empirical evidence that whereas some individuals adapt rapidly to marital breakup, others remain vulnerable over a longer period of time. However it is not clear what exactly accounts for these individual differences. The topic of the large heterogeneity of reactions to loss has been tackled by a major research strand, the trait approach, which focused on personality factors as determinants of psychological adaptation to critical life events. This approach is highlighted in the following section."

These statistics represent the farm population of interest, thus the data to be used are ideally obtained from a statistically representative sample of the population of farms and collected over a long enough period of time (e.g., multiple growing seasons) so that statistical methods can be used to account for seasonal variation and other factors that could affect the observed outcomes. The data can be grouped into the following categories: (i) prices, outputs and costs of production of each production activity; (ii) farm characteristics, including farm size, family size, and non-agricultural income; and (iii) other relevant environmental or social outcomes. The conventional way to obtain the farm production data is to conduct a survey, such as the surveys done periodically by government agencies (e.g., agricultural census or other statistical surveys such as the Agricultural Resource Management Survey in the United States or the Farm Accountancy Data Network data collected in European Community countries). There are limitations to these kinds of data. One is that these data are often collected periodically, e.g., the U.S. agricultural census is carried out on 5-year intervals, and then only made available to researchers with a substantial delay of a year or more. Another major limitation is that these data often lack sufficient detail, particularly for management decisions such as fertilizer and chemical use, machinery use, and agricultural labor. A third limitation is that these surveys can be extremely expensive both for respondents (e.g., to complete large elaborate questionnaires) and for organizations collecting the data (e.g., to employ enumerators, data entry workers, quality control specialists, etc.). A tool like AgBiz Logic could be utilized to provide higher quality, more timely data at lower cost.

It is not therefore surprising that most therapeutic nuclear medicine has developed in these areas as well. Diagnostic nuclear medicine was traditionally performed by nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists but the latter have generally showed little interest in radionuclide therapy as it was not seen as âradiologyâ. An alternate source of expertise lies with clinical oncology and in many parts of the U.K radionuclide therapy is delivered by clinical oncologists. However, as oncologists have taken a system based approach to treatment and those who are licenced to treat thyroid cancer may have little interest in cancers in other sites. Compounded to this has been decision by clinical oncologists to withdraw from treatment of benign disease. Some endocrinologists have taken on the role of treating benign thyroid disease but of course they will not do radiation synevectomies. The delivery of radionuclide therapy also requires further craft group skills in particular trained clinical scientists, technologists, radiopharmacy and nursing. All this has led to a centripetal effect with expertise being concentrated in less than ten centres across the UK. The majority of these centres lie within Greater London further exacerbating the poor geographic distribution of services.

166,19,0.986,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"Along the same lines, institutions other than family are also supposed to become less important, at least in their capacity to frame peopleâs life courses and impose age- (and gender-) related norms. There is a consensus that formal recognition of vulnerability is a categorization process that often has negative drawbacks in terms of loss of self-esteem for the person or group being categorized, who become exposed to social stigmatization (Ruof 2004; Thomas 2008). There is also a general agreement that individualization implies an increasing role for the state and its various welfare components, which should be important in preventing vulnerability, and are particularly important in responses to so-called âsocial risksâ, old or new, and consequently in the public management of vulnerable situations and individuals (Leisering 2003; Ranci 2010). We can cite the education system, unemployment offices, hospitals, and institutions caring for the elderly as examples considered in this volume. They all tend to be affected by the âactivationâ paradigm which is coherent with the values of individualization, and it is now recognized that like family configurations, institutions can be a source of support but also of stress (Bonvin et al. 2014). Stress is also present in the two main theoretical approaches discussed previously. Pearlin (1989) explicitly associated a lower position in the socioeconomic structure with greater exposure to stress. More recently, as we discussed briefly earlier, postmodern or post-industrial societies have also been seen as structural producers of stress through their demands for flexibility and competition (Rudisill et al. 2010) and, more generally, through the ambivalence of the ideal of self-realization (Giddens 1991), the burden of being the actor of his or her life (Ehrenberg 1998). Pressure, insecurity, chronic strain, daily hassles, incivilities are obvious sources of vulnerability when their effects accumulate over time. Their impact is maximized by contexts of discrimination, xenophobia, or other attitudes that challenge fairness. These negative associations are specifically discussed in chapter âCareer Pathways and Professional Transitions: Preliminary Results from the First Wave of a 7-Year Longitudinal Studyâ by Christian Maggiori and colleagues in the context of professional life. From a survey research perspective, the challenge for researchers interested in measuring vulnerability is to properly locate individuals in a web of social interactions that is more or less dense, with different actors that have to be identified. It is also to analyze those interactions from an individualâs subjective point of view, in terms of perceived social support or discrimination (chapters âA Survey of Couples Facing Breast Cancer in Womenâ and âCareer Pathways and Professional Transitions: Preliminary Results from the First Wave of a 7-Year Longitudinal Studyâ). It is finally to identify and measure chronic strain and daily hassles. Psychologists are of course the main contributors in relation to the latter (see chapters âA Survey of Couples Facing Breast Cancer in Womenâ, âCareer Pathways and Professional Transitions: Preliminary Results from the First Wave of a 7-Year Longitudinal Study, and âStudying Youth Transitions Through a Social Network: First Impressionsâ) but all social scientists recognize the importance of subjective perception since another widely accepted definition of vulnerability is simply low levels of well-being (see chapter âRepresentation of Vulnerability and the Elderly. A Total Survey Error Perspective on the VLV Surveyâ)."
183,308,0.986,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"political changes in the local government of Carhuazâresulted in a lack of comprehensive assessment of the social and political situation of the areas of intervention, and contributed to the delay in the process of implementation of certain activities and challenged the sustainability of the EWS. Recurrent technical problems in the EWS causing a delay in its final operation. The proper operational functioning of the different components of the implemented EWS is highly challenging in such extreme conditions in high mountains. Several persistent technical problems (bad or null signal reception between the stations, failures due to lightning impacts, energy problems, etc.) repeatedly disturbed the operation of the system. This led to unexpected expenses, change of sensors and their disposition, and a lack of data for defining warning thresholds for the geophones signals. A proper diagnosis of the problems and an integral correction of the system scheme were then needed. The alarm module of the system (sirens and their corresponding infrastructure, permanent surveillance in the municipality, etc.) was not yet implemented. This task was in the responsibility of the Municipality of Carhuaz. It is planned to install one or two long-range sirens to cover the entire area of the city of Carhuaz. In addition, the system has the possibility to send out predefined text messages to district leaders in parallel to the acoustic alarm. The populated places further up in the catchment are not included in the acoustic alarm concept at the current stage. However, they could be included in the described SMS service, given the coverage of the signal. Geophonesâ thresholds for the activation of the different warning levels were not yet defined. At the end of the first phase of the project, the system was not yet fully operational (even if it has been tested on several occasions) because the thresholds for the geophone measurements described above that indicates when a warning level is activated were not established yet. In this test phase, three different thresholds were to be defined to make sure that smaller events got registered as well (lowermost threshold) and to have a direct indication of the size of the event, depending on only one, two, or even all three thresholds are overshot. For this, historical records of the geophones had to be taken into account, and data analysis had to be applied to them as well. Further involvement of other technical fields such as electronic engineering is required. The multiple technical problems identified in the EWS, most of them caused by unexpected power source issues and deficiencies on the sensors and transmission devices, could have been solved or even avoided if an initial well-designed scheme had been elaborated which relates back to missing local experience. This could also lead to a more participative role of universities and/or research platforms on the conception and design of this (or other) EWS, benefiting both the technical aspects of the project and potential research initiatives. Toward a multipurpose project. When assessing the scope of the EWS in the context of the âGlaciares 513â project, a broader perspective of adaptation to effects of climate change results in an integration of risk reduction and water resource management in the light of dwindling water resources from shrinking glaciers. Multipurpose projects have the objective to integrate both perspectives"
170,499,0.986,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"2 Research on Impact The objective for many of the chapters in this volume is identifying the evidence concerning the impact of ICT on society and its transformation. The volume begins to collect and draw together evidence about the impact that ICTs are having and, as such, contributes new findings to the already vast body of knowledge that informs about how ICTs are contributing to society. In this respect, it is generally recognized that there are both social and economic dimensions of change and, further, that consideration should be given to both actual and perceived changes in deprivation. This is a substantial question that requires a more sustained research effort than the one undertaken by the SIRCA II research cycle. As the chapter by Flor reminds us, ICT can have an impact on sectors (such as agriculture, health or education) and on development themes (such as poverty, gender or governance). The mechanisms through which this impact takes place are complex, as are the sectors and themes in which the impact is to be felt. In addition, information and communications is a fast-growing economic sector in its own right and directly contributes towards the growth of a quaternary sector of knowledge-based services. Attribution of change to ICT, whether positive or not, is thus complex and links of causation may flow in different directions. As with any attribution attempt, it is necessary to separate outputs, outcomes and impacts and to decide which is feasible to measure, as well as which is necessary before conclusions can be reached concerning the contribution of the intervention. Thought must also be given as to what is meant by âcausationâ and whether it can be convincingly demonstrated. There are also lags between ICT interventions and their impact, and these lags in"

ERL/ERM guidelines are most useful when supporting data such as in situ biological analyses, toxicological assays, and other variables have been measured that confirm suspected cause-and-effect relationships. Despite the limitations above, by convention, the National Coastal Condition Reports (NCCRs) assess coastal sediment quality based on the number of ERL/ERM exceedances (USEPA 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012). In this summary, ERL/ERM values are used only to draw attention to sites where contaminant concentrations exceed levels that may be of biological significance; however, cause-and-effect or toxicity is not inferred. The results of the NCCRs are summarized including exceedances of ERL and ERM values to qualitatively describe the distribution of higher and lower levels of contaminants in sediments and to assist in discerning the sources of the contamination but not for predicting sediment quality or toxicity. In those cases where NCCR conclusions about sediment quality/toxicity are inferred, additional variables have been taken into account, and attribution of degraded benthic conditions solely to elevated chemical concentrations is often not possible. Furthermore, ERL values used to classify sediment metal concentrations (Cr, Cu, Ni, and As) are close to or less than natural background crustal values for Mississippi River suspended matter and Gulf of Mexico sediments (Table 4.1). In some cases, according to a peer reviewer of this chapter, Long et al. (1995) used concentrations of Cr and Ni that were determined with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) techniques that used an acid leach (without hydrofluoric acid) rather than total dissolution of the sediment to calculate ERL/ERM values. ERL/ERM values also have been revised over the years as additional data have become available, so reports may use differing values to assess exceedances. These limitations should be taken into account when considering the summaries in this chapter. Mapping and categorizing the number of sites that exceed ERL/ERM values are used to assess the location and origins of contaminants but not to infer or predict in situ biological effects or sediment toxicity."
320,226,0.986,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"In HABIT-CHANGE the term impact is considered as a change in the state of a system caused by pressures like climate change or land use. The focus is set on environmental impacts esp. on habitats. Climate impacts may be positive or negative. They can be the result of extreme events or more gradual changes in climate variables showing either direct or indirect effects. Examples for direct impacts are changed abiotic conditions (e.g. soil moisture) for protected habitats. Examples of indirect impacts are changes of agricultural practices due to increasing drought stress. The framework for the assessment (Fig. 8.5) of climate-induced impacts on habitats results into overall impact magnitude values partitioned into the four time segment during the course of the year. The starting points in the impact assessment were the exposure values and the sensitivity derived from the indicator values. The parameter temperature (tas) and climatic water balance (cwb) were checked against the sensitivity of the indicators temperature and moisture. Subsequently, this resulted into the first impact values following the rules defined in Table 8.9 for Temperature and Table 8.10 for Moisture. In the example shown in Table 8.11, for the Temperature, the Indicator rules stated that all negative values should be ignored from further analysis. The Moisture was indifferent and therefore all low exposure values were removed. The sensitivity values from the regional expert knowledge assessment were used to weight the first impact values. This was done by summarising the values from temperature, moisture and regional sensitivity for"
386,148,0.986,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"5.1.2 Empirical Results About Self-perception If anything should have become clear over the course of this book, it is the strong heterogeneity of agriculture in different parts of the world. US entrepreneurs and Zambian pastoralists, for example, have very little in common. Under these circumstances, is it justified to say anything about self-perception of farmers? Perhaps selfperception of farmers differs too much within and between the various agricultural systems. The multifaceted reality of farming systems barely allows finding a single term under which self-perception of todayâs farmers could be summarized. The best term would probably be âproductivistâ. In general, farmers like to consider themselves as producers of food more than anything else. This self-image applies, for example, to Kenya. As Waithaka et al. (2006) showed, Kenyan farmers, when depicting an âidealâ farm, start dreaming about milk yields 10 times the actual level, or about corn yields 20 times as high as they are. Feed needs are underestimated, whereas animal density is rather overestimated. Such farms are ideal because they generate maximum food yield with minimum effort. The provision of anything else besides food, under these circumstances, is not really part of the picture. The self-image of being a productivist also applies to Ireland, where Howley et al. (2015) showed that farmers are willing to sacrifice additional income to avoid participating in agri-environmental or forestation schemes compromising their production potential. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that farmers are as heterogeneous a group as people in most other professions. This heterogeneity is nicely illustrated in a study from the USA where Sulemana and James (2014) involved farmers in discourses about ethics. Farmers were confronted with scenarios such as applying pesticides under windy conditions or disposing pesticide containers without rinsing them. The farmersâ attitudes differed widely, allowing the authors to categorize parts of their sample as conservationists, others as productivists. A recent study from Switzerland (Mann 2018) raised the question of how âgreenâ even conservationists among farmers are. Farmers who subscribed to a public program on no-tillage and stated in a standardized survey conservation as a very important task for farmers would usually be regarded as being conservationists. However, in conversations with this group, this view was strongly challenged. The sequence below, for example, shows that these farmers, at least in some cases, still prioritize intensive production. Farmer 3 (F3): Yes, and then I did it like that, and then I also worked outside the farm. Now I have arable production and pigs. Interviewer (I): Yes, OK. F3: And, er (â¦) right, since 03 Iâm actually doing no-tillage (.) I: OK F3: When it actually was prescribed, due to run-off. I: The district administration has prescribed it, right?"

It is important to pay attention to the rate of values, which have the lowest points relatively to other factors of overcoming crises. Figures show the representation of a crisis-prone factors in the lives of teachers, clearly show the state of depression, confusion and anxiety in a greater or lesser extent. For instance, 41.2% to 54.09% of Yakutian teachers have the lack of dignity in professional career. 47.9% to 81.3% of teachers are affected by the influence of external negative circumstances, the inability to implement their plans and prioritize high payment for their work experience. 32.1% to 67.4% of teachers have the sense of loss of meaning in life. 28.1% to 60.8% have the feeling of loneliness and alienation. This suggests that teachers respond to unfavorable trends of our times as sensitive indicators of the state of society, primarily due to the fact that this state of society is reflected and refracted in children. However at the same time, the outcomes of this survey showed a very high resistance (from 90.5% to 97.5%) to the effects of a crisis-prone factors accompanied by exceptional adaptability to the adverse social factors and the adaptability to the rapidly changing world and society when there is a need to react quickly and learn fast. Teachers of the North are characterized with a desire to everything new and tolerant attitude, self-control when necessary and selfregulation. 72.6% to 95.7% responses confirm it. Yakutian teachers are aware of the importance of goal-setting skills, when setting more and more new purposes becomes an internal necessity of constantly developing personality: 91.7%â97.3%. A developing personality can be curious, indifferent, open to everything new and unknown at every moment of life. For the analysis of Yakutia and Kazakhstan, it is"

They found all 70 fatwas allow for organ donation and blood transfusion. Autotransplantation is no problem at all if done for medical reasons. Allotransplantation, both from a living and a dead donor, appears to be possible though only in quite restricted ways. Xenotransplantation is less often mentioned but can be allowed in case of necessity. Transplantation in general is seen as an ongoing form of charity. They state that their ï¬ndings are very much in line with the international literature on the subject. They also found two new elements: debates on the deï¬nition of the moment of death are hardly mentioned in the English Sunni fatwas and organ donation and blood transfusion are presented as an ongoing form of charity.

244,614,0.986,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","In general, the ETS response to conflicting evidence or varieties of nuances in interpretation is to keep the evaluation process and its reporting as open as possible. In this way, the values of the evaluator, though necessarily present, are less likely to be a predominating influence on subsequent action. Program evaluators do, at times, have the opportunity to influence decisionmakers by showing them that there are kinds of evidence not typically considered. The Coleman Study, for example, showed at least some decision-makers that there is more to evaluating school programs than counting (or calculating) the numbers of books in libraries, the amount of classroom space per student, the student-teacher ratio, and the availability of audiovisual equipment (Coleman et al. 1966). Rather, the output of the schools in terms of student performance was shown to be generally superior as evidence of school program performance. Through their work, evaluators are also able to educate decision makers to consider the important principle that educational treatments may have positive effects for some students and negative effects for othersâthat an interaction of treatment with student should be looked for. As pointed out in the discussion of unintended outcomes, a systems-analysis approach to program evaluationâdealing empirically with the interrelatedness of all the factors that may affect performanceâis to be preferred. And this approach, as Messick emphasized, âproperly takes into account those student-process-environment interactions that produce differential resultsâ (Messick 1975, p. 246)."
376,463,0.986,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Concerns about the welfare of a rare bird, the California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus), led to a study of the SES that sustains the small wetlands that are its primary habitat in the Sierra Nevada foothills. More than two-thirds of the wetlands in the area are fed primarily by irrigation water, either by irrigation runoff or through leaks in earthen irrigation canals and ditches, and are scattered within grazed annual grasslands that are mostly in private ownership. Wetlands fed by irrigation water are also more consistently wet and had greater bird use than those subject to seasonal water variations (Richmond et al. 2010). Designing the study and analyzing research results using an SES framework revealed that many wetlands are functionally âaccidentalâ and have little impact on land use or productivity from the landowner perspective. They are largely ignored by landowners, and while this benign neglect is to some degree why they have served as black rail habitat for decades, changing environmental and economic conditions could lead to their demise. In this study, the SES framework linked factors outside of the land manager-ecosystem relationship to strong impacts on the potential for conserving rail habitat, and revealed a need for governance that facilitates feedbacks from rail habitat conditions to water districts. The secretive black rail is a small ground-dwelling marsh bird, and was known only from large marshes in San Francisco Bay and along the lower Colorado River until it was âdiscoveredâ in the Sierra foothills of Yuba, Nevada, Placer, and Butte counties in 1994 (Richmond et al. 2008). The SES framework enabled researchers to conceptualize and model the ecosystem service of rail habitat provision as a product of the interaction of humans and environment, rather than a service provided by the ecosystem alone (Huntsinger and Oviedo 2014). Researchers hypothesized that the interaction of landowners and environment is driven mostly by water scarcity, fears of mosquito-related illness, ranching activities, water price, and landowner goals for their land (Fig. 8.3). To understand how landowner decisions influenced black rail habitat, landowners within the birdâs habitat distribution were surveyed about water and land management goals and practices in 2014. Results showed that about half the landowners purchased irrigation water from a water district. Water districts are local government institutions that supply water to farms and homes in a rural area. They typically serve hundreds to thousands of properties. While many respondents reported having a small wetland that could be rail habitat on their property, few survey respondents reported any management of such wetlands, with about 9 % reporting draining a wetland in the last 5 years, and 9 % reporting that they created a wetland during the last 5 years. About half said that they valued wetlands as wildlife habitat, about a quarter thought that the green forage was useful for livestock, but about a quarter reported not doing any management because the wetlands simply did not âbotherâ them."

Furthermore, it is plausible that in actual marine systems, background chemical concentrations in biota may already exceed the concentrations that microplastic ingestion would be able to explain, in which case no gradient for transfer would exist. In a follow up study, Koelmans et al. (2014b) used the same biodynamic model as was used for POPs to assess the potential of leaching of nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the intestinal tracts of lugworm (A. marina) and cod (Gadus morhua). Parameters for the lugworm were based on Besseling et al. (2013). Parameters for cod were based on actual abundances of microplastic particles in the cod GIT as observed by Foekema et al. (2013). The resulting model was validated against the data provided by Browne et al. (2013) for leaching of NP from PVC to A. marina. Then, the model was used to calculate the body burdens that could be explained from plastic ingestion, which were compared to NP and BPA body burdens actually measured in the field. Uncertainty in the most crucial parameters was accounted for by probabilistic modelling. The conservative analysis showed that plastic ingestion by the lugworm indeed results in chemical transfer to the organism, but yields NP and BPA concentrations that stay below the lower ends of global NP and BPA concentration ranges in the lugworm, and therefore is unlikely to constitute a relevant exposure pathway. A similar comparison showed that plastic ingestion is also likely to constitute a negligible exposure pathway for cod. Note that the key model concepts of chemical transfer in the intestinal tract or segments of the intestinal tract as condensed in Eqs. 11.7â11.9 are also applicable to higher marine organisms. They would only need different parameterizations and different initial boundary conditions."

Olefins are still olefins and acrylates are still acrylates, and behave like their petroleum-fabricated counterparts. Furthermore, biodegradability standards are not applicable in the marine environment and marine degradability requires a separate standard. Marine degradable plastics have a negligible market share and are not poised to make headway into the consumer plastics market at the present time. The difficulty of recycling plastics has made their profitable recovery a problem, which in turn results in failure to provide take-back infrastructure and results in accelerated pollution. Given the proliferation of plastics into all spheres of human activity, and their increasing use value in the developing world, the phenomena associated with plastic pollution of the marine environment will continue to merit scientific investigation. These studies, however, are hampered by the lack of basic geospatial and quantitative data. Estimates abound based on limited sampling and modeling, but the ocean is the biggest habitat on the planet by far and knowledge of its plastic pollution will require new methods of data acquisition. The role of citizens in the monitoring of plastic pollution will increase in the coming years, and the truly âbigâ data they document must become part of the science of plastic pollution. For the present, it is fortunate that a few pioneering scientists around the world are engaged in attempting to understand the consequences of the plague of plastic that contaminates our precious ocean.

48,68,0.986,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"is likely to be one of those overoptimistic persons pursuing the near impossible. Now the optimists, or at least one of them, have an advantage in the battle of survival. Similarly, if all the costs, efforts, delays, and frustrations of a companyâs ambitious projects were known beforehand, the projects might perhaps never have been initiated. When completed, most of the ambitious projects may have become complete failures, but perhaps one of them became a great success, giving the company a tremendous advantage that more than compensated for all the failures. Preceding many great successes are usually a high number of failures with strongly overoptimistic costâbenefit predictions. The economist Albert O. Hirschman proposed an argument in favour of being overoptimistic [14]. He argued that people tend to underestimate their creativity and ability to find solutions to problems that emerge. Overoptimistic time and cost predictions may compensate for this overpessimism. Thus, overoptimism is the hiding hand that helps us conceal difficulties and encourages us to complete worthwhile projects that we never would have initiated had we known how problematic they would become. The researchers Flyvbjerg and Sunstein [15] showed that in most large infrastructure projects, difficulties were indeed underestimated, as evident by the strong tendency to experience cost overruns. The benefits, for example, in terms of the number of users of a service, were, on the other hand, typically overestimated. If we overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, we may tend to start projects that are not worthwhile, and the hiding hand will not be as helpful as Hirschman assumed. Flyvbjerg and Sunstein claimed that the negative hiding hand, which they termed the malevolent hiding hand, applied in 78% of the projects they studied, while Hirschmanâs positive hiding hand, which they termed the benevolent hiding hand, applied to only 22% of the projects. Even if negative effects of overoptimism should be more common than positive effects in infrastructure and other types of projects, there may still be more benefits than costs across all such projects for society at large. With a few projects yielding immense benefits and fewer projects being detrimental, it would not be that bad to have a high number of overoptimistic costâbenefit analyses after all. However, we have yet to see systematic studies on the distribution of benefit outcomes for large projects. A tendency towards overoptimism may be a result of a supportive and friendly environment that does not punish failures too much. Overpessimism, on the other hand, may be a result of a more unfriendly environment. There is a fascinating line of research that shows how humans and animals, for instance, dogs, rats, and starlings, seem to develop more overoptimistic expectancies in better environments [16]. In a study of birdsâ behaviour, the researchers exposed starlings to both bad and good cage conditions. The bad conditions included unpredictable feeding and cleaning times in a small, boring cage. The good cage conditions included continuous access to water baths, perches made from natural branches, and bark chipping on the floor. The birds first learned that they could receive food pellets if they pressed one lever when they saw a light for two seconds and another lever when the light appeared for 15 seconds. From previous studies, the researchers knew that the birds"
167,192,0.986,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"The last section of this chapter deal with three infectious diseases that were all common in the past, and that are considered as minor threats today. Nevertheless, they all bear a potential risk for the future related to changes in the Arctic. Two hundred years ago infectious diseases dominated the high mortality in the Arctic countries. In Sweden smallpox killed more than 300,000 people between 1750 and 1800, in a country with only 2 million inhabitants. After the introduction of vaccine in the early 1800s smallpox mortality decreased rapidly, and in 1976 the World Health Organization declared the disease as totally eradicated from Earth. This was the first infectious disease that human health prevention actively got rid of (SkÃ¶ld 1996). 1918â1920 an influenza pandemic swept over the world, killing between 50 and 100 million people. The Arctic, and especially the Indigenous peoples, were heavily struck. In local communities in Alaska the disease killed up to 90% of the entire population (Mamelund et al. 2013). Anthrax is an infection by bacteria that was already mentioned in the bible as a disease of herbivores, it remained a major cause of death for animals all over the planet until the end of the nineteenth century, with occasional, sometimes extensive, contamination of human beings. Untreated the disease has a fatality rate higher than 90% (Schwartz 2009). What then do these three terrible diseases have in common for the future mortality risks in the Arctic? The answer is the consequences of melting permafrost. Smallpox, influenza and anthrax are relatively resistant to external factors and can survive for long, also in ice. When reports of an anthrax outbreak in Siberia came in 2016, it was stated that the bacteria originated from dead reindeer in 1941 (Nechepurenko 2016; Revitch et al. 2012). Severe epidemics with these diseases would have terrible results, not least since immunity status of the present-day populations is very low, in the case of smallpox non-existing. This is a somewhat neglected consequence of climate change that needs to be highlighted."
224,126,0.986,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"While the land use system on Bellona may be seen to examplify a âclose to autonomous village situationâ in the Boserupian heurisitc rhetoric because of its immediate appearance as a traditional shifting cultivation system, the island specific population-land use nexus and the classical Boserupean trajectory of intensification have been bypassed. The apparent status quo situation of the land use strategies can be explained by the important cultural value embedded in the traditional agricultural practices. Overall, the area under cultivation in Bellona since 1966 has remained remarkably unchanged despite the significantly increasing population. The land use pattern has also remained fairly constant although a few new crops have emerged in âwaves of changeâ (e.g. coconut palms making way for more permanent gardens of mainly sweet potato and/or watermelon). The production techniques as well as technology have remained unchanged as a traditional shifting cultivation system in the absence of affordable inputs such as agro-chemical fertilizer for more intensive practices, in spite of the fact that the population pressure has grown considerably. Changes in economic and human resources in Bellona have, however, also made living conditions and food provision challenges very different, mainly as a result of income opportunities occurring from migration, remittances, aid and increasing bureaucracy. Faced with scarce land resources and opportunities found off the island, the Bellonese have under the new circumstances been able to generate alternative livelihoods to subsistence agriculture, for example, through the mobility of family members. The value the Bellonese give to tradition and culture is another important part of the explanation of the land use stability. Many inhabitants consider traditional agriculture to be an important part of their daily life, beyond rational assessment criteria. Yam gardens are, for example, attributed great importance for cultural identity; they help maintain the social institutions that continue to provide an important social safety net (embedded in various collective labour relations and the sharing of harvests among kin). Alongside the seeming continuation or status quo of the land use pattern, a number of changes have occurred, some closely linked to humanâland relations and others to changes in socioeconomic conditions. Notably, the food producing area per person in 2006 has decreased by one third compared to 1966. Apparently the influence of the âmodern way of lifeâ, particularly on young migrants returning after completing their education or (un)successfully pursuing job opportunities has reduced the inclination for âhard workâ in the traditional gardens among the younger generations. Within the last decade, eight new shops have opened on the island, functioning as storage depots for imported foodstuffs and other goods. This indicates that people do have money to spend and that the availability of âmodernâ food on the island has increased. The overall portfolio of livelihood strategies observed has become much more diversified.

The ï¬rst two measures are quantitative assessments of physical and mental health, positively oriented (the higher the score the better the health) derived from the Short Form-12 Health SurveyâSF-12 included in the Italian survey. SRH is a binary variable derived from the single-item question recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), which asks: âHow is your health in general?â (De Bruin et al. 1996). Answers are distributed on a ï¬ve point scale: very good, good, fair, bad, very bad. We grouped these ï¬ve categories into two, creating a dummy variable (poor-SRH) of people reporting âpoorâ and âvery poorâ health conditions as opposed to those reporting âfairâ, âgoodâ or âvery goodâ conditions. This aggregation is due to the very unbalanced frequency distribution of respondents in the ï¬ve categories: only a very small proportion of the population were in the two extreme categories (very good/very poor), which would have produced unreliable estimations. The choice of aggregating the category âfairâ together with the positive modalities (âgoodâ and âvery goodâ) is due to its Italian translation, which has a quite positive, rather than a neutral, connotation (Egidi and Spizzichino 2006). We included individual and contextual (household) covariates in the analyses. As individual variables, we consider age, classiï¬ed as <50, 50â64, 65â74, 75+; gender; education (low, i.e. primary education or lower; medium, i.e. lower secondary; and high, upper secondary education or higher); disability (yes/no), according to the highest limitation grade in at least one item of OECD Long-Care Disability Questionnaire; and multichronicity (yes/no), deï¬ned as having three or more chronic illnesses diagnosed by a medical doctor. Finally, we created a new variable from the dataset intended to capture the burden of disability of one household member on the rest of the family. It is labeled cohabitation with disabled and has value one when the individual cohabits with at least one disabled person. Household covariates include: perceived economic status with categories good/ satisfactory versus inadequate; housing conditions, which is based on the presence of very basic housing problems (e.g. absence of heating) and is classiï¬ed as Good (no problems), Fair (1â2 problems), or Bad (more than 2 problems); household size with categories 2â3; 4; 5+ components; household structure with couple-headed families opposed to single-headed families; and city size with two classes based on the threshold of 50,000 inhabitants. We adopted a multilevel approach with which we are able to disentangle the proportion of variability on different levels, i.e. the variability between individuals due to differences between individual themselves or due to household or ALHU communalities. According to the outcome characteristics, we ran linear or logistic multilevel models, with random intercepts at the household and ALHU levels. For each of the three outcomes we ran different multilevel models: â¢ Empty model: the model without any covariates, to evaluate the proportion of variance to be accounted for at each level, by means of the Variance Partition Coefï¬cient (VPC)."

Without that, it is likely that the performance of the project will deteriorate over time. Many past failures in water resources management are attributable to the fact that waterâits quantity, reliability, quality, pressure, locationâ has been and still is viewed as a free good. Prices paid for irrigation and drinking water are in many countries well below the full cost of the infrastructure and personnel needed to provide that water, which comprises the capital charges involved, the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, the opportunity cost, economic and environmental externalities (see GWP 2000).

As indicated by the test statistics, each method produced a plausible present distribution and estimate of habitats suitable for each species (14 commercial ï¬sh). When used to make projections into the future, the ensemble of models suggested northward shifts at an average rate of 27 km per decade (the current rate is around 20 km per decade for common ï¬sh in the North Sea, Dulvy et al. 2008). This modelling approach was extended to include several additional, commercial species (squid Loligo vulgaris, seabass, sardine, sprat, John dory, anchovy, plaice, herring, mackerel, halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus, red mullet etc.) as part of a Defra study (Defra 2013). The species predicted to move the furthest were anchovy, sardine, Greenland halibut, John dory and seabass (i.e. E. encrasicolus, S. pilchardus, R. hippoglossoides, Z. faber and D. labrax respectively, see Fig. 12.4). By contrast Rutterford et al. (2015) used the same ï¬sh survey datasets for the North Sea, together with generalised additive models (GAMs), to predict trends in the future distribution of species, but came to the conclusion that ï¬sh species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by the availability of suitable habitat in the North Sea, especially in terms of preferred depths. The authors found no consistent pattern among species in predicted changes in distribution. On the basis of the GAM results the authors suggested that they did not expect or predict substantial further deepening (as previously observed by Dulvy et al. 2008), and that the capacity of ï¬sh to remain in cooler water by changing their depth distribution had been largely exhausted by the 1980s, that ï¬sh with preferences for cooler water are being increasingly exposed to higher temperatures, with expected physiological, life history and negative population consequences. Beaugrand et al. (2011) described a model to map the future spatial distribution of Atlantic cod. The model, which they named the non-parametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN), suggested that cod may eventually disappear as a commercial species from some regions including the North Sea where a sustained decline has already been documented; in contrast, the abundance of cod is likely to increase in the Barents Sea. Lenoir et al. (2011) applied the same NPPEN model with multiple explanatory variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, and bathymetry) to predict the distribution of eight ï¬sh species up to the 2090s for the Northeast Atlantic. This study anticipated that by the 2090s horse mackerel and anchovy would show an increased probability of occurrence in northern waters compared with the 1960s, that pollack Pollachius pollachius, haddock and saithe would show a decrease in the south, and that turbot Scophthalmus maximus and sprat would show no overall change in probability (â0.2 to +0.2) anywhere."
230,420,0.986,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"10.2.7 Summary Microplastics have been documented in almost every habitat of the open oceans and enclosed seas, including beaches, surface waters, water column and the deep seafloor. Although most water bodies have been investigated, there is a lack of published work from polar regions and the Indian Ocean. Further research is required to accurately estimate the amount of different types of microplastics in benthic environments around the globe. Distribution of microplastics depends on environmental conditions including ocean currents, horizontal and vertical mixing, wind mixing and biofilm formation, as well as the properties of individual plastic polymers. A number of modelling approaches have been considered in the recent literature, which highlighted the effect of wind on the distribution of microplastics in the ocean. Oceanographic modelling of floating debris has shown accumulation in ocean gyres, and the distribution of microplastics within the water column appears to be dependent on the composition, density and shape of plastic polymers affecting their buoyancy. Further modelling studies may help to identify and predict regions with ecological communities and fisheries more vulnerable to the potential consequences of plastic contamination. The distribution of microplastic plays a significant role in terms of which organisms and habitats are affected. Widespread accumulation and distribution of microplastics raises concerns regarding the interaction and potential effects on marine organisms."

This chapter compiles a more detailed treatment of the effects of buffering in the radio access part of LTE by also considering the performance of high-speed/long-delay variants of TCP in these kinds of networks. The so-called bufferbloat effect has also a huge impact into the performance of TCP over LTE [10]. The bufferbloat effect is possible due to the configuration of long queues both in the end-nodes and intermediate nodes, which can accumulate a great number of packets without any drop. However, that excessive packet buffering in a single queue in the end-to-end network path, causes a great latency increase and therefore, throughput degradation. Our work does not merely focus on bufferbloat, but considers the implications of different TCP variants in queue build-up under certain network conditions. Considering that many flows in Internet are short, it is important to verify the efficiency of TCP to carry out such transmissions over cellular networks, it has been demonstrated [11] that under some network conditions TCP fails to correctly utilize the available capacity and therefore, the flows last longer than necessary. The current work complements such works and analyzes the impact that different flow sizes have in the performance outcome of different TCP flavors. To this end, our work not only focuses on the stationary phases of TCP but also on its behavior during start-up due to its significant impact in short flows performance. In particular, we study the Hybrid Slow-Start scheme [12], and evaluate how it operates in LTE networks in comparison with the Standard Slow-Start scheme. Other studies have measured TCP over live LTE networks. Apart from the classic metrics of TCP throughput and RTT in [4] they also measured the delay caused by mobile devices going from idle to connected state. In [13], measurement trials were carried out over the cellular access of four Swedish operators and the diurnal variation of TCP throughput and delay were analyzed. [14,15] studies did similar TCP measurements, however, they did not consider daily variations. None of these live measurements took into account the impact of speed in the performance of TCP, or the behavior on different types of CCAs. So, to the best of our knowledge, our work both complements and extends these works through the study and evaluation of the behavior of common TCP variants in LTE networks under mobility with different speeds. There are only a few works that have considered the impact of different speeds on the performance of TCP over LTE networks. Even though some works [5] have studied different speeds, the primary metrics were more related to the radio part with spectral efficiency and share of resource blocks among the UEs. Even though the utilization of such radio resources was studied, one or two simple variants of TCP were utilized in a multi-user resource share, leading to TCP micro-effects masking. Also, in [3] the impact of speed on TCP in LTE was studied. The work focused on uplink and downlink throughput, RTTs and also considered time-ofday variations. Still, they did not consider how the CCA factor into the TCP performance at different velocities. Our work serves to cover all the options and extends the previous studies with multiple mobility patterns, different speeds and a wide range of CCAs."

However, when exploring walking speed in a linear mixed model we found that there was no relationship with family situation (not shown). This suggests that in general walking speed is only loosely related to family situation but that sub-performance and extreme deï¬ciencies in walking speed may be also routed in the family environment. Living in a partnership tends to be beneï¬cial only for men, for women it may even be detrimental when controlled for life-style and health characteristics. For men there is a clear positive gradient between the amount of family resources and walking speed: the childless living alone have the slowest walking speed, those living in a partnership and who have children have the highest. Life-style factors such as obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption mediate the advantage of the latter group. This is also true for health related characteristics such as the number of morbidities and signs of depression. For women, no positive gradient exists. On the contrary, living in a partnership exerts a negative effect, both among the childless and among those with children. Thus, for men we can conï¬rm our initial hypothesis that higher amounts of family resources positively influence walking speed, for women we have to reject it; the effect of children appears to be positive, the effect of a partner, however, is negative. It is difï¬cult to disentangle the effects of health selection and causal factors related to protective or detrimental effects of the current family situation. Both"

It is shown that exact knowledge such as lethal dosages and the type and extent of injuries had been observed in cases of accident long before the outbreak of war. Nevertheless, detailed toxicological research was carried out in the toxicological department of Fritz Haberâs Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin-Dahlem. War itself offered the opportunity for deadly ï¬eld experiments. The soldiers suffered not only from physical injuries (chest pain, breathlessness, coughing, bloody sputum, multiple organ failure) but also from fear and traumatization. Given the enormous fear caused by the idea of a supposed poisoning even without symptoms, distinguishing the real and actual from the simulated in such cases must have been problematic and caused a permanent threat of being accused of malingering or even simulating. From there it was only a small step to psychic and political stigmatization as âRentenbetrÃ¼gerâ (pension fraudsters) or being mentally ill in the late Weimar Republic and especially under National Socialism. Whereas the nation was forever grateful to the war-wounded and disabled veterans, the stigmatized were seen as being mentally ill, were sterilized, and sometimes even murdered."
165,419,0.986,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"group in the comparison is small in relative size. This could apply, for example, to establishing âbaselinesâ for White-Latino segregation in micropolitan areas and non-core counties of the Midwest and South that emerged as new destination communities experiencing Latino population growth during the period 1980â2000. Current practices do not permit these cases to be considered. The unbiased indices I introduce in Chap. 15 make it possible for researchers to focus on these communities using spatial units as small as blocks (instead of tracts) if they wish to do so. For each segregation comparison I calculated the value of D and estimates of bias based on values of E[D] obtained using both Winshipâs analytic formulas and also by bootstrap methods. The question I address is whether the restrictions on the study design and analysis sample yield an analysis data set where concern about bias is negligible. The main conclusions are the same whether using either set of estimates of E[D] so I report results for E[D] computed by formula because few researchers are likely to compute bootstrap estimates in empirical studies. I first consider results when segregation is assessed using tract-level data, the most conservative choice for minimizing potential bias. Here the mean for E[D] was 7.36. Equally and perhaps more importantly, its values displayed considerable variation across cases with an inter-decile range of 8.86 with 10 % of cases at or below 3.74 and 10 % of cases at or above 12.60. So the first takeaway point is that the screening criteria did not reduce the typical potential for bias to negligible levels. A second takeaway point is that screening cases did not yield an analysis data set where the potential for bias is uniform across cases. This is not surprisingly because relative group size is an important determinant of E[D] and it varies widely across cities even after screening out cases where percent minority is below 3 %. Another finding is that the level of underlying potential for bias in D varies across group comparisons. The mean for E[D] is 6.10 for White-Black segregation, 7.02 for White-Latino segregation, and 10.86 for White-Asian segregation. The crossgroup variation traces to the fact that, on average, the relative size of the minority population is smaller for the comparisons involving Latinos and even more so for comparisons involving Asians. This raises concerns that bias might distort crossgroup comparisons on segregation. The means on D are 48.48 for the White-Black comparisons, 35.13 for the White-Latino comparisons, and 39.21 for the White Asian comparisons. It is interesting to observe that the difference of 3.84 between the White-Asian and White-Latino averages for E[D] is almost as large as the difference of 4.08 between the White-Asian and White-Latino averages for D. The important point here is that the conventional approach to screening cases does not do away with nagging concerns about the potential role of bias. Furthermore, these results only get worse when segregation is measured using data at lower levels of geography such as for block-groups and blocks. For example, when calculated using block-level data, the means for E[D] are 21.98 for White-Black segregation, 35.13 for White-Latino segregation, and 39.21 for White-Asian segregation. The results for E[D] also varied considerably across areas and across group comparisons as observed for E[D] computed using tract-level data."
114,252,0.986,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Risk Control Strategies When systems are under pressure risk control strategies need to be considered to maintain safety and potentially also to constrain costs. An important example of risk control is the deliberate restriction of clinical practice in circumstances posing high risk to patients. This method of controlling risk is most prominent in the prescription and administration of high risk medication. For instance, in primary care certain drugs cannot be prescribed by general practitioners or supplied by community pharmacists. The argument for risk control is essentially that it is better to explicitly manage demand and conditions of work in order to maintain standards and preserve safety; the alternative is a system which delivers some high quality care but which potentially runs out of control. The most obvious potential control is to cap the maximum number of patients who are under the care of a single primary care team, which varies according to patient characteristics and how care is provided. Provided some realistic assessment of patient need and consultation length can be made, then capping the number of patients per team is a possible option but solutions of this kind can only be achieved at a national level. Demand can be managed locally by greater involvement of nurses and paramedical staff in care delivery or by transfer to hospitals or other facilities but this may not be feasible in isolated or poorer areas. There are however many examples of risk control in primary care and the potential for a much more thorough consideration of this particular strategy."

The world does not operate on idealism alone. Vision 2050 also keeps reassessments of our lifestyles in mind, but it is limited in its expectations of any quantitative effects. The emphasis is on finding avenues for technologically improving energy consumption efficiency. Another one of the premises of Vision 2050 is that there is little chance that renewable energy will have replaced fossil resources across the board in 2050. If we set aside hydroelectric power and the use of firewood in developing countries, then the percentage of total energy that renewables contributed as of 1999 stood at less than 1%. In contrast to fossil resources such as gasoline and coal that have a high energy density and can be used at any time, renewable energy sources such as sunlight and wind power have a sparse energy density and the volume of energy they produce has extreme time fluctuations. It is extremely difficult to come up with a scenario in which people will rapidly switch across the board from sources of energy that are easy to use and convenient to renewables that require planning when it comes to making use of them. These are the premises that support Vision 2050. I undertook countless studies using the most up-to-date and detailed data I could acquire at the time I drafted it. Close to two decades have passed since it was formulated, but I still believe that everything in it to be current, including its premises. The difference between developed and developing countries is likely to be a crucial factor that should be ascertained in the future. The amount of energy consumed in developed countries will definitely decrease. Their populations have already peaked out and are similarly shifting to a declining pattern. Japanâs population peaked at 128,060,000 people in 2008. According a National Institute of Population and Social Security Research estimate, it might reach a maximum of 129,200,000 in 2050, or fall below 100,000,000, if the population decline accelerates. These population projections are based on suppositions about birthrates and average longevity, but assuming there are no major changes in conditions by 2100, it will drop to somewhere between 38 million and 65 million people. When the size of the population falls, the total volume of energy consumed likewise falls. Furthermore, given that automobiles, houses, and household appliances will be even more energy efficient, the amount of energy they consume will drop even if we are still using them in the same ways. The amount of energy consumed in Japan rose continuously through 2004, but since then, it has been falling. Current levels of energy consumption are practically the same as those of the late 1990s when I worked out Vision 2050. The amount of energy consumed drops as the population decreases and energy efficiency improves. Similar trends can be seen not only in Japan but also to varying degrees in all developed countries. It seems likely that developing countries will also navigate the same sorts of changes as development proceeds, their populations will reach their upper limits, and they will reach the saturation point with man-made objects. Vision 2050 was formulated as a realistic and rational vision statement."

102,380,0.986,Saving For Development : How Latin America and The Caribbean Can Save More and Better,"BOX 9.1. DO GENES AND CULTURE MATTER FOR SAVING? Several studies have probed differences in saving behaviors across countries and agents to understand if there is a natural propensity to save. A series of studies in the 1970s used factor models to decompose the variance in IQ tests into its genetic and environmental components. However, estimates of the contribution of genetic components from this literature range widely and depend mainly on strong and restrictive assumptions about the factor loadings or about the distribution of the genetic and environmental components.a A noteworthy study on the role of genetics in saving decisions was recently conducted by Cronqvist and Siegel (2015) in Sweden. By exploiting the differences in genes shared among fraternal and identical twins, the study finds that genetic differences explain about one-third of the variation in individual savings rates. Moreover, the study finds that saving rates are negatively correlated with smoking and obesityâbehaviors that may also reflect lack of self-control and present-biased preferencesâand that this correlation is largely explained by genetic factors. Another innovative strand of the literature has focused on testing what is referred to as âlinguistic relativity,â or the SapirâWhorf hypothesis: Does the structure of a language affect the ways in which its speakers view the world? Can language influence the way speakers think and/or engage in nonlinguistic behaviors such as saving? A recent study by Chen (2013) evaluates whether speakers of languages that disassociate the present from the future have a harder time saving. He first classifies languages into strong and weak futuretime reference (FTR) languages, and finds that Spanish and English have strong future time-references, while Chinese has a weak one.b In other words, Chinese distinguish the differences between current and future events less strongly than Colombians, who tend to make a very clear distinction between the two. With this language coding in hand, Chen (2013) finds that the degree of future-time references intrinsic in each language correlates highly with the way in which speakers deal with household and individual intertemporal decisions such as health and saving choices. Furthermore, he shows that linguistic relativity may play an important role in national saving rates: countries with a strong FTR language save about 5 percentage points less per year than comparable countries with weak FTR languages. Wang, Rieger, and Hens (2011) measure long-term discount rates (Î´) and present-bias discount factors (Î²) in 45 countries around the world. Whenever Î´=1, individuals give the same weight to gains/losses today and tomorrow; i.e., they do not penalize future events. Thus, low values of Î´ signify that they discount the future more heavily relative to the present. Individuals may also discount the future against the present differently depending on when the choice is made. Someone may care about an intertemporal trade-off between today and a week from now, but not so much between four and five weeks from now. Individuals with Î²=1, will not exhibit any present bias in their choices (continued on next page)"

It does not include the costs of the involvement of faculty, university administrators, meeting rooms, European projects, evaluations by foreign experts, research evaluations or any other evaluations undertaken by the university. While some may argue that these are legitimate costs for improving the quality of education and scientiï¬c research, we have our doubts that these costs can be justiï¬ed as such, since these reports are often unrelated to improvements.

The law prescribes universities to establish each of these structures and activities, and we indeed could ï¬nd people involved in each of these structures, as well as trails of documents and reports elaborated by each of them. One of the main reasons why many of these evaluations are seen as meaningless bureaucracy is that they are too often changed.

64,46,0.986,Infrastructure and Economic Growth in Asia,"Fan and Zhang (2008) is another study which provides evidence on the importance of the market access channel in alleviating poverty in poor countries. The study builds on the conceptual framework and modelling approach developed previously in Fan et al. (2002). Using a full information maximum likelihood technique applied to a simultaneous equations model, the authors examine the various channels through which government expenditures on rural roads affect rural poverty and agricultural production in Uganda. Similar to the findings of the Fan et al. (2002) study conducted for the case of China, the results reveal that agricultural labour productivity and non-farm employment are significant factors determining the extent of rural poverty in Uganda. Fan and Zhangâs (2008) estimates suggest that a 1 % increase in agricultural production or non-farm employment would lift about 0.27 % of the rural poor out of poverty. However, higher rural wages were found to have no statistically significant effect on rural poverty, which the authors argue may be due to the presence of surplus rural labour in Uganda. Fan and Zhang (2008) examine the poverty impacts of road infrastructure by analyzing the marginal returns to public investment of different types of roads. Their calculations indicate that, among the different types of roads, feeder (dirt) roads have the largest impact on poverty reduction across Uganda, such that an additional million shillings invested in building feeder roads would allow 33 persons to escape poverty in Uganda. For murram (gravel) and tarmac (tarred) roads, the authors estimate that nine persons would be able to rise above the poverty line for each additional million shillings spent on these roads. Fan et al. (2002) carry out a similar study using Tanzanian household level data. Their calculations of marginal returns to public investment in road infrastructure indicate that for every shilling invested, household income rises by 9.13 shillings. The authors also estimate that for every one million shillings invested in roads, on average, 27 persons are lifted out of poverty. Road investments are also found to have the largest poverty impacts in the Central and Western regions of Tanzania and in the South Highlands, where each million shillings spent on roads leads to 60â75 persons exiting poverty. An increasing number of empirical studies seem to support the idea that strong complementarities exist between investments in road infrastructure and investments in other sectors of the economy, particularly in education. Jalilian and Weissâ (2004, p. 3) research provides evidence of a positive relationship between infrastructure and economic growth, with the caveat that this relationship is only significant in the presence of human capital development. Jalilian and Weiss (2004) derive this finding based on their study on the impact of road infrastructure5 on economic growth and poverty across a sample of developed and developing countries. The authors apply a range of estimation techniques to find that the road infrastructure variable on its own is insignificant in all estimations. Rather, the findings reveal the existence of complementarity between"
77,49,0.986,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"not all support this hypothesis. For instance there is evidence that the duration of obesity is associated with mortality independent of BMI level. Abdullah et al. (2011) conducted analysis of 5,036 participants from the Framingham cohort study. Using data from 48 years of follow-up, they showed that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality increased with the number of years of obesity; compared with those who were never obese, being obese for 1â4.9, 5â14.9, 15â24.9, and 25 years was associated with adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality of 1.51 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.27â1.79), 1.94 (95 % CI 1.71â2.20), 2.25 (95 % CI 1.89â2.67) and 2.52 (95 % CI 2.08â3.06), respectively. Similar patterns were found for cause-specific mortality from cardiovascular disease and cancer. The relationships were robust to adjustment for current BMI, and were reduced but not completely eliminated by adjustment for potential intermediate factors such as incident cardiovascular disease and diabetes or biomedical risk factors. A large body of research has focused on the topic of whether infancy is a sensitive period in the development of obesity and cardiovascular research. Several studies have concluded that rapid growth in infancy is importantly associated with subsequent obesity and adverse cardiovascular health (Ong et al. 2000, 2009; Ong and Loos 2006). However, these studies have generally only examined changes in weight (or weight adjusted for height) during infancy, and have not considered the associations of growth in later periods of childhood with the same outcomes. Without these comparisons (i.e. determining whether weight change in infancy is more strongly associated with later outcomes than is weight change in later childhood) it is difficult to conclude that infancy is a sensitive period. Studies on this topic have used a variety of statistical methods, often less than ideal (Tilling et al. 2011c; Tu et al. 2013) â for instance, relying on repeated z-scores, an approach which does not model the clustering of measurements within individuals and generally can only include people with complete, non-missing, data at all ages. In ALSPAC and Probit, two large studies with lots of repeated measurements of growth, we have used multilevel models to define growth trajectories across childhood (Howe et al. 2013c; Tilling et al. 2011b); an approach which is appropriate for repeated measures data and which can incorporate missing data under a missing at random assumption. In these analyses, we have not found strong support for infancy as a sensitive period in relation to a wide range of cardiometabolic risk factors, including blood pressure (central and peripheral), glucose, lipids, insulin, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Howe et al. 2010; Tilling et al. 2011a; Anderson et al. 2014). Longitudinal studies also permit in-depth examination of the ways in which the determinants of obesity act throughout the life course, potentially providing deeper aetiological insight than would be possible in cross-sectional studies. For example, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants that are associated with obesity and greater BMI in adulthood. Since BMI changes in childhood can result from changes in both height and weight, examining the effect of the genetic variants on growth trajectories in childhood can provide improved understanding of the potential mechanisms through which the genes are acting (Paternoster et al. 2011; Warrington et al. 2013; Cousminer et al. 2013). Risk scores of obesity-related genetic variants have been shown to be associated with changes in height, weight"

However, if the mutation is in the heterozygous state in the analyzed M2 plant, it is necessary to select plants that carry the mutation in the homozygous state in M3 generation. A large number of seeds are required for many phenotyping experiments, and therefore it is always recommended that the material be multiplied before analysis. Phenotypic analysis of allelic mutants identified through TILLING may reveal the function of the gene of interest. However, it has to be borne in mind that after effective mutagenesis, many mutations are generated in a plant genome. For example, in barley, whose genome size is 5.1 Gbp (IBGSC 2012), each M2 plant may carry circa 10,000 mutations, assuming that the mutation density in the TILLING population is 1/500 kb. The majority of these mutations are in intergenic regions or in introns, but there is a possibility that an M2 plant carrying a mutation in the gene of interest may also carry other mutations (in different genes) that influence the phenotype. To clean the genetic background of the mutant from unwanted mutations, backcrosses with the parent variety should be carried out. However, in order to confirm that the altered phenotype is a consequence of the identified mutation, the co-segregation analysis of the mutation and a specific phenotypic trait should be performed. The creation of a TILLING population is strictly associated with the production of a large amount of data that has to be safely stored and made available for population designers and for future users of the developed TILLING platform. Most of the available databases contain data on 5000â13,000 plants of the M2 population (reviewed by Kurowska et al. 2011). The planning and creation of a TILLING population have to be preceded by a decision about how to provide the generated data to the recipients. It should be noted that the availability of a database containing detailed information about a TILLING population on the Internet significantly increases the impact of the studies being performed (Coronel and Morris 2016). In this manual, we present a version of a database that can be shared on the Internet. There are many different ways to establish databases for a TILLING population, and various programs can be used to design them, including freeware and commercial software. For the Internet-available databases, phpMyAdmin is a useful program that allows simple and sophisticated databases to be developed that are easily accessed via the WWW. In combination with Internet platforms created using HTML and PHP languages, there are enormous possibilities for presenting,"
166,134,0.986,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"adaptations were crucial to avoid the failure of the subproject on migration, but this also involved taking some risks. The challenge was to negotiate a trade-off between biasing results by modifying contact and interviewing procedures, and not getting a final sample large enough for further analyses. To know if the rewards made the effort worthwhile, a cost-benefit analysis of the impacts of such adjustments was necessary. The most obvious cost is the loss of comparison with former Yugoslavians because of ending the fieldwork in Basel. This comparison was worthwhile because of the specific characteristics of this group. Their arrival in Switzerland was more recent than Italians and Spanish. Some former Yugoslavians came to Switzerland to seek asylum, which is not the case for the other groups of old immigrants who arrived as adults and grew old in Switzerland. They are not EU citizens and this difference in legal status may give rise to different practices compared to other elderly migrants such as not spending extended periods of time alternately in Switzerland and the country of origin. One of the good practices in surveys is to maximize cooperation or response rates within the limits of ethical treatment of human subjects. This last criterion played a major role for former Yugoslavians regarding the above-mentioned trade-off. On the other hand, such a loss was compensated by an oversample of Italians in Geneva. Having Italian oversamples in Geneva and Basel allows comparison of immigrants from the same origin but who immigrated to different regions of Switzerland, which differ in their population composition, linguistic dimension, size of urban area, and integration policies. Such comparisons should give rise to analysis of the impact of these differences on immigrant living conditions at retirement. Even if the response rate of elderly people with foreign origins remains lower than that of the main sample (see Table 2), increase in participation to the survey was an important benefit of the adjustments to the standard procedures, especially with the recruitment of new interviewers. This benefit can only be measured for the Portuguese and Spanish fieldwork because they were the first two populations for which innovating contact and interviewing procedures were introduced after having noted the difficulties of the standard procedures for these groups. Indeed, only these two projects allow a comparison between first and second wave interviewers. The following graph shows the coincidence between the increase in the response rate for the Spanish and Portuguese oversamples and the recruitment of new collaborators (Fig. 2). It is not possible to run the same analysis to observe the effect of new recruitment for the Italian oversamples in Basel and Geneva, since they immediately benefited from the experience acquired. Nevertheless, Italian oversamples also strongly profited from the snowball approach. Indeed, 55.1 % (43 out of 78 individuals) of the Italian oversample in Geneva came from the snowball approach, 54.5 % (55 out of 101 individuals) in Basel. Adjusting VLV contact procedures by introducing this technique based on a positive appreciation of the social relations within the communities contributed to more than half of the final Italian oversamples. The reader will have noticed that the initial objective of 120 respondents by nationality and canton was not achieved despite the implementation of new contact"
180,408,0.986,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"dling human resources further and straining the health care system (WHO 2008; University of Toronto Joint Center for Bioethics 2005). In anticipation of these human and physical resource shortages, hospitals, public health agencies, and states have created plans to prepare for an influenza pandemic. Such plans typically include health services, public health measures, priority setting, and resource allocation and usually direct surveillance, preparedness, and response (WHO 2010). Pandemic plans typically aim to minimize serious illness and overall deaths, but more comprehensive plans also refer to special needs of vulnerable groups. The term âvulnerable,â however, often is left undefined, and, if specified (e.g., the elderly), it usually refers to increased biological or medical risk of succumbing to or transmitting pandemic influenza (Uscher-Pines et al. 2007). Few plans refer to vulnerability in social or economic terms (Uscher-Pines et al. 2007). This lack of specificity raises questions about whether (and how) special consideration ought to differ for vulnerable conditions, such as being homeless, being immunocompromised, or living in a remote community. Even when plans do mention such vulnerabilities, have decision makers or practitioners consulted the people in these categories about their needs in such situations? (Uscher-Pines et al. 2007) More importantly, has anyone reconciled the aim of minimizing sickness and death with the oft competing aim of meeting the needs of the vulnerable? Meeting the needs of the most vulnerable while being mindful of health equity and social justice has been a long-standing tradition of public health (Beauchamp 1976; Krieger and Birn 1998). In particular, public health interventions targeting the social determinants of health have been heralded as an effective way to combat systemic inequities that lead to disparities in health outcomes (Wilson 2009). However, some challenge the notion of vulnerability as a static condition that can be predefined. Broadly defined categories of vulnerability can exclude people not traditionally seen as vulnerable (such as health care workers), while including people thought to be vulnerable who, with the right supports, can actually participate in the emergency response (e.g., retired older adults) (Mastroianni 2009). Considering and doing something about the context-specific needs of those who might be most vulnerable during a pandemic, can easily become a complex, ethically fraught task. A further complication is that the interventions taken in response to a pandemic can unintentionally render some people more vulnerable (Mastroianni 2009). Most pandemic influenza plans, for example, seem to focus on hospitals, directing attention to managing intensive care unit (ICU) bed and equipment shortages and distributing resources in high-acuity settings. Such plans often call for redeploying workers from community settings to hospital settings. Because many of these workers already work part-time in the community and hospital sectors, this option is appealing. But if workers are shifted from community health care settings to hospitals, people in the community who depend on these workers may become vulnerable from the intervention."
245,753,0.986,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"Complicating this somewhat is the fact that not all students may perceive ï¬nancial barriers in the same way. For some, a rise in costs (either in terms of fees or a change in the cost of living) might create a rate of return issue, while for others it might only cause a liquidity issue. In which case, does it make more sense for governments to offset rising costs with loans or grants? Clearly, there are some efï¬ciency arguments which come into play here, and the proportion of students who view it each way is not irrelevant to determining the correct policy; unfortunately, few if any countries bother to investigate this kind of question before formulating policy. Before examining what the evidence tells us about policy and equity, it is worthwhile reviewing some of the difï¬culties that exist in terms of being able to make deï¬nitive statements about âwhat worksâ. There are four major problems when it comes to discovering âwhat worksâ in terms of equity in higher education. The ï¬rst is the ability to collect adequate data, the second is the ability to properly attribute cause and effect, the third is the generalizability of particular results and the fourth is a tendency to re-deï¬ne the term âequityâ when results become inconvenient. To begin with the problem of data: despite the rhetorical signiï¬cance governments lay on equity in higher education, very few countries systematically collect data annually on any key equity criteria apart from gender. Not all countries in the European Union systematically collect data on the socio-economic backgrounds of students and when they do it is often simply to record parental occupation, which without corresponding information on occupational structure in the economy as a whole is not very useful in calculating participation rates. Data on ethnicityâat least in countries which have substantial minority ethnic populationsâis also absent more often than not. Data on completion rates is available only in a minority of EU countries, and of these fewer than a half-dozen provide completion-rates data on sub-populations such as socio-economic backgrounds (European Commission/ EACEA/Eurydice 2014). As a result, when policy changes are made which might affect equity, there is little evidentiary basis on which to evaluate reforms. Where high-quality policy evaluation has been done (e.g. the work of Nielsen or Baumgartner and Steiner), it has tended to come through datasets entirely unrelated to education. This problem of good national data is, it should be noted, of signiï¬cantly more importance in Europe than it is in other parts of the world. In North America, where there is considerably more policy variation within states (because of the federal nature of both Canada and the United States) and across institutions (because of wider limits on institutional autonomy), deï¬ciencies of national datasets can be made up through local surveys. In Europe, where national policies tend to be more uniform and policy entrepreneurialism at the institutional level is rarer, the policy âexperimentsâ which one might want to evaluate can often only be looked at through national-level data. The issue of cause and effect is somewhat more difï¬cult. Equity-affecting policy decisions are rarely taken in a vacuum, and isolating the effects of one particular policy can be difï¬cult. A similar example would be where a government in dire"

302,388,0.986,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"6 Conclusion Increased research on (micro)plastics has developed the picture that (micro)plastic pollution is ubiquitous. Microplastics have been detected in rivers in Europe (e.g., Danube, [70]), as well as in lakes in Mongolia [50] and the USA [59]. They cross state boarders, passing from rivers into lakes, and finally into the global common, the ocean. They also cross the boundaries between single organisms, accumulating in the food web. From a social-ecological perspective, the risk induces a vibrancy and resonance in socioeconomic, political, and public spheres. Thus, the theses we have presented and their corresponding data clearly identify microplastics as a global risk, leading to the following conclusions regarding further research areas: Based on an understanding of the risks posed by microplastics as an unintended side effect of the everyday mode of societies, the global dimensions of production and distribution patterns need to be researched in more depth. In many countries of the Global South, a new middle income class with a high demand for plastic products is growing. Relations between the Global North and the Global South need to be addressed more adequately, regarding the production, distribution, consumption, disposal, and leakage into the environment of plastic-packaged products like fast-moving consumer goods. Due to the complexity of the microplastics phenomenon, its assessment is difficult and requires further scientific investigations to establish the evidence in order to properly address the environmental risk. The same holds true for the assessment of the human health risks. This uncertainty impedes risk management decisions, but nevertheless action is required despite a lack of clear evidence, because microplastics are perceived as a threat by society. Therefore, as the complexity of the phenomenon may never be entirely resolved, future research should also focus on the question of how to handle uncertainty and manage complex global risks. Although it is common sense that plastics should not be allowed to accumulate in the environment, much less consensus exists regarding the strategies needed to achieve this. As Shaxson [58] points out, the question âHow can we make plastics sustainable?â is just too broad and unstructured to enable all the interest groups to speak with one voice. Strategies to combat pollution range from reuse, green chemistry, designs for recycling, improved waste management, standardized labeling, education, cleaning programs, and sustainable consumption. Not a single strategy is required, but each sector needs to be active. However, current debates show that responsibilities are often shifted elsewhere. Thus, identifying the risk producers is not straightforward, as some voices do not regard plastics as the source of the problem but rather their improper disposal; other voices emphasize the design of the plastic material, and yet others target consumer behavior. Risk management is about the negotiation of evidence and values. We should not stop at symbolic goals, like the G7 Action Plan [71], but move on to binding regulations. Research should focus on developing and testing mechanisms to call risk producers to account, for example, with the integration of costs in the benefits, extended producersâ responsibility, cost of inaction analysis, etc."
214,261,0.986,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Changing water availability affects industry and also affects agriculture. Agricultural land (pasture and cropland) has very different surface properties than natural vegetation, which can result in signiï¬cant differences in evapotranspiration, affecting precipitation, and albedo, affecting surface temperature. Changes in precipitation and temperature in turn feedback on crops: requiring changes to crop types or additional irrigation water if available. All of these feedbacks can be predicted and modeled, with varying degrees of ï¬delity. Ultimately, human systems like industry, energy, and agriculture respond to price signals from the economic system. The costs of energy and agriculture are affected by the natural environment. This is most obvious with agriculture: Rrain and temperatures strongly affect crop yields and the necessity for irrigation. Then crop yields in different regions affect overall prices for crops, the mix of crops, and ultimately the economic system. Many terrestrial systems models are starting to include complex representations of the physical side of the anthroposphere: agriculture and urban environments. Agriculture is a signiï¬cant fraction (one-third) of total land area,20 so it has a large physical effect. The effect of urban areas is signiï¬cant as well due to signiï¬cantly different albedo and evaporation characteristics of hard (nonporous) surfaces common in densely built-up areas (roofs and roads). The extent of urban area (less than 0.5 % of the total land area) is small. However, cities have a large impact because of the intensity and magnitude of their emissions. It is also important to simulate urban areas because cities are home to half of the global population. Simulation of urban environments generally starts as a discrete land surface type in a model, but it may evolve to have its own emission characteristics as well. There are many varieties of economic models. Economic models range from simple supply-and-demand curves (an economic model of a single product in a spreadsheet), to complex models of entire economies or even the global economy. Such macroeconomic or sectoral models typically have similar supply-and-demand curves for different regions of the planet and different economic activities that are interdependent, and can be solved for a solution to all these supply-and-demand equations that end up yielding predictions of economic output and prices. These economic system models encompass the Industry, Energy, and Agricultural sectors of the Human Systems box in Fig. 7.9.21 Economic models can also be coupled with the climate and environmental factors. Climate factors can alter supply-and-demand curves (crop yields based on weather, for example). The result of these feedbacks is ultimately to alter the trajectory of human systems to react to changes in the environment: If climate changes, crops may not be viable in certain regions, and the economy and society will adapt. Some regions will suffer, but other regions may beneï¬t from increased crop yields in colder climates that have warmed, and this also needs to be factored"
337,328,0.986,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"example of a scenario that Samburu residents asked us to include, given their interest in intensifying their livestock management. A program is in place now, led by C. Lesorogol, to introduce enhanced and highly productive goat breeds into Siambu. In a scenario, attributes of goats are modified to represent mixed herds of local and enhanced breeds, and effects on livelihoods judged (6). Residents asked us to explore the implications of improved crop yields on livelihoods (7). This scenario addresses a variety of management options, streamlined so as to be amenable to simulation with our tools. For example, land owners struggle to decide whether increased production from high-yield seed stocks outweigh their increased costs, whether to invest in chemical fertilizers (very few do in the region), investing in water projects for irrigation, and the usefulness versus costs of drought tolerant seeds. The last scenario (8) compares the costs and benefits of increasing or decreasing veterinary care for livestock. Residents seek to balance the money they spend on veterinary care with the benefits they receive through improved livestock health and survival. We used an application of SAVANNA and DECUMA to Mbaringon to address this scenario. These preliminary results report outcomes from three simulations (baseline, increased livestock survival by 3 %, decreased by 3 %); in practice we do 20 or more simulations of each type to yield error estimates. Such a seemingly small change in survival for large herbivores can have dramatic impacts on population dynamics. In this example, Fig. 9.2 (top) shows about a 1 tropical livestock unit (TLUs) increase for each adult equivalent (AE). These metrics are methods of standardizing livestock of different species (e.g., a cattle is 1 TLU, and a sheep or goat is 0.1 TLU) and humans of different ages and sexes (e.g., an adult male is 1 AE, and a child 6â12 years old is 0.85 AE) (Boone et al. 2011). Figure 9.2 (bottom) demonstrates one of the many linkages within the SAVANNA-DECUMA integrated system. The average proportion of householdsâ diets composed of supplemental food decreases when more funds are spent on veterinary care. This must be weighed against the costs of the improved care."
267,362,0.986,"Microfinance, Eu Structural Funds and Capacity Building For Managing Authorities : a Comparative Analysis of European Convergence Regions","The economic crisis that has gripped the developed countries in recent years has contributed to exacerbating a number of chronic issues that have long characterised their social and economic systems, in particular those related to the gap between a limited number of wealthy individuals and growing sectors of the population that struggle to make ends meet and fail to secure a minimum level of subsistence. From this perspective, with an eye on a number of some consolidated microfinance and microcredit experiences, this study represents a first attempt to affirm microinsurance not simply as a phenomenon catering exclusively to the most vulnerable strata (or the totality, in some cases) of the population, often far away (not only geographically) from the âdevelopedâ countries, but also as an âalternativeâ form of providing insurance services, which, following proper operational and regulatory adjustments, could be applied also to advanced economies in order to meet the demand and needs of those subjects traditionally excluded from the âconventionalâ insurance circuit. Obviously, several obstacles may hinder the full-scale development of this new model of providing insurance. As already mentioned, first of all there are regulatory obstacles, which may considerably prevent potential microinsurance providers from entering this market; to this must be added operational hurdles, including strictly technical problems (e.g., the creation of pools of insurers allowing for an effective management of the risks undertaken) as well as strategic issues (assessing, e.g., the opportunity â besides the mere economic convenience â of entering the microinsurance business), commercial (e.g., the"
233,528,0.986,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"survey coverage, whether coastal or oceanic, is very limited (Jewell et al. 2012). Less than 25 % of the ocean surface has been surveyed and only 6 % has been covered frequently enough to allow estimations of population trends (Kaschner et al. 2012). In addition, spatial coverage is also signiï¬cantly biased towards some ocean basins. Karchner et al. (2012) reported that with the exception of Antarctic waters, survey coverage was biased toward the northern hemisphere, especially US and northern European waters, which may explain the consensus among methods identifying the Aleutian and Hawaiian Islands as CPAs. Nevertheless, despite this potential data bias most CPAs were found in the southern hemisphere, suggesting that phylogenetic conservation priority methods do not simply reï¬ect sampling effort, but identify areas that contain aquatic mammal communities including both evolutionarily unique species and those at risk. As we discussed in our methods, CPAs were the result from the cumulative values for each metric in each cell. Thus CPAs may reï¬ect a large number of species varying in conservation priority values or possibly only a few species with high values. The later seems to be the case for Hawaii, Nouadhibou, Madeira Island, Yangtze river, and Southern Brazil-Argentina where highly evolutionary unique species are endemic to those areas (Table 2). Other CPAs such as California, Southern Australia and New Zealand include many species, but only some of which are evolutionarily unique species. These areas are part of ranges of several species with very broad distribution ranges such as the sperm whale, pygmy and dwarf sperm whales, and blue whale. Interestingly, previous studies that have used species richness to identify âhotspotâ of aquatic mammal diversity (Pompa et al. 2011) and a combination of levels of imperilment with intrinsic and extrinsic factors to identify high risk areas for aquatic mammals (Davidson et al. 2011) agree with the CPAs identiï¬ed here. Davidson et al. (2011) identiï¬ed ï¬ve major global hotspots of marine mammal species at risk. Within these major hotpots several locations overlap with those found in this study: Aleutian Islands, Alaska, California, Galapagos, Patagonia, South Africa, Japan, Indonesia, South Australia, and New Zealand. Pompa et al. (2011) identiï¬ed nine âhotspotsâ based solely on species richness and 11 irreplaceable key conservation sites, based on the presence of endemic species, ï¬ve of these sites Hawaiian and Galapagos Islands, Mediterranean Sea, and the Yangtze river network were also identiï¬ed as CPAs. Finally, Kashner et al. (2011) using an environmental suitability model predicted highest marine mammal richness in New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, Galapagos, the Southeast Paciï¬c and Southern Ocean, all congruent with our study. Within the CPAs identiï¬ed here we highlight the presence of several top ranking conservation priority species among those are the extant monk seals (see Table 2). The UICN has estimated a 68 % reduction of Hawaiian monk seal abundance in the past 49 years, and projects an 86 % reduction in the next 15 years. The future for the Mediterranean monk seal seems bleak, current population estimates are about 350â 450 individuals (IUCN 2013). The Cap Blanc population in Nouadhibou is probably the most threatened, with less than 220 individuals. This is the last population with colonial structure, so its loss would also lead to the loss of a peculiar behavior amongst monk seals (e.g., Gonzalez 2006; Martinez-Jauregui et al. 2012; Gonzalez"

Despite this, some questions remain concerning both the chronologies of the transgressionâregression phases of the prehistoric Baltic Sea basins and their spatial characteristics.

233,382,0.986,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"but rather by sample completeness (Alroy 2010; Jost 2010; Chao and Jost 2012). Completeness, when measured by a statistic known as coverage (Good 1953), is the proportion of individuals in a community that are represented by species in a sample from that community (Chao and Jost 2012). When samples differ in their coverage, they should be standardised to equal coverage before a âfairâ comparison can be made. Much like expected species richness, the coverage of a sample can be estimated from the sample size and the distribution of individuals among the species in the sample (Chao and Jost 2012). Given that standardisation by sample completeness has been shown to yield a less biased comparison of species richness between communities (Chao and Jost 2012), it would be desirable to have a similar method of standardisation for PD. Since rarefaction of coverage is mathematically related to rarefaction of sample size, the recent work on estimating PD from sample size will no doubt form the basis from which estimated PD for sample coverage will be developed. Finally, a general issue when considering any PD measure is uncertainty regarding the length of branches and the topology (branching pattern) of the tree. All PD measures (including those presented here) assume that the branch lengths and their arrangement in the tree are perfectly known. This is obviously an abstraction, although PD can be surprisingly robust to this source of variation (Swenson 2009). One solution to this dilemma is to calculate PD, including rarefied PD, for a large number of possible trees and report the mean and confidence limits. The output from a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis is a large number of trees, each with their own topology and corresponding branch lengths (see for example Jetz et al. 2012) and so lends itself well to this approach. However, when the possible trees number in the thousands and tens of thousands, this is obviously computationally intensive. An analytical solution, directly incorporating uncertainty into the calculation, would therefore be desirable. This is not an easy extension of the PD rarefaction solution because both variation in branch length and topology (affecting the probability of encountering internal branches) would need to be taken into account. It is worth remembering that phylogenetic relationships are not the only source of uncertainty when investigating real ecological communities â neither the abundance, nor even the presence (occupancy), of species are necessarily known with precision."
365,702,0.986,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Despite the limitations of the analysis conducted here, some conclusions can be drawn. First, from a technical perspective, there appear to exist no âsilver bulletsâ for achieving climate-smart mixed systems. While this echoes the conclusions of the semi-quantitative analysis in Thornton and Herrero (2014), here we looked at a much wider range of possible interventions than was done there. Triple wins undoubtedly exist, but technical recommendations over broad domains that will work in all or even most circumstances may not be appropriate. Second, from an adoption perspective, a range of different constraints exist that may impede the widespread adoption of all these innovations. These may be to do with investment and/or running costs and access to technology and knowledge of how to implement it, as well as social acceptability and local governance issues. In different contexts, these may conspire to prevent the incremental and transformational shifts that may be needed to result in more climate smart agriculture in many places. Third, for some of the interventions evaluated, there are significant trade-offs between meeting shorter-term food production or food security objectives and longer-term resilience objectives. This applies particularly to crop residue management and altering the integration of crops and livestock within the system, but also to several other interventions (nutrient, soil, water management; grazing management; changing"

The review statement, comments of the expert and any responses to recommendations by the reviewer(s) must be included in the LCA report (ISO 14040:2006). Since life cycle assessments are often rather extensive and the amounts of input/output data, flows and factors are very large, several calculation softwares have been developed to help the calculations. They often include generic databases and some impact assessment methodologies which are helpful in calculations. SimaPro, GaBi and SULCA can be mentioned as examples of LCA calculation tools (Loijos 2012; VTT 2014). Naturally, like every method, LCA has its limitations, for example, inclusion of biodiversity, littering, or animal well-being may be difï¬cult in the calculations, due to lacking data and limitations in impact categories (Finkbeiner et al. 2014). Such challenges and limitations must be considered and recognized in the goal and scope deï¬nition phase when using the method."
71,1336,0.986,Advancing Culture of Living with Landslides: Volume 1 ISDR-ICL Sendai Partnerships 2015-2025 (Volume 1.0),"Discussion The increase in mitigation efforts and resultant costs in the study area (Southern Lower Saxony and Northern Hesse) is linked with increased risk awareness. The risk management in the Upper Weser area follows a cycle of event with a short-term response in terms of material removal from the affected site, recovery, which means the reinstatement of the infrastructure, and mitigation measures. Finally, a period of awareness/preparation should follow (Crozier and Glade 2005; Alexander 2002) to maintain high sensibility to the risk. That includes investments into existing mitigation measures. Instead, public awareness to landslide vulnerability decreases and subsequently mitigation measures are neglected which may result in a decrease of structural integrity. As a consequence, landslide events cannot be prevented and instead dysfunctional mitigation measures become more damaging than before (i.e., loose wire meshes and wooden planks from barriers). With a new phase of landslide events the risk management cycle starts from the beginning. Public risk awareness raises and new mitigation measures are installed. An increase in mitigation effort and costs is intensiï¬ed by technical standards. Introduced in the 1960 s technical standards are created to deï¬ne slope stability and calculate modes of failure (cf. Eurocode 2014). With the technical development the standards for slope stability increased and consequently mitigation measures become outdated and must be reconstructed. The trend of installing cost intensive and maybe oversized mitigation measures is enhanced by producers of relevant systems. Technical warranties of 50 years and more are common, even though construction engineers argue that these numbers are hardly realistic. Decision makers in transportation ofï¬ces and involved communities might be under the impression that measures with extended warranties"
191,157,0.986,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Discussion In this chapter, we have described how the CPC-CBT intervention aimed to reduce the risk of re-victimisation and to increase the wellbeing of children who have been exposed to parental physical violence. We have also described how the method has been implemented in Sweden. Some noteworthy results can be highlighted from the ongoing Swedish research. We identified significantly reduced trauma symptoms in children at post-treatment, reported by children as well as parents. The abused children in the study reported high levels of various potentially traumatic experiences beyond being the victims of physical violence. The findings underline the need to organise relevant support and intervention for children so as to reduce traumatic stress. The treatment components in CPC-CBT seem to meet those needs and to support children by increasing their well-being. Parents reported significantly more consistency in their child-rearing and less use of corporal punishment after treatment. One of the aims of the treatment is to support parents in developing alternative, non-violent parenting skills and improved"

None of the three pastoral groups really recovered from their many years of dispossession in their respective countries and within the Ilemi. Livestock mortality continued at a high level, as village survey in both northern Turkana and Dasanech areas indicate (Chaps. 7 and 9). Herd sizes plummeted for the vast majority of households and villages. The pastoralistsâ longstanding strategies for recovery outlined above have proven insufï¬cient for a massive proportion of the northern Turkana and Dasanech in particular, so tens of thousands of them turned to the only remaining resource systems available to themâat the Omo River and along the shores of Lake Turkana. By the 1980s, the Omo delta had expanded considerably considerably, offering new resource availability for that helped local communities cope with the effects of earlier territorial losses (see Fig. 1.2). The general patterns of migration, or relocation to the Omo River and to Lake Turkana are indicated in Fig. 4.6. Households continue to herd whatever livestock they have leftâoften by combining herds and cooperating in labor for stock camps, including in distant areas where still possible. Along the Omo River, most of the locales for flood recession agriculture are already spoken for as this large displaced population searches for possible planting land and for livestock grazing and watering locales. Well-established social and material exchange patterns between the Dasanech and Turkana, like those of nearby ethnic groups (Fig. 1.6), have altered with these settlement shifts and accompanying changes in mobility and economy (see Chap. 7 for changes in the traditionally complex strategies for household/village level herd management since the 1970s). The Omo River and Lake Turkana are central to the present day seasonal shifts in survival strategies of the Dasanech, Nyangatom and northern Turkana peoples. Their general seasonal patterns are represented in Fig. 4.7â patterns for herding, planting and ï¬shing that are conditioned by major shifts in the character of water and biological resources of the river and lake, as well as precipitation levels and other conditions in the broader region. The relatively recent major spike in livelihood dependency on the Omo River and Lake Turkana resources by transboundary residents leaves them vulnerable in the extreme to radical reduction of river and lake waters. The precipitous drop in river flow volume and shoreline retreat of the lake caused by the Gibe III dam and dam enabled irrigated agriculture spell unprecedented disaster for the regionâs indigenous population."

We also consider the evolution of ranaviruses with a focus on local adaptation and virulence, which is important to understand in light of the growing evidence that ranaviruses are being moved around the world by human activities. We end by returning to the impacts of ranaviruses on their hosts, considering whether ranaviruses can cause host extinctions."
214,390,0.986,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"Different strategies can be used to better quantify the different types of uncertainty in climate model projections. One of the best, which can be used for quantifying all three types of uncertainty, is to run ensembles, or multiple simulations. These simulations are typically done to gauge one kind of uncertainty, but they can be appropriately mixed and matched to understand all three types of uncertainty. The use of ensembles is now also common in weather forecasting. Weather forecasting suffers from model uncertainty and especially initial condition uncertainty, but usually not scenario uncertainty as we have described it. However, sometimes external events such as ï¬re smoke can signiï¬cantly affect the weather. In weather forecasting, ensembles of a forecast model are typically run in parallel: multiple model runs at the same time. Then the spread of results of these parallel runs is analyzed. The simulations usually differ from each other by perturbing the initial conditions (slight variations in temperature, for example) and/or by altering the parameters in the model. Sometimes forecasters consult different models, creating another sort of ensemble. Altering initial conditions tests the initial condition"

Peter Sainsburyâs study, Suicide in London (1955), for example, noted higher numbers in the West End and North West areas and lower rates in Southern boroughs and many of the large working class districts.170 His research clearly documented higher rates among men, but âdid not extract any particular environmental factor that appeared to determine this differential sex incidenceâ.171 Other studies tested hypotheses relating to a range of variables such as class, age, the loss of a spouse, divorce and isolation. American research indicated that suicide was more common in the lower classes; however, in Britain, there were no specific investigations on class and suicide during the period.172 In research published much later during the 1990s, the psychiatrist Norman Kreitman, who wrote widely on suicide and depression, argued that suicide was significantly more common among classes IV and V, echoing findings across the Atlantic.173 Kreitman and his colleagues suggested that suicide was associated with social deprivation, chronic mental illness and alcohol abuse. Downward social drift and unemployment were also noted to be key factors in suicide â both factors that were more common in the lower social classes.174 In contrast, F. A. Whitlock found that suicide was generally more common in the more affluent classes. With specific relation to sex differences, he noted that male suicides were particularly connected with loneliness and isolation, especially in old age, and that males who were vulnerable to suicide appeared also to express themselves in other violent ways.175 These key factors were to be developed in more recent debates about the different ways in which men and women express distress. However, Whitlock acknowledged that, at that time, existing research could say very little about the mental health of communities or about the prevalence of mental illness and alcoholism â which, as will be demonstrated in Chapter 3, were closely correlated. Summing up, he concluded that âany attempt to bracket together the epidemiological findings in male and female suicide will scarcely do justice to the complexity of circumstances that vary according to the age and sex of the patientâ.176 Psychiatrists and physicians were keen to find ways of preventing suicide by investigating whether those who had succeeded had made earlier attempts and by examining whether or not individuals"
391,114,0.986,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"1.2.1.2 DMS Yield Given the many conversion pathways that originate from DMSP, it is difficult to assess what fraction of DMSP ultimately ends up as atmospheric DMS. As a general rule, the fraction of DMSP produced that is emitted to the atmosphere as DMS is thought to be between 1 % and 10 % (Bates et al. 1994). This far larger DMSP pool therefore leaves room for a several-fold change in the DMS flux, which could arise when shifts in any of the conversion pathways occur. Unfortunately, there is no database of DMSP concentrations comparable to the one for DMS, which makes it difficult to verify underlying ecosystem pathways (see Chap. 5 for discussion of such databases). The potential for shifts in the DMS yield from DMSP can be illustrated with four scenarios (Fig. 1.1). The terms âLowâ and âHigh DMSPâ refer to variation in the species composition of a system, where one system is comprised of species that do not produce large amounts of DMSP â such as diatoms, prochlorophytes and cyanophytes â and the other of species that do produce DMSP â such as haptophytes, chrysophytes and dinoflagellates (Stefels et al. 2007). The term âHigh stressâ refers to conditions that adversely affect algal or bacterial physiology, such as nutrient limitation and light inhibition."
241,1269,0.986,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"tourism industry will be largely positive in the Baltic Sea region although the costs of maintaining the attractiveness of this region as a tourist destination may increase in the southern and south-western coastal areas (e.g. costs for beach cleaning, coastal protection and beach nourishment). Private tourism operators have short planning horizons of 1â5 years. Adaptation to long-term processes such as climate change is therefore rarely discussed. At the same time, tourism plays a major role in the spatial development of many Baltic Sea regions, which have planning horizons of 10â30 years. According to Schumacher and Stybel (2009), tourism adaptation strategies are discussed at senior policy level, but there are few examples of adaptation strategies in practice. The wide range of possible adaptation measures (Schumacher and Stybel 2009) necessitates cooperation with adjacent sectors such as urban and regional planning, coastal protection, nature protection, health, water management and forestry. Transport and its various sub-sectors of road, rail, air and sea play an important role in all economic sectors and are all affected by climate change. The costs of climate change on the transport sector are uncertain and difï¬cult to calculate (Koetse and Rietveld 2009). There are likely to be changes in passenger and freight transport, as well as damage to existing transport infrastructure causing congestion in urban complexes. For example, a heat wave may have costly impacts on rail systems. The costs of a heat wave in London and surrounding areas in 2003 were estimated at GB 750,000 (Love et al. 2010). Maritime transport within the Baltic Sea would also be affected. Coastal transportation infrastructure is vulnerable to sea-level rise and more frequent storm surges. Disruption in supply chains can have a devastating impact on the regional economy. For example, it is estimated that Hurricane Katrina caused damage estimated at USD 1.7 billion and affected business in over 30 US states (Becker et al. 2012). In a global review of sea ports, port authorities stated that sea-level rise is likely to have negative impacts on their port that systematic adaptation is not taking place and that more research is needed (Becker et al. 2012). The insurance sector is the part of the ï¬nancial sector that is likely to be most important in terms of climate change as it can be a means to limit damage and spread risk. The insurance sector can help society to reduce the costs of adaptation by risk sharing, but climate change can also affect the insurance sector itself, causing the sector to consider heightened risk in setting premiums and risk management (Mills 2005). Insurers must therefore set premiums in a way that is ï¬nancially viable by attempting to predict the frequency and severity of insured losses based on expected, rather than historical risk (Gasper et al. 2011). Insurance practices vary by country. Within the Baltic Sea region, flood damage is privately insurable in Germany, while there is no insurance for storm surges (Botzen and van den Bergh"
229,112,0.986,Constructions of Cancer in Early Modern England,"4.1 Cancerous growth In the twenty-first century, âmalignancyâ is most often used to describe the propensity of cancer to grow and spread throughout the body. Early modern medical practitioners, as I will show, used âmalignancyâ in a broader sense. Nonetheless, they too were keenly aware that cancer was an invasive disease. Why, they asked, did some cancers grow so large that they developed into ulcers, while others disseminated to diverse parts of the body? Over several hundred years, medical practitioners of all kinds devoted much attention to describing cancerâs disturbing tendency to increase and spread. A 1651 edition of the popular Directory for Midwives, for example, delineated the progress of breast cancer as âa little tubercle, no bigger than a pease, [which] ... grows up by degrees, and spreads out roots with Veins about itâ, while The Compleat Midwifeâs Practice stated that cancers âsometimes remain for two years together, no bigger than a Bean; afterwards it grows to be as big as a Nut, then to the bigness of an Egg; and after that increasing to a larger sizeâ.6 Such descriptions followed a widespread trend when they compared the incipient tumour with familiar objects distinguished by their potential to grow or bring forth life; elsewhere, medical practitioners described tumours as growing from the size of a pea, nut or bean, to that of a Crown, egg or even a small melon.7 The primary object of interest in such discussions was the single cancerous tumour which grew larger and larger. Less commonly, however, medical writers noted that tumours might also appear in relatively distant parts of the body â in modern terms, metastasise. For instance, the anonymous writer of An Account of the Causes of Some Particular Rebellious Distempers added the following note of caution to their promises of a cure for incipient cancers: If a Cancer in the Breast proceeds from malignant Humours or corrosive Salts in the Blood, it is generally incurable ... or if in some it"

371,327,0.986,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"Nevertheless, under the free movement of the labour force granted within the European Union by the Treaty, and given the staggering unemployment rates observed in the South, one might expect higher rates of internal migratory flows, even in the official statistics. One plausible explanation for these otherwise âsurprisinglyâ low levels of current South to North migratory flows arises when considering that international migration is often yet another form of rural to urban migration of the young and the middle aged. Due to past declines in fertility rates (see Billari and Kohler 2004; Frejka and Sardon 2004), the size of the 20â34 year old cohorts in South Europe decreased substantially between 1965 and 2014 (to around 2.4 million smaller in Spain and 0.7 million smaller in Italy). Moreover, as Southern European countries are now far more urbanized than in the post-war context, this driver of Southern European migration has also lost momentum (HeikkilÃ¤ and Kashinoro 2009). Over time, these demographic changes that have affected Southern Europe since the 1970s have contributed to a significant reduction in the pool of potential migrants from this region of Europe. In addition to this, one must also bear in mind that current potential southern migrants often lack informal networks of their fellow countrymen in the destination countries, and this limits their ability to establish a foothold there. Demographic changes in the South of Europe must thus be related to the lack of availability of family networks in destination countries for younger generations of potential southern migrants. Young unemployed southerners are no longer concentrated in rural areas lacking basic services, as they were during the post-war years, but instead live in well-equipped urban towns and cities, quite often in parental households. Their parents did not migrate to northern countries, or else they returned long ago, leaving no strong links there. Consequently, nowadays, typically southern family networks favour staying at home to cope with unemployment or they take on precarious employment rather than migrating. On the other hand, if they do migrate, this may be only temporarily, while remaining registered as residents in the parental household of the native country in order to avoid losing welfare benefits, such as free and straightforward access to public health care. There is a well-documented literature on the impact of transnational networks on migration flows and patterns of labour market incorporation. At the individual or household level, support from ethnic networks reduces the costs of migration and adaptation into the host society and labour market. At the macro-social level, these networks determine the direction and intensity of migration flows (Gurak and Caces 1992; Espinosa and Massey 1999). However, as established in the literature, the durability of transnational links is a critical condition for networks to play a role for newcomers. When there are important time gaps between migration waves, the links between old and new migration waves may be weak. In this case, the links between migrant communities and the home country can become purely symbolic and therefore of little use for the socio-economic integration of newcomers (Bruneau 2010). In this regard, the case of post-crisis Southern European migration is very illustrative. The gradual decrease in the volume of emigration from Italy, Spain and Greece after the 1970s Oil Crisis created a considerable time gap between the post-war and the new cohorts of migrants. We believe that this missing generational link has contributed to keeping the volume of outflows from these countries relatively low."

Results from both descriptive statistics and regressions indicate that functional difficulties have significant and large associations with both individual and household deprivations in Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda. This is found through an indicator-by-indicator analysis as well as through an assessment of multidimensional poverty. There are four wellbeing dimensions for which functional difficulties were systematically associated with deprivations in the four countries: education, morbidity, employment, and economic security. Some persons with functional difficulties do achieve levels of wellbeing comparable to persons with no difficulty. The association between functional difficulties and deprivations was found for both severe and moderate functional difficulties, although it was typically larger and more often significant for the former.

87,869,0.986,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","the preservation and sustainable provision of common-pool goods. Externalities The most important cause of market failure in the environmental sector is the existence of so-called external effects. An external effect exists, if an economic activity of one economic agent (household or firm) has an impact on another economic agentâs objective function (e.g., a utility function or profit function) where this agent has no control over the effect. If the external effect is positive, we speak of an external benefit; if it is negative, it is called an external cost. Especially external costs are responsible for the deterioration of environmental quality. Examples are the pollution of air, soil, and water as a by-product of the production or consumption of market goods. If a river or lake or a groundwater aquifer is polluted by the toxic wastewater of a production plant, this has consequences for the profits of other firms (e.g., fishermen living at the same lake or river or producers of mineral water from that aquifer), but also households using that lake for recreation or receiving their drinking water from that groundwater aquifer are affected. Without government regulations, they have no possibilities to influence the extent of pollution or to stop it. But also households can cause externalities affecting other households (e.g., car driving leading to particulate matter pollution in our cities) or firms (e.g., by burning garden rubbish in the neighborhood of a hotel or an open-air restaurant). Households and firms together cause negative externalities on the world climate by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thereby affecting the profit functions of producers (e.g., farmers) and the utility functions of households all over the world. The bioeconomy addresses especially this problem by developing new alternative products and new technologies which use less carbon-based inputs and cause less CO2 emissions than traditional production processes. Markets alone ignore the existence of external costs and benefits since the prices of market commodities equal the marginal utility of households consuming these commodities on"
110,277,0.986,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"Index-Based Insurance In recent years, index-based insurance schemes have emerged as an innovative and cost-efficient risk management tool that nurtures the hope of policymakers, donors, and development organizations that marginal and small farmers in developing countries can be provided with better support in managing their exposure to agricultural perils. In such insurance, indemnity payments are based on an index such as cumulative rainfall or aggregate crop yields in a geographical area, and not on the individual farmerâs loss incurred. Unlike in traditional crop insurance products, asymmetric information problems play a much smaller role in index-based insurance schemes. Firstly, a farmer mostly has little more information than the insurer regarding the index value, and secondly the index value cannot be influenced by individual farmers. Finally, administration costs are much lower as it does not require verification of individual loss claims, making it more affordable particularly for small and marginal farmers. The development of index-based insurance is still at an early stage. Many index initiatives in developing countries have been supported by the donor community and the international reinsurance market. Most of the weather-based crop insurance programs are still under pilot implementation, with only few farmers insured so far. Hence, it is too early to judge their success, except in India where 400,000 farmers purchased weather-based crop insurance in 2008 (Mahul and Stutley, 2010). At present, the pilots face a number of technical and other obstacles such as the lack of high-quality weather data, inadequate distribution of weather stations, limited supply of people with risk-modeling capabilities and expertise in agricultural risk management, and weaknesses in regulatory and legal infrastructure. These problems hamper the pace of progress.13 Another obstacle for the mechanism is climate change. This is imposing a long-term trend of increasing risk, making the insurance approach more difficult to apply and more expensive (Doran et al., 2009). A major disadvantage of index-based insurance is the so-called basis risk, i.e. the risk that payouts (triggered by an index) may not correspond with the losses a farmer actually incurs. The basis risk may be substantial, making it difficult for farmers to understand and accept (Skees, 2008). In addition, (re)insurance companies are reluctant to take the reputation risk associated with possible negative media coverage if poor farmers in developing countries are not indemnified for their losses although they bought insurance cover (Levin and Reinhard, 2007). Hence, the central challenge of index-based insurance products is to overcome the problems linked to the basis risk. Catastrophic Risk and Market Failure: Risk Transfer to Government Catastrophic events like natural disasters and extreme weather events generate very large and highly correlated losses, even if their frequency is low.

In this case stream and river flows can be deï¬ned by simple mass balance or continuity equations. For shorter duration time periods flow routing may be required. The actual length or duration of each within-year period deï¬ned in a model may vary from period to period. Modeled time period time periods need not be equal. Generally what is important is to capture in the model the needed capacities of infrastructure that are determined in large measure by the variation in supplies and demands. These variations should be captured in the model by appropriately selecting the number and duration of time periods. If say over a three-month period there is little variation in both water supplies and demands or for the purposes water serves, such as flood control, hydropower, or recreation, there is no need to divide that three-month period into multiple time periods. Another important factor to consider in making a decision regarding the number and duration of time periods to include in any model is the purpose for which the model is to be used. Some analyses are concerned only with identifying designs designs and operating policies of various engineering projects for managing water resources at some ï¬xed time (say a typical year) in the future. Multiple years of hydrological records are used, usually in simulation models, to obtain an estimate of just how well a system might perform, at least in a statistical sense, in that future time period. The within-year period durations can have an impact on those performance indicator values as well as on the estimate of over-year as well as within-year storage that may be needed to meet various goals. These static analyses are not concerned with investment project scheduling or sequencing. Dynamic planning models are used to estimate the impacts of changing conditions over time. These changes could include hydrological inputs, economic, environmental and other objectives, water demands, and design and operating parameters. As a result, dynamic models generally span many more years than do"
230,37,0.986,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"1.7 Mitigation Measures and Long-Term Changes in Marine Litter One of the major challenges in addressing the marine plastics problem is the diverse nature of plastic products, and the many routes they can follow to enter marine systems (Pruter 1987; Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, a diversity of mitigation measures is needed to tackle the problem. Initial efforts focused on two specific user groups, shipping/fisheries and the plastics industry, at least in part because they are relatively discrete user groups, and thus are more easily addressed (at least in theory). Shipping was a major source of marine litter (Scott 1972; Horsman 1982). Dumping persistent plastic wastes from land-based sources at sea was banned under the Convention on the Prevention of Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (London Dumping Convention, promulgated in 1972; Lentz 1987), but operational wastes generated by vessels were exempt until Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL, promulagated in 1973) came into force at the end of 1988 (www.imo.org). Since then considerable effort has been expended to ensure there"
36,464,0.986,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"6. Detailed meta-analyses of existing data on cumulative fatality impacts and factors influencing fatalities are needed. It should be noted that data disclosure from many sites by some companies hinders such analyses. We strongly encourage developers to follow guidelines (e.g., Kunz et al. 2007b; Rodrigues et al. 2015; Strickland et al. 2011; Bat Conservation Ireland 2012) consistently when implementing pre- and post-construction monitoring. Data should be placed into the public domain or preferably published in refereed journals. There are a number of policies, regulatory, and communication challenges we face in protecting bats while developing wind energy responsibly across the globe (Arnett 2012). Unless there is a federal, state, or provincial nexus, most research, siting, and mitigation efforts by wind energy developers and operating companies will be voluntary, likely without regard for cumulative effects. Sites that do trigger a regulatory nexus will usually be driven by endangered species issues (e.g., Indiana bats in the USA). It is apparent most local jurisdictional entities, regardless of country, lack experience in wildlife science, and unless they coordinate with their wildlife or natural resource agency specialists, concerns about bat fatalities may never be addressed in decision making for wind energy development. Another key issue is consistent application of regulations. The authors have encountered many situations where different individuals had varied interpretations of the same law or guidance policy, and this creates untenable situations, considerable uncertainty, consternation, and lack of trust among stakeholders that seems completely unnecessary and easily remedied (Arnett 2012). We encourage continuing cooperation among all stakeholders, gathering needed information, avoiding construction in high-risk sites, considering cumulative effects, and implementing mitigation where needed even when no regulatory process is triggered (Arnett 2012; Arnett and Baerwald 2013). Wind energy developers should, however, be treated fairly and consistently to ensure proactive measures are implemented. Arnett (2012) noted that when some companies choose to cooperate, while others may not, unnecessary angst is generated and deters resolving wildlife impacts and other issues. Decision making must be based on the best available science. Also, consistent policy, accountability, effective siting and mitigation strategies, and a âlevel-playing fieldâ for the industry (i.e., consistent requirements and incentives for all companies) are fundamental if we are to successfully develop wind energy that protects bats and other wildlife.

180,264,0.986,Public Health Ethics : Cases Spanning The Globe (Volume 3.0),"lack of evidence. The authors acknowledge limitations in their research, including that most of the trials were relatively old and that changes in interventions and care pathways reduce applicability to current practice. All studies entailed voluntary invitations to get checkups, so selection bias may have overrepresented privileged people (in typically better health to start with) and not reached those needing attention the most (KrogsbÃ¸ll et al. 2012). The focus on all-cause mortality has also been criticized as setting too high a threshold (Sox 2013). Yet despite the somewhat intuitive appeal of using general health checkups in secondary prevention, there is little robust evidence from randomized controlled trials to show any major impact on overall mortality. An ethical problem arises when offering preventive screenings that do not follow evidence-based guidelines (U.K. National Screening Committee 2013). Such screenings may increase the number of âworried wellâ who oftentimes are confused by complex probabilities of detecting and preventing diseases. Clinicians must therefore do their utmost to understand risks and benefits of screening tests and communicate these to patients in ways that are easily comprehensible and not misleading (Wegwarth and Gigerenzer 2011). For example, a physician might tell his 50-year-old patient that she should undergo breast cancer screening because it reduces risk by 14 %. But this information is incomplete, as relative risk rates alone obscure the basic reference point against which the comparison is made. Another way of providing the same information would be to use absolute risk rates and to say that if one screens 1000 women for 20 years, four breast cancer deaths can be averted, even though eight among all screened women still die from breast cancer. In addition, over the 20 years, the 1000 women taking part in screening experience 412 false positives, and of 73 women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, 19 experience overdetection and are treated for a cancer that would not have developed into a lethal tumor, with treatment typically consisting of hormone- radio- or chemo-therapy, and partial or full surgical breast-removal (Hersch et al. 2015). This way of presenting data (Fig. 5.2), especially when combined with other relevant information about screening accuracy and rates of overdiagnoses, provides more adequate context for considering benefits and risksâyet, this presentation method is far from being universally adopted (Gigerenzer et al. 2010). Adequate risk information in secondary prevention matters not only from a patient-empowerment perspective but also because it can mitigate real or perceived conflicts of interests of physicians. Physicians, anyone who markets or manufactures screening equipment, and those who analyze data typically experience financial gain when more patients undergo screening. Therefore, a central ethical issue of secondary prevention is not only how to avoid premature mortality in the most efficient and cost effective way but also how to eliminate potential conflicts of interests. Patients can become entangled in competing interests, as illustrated by the controversy surrounding prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, testing to detect prostate cancer. Although physicians and others experienced financial gain, patients experienced no reduced mortality and instead higher morbidity and loss of quality of life"
231,176,0.986,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.2 Harmful Algal Blooms Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been reported in several regions of the North Sea and linked to changes in nutrients, temperature, salinity, and the North Atlantic Oscillation (ICES 2011). Their relation to anthropogenic drivers is unclear. Harmful algal blooms may impact ecosystem function and thus influence economic functions, including human health. However, several species known to cause HABs (e.g. Phaeocystis spp., and several dinoflagellates and raphidophytes) were already present in the North Sea at the beginning of 20th century (Peperzak 2003). Laboratory studies indicate that a rise in temperature may enhance growth, but that not all species tested responded in the same way (Peperzak 2003). 1.6.3.3 Offshore Oil and Gas Vast oil and gas reserves formed during the North Seaâs long geological history are currently being exploited. A large number of oil and gas production platforms widely distributed over the North Sea are responsible for supplying energy to European countries. Waters around the platforms are sometimes contaminated by chemicals including substances that affect benthic communities. Detailed studies showed effects of drilling activities (discharge of oil-based muds) only up to about 1 km from the platform (Daan and Mulder 1996). 1.6.3.4 Renewable Energy As the use of renewable energy from offshore wind farms and from wave/tidal power plants increases, so the threat to seabirds and marine mammals will increase. The long-term impacts of renewable energy infrastructure on the North Sea ecosystem are not yet clear. Initial studies based on a UK wind farm show that plant and animal growth on piles may offer a substantial additional food supply for marine mammals. Studies by Garthe (Kiel University, unpubl.) on telemetered northern gannet Morus bassanus from Helgoland show birds can avoid wind farms to some extent."
275,319,0.986,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"10.3.1 Kinds of Uncertainty, Risks, Standards, and Dispositions Humans think and act as though there are distinct kinds of unknowns. They regard some kinds as worse than others, and may trade one kind for a more preferred kind. Peopleâs risk perceptions can be modulated by influences such that those perceptions will not match so-called âobjectiveâ risk assessments. They also may apply different standards of proof to different settings, and the burden of proof will depend on the assumptions they have made. Likewise, humans vary in their orientations toward and tolerance of risks and unknowns. All of these considerations are relevant to trust in HRI settings, and this section reviews them with this in mind. Starting with probabilities, there is ample evidence that human reactivity to probabilities is not linear in the probabilities, even when those probabilities are accurate. People tend to over-weight risks that have small probabilities, particularly if the stakes are high, and they have difficulty making meaningful decisional distinctions between small probabilities, even when these differ by orders of magnitude (such as one in a million versus one in ten thousand). They do, however, make a strong distinction between a probability of 0 and a very small nonzero probability. Trust in an automaton therefore is unlikely to be improved noticeably by decreasing the probability of automaton failure from, say, one in ten thousand to one in a hundred thousand. However, it is likely to increase substantially if the probability of failure is reduced from one in a hundred thousand to zero. A relevant body of work here is on the relationship between judgments of probabilities and sample space partitions [13]. This line of research has shown that people anchor on the number of outcomes that is salient to them when making probability judgments. If they think in terms of K possible outcomes (i.e., a K -fold sample space partition), then they will anchor on probabilities of 1/K for each of the outcomes, and then adjust away from that when presented with relevant information. Smithson and Segale [41] demonstrated that partition-dependency effects hold even when people are using imprecise probabilities (e.g., probability intervals). An implication is that trust in an automaton can be influenced by priming users to consider its performance outcomes in alternative partitions. For instance, unpacking good outcomes into K â 1 sub-categories (K > 2) but lumping bad outcomes together into one category will anchor users on 1/K probability of a bad outcome, whereas packing both good and bad outcomes into one category will anchor users on a probability of 1/2 for a bad outcome. Turning now to types of unknowns, there are long-running debates among proponents of formal frameworks for uncertainty about whether all uncertainties can be handled by some version of probability theory. These debates will not be surveyed here, but one of the motivations for them has been evidence of widespread human intuitions that not all uncertainties are probabilistic. Instead, research in judgment and decision making under uncertainty has revealed that uncertainty arising from ambiguous or conflicting information influences judgments and decisions in ways that probabilistic uncertainty does not. Ambiguity has been widely studied in psy-"

For Tanzania, for example, one in seven of the poorest have a severe functional difficulty and one in three have a severe or moderate difficulty. Other countriesâ estimates are close to the Tanzania estimates (Fig. 4.6 and Appendix A3).12 This result is consistent with results from Hosseinpoor et al. (2013) using an asset quintile, a disability measure similar to that in WHOâ World Bank (2011) and 2002â2004 World Health Survey data for 49 countries, including Ethiopia and Malawi. Table 4.7 gives descriptive statistics of households across functional status. It shows that households with functional difficulties have different characteristics in terms of structural factors. Households with functional difficulties have heads who tend to be older and less often female or married. They are significantly smaller households and tend to have more older or female members. They are also more likely to be in rural areas. For these characteristics, significant differences are found between households with severe or moderate functional difficulties, on the one hand, and households with no difficulty, on the other. However, the differences are larger for households with severe vs. moderate functional difficulties."

Water quality analysis undertaken around 1980 indicated high nutrient levels and responding algal blooms. From 1986, however, there appeared to a signiï¬cant response due to progressive nutrient reduction in sewage efï¬uent. This is the only program that can be linked to the multitude of management programs developed to protect or improve the quality of the Hawkesbury River. It can be demonstrated that clear responses in waterway condition can be linked to catchment activities and some actions to improve river health. It appears however, many such actions or management practices have not been assessed or are not capable of assessment. The development of protocols or a framework to assess future management proposals for protection and remediation of the Hawkesbury River is recommended. It is suggested that this include investigation of legal river status with recognised values and rights of its own, as has been undertaken in New Zealand and Canada.

Other predictions (Ali and Lunghi, 2002; Ball, Jones, and Zwicky, 2007; Lu, Matsumori, Sanda, and Yang, 2005) are similarly small. For direct CP asymmetries, in exclusive decays, the uncertainties due to form factors cancel out to a large extent. But both the scale dependence and the dependence on the charm quark mass of the NLO predictions are rather large because the CP asymmetries arise at O(Î±S ). While the direct CP asymmetry in B â K â Î³ is doubly Cabibbo suppressed and expected to be very small, with QCDF and SCET one finds â10% predictions for the direct CP asymmetries in B â ÏÎ³ (Ali, Lunghi, and Parkhomenko, 2004; Beneke, Feldmann, and Seidel, 2005; Bosch and Buchalla, 2002b).

This is the case for instance, of depression for which a questionnaire may ask about a personâs wish to die or about difficulty sleeping at night (e.g. Radloff 1977). This method may require a lot of questions and may not be feasible for all health conditions. As for impairments, individuals may be directly queried about impairments that might include blindness, deafness, complete or partial paralysis. However, this nomenclature may be unknown or people may feel stigmatized and not self-report impairments, which will lead to underestimates (Mont 2007). They tend to capture visible and severe impairments. Functional Difficulties Given the challenges of measuring health conditions and impairments through household survey data, this book uses instead questions on basic activity or functional difficulties. Basic activities are basic actions such as walking or activities of daily living such as bathing or dressing. Functional difficulties refer to difficulties experienced with particular bodily functions such as seeing and hearing. In the context of the human development model, functional and basic activity difficulties (functional difficulties for short) are used here as measures of health deprivations.

Public subsidies for OJT were not often used and were more likely to be used by larger firms. Also, few firms seemed to use public institutions as external training providers. We also presented evidence suggesting that, regardless of the firm size, the decision to train is determined by the firmsâ demand for skills, which, in turn, is associated with innovation and the adoption of more advanced production technologies. Finally, we assessed the effects of training on wages and productivity. Point estimates showed that a 1 percentage point increase in the proportion of trained employees raised productivity by 0.7 %, but only in firms with more than 100 employees. We did not find evidence of wage effects from training. However, due to data limitations, our results should be interpreted with caution and may be a lower bound of the true effects. Several policy recommendations emerge from these findings. First, the results are consistent with the view that providing training in general skills to low-skilled workers may have very low private returns for the firms. This highlights the importance of complementary policies to increase the skills of the workforce, such as developing lifelong vocational and educational training systems that allow workers to update their skills and reduce the skill gaps between individuals entering the workforce. Our results also support the design of comprehensive interventions in which the instruments to promote OJT are part of a broader set of policies that foster technological transformation and innovation. Policies should take into account the coordination failure that may have caused some firms in the region to be caught in a low-technology low-skill trap. This means that some firms are not able to adopt skill-intensive productive technologies because of the lack of skilled workers and therefore do not invest in the human capital of their employees. Indeed, while this chapter shows that a lack of technology adoption limits human capital investments by firms, recent evidence shows that lack of skills impose serious constraints on the adoption of innovation in LAC (Hall and Maffioli 2008). The results in this chapter also underscore the need for further research. First, there is a need to assess the magnitude of the private returns to OJT and how these are distributed between firms and workers. This implies making greater efforts in data collection, either by conducting longitudinal surveys or using administrative data. An effort should also be made"

One possible consequence is a flattening of the relative importance of parental influence in such matters. In the surveys examined, only the CILS4EU and TIES data include information about parents that can realistically allow for this type of intergenerational comparison.11 Given the young age of the CILS4EU respondents, where information was collected directly from the parents (in wave 1 only), direct intergenerational comparison of outcomes are difficult, if not impossible. In the TIES data, on the other hand, the (young) adult respondents were asked to provide parental information themselves, hence allowing for intergenerational comparisons that are marred by issues of misreporting, as is often the case when respondents are asked to provide information about their parents (Lessard-Phillips and Ross 2012). Hence, lack of accurate and timely information and issues of measurement make it quite difficult to analyze the outcomes of both immigrants and their children simultaneously. A partial solution to this might be to follow that of Rothon et al.

For example, the negative outcomes of climate change and ozonelayer depletion will become more substantial for the next generations (Dentener et al. 2006), and the extinction of species as well as the decline of certain natural habitats including forests and oceans cannot be fully rectified in the future. In a similar vein, a deteriorating communal environment may hinder individuals from meeting their need for competence due to its impact on the next generationâs well-being. As an example, family disruption harms the well-being of children and grandchildren in impacted families (Amato 2005). To the degree that individuals ascribe such negative outcomes to their own or their societyâs failure to preserve natural and communal environments, their need for competence will be unsatisfied and their sensitivity to opportunities that maintain the environment will increase. Deteriorating natural and communal environments also negatively affect peopleâs need for relatedness (i.e., their need to connect with others) (Ryan and Deci 2000). First, declining environmental conditions that will primarily harm the subsequent generation are likely to make it more challenging for individuals to develop relationships with people in that generation. For instance, children may blame their parents (or the generation of their grandparents) for leading self-centered and egoistical lives that exploited and damaged nature and for causing problems that the children and their generation will have to endure. Second, a deteriorating natural environment generally causes unequal suffering among the earthâs population; often, the individuals who suffer most did not cause the decline, thus making it challenging for both groups of people to connect. Ozone-layer depletion, global warming, and overfishing, for instance, can largely be attributed to industrial activities and use in developed regions and countries, yet the numerous and often significant costs of these activities in the form of destroyed ecosystems are forced on developing countries (Srinivasan et al. 2008). In turn, individuals from these developing countries may reproach the developed countries for their self-centeredness and irresponsibility, thus harming interpersonal relationship building across different societies. Third, weakened communal environments can disturb salient social relationships, for example, between parents and their children when families are disrupted. With more struggles and relationship issues, peopleâs need for relatedness is unmet. In this case, they are likely to focus on"
118,4,0.986,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"said (mostly by nuclear engineers) that the Fukushima Daiichi accident is a good demonstration of the effectiveness of the defense-in-depth concept. While it is true that there were no deaths due to radiation from the accident, more than one thousand people died during the evacuation and while living in temporary housing as a result of various causes that were triggered by the evacuation. In addition to these deaths, thousands of families, local communities, and industries were damaged or completely destroyed. On a national scale, Japan is experiencing difficult and complicated situations in international relations and economics. On a global scale, carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere increased significantly. These consequences should have been properly analyzed, discussed in public, and prepared for prior to the accident, but there had been serious oversight and misunderstanding about what harms must be protected against in such a severe accident. This insufficient preparedness has been compounded by the lack of an effective decisionmaking process with participation from a broad range of stakeholders, resulting in intolerable delays in societal recovery after the accident. Numerous cases can be found in which decisions led to greater injury due to lack of timely decisionmaking informed by solid scientific evaluation of various risks, including those of low-dose radiation. The bitter reality is that severe nuclear accidents will occur in the future, no matter how advanced nuclear technologies become; we just do not know when, where, and how they will occur. Of course, we should continue our efforts to improve technologies toward minimizing the frequency and consequences of accidents as discussed in detail in Chap. 12, but, in addition, we should develop effective aftermath management for enabling swift recovery. Scientific and academic communities should start efforts for establishing the scientific bases, both natural and social, for better societal resilience. Naturally, as a part of such efforts, the education of nuclear engineering professionals at the college and graduate levels must be reinvented. In fact, to some extent, the team responsible for the present book had shared this recognition in advance of the accident, and efforts had been started before 2011, as Chaps. 1 and 21 describe in detail. For the 4 years (2007â2010) prior to the accident, the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Management at the University of Tokyo and the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley had already started a collaboration called GoNERI for developing advanced educational programs for nuclear engineering. The collaboration was funded by the Global Center-of-Excellence (G-COE) program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Sciences (JSPS). GoNERI was motivated by the particular relevance and importance of social-scientific approaches to various crucial aspects of nuclear technology, such as the nuclear fuel cycle, radioactive waste disposal, implementation in rising countries, etc. Therefore, special emphasis was placed on integrating nuclear science and engineering with social science. However, at the same time, it was also recognized that we did not yet have sufficient command of the fundamentals of the social sciences (such as their domain, concepts, terminology, methodology, etc.), which limits nuclear engineers"

These images can also tell us how OH advocates understand relationships between humans, animals and environmentsâas they are and how OH believes they should be. Humans appear regularly, talking to each other, caring for animals, working in laboratories, or as human hands. OH depicts itself as a form of care of animals, environments and the planet. Implicitly or explicitly, this imagery shares the assumption that humans must care via forms of custodianship where only human agency is made visible. In first world contexts we see familial or clinical scenes, most often with pets; in images of the global South and East we see small-scale, direct agricultural care and veterinary care of wildlife. In this way, OH indicates its globalizing ambition alongside its awareness of key differences in humanâanimal relationships in different parts of the world. Care and risk are held in balance, particularly in the context of zoonotic diseases, which by implication come from less appealing wildlife species and from modes of humanâanimal interactions that occur in traditional food and farming systems. This narrative casts animals and certain kinds of human as âguilty victimsâ, geographically far away from the global North, or socially excluded, who must be kept out at all costs.99 It is also at odds with emerging OH research which suggests that pandemic disease risks may be accentuated not by traditional but by modern intensive farming systems and the global distribution of their products.100 finally, it is worth observing that as time goes on, the imagery of OH has become more and more abstracted: following John Berger, the animals are literally disappearing from a movement primarily led by people concerned with animal health.101"

The AUC for risk products of 0.25% is 1.75%; (2) If the AUC was equal to or greater than 1.75%, but less than 9.82% (i.e., the AUC for risk products of 2%), then the risk was categorized as low; (3) If the AUC was equal to or greater than 9.82%, but less than 33% (i.e., the AUC for risk products of 10%), then the risk was categorized as intermediate; and (4) If the AUC was equal to or greater than 33%, then the risk was categorized as high. The risk curves defined by risk products of 0.25, 2 and 10% are shown graphically in Fig. 3. Categories of risk were based on a rationale described previously (Moore et al. 2010a, b) and included several considerations: (1) Losses of small numbers of individuals from a local population should not adversely affect the population (Giddings et al. 2005; Moore 1998). One of the foundations of hierarchy theory (Allen and Starr 1982) is that effects at lower levels of ecological organization (e.g., organism level) are not necessarily transmitted to higher levels of ecological organization (e.g., population level); (2) Although there are exceptions, an adverse effect level of 10% is unlikely to be ecologically significant to a local population. Such an effect generally cannot be reliably confirmed by field studies (Moore 1998; Suter et al. 2000); (3) Based on an analysis of EPA regulatory practice, Suter et al. (2000) concluded that decreases in an ecological assessment endpoint of less than 20% are generally acceptable; (4) The curve corresponding to a risk product of 2% passes through the points corresponding to a very low probability (i.e., 10%) of 20% or greater effect, and a low probability (i.e., 20%) of 10% or greater effect. Thus, based on the considerations described above, if risk products are generally less than the 2% boundary for an exposure scenario, then it can almost certainly be considered a low risk scenario; (5) The curve corresponding to a risk product of 10% passes through the points corresponding to a median probability (i.e., 50%) of 20% or greater effect and a 20% probability of 50% or greater effect. In this assessment, exposure scenarios with risk products generally above the 10% boundary were"
337,1,0.986,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"This book covers a wide range of subjects which have enormous relevance to the interface between human society and the use and conservation of natural resources. This is a theme on which perhaps much more could have been done by researchers and academics, but possibly the integration of various disciplines, particularly through those dealing with the physical sciences and researchers involved in the social sciences, does not take place with adequate facility in most parts of the world. This volume is clearly an important contribution to the literature with a proper blending of different disciplines that would help us understand the interface between human society and natural resources in an integral manner. The very first pages beginning with the introduction set out the case for transdisciplinarity. This theme is then dealt with elaborately in subsequent chapters in a manner that would appeal to all the disciplines represented in the chapters of the book. I would hope that this effort can also be replicated through integration of disciplines dealing with the subject of climate change. As was logical, the initial work of scientists dealing with climate change focused largely on the biophysical and geophysical aspects of this problem. This, of course, was essential because it was important for society to understand what really was happening with changes in the physical system given that emissions of greenhouse gases have been increasing, and as a result the concentration of these gases going up significantly since industrialization. It was also essential to understand the physical nature of impacts of climate change, such as those involving the entire water cycle and how it would be affected as a result, as well as to assess the physical impacts of climate change in the form of extreme events and disasters. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) brought out a special report in 2011 on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. This provided an in-depth assessment not only of extreme events and how their frequency and intensity would change as a result of climate change but also various human dimensions of the problem. One of the observations that was brought out in the report stated that between 1970 and 2008, 95 % of the fatalities that took place around the world as a result of all kinds of disasters occurred in the developing countries. There was also an elaboration of several other implications for human society from increase in"

Central and State Pollution Control Boards have been monitoring the ambient air quality for certain Indian cities for the last two decades. Monitoring of ambient air quality in rural areas is very sporadic and purpose specific. Given the severity of the problem, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) conducted air pollution monitoring in three villages of Patiala districts, namely Dhanouri, Simro and Ajnoda Kalan during November 1â3, 2006. Patiala is one of the agriculturally leading districts of Punjab which is rich in crops like rice and wheat. When monitoring was done in these designated villages, it was ensured that some burning of paddy straw was happening in the fields of these villages. Monitoring stations for the sites were planned keeping in view the metrological conditions and environmental settings in terms of habited and non-habited areas and following parameters were monitored: metrological parameters (temperature, humidity, wind-speed and wind direction), particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10, TSPM), gaseous pollutants (SO2, NOX, NH3, CO, Ozone, THC, TC and BTX) and heavy metals.1 Descriptive statistics of some of the important pollutants and metrological parameters is given in Table 3.1.

175,1466,0.986,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Surface runoff of precipitation and the need to collect urban wastewater are the primary reasons for designing and maintaining urban drainage systems. Storms are a major source of flow into the system. Even sanitary sewer systems that are designed to be completely separate from storm drainage sewers are often influenced by rainfall through illicit connections or even inï¬ltration. Rainfall varies over time and space. These differences are normally small when considering short time periods and small distances but they increase as time and distance increase. The ability to account for spatial differences in rainfall depends on the size of the catchment area and on the number of functioning rainfall recording points in the catchment. The use of radar permits more precision in estimating precipitation patterns over space and time, as if more rain gauges were used and as if they were monitored more frequently. In practice spatial effects are not measured at high resolution and therefore events where signiï¬cant spatial variations occur, such as in summer thunderstorms, are usually not very accurately represented. There are two categories of rainfall records: recorded (real) events and synthetic (not-real) events. Synthetic rainfall comes in two forms: as stochastically generated rainfall data and as design storms. These events are derived from analyses of actual rainfall data and are used to augment or replace those historical (real) data. Design events are a synthesized set of rainfall proï¬les that have been processed to produce storms with speciï¬c return periods, i.e., how often, on average, one can expect to observe rainfall events of that magnitude or greater. Design events are derived to reduce the number of runs needed to analyze system performance under design flow conditions."
233,115,0.986,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Practical Contribution of Phylogeny to Conservation The practical contribution of phylogeny to conservation actions has recently been discussed (Cardillo and Meijaard 2012; Winter et al. 2013). In part, the conservation value of the phylogenetic approach is in its ability to guide pre-emptive actions towards identifying and prioritizing the most at-risk species. For example, by identifying species with traits or in regions that predispose them to high risk of extinction, we can identify species that are not yet at risk of extinction but which might become threatened in the near future if current extinction drivers increase in intensity or geographic extent. Cardillo et al. (2006) referred to such species as having high âlatent riskâ of extinction. Given limited conservation funding, focusing efforts on species with high latent risk might make economic sense as it is likely to be more"
226,278,0.986,Formalizing The Shadow Economy in Serbia : Policy Measures and Growth Effects,"Recommendations for Improving the Efficiency of the Labour Inspectorate in Tackling Undeclared Work An analysis of the position, operation, and volume of activities undertaken by the Labour Inspectorate shows that this body has been achieving relatively good results in terms of addressing undeclared work, given the constraints on its operation imposed by regulations, limited human resources, and lack of other capacities. This finding is further borne out by the fact that 56 % of all respondents in the Survey on Conditions for Doing Business in Serbia awarded good marks (4 and 5 on a scale from one to five) to the Labour Inspectorate, while a mere 12 % gave it poor marks (1 and 2 on a scale from one to five). This result is slightly better than that achieved by the other two institutions in charge of tackling the shadow economy, the Tax Administration and Market Inspectorate. As has already been demonstrated using a multitude of examples, one of the key problems in the operation of the Labour Inspectorate is the lack of co-ordination and integration with other inspection and oversight services. This problem could be overcome by integrating the various inspection services into an InspectorateGeneral (of which the Labour Inspectorate would be a part) to achieve synergy and avoid duplication of activities, while at the same time establishing a consistent system that would be more efficient at preventing some of the most dangerous participants in the shadow economy (such as âphantom companiesâ) from operating with virtual impunity by using loopholes in existing legislation. Changes to legislation should be considered that would allow labour inspectors to access and examine all premises where business is conducted, regardless of whether the entities in question are formally registered or not. In addition, it would be beneficial to allow labour inspectors to impose fines as part of a simplified procedure. A long-standing complaint of the Labour Inspectorate is that they have too few people and too much work, and that the number of inspectors needs to be increased substantially if optimal results are to be achieved. Inspectors are well qualified, and nearly all of them have university degrees. The Inspectorate has limited Information and Communication Technology (ICT) capacity. There are electronic linkages with the Business Registries Agency and an internal analytics and planning database has been developed. However, the Inspectorate cannot establish direct links with business records, the Tax Administration, the National Employment Service, or social security organisations. The key measures for removing administrative barriers are better co-operation between the Labour Inspectorate and the Tax Administration, social security organisations, the police, and courts. Moreover, co-operation with the National Employment Service is tenuous: the database of people receiving unemployment assistance is not available to the Inspectorate, which is an issue that needs to be resolved."
232,205,0.986,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The aim of this section is to share basic descriptions of the 3.11 triple disasters. For this purpose, we would like to use a description-oriented method. Through descriptions of damaged sites, we will know the complexity of damages brought by the earthquake, tsunami, and the NPP accident. For the horrible triple disasters, there were over 20,000 deaths and missing persons. Approximately 170,000 people evacuated from their homes in Japan. Three prefectures in particularâMiyagi, Iwate, and Fukushimaâwere the most affected (for example, deaths in the Miyagi prefecture reached over 10,000). We summarize the number of victims, focusing on these three prefectures, in Table 1.1 The tsunami wiped out several hundred kilometers of coastline in towns. Concerning causes of death, drowning was responsible for over 90% of lost victims, and about 65% of the victims were over the age of 60 [3]. Looking at the press release by the national government on June 24, 2011, it was estimated that total losses for the building, life-line, social infrastructure, agriculture, and others reached approximately 16.9 trillion yen. Over 25 million tons of rubble and general waste were generated. Of course, there continues to be other serious problems, such as the stress of disaster victims, discrimination, etc. In addition, the social conditions were different between damaged areas. Previous studies showed that local towns that were seriously injured were considered to be an aging society, farming and ï¬sheries society, and generally poorer than when compared to metropolitan society [1, 2]. And of course, such negative conditions compound upon each other. Generally speaking, the municipalities that were seriously injured faced deeply-indented coastlines; this geographical disadvantage is not only vulnerable to tsunamis but also reinforced aging and economically vulnerable society. Furthermore, these vulnerabilities (such as an aging"

As a consequence, there seems to be a lack of plans or other instruments regarding drought adaptation, as well as a lack of long-term vision for this issue. This means that the district government is under no pressure due to obligations on the topic of climate change adaptation in general or drought in particular, and nor have the relevant resources been made available. Although they recognise the importance of the issue, they do not see themselves in a position to take it up, and so the district government is currently not driving any process (e.g. establishing its own guidelines, programmes, or implementing adaptation initiatives). It is individual actors that are initiating interesting activitiesâthe DROP project being one of them. The Waterboard Eifel-Rur, a drinking water producer and a hydroelectricity producer interviewed all emphasised the existence of technical projects to enhance the systemâs robustness, improve risk management and develop backup solutions in case of extreme events. We can say that drought prevention is being addressed in the context of general risk management strategies that use as inputsâ precipitation patterns. WVER can thus be described as the driving force of change in the region. As the responsible for most things water in the Eifel, they are also the ï¬rst in line to be affected by drought issues, which explains their taking a proactive approach. The overall assessment of the intensity is thus low, but with increasing strength."
169,122,0.986,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The concept of EF historically was developed as a response to the degradation of aquatic ecosystems caused by overuse of water. In this context EF may be deï¬ned as the amount of water that is left in an aquatic ecosystem, or released into it, for the speciï¬c purpose of managing the condition of that ecosystem (Arthington et al. 2006; Brown and King 2003). Despite the fact that the concept of EF has existed for over 40 years (including other terminology, such as instream ï¬ows), there is still no uniï¬ed deï¬nition for it (Moore 2004). This lack of uniform agreement for a deï¬nition of EF can be illustrated by looking at a sample of the ways in which it has been deï¬ned in the literature by researchers and organizations involved in assessing and implementing the concept all around the world over the last decades. In these deï¬nitions of environmental ï¬ows, there are always two key aspects of the concept included: the ï¬ow regime that should be considered and the level of conservation for the ecosystem that is intended. Selected deï¬nitions of EF: â¢ Arthington and Pusey (2003) deï¬ne the objective of environmental ï¬ows as maintaining or partially restoring important characteristics of the natural ï¬ow regime (i.e., the quantity, frequency, timing, and duration of ï¬ow events, rates of change, and predictability/variability) required to maintain or restore the biophysical components and ecological processes of instream and groundwater systems, ï¬oodplains, and downstream receiving waters. â¢ Brown and King (2003) state that environmental ï¬ows is a comprehensive term that encompasses all components of the river, is dynamic over time, takes cognizance of the need for natural ï¬ow variability, and addresses social and economic issues as well as biophysical ones. â¢ Dyson et al. (2003) in the IUCN guide on environmental ï¬ows deï¬ne the concept as the water regime provided within a river, wetland, or coastal zone to maintain ecosystems and their beneï¬ts where there are competing water uses and where ï¬ows are regulated. â¢ Tharme (2003) deï¬nes an environmental ï¬ow assessment (EFA) as an assessment of how much of the original ï¬ow regime of a river should continue to ï¬ow down"
84,572,0.986,Eye Tracking Methodology,"the two idealized models. That is, when a cumulative distribution of human visual search performance is plotted, it should appear somewhere between the two curves, as indicated by the dashed curve in Fig. 22.4. Using this methodology, it is then possible to gauge the efficiency of an individual inspector: the closer the inspectorâs curve is to the idealized systematic model representation, the better the inspectorâs performance. This information can then be used to either rate the inspector, or perhaps to train the inspector to improve her or his performance. Tracking eye movements during visual inspection may lead to similar predictive analyses, if certain recurring patterns or statistics can be found in collected scanpaths. For example, an expert inspectorâs eye movements may clearly exhibit a systematic pattern. If so, then this pattern may be one that can be used to train novice inspectors. In the study of visual inspection of integrated circuit chips, Schoonard et al. (1973) found that good inspectors are characterized by relatively high accuracy and relatively high speed, and make many brief eye fixations (as opposed to fewer longer ones) during the time they have to inspect. In a survey of eye movements in industrial inspection, Megaw and Richardson (1979), identify the following relevant eye movement parameters. â¢ Fixation times. The authors refer to the importance of recording mean fixation times (perhaps fixation durations would be more appropriate). Megaw and Richardson state that for most inspection tasks, the expected average fixation duration is about 300 ms. Longer fixation times are associated with the confirmation of the presence of a potential target and with tasks where the search times are short. â¢ Number of fixations. The number of fixations is a much more critical parameter in determining search times than fixation times and is sensitive to both task and individual variables. â¢ Spatial distribution of fixations. The coverage given to the stimulus material can be found by measuring the frequency of fixations falling in the elements of a grid superimposed over the display or by finding the frequency of fixations falling on specific features of the display. In both cases these frequencies correlate with the informativeness of the respective parts of the display as revealed by subjective estimates made by the searchers. â¢ Interfixation distances. With static displays this measure is equivalent to the amplitude of the saccadic movements. It is possible that when a comparatively systematic strategy is being employed, interfixation distances may reflect the size of the useful field of view (visual lobe). â¢ Direction of eye movements. Horizontal saccades may occur more frequently than vertical ones, which may reflect the elliptical shape of the effective useful field of view (visual lobe). â¢ Sequential indices. The most popular of these is the scanpath. In their survey, the authors review previous inspection studies where eye movements were recorded. These include inspection of sheet metal, empty bottles, integrated circuits, and tapered roller bearings. In an inspection study of tin-plated cans, the authors report that experienced inspectors exhibited smaller numbers of fixations and that each inspector used the same basic scanpath from one trial to the next although"
223,212,0.986,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"In 2009 the world found itself in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Events thought of as extremely unlikely, such as the burst of the U.S. housing boom, the meltdown of the financial system, and the bankruptcy of colossal companies, happened in breathtakingly fast succession. Why was the world so badly prepared for these improbabilities? One explanation is that the crisis of the financial industry preceding the economic recession occurred because the industryâs supposedly optimal risk-management models failed to reckon with âblack swansâ (Taleb, 2007)âunexpected and unpredictable rare events that carry an enormous impact. Of course, modern risk-management paradigms were not alone in failing to take the black-swan event into accountâso did individual players, such as many homeowners who could no longer afford their mortgages. Can psychological theories and findings account for such blind spots? At first glance, the answer is no. Influential studies in behavioral decision research consistently suggest the opposite propensity: People are oversensitive to rare events. For example, they overestimate the chance of getting food poisoning or of contracting lung cancer from smoking (Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, & Combs, 1978; Viscusi, 2002). Moreover, people are depicted as remembering past experiences by how they felt at their peak (rare moment) and end (Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996). Such oversensitivity is not only empirically observed but also theoretically suggested. According to the most influential descriptive theory of risky choice, people overweight low-probability events (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). In fact, cumulative prospect theory explains the puzzling co-occurrence of two R.

We assessed the correlation between all six governance indicators and found that they were all highly correlated. Among the six indicators, âPolitical Stabilityâ was chosen to represent the âPublic domain and institutionsâ sphere. Political stability is one of the indicators of the âperceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including political violence or terrorismâ (Thomas 2009, 5). According to Collier (2002), civil wars (severe political instability) are one of the three main causes for a country remaining in a âdevelopingâ state. Political stability or instability indicates the ability of governments to lead their respective populations. Political stability is also linked to economic growth, in as much as instability is associated with reduced growth in terms of per capita GDP, especially in low-income countries (Polachek and Sevastianova 2010; The Economist 2011). Political stability is also an important issue with regard to the socio-economic development of Africa, as a result of the establishment of an institutional and legislative framework (OngÂ´ayo 2008). This dimension was described by three quantiles, and we chose the cut-off point at the lowest quantile. Because we were interested in the number of people affected by the different marginality dimensions we included population data, particularly data on the number of poor by Harvest Choice based on the population database provided by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) (CIESIN/IFPRI/World 2004). The Gridded Population of the World and the Global RuralâUrban Mapping Project provided data with a resolution of 2.5-arc-minutes on population densities based on a population layer that was compatible with the datasets on social, economic, and earth science fields."
183,164,0.986,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"9.1.2 Patient Safety in Surgery: Infrastructural Challenges to Sterility In LMICs, surgical patients develop disproportionate rates of surgical site infections (SSIs), particularly the deep infections characteristic of intraoperative contamination. Meta-analyses (Allegranzi et al. 2011) have found that 0.4â30.9 per 100 surgical patients in LMICs develop SSIs. In particular, even in clean and cleancontaminated wounds, which had not previously been contaminated by traumatic skin breaks, uncontrolled gut flora spillage, etc., the median cumulative incidences were still, respectively, 7.6% (range 1.3â79.0%) and 13.7% (1.5â81.0%), all several times higher than in higher income countries (Ortega et al. 2011). Most alarmingly, these figures represent early postoperative infections of deep visceral spaces and organs, not superficial tissues, a finding underscored by Nejad et al. (2011) meta-analysis that showed 6.8â46.5% incidence of deep infections in postoperative patients, and 10.4â20.5% of infections in organ spaces. Bjorklund et al. (2005) analysis showed a particularly unfortunate interaction between immunosuppressionâall too common in the developing world due to poor nutrition, untreated illness, and HIVâand unsterile surgical conditions in producing very high rates of severe infection following c-sections. These infections translate into longer stays at already-overcrowded hospitals: eight additional days on average in Tanzanian and Ethiopian studies, 10 days in a Burkina Faso study comparing surgical patients with and without SSIs (Eriksen et al. 2003; Taye 2005; Sanou et al. 1999). In nascent healthcare systems with limited infrastructures, SSIs that effectively double or triple patient stay lengths fetter institutionsâ ability to cope and reduce the volume of new patients that could be accommodated. Taye (2005) noted that SSIs were associated with 2.8-fold increased mortality (10.8% vs. 3.9%). Numerous factors impact surgical site infection rates. These have been most authoritatively summarized by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (2015) and range from preoperative antibiotic administration to drape selection to handwashing and beyond. A particularly pernicious and challenging one to address has been that of the contaminated environment. Whyte et al. (1982) and Edmiston et al. (2005) have described the general link between airborne contamination and SSIs, with an estimated 30â98% of wound bacteria attributable to airborne contaminants, depending on the ventilation system in an operating room. In higher income countries, invasive procedures are typically performed by scrub-attired personnel striving to reduce contamination in operating rooms with meticulously filtered air. In LMICs, such facil-"

The fact that large numbers of individuals are often concentrated into only a few specific roost sites results in high potential for disturbance (Sheffield et al. 1992). It also increases the potential for Allee effectsârecently redefined as a positive relationship between any component of individual fitness and either numbers or density of conspecifics (Stephens et al. 1999). Caves have a long history of human use, with the earliest direct evidence of occupation dating back to at least 700,000 BP (from the Peking person site near Beijing, China: Gillieson 1996). Originally providing havens for prehistoric hunter-gatherers, caves across the world have since served a remarkable range of purposes. These include military fortifications and wartime refuges, horticultural uses, sanatoria for patients with respiratory and other ailments, sites for religious worship and burial, storage and dumping facilities, sources of water and fertilizer, and finally, destinations for opportunistic recreation and commercial tourism. More generally, because karst is highly porous, the integrity of caves in karst areas depends on complex interactions between hydrology, biology and geomorphology within their catchments. As the health of broader subterranean communities is strongly influenced by their surrounding environment, activities impacting cave-dwelling life consequently include those affecting the surface environment (Watson et al. 1997; Vermeulen and Whitten 1999)."

One could expect, for instance, that more developed countries would host more foreign subsidiaries than less developed countries. In controlling for differences in per capita income, Fig. 2.10 indeed shows that there is a clear positive relationship between the level of income of the country and the number of vertical subsidiaries that it hosts. However, most countries in Latin America fall below the trend line, indicating that the number of foreign subsidiaries is lower than what should be expected from their level of development. In other words, even after accounting for differences in income per capita, the participation of most countries in the region seems to be low."

Critical voices played down these achievements. They claimed that remittances failed to stimulate development beyond consumption and that returnees, who had mostly done menial jobs in factories and on construction sites, brought little relevant knowledge and skills. Few returnees invested in viable enterprises that spawned economic multiplier effects, like creating new employment for the local economy (BÃ¶hning 1975). At the same time, it was noted that migrants had âfailedâ to integrate largely because of the host societyâs barriers of exclusion and racism (Castles and Kosack 1973). This pessimism widened to a more general critique of migrationled development after the oil crisis brought a halt to labour-migrant recruitment in Europe in 1973. Seers et al. (1979) applied the coreâperiphery model to the European case, the result being that âdevelopmentalismâ gave way to âdependencyâ and âunderdevelopmentalismâ as characterizations of the theoretical and empirical outcome of the post-oil crisis years. It was argued that emigration not only took away the youngest, fittest, and most ambitious of the less-educated workers from the peripheral regions, it also produced a brain drain of the more highly educated, leading to an overall decline in the peripheryâs endowment of human capital. During the 1990s the pendulum swung again, back towards the optimistic view of migrationâs contribution to development. Both ideological shifts and a large volume of empirical evidence lay behind this new optimism. First, there was a critique of the deterministic neo-Marxist model of migration, which now seemed oldfashioned and illogical. The downward spiral of cumulative causationâfor example, underdevelopment produces migration, which leads to further underdevelopment and thus more migrationâcould not continue forever; and the accumulating evidence of the migration humpâfor instance, the way that the Southern European countries transitioned from mass emigration to mass immigrationâwas more convincing. Moreover, an increasing body of empirical studies carried out at the time revealed that, under certain conditions, migration could positively contribute to the development of regions and countries of origin, and that a more positive integration outcome often correlated with better home-country development feedbacks (De Haas 2010, 240). Inspired by NELM thinking, migration came to be seen as an effective route out of poverty, and as a rational strategy for household sustenance and improvement. Remittances took centre stage in this M&D neo-optimism. Indeed, they became a kind of mantra for economists and policymakers working in this sector of development (Kapur 2005). Against the pessimistsâ claim that remittances were âwastedâ on extravagant housing and social-status performances, studies traced productive and development-inducing effects (see Adams and Page 2005; Gammeltoft 2002; Lucas 2005, 145â206; Ngoma and Ismail 2013). Remittance spending on housing and consumption, after all, did improve the quality of life and generate multiplier effects in the local economy, creating employment and stimulating demand for goods and services. Improved housing not only raised social status, but also contributed to general wellbeing, health, and safety (De Haas 2012, 13). Once basic needs were met, some remittances were invested in farming,"

The regional dummy REGEAP is significant in all relevant models, showing that the East Asian and Pacific countries are positively associated with higher FD. While AREA is significant in Models 2 and 4, the standardized coefficient for it is rather small. For the policy variables, EXPPRIM is significant in Models 3 and 4, but not for Model 1. SDPI is significant in all relevant models, but the standardized coefficient for it is negligible. Three institutional variables, CIVLEG, KKM and PCI, are found to be significantly associated with FD in all relevant models. The effects of KKM and PCI on FD are very strong, as shown by the standardized coefficients in the lower section of the table: a one standard deviation change in KKM translates into a more than 0.5 standard deviation of the FD measure, and even stronger effects for PCI. In sum, on the one hand, the analyses above further confirm that institutions, policy and geography, taken as a group, jointly explain a substantial proportion of the variation in FD. On the other hand, the above analyses show that, in comparison to policy and geography, institutions could play a fundamental role in the process of financial development. When taken individually, at least CIVLEG, KKM, PCI, GDP90, POP90 and EURFRAC are found to have a significant influence on financial development. This finding explicitly suggests that, in addition to initial GDP and initial population, the legal origin22 and institutional quality are the most fundamental determinants of financial development in a country."
381,272,0.986,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"accumulate the human capital, broadly conceived, that will play a critical role in their adult outcomes. The dimensions of human capital include a variety of cognitive and noncognitive skills, as well as dispositions, experiences, and flexibility (see Keeley 2007; Pellegrino and Hilton 2012). At each stage of development, the gates represent access or obstacles to opportunities to add human capital, building on whatever potential individuals may have, as well as the human capital they already possess. For individuals born in higher strata (by income, SES, or other) the gates are mostly open, offering access to a multitude of opportunities. For individuals born in lower strata, the gates are mostly closed so that there are fewer opportunities to amass essential high-quality human capital at a developmentally appropriate stage (Fishkin 2014). The use of the term âgatesâ is motivated by the gated communities that have sprung up over the last few decades and are perhaps the most visible aspect of the stratification of opportunity. Children born in such privileged communities have multiple opportunities to develop their human capital, while those born outside of them often have fewer. However, stratification of opportunity goes far beyond these enclaves of privilege. According to some investigators, over the last few decades, residential segregation by income has remained fairly stable and by race/ethnicity has even declined slightly. Others argue that residential segregation by income has increased. All agree, however, that Blacks and Hispanics remain much more segregated than Whites and Asians (Rugh and Massey 2013; Bischoff and Reardon 2013). Neighborhood differences in income are, in turn, strongly associated with differences in private and public investments in children such as parental attention, school quality, the nature and extent of social networks, and so on (Bischoff and Reardon 2013). These and other factors largely determine which gates are open to some childrenâand closed to others. Indeed, it is worth noting that as neighborhoods become more homogeneous with respect to income, so do childrenâs peer groups (Ibid.). This homogeneity carries over to schoolâwhether a neighborhood public school or a private school (parochial or nonsectarian). Increasingly, children find themselves in schools segregated by income as well as by race and ethnicity (Coley and Baker 2013). Stratification by income also leads to neighborhoods that are more homogeneous with respect to percentages of adults in the labor force or facing long-term unemployment, as well as the types of work engaged in by those who are employed. Such patterns are determined in large part by the type and extent of the human capital that adults bring to the labor market, as well as labor market trends in the kinds of occupations with openings, the salaries and benefits offered, and their locations (Levy and Murnane 2013). At the low end of the spectrum, neighborhoods in which a plurality of adult males either are or have been incarcerated are characterized by high unemployment, high levels of crime, and a lack of positive role models. As noted at the outset, these trends are driven not only by globalization and the rapid advances in technology but also by interactions among market forces, regulatory decisions, and legislation. Inasmuch as how these trends shape parentsâ or"
311,994,0.986,The Physics of the B Factories,"In the case of time-dependent Dalitz plot analyses, the resonance parameterizations above are combined with the equation describing the time-dependent decay properties of the B and B meson as given in Equation 13.2.17. In this case, a great deal of attention has to be given to the tagging and resolution functions. Charmless B decays, especially those without access to tree decay diagrams, may have a large non-resonant contribution. This can be as high as 90% for B â KKK. The contribution is not uniform across the Dalitz diagram and so a parameterization must be adopted that depends on position in the Dalitz Plot. In some analyses, BABAR and Belle have adopted the same non-resonant parameterization but in most cases they diï¬er, which can complicate comparisons. The statistical errors on the measured fit fractions and CP parameters are often derived from fits to a large number of MC experiments generated with the fitted parameters obtained from the data. These MC experiments are also vital for understanding the minimization process. With a large number of floating parameters, the fit can sometimes have more than one local minimum. There can be systematic shifts in the fit caused by the starting values of the floating parameters. A number of techniques for investigating this eï¬ect have been applied, including using diï¬erent minimizers, scanning through a set of starting values, randomly initializing the starting values, and the use of genetic algorithms. Each has its benefits and drawbacks but there is no one method that works better than the others in all circumstances. The systematic uncertainties that aï¬ect the final result are very similar to those seen in other charmless B decays. However their eï¬ects can be modified since there are more opportunities for correlations between parameters and the fitted results are often reported as ratios rather than absolute numbers.

This means that including phylogenetic diversity as a prioritization criterion improves the outcome of the Zonation solution from the perspective of evolutionary history. Our results also highlight that the scale at which the prioritization is conducted (European vs. National) does not appear to have a consistent impact on the mean QE retained in each fraction of the landscape (same colored symbols are close to each other for a given fraction). In other words, the choice whether to conduct a prioritization at the country level or at the continent level does not influence how much phylogenetic diversity is retained. We overlaid the Zonation rankings with maps of existing protected areas to see how well the priorities and protected areas coincide. The protected areas we considered in our analyses (WDPA categories IâIV) cover a total of 7.8 % of the land area in the study region. We compared them to the same amount of land area prioritized by the Zonation variants (Fig. 6), i.e., 7.8 % top fraction of the Zonation solutions. A large majority of currently protected land is not considered of high priority by any of the Zonation variants (light blue areas), and conversely, much of the Zonation priorities are unprotected (yellow-orange tones). The best matching areas are shown in red, and are sparsely located across the study region without any clear spatial trends. We plotted the mean proportions of cell area protected among the cells in different top fractions of Zonation solutions for each of the four main solutions (Fig. 7). For both of the European scale analyses the proportion protected did not seem to depend at all whether the cells were considered of high or low priority. Actually their pattern of distribution appeared near random.

Workers are not âstakeholdersâ in the same way as persons or groups external to the enterpriseâs production of value added. It will therefore be very important to see how due diligence processes will be carried out in relation to employment of persons with disabilities. Due diligence processes in such situations need to take into account the structure of firms and their business relationships, the information relied upon, and the broader culture within an enterprise. As a general matter, the Guide for integrating Human Rights into Business Management, developed by BLIHR, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Global Compact, sets out a series of processes for situating human rights considerations within standard business practices, from strategy to measuring impact and auditing and reporting.33 The due diligence process itself identifies the steps to be taken in carrying it out. However, other factors will need to be taken into account. One is better identification along the supply chain as well as in the company of who is responsible for what. Another step would be setting out some criteria for assessing the reliability of information relied upon and the transparency about its sources. When businesses carry out due diligence in relation to other types of risks, they rely on internal and external sources. In the now more regulated financial services sector, due diligence is reported as being regularly undertaken in relation to prospective clients, prospective employees and prospective investors. Information comes from public and private sources, and pose the challenges of verification, timeliness, multiplicity of sources, and cost, particularly from commercial databases.34 The commentary to Principle 21 suggests that business reporting should include âindicators concerning how enterprises identify and address adverse impacts on human rightsâ. The most likely scenario is that they will seek out existing indicators. Here we find a number of competing sources, of variable quality and accessibility of data. Multiple, non-transparent and non-comparable firm-based indicators would not be particularly helpful. But more importantly, there is always the risk of reductionism, that the indicator becomes not a proxy for the right, but a reduced notion of the right itself.

Public awareness of the need for services is increasing, and appreciation of education is rising among many rangeland dwellers (Coppock et al. 2011). Service provision to mobile pastoralists is much worse than that for town dwellers across all of our case-study locations. Most traditional rangeland populations have never had public services, so any progress is an improvement. An interesting exception, however, is Mongolia where during the communist era nomads received heavily subsidized services including education, health care, and veterinary care (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez 1999). This resulted in high rates of literacy as well as successful vaccination campaigns. In the free-market era these services have been lost or greatly diminished. The one bright spot in service provision on the rangelands concerns improved telecommunications; each of our case-study sites have witnessed expansion of mobile phone use in the past 5 years. Pastoral households across our case-study sites are commonly near or below the poverty line. Compared to the past, trends indicate that traditionally oriented pastoralists are generally getting poorer and thus have a higher risk exposure to perturbations caused by weather, economy, or conflict. Although illiteracy rates remain high in most cases, more pastoral children are reportedly attending school and, where local circumstances allow, pastoral households increasingly attempt to diversify incomes and assets by mixing pastoral with non-pastoral activities (Coppock et al. 2011). Food insecurity remains common for pastoralists in the lower tier; Afghan and African pastoralists often receive food aid (Coppock et al. 2014; Schloeder, unpublished data). One extreme case, for example, is the 40 % of Afghan Kuchi pastoralists who remain in refugee camps (Colville 1998; USAID 2007). Food aid is pervasive in the Sahel14 as well as in the Greater Horn of Africa.15 Livelihoods for pastoralists in the upper tier are relatively better in that food (both in terms of production and access) is less of a problem. A common concern for rangeland dwellers in Mongolia, the Altiplano, and northern Mexico is the cost and effort needed to gain access to secondary or tertiary education (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez, personal observation; Kristjanson et al. 2007; MartÃ­nez-PeÃ±a 2012).16 In Mongolia, the proportion of rural households living in poverty greatly increased in the early years of the free-market transition (Griffin 2003; Nixson and Walters 2006). There has since been a gradual recovery, but this has been disrupted by large herd crashes caused by severe winter weather. Considerable development attention has recently been given to strengthening community-based organizations to fill resource governance gaps created by de-collectivization (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez et al. 2015; Leisher et al. 2012; Upton 2012).

For some people, certain destinations appeal for reasons largely unaffected by climate change, including uniqueness, travel time, standard and cost of accommodation, perceived safety and security, existing facilities, services, access, and host hospitality (Hall 2005).

376,965,0.986,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Summary. Overall, range livestock and their products are increasingly important for developing-country economies, although the relative contribution is low as other sectors expand. Rangeland dwellers are experiencing an expansion of livestock marketing options due to increasing domestic and export demandâand in some cases transportation infrastructure is also being improved. Ready access to public services such as potable water, electricity, health care, education, and banking services remains elusive for most rangeland dwellers, although access tends to be greater in the upper-tier sites compared to that of the lower-tier sites. Telecommunications have improved across the board, however, largely due to mobile phone networks. Traditional pastoralists have lower access to public services than do settled pastoralists or agro-pastoralists. Transition from communism to a free-market system in Mongolia has undermined the access of pastoralists to public services; other structural adjustments in the Sahel dismantled state-run veterinary and livestock services. Livelihoods are diversifying among agro-pastoralists, residents of settlements, and households whose members find employment outside of the rangelands. Wealth stratification among rangeland dwellers appears to be increasing overall as fewer people control more resourcesâa negative outcome of globalization.13 Food insecurity and extreme poverty occur in the lower-tier sites, but less so in the upper-tier. Social conflict takes a variety of forms, but it tends to be focused more on local control over natural resources in the Andean, Mongolian, and Sahelian situations. In contrast, the other case-study sites are subjected to a much wider array of conflictsâfrom resource-access squabbles among neighbors to struggles between drug cartels and long-term, major insurgencies. Several of our case-study sites are in nations where rangelands are the predominant portion of the productive land area, with the main exceptions being Bolivia and Peru which have large portions of their lowlands in the moist tropics or subtropics.

73,692,0.986,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The local ofï¬cials in Lahore/Punjab were asked about the formulation of a climate change adaptation plan. Majority of the respondents (97 %) said that their union council is not making any climate change adaptation plans to deal with the climate change impacts for Punjab. It shows a high level of irresponsibility in dealing with the potentially devastating impacts of climate change in Punjab. Practically there is no climate change planning taking place at the local level in Lahore which is the most developed city in Punjab. It can thus be concluded that there is no planning at the local level in Punjab, Pakistan to adapt to climate change conditions. Pakistan is a poor country with a very high population growth rate at 2.2 % per year and if it continues, Pakistan may have a population of 335 million by the middle of twenty-ï¬rst century (Lieven 2011). There might be various reasons for not making any climate change adaptation plan by union councils in Lahore. One third (32 %) of local ofï¬cials believe that a lack of awareness among local government ofï¬cials is the main reason for not making any climate change plan by union councils. Many local ofï¬cials described that it is not their responsibility to prepare climate change plans and it is the responsibility of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA). As discussed earlier ï¬ooding is one of the biggest disasters that occurs in Pakistan. Of the population who are affected by natural hazards in Pakistan, 90 % are subjected to ï¬ooding (Haider 2006 cited in Tariq and van de Giesen 2011). Most of the union councils (97 %) in this survey did not make any plan to reduce the impacts of future ï¬ooding in Punjab. This shows a culture of carelessness in Punjab about dealing with future ï¬ooding at a grass root level in the province. Local governments in other developing countries are taking initiatives to make plans to reduce impacts of ï¬ooding in their local areas. For example, Philippinesâs government had recently installed 15 rain gauges on the slopes of Mount Mayon â an early warning system against deadly ï¬oods and their plan is to install more sophisticated early warning weather stations to reduce the impacts of future ï¬ooding (Lasco et al. 2008)."
246,206,0.986,Rewilding European Landscapes,"exercises on European marginal farmland. An important point to take on board for nocturnal Lepidoptera, and other nocturnal biodiversity, is the issue of light pollution, which may cause adverse effects on larval development, fitness and population dynamics (van Geffen et al. 2014), and may hence result in negative effects cascading through whole ecosystems (van Langevelde et al. 2011; Fox et al. 2013). Rewilding exercises should thus include measures to actively mitigate light pollution sources (see Chap. 2). The likely improved species composition as a result will not only help achieve European species conservation targets (i.e. halting and reversing declines in biodiversity), but stronger populations of moths, butterflies and other invertebrates will also result in increased resilience of food-webs and ecosystem functioning (Loreau and de Mazancourt 2013). Since there is an urgent need to determine the effects of farmland abandonment and landscape context on communities over a wide range of spatial scales (Cozzi et al. 2008), we believe that our study on macro-moths in the Peneda range provides useful and timely scientific evidence on the benefits, requirements and limitations of the rewilding approach for marginal land, such as mountainous areas and High Nature Value farmland within Europe. We hope that the approach of Controlled Rewilding here proposed, may help design an effective conservation policy regarding the European farmland abandonment process. We here call for more research into how optimal configurations of rewilded land on abandoned farmland would look like. We also call to develop regional goals for biodiversity on land characterised by a high degree of farmland abandonment. Although it is clear that a universal approach to provide habitat heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales is the key to deliver and sustain the required biodiversity, we may need different types of heterogeneity in different places and regions.

There are other functions that would influence the growth of periphyton and ï¬sh, such as the concentrations of phosphorus or other nutrients in the water. These are not shown. Figure 9.8 merely illustrates the construction of habitat suitability indices. There are situations where it may be much easier and more realistic to deï¬ne a range of some hydrological attribute values as being ideal. Consider ï¬sh living in streams or rivers for example. Fish desire a variety of depths, depending on their feeding and spawning activities. Ideal trout habitat, for example, requires both deeper pools and shallower riffles in streams. There is no one ideal depth or velocity or even a range of depths or velocities above or below some threshold value. In such cases it is possible to divide the hydrologic attribute scale into discrete ranges and identify the ideal fraction of the entire stream or river reach or wetland that ideally would be within each discrete range. This exercise will result in a function resembling a probability density function. The total area under the function is 1. (The ï¬rst and last segments of the function can represent anything less or greater than some discrete value, where appropriate, and if so the applicable segments are understood to cover those ranges.) Such a function is shown in Fig. 9.10. Figure 9.9 happens to be a discrete distribution, but it could have been a continuous one as well. Any predicted distribution of attribute values resulting from a simulation of a water management policy can be compared to this ideal distribution, as is shown in Fig. 9.10.

19,295,0.986,Perspectives on Nuclear Medicine for Molecular Diagnosis and Integrated Therapy,"protection against atherosclerosis in apoE / mice [17]. Indeed, the expression level of some subtypes of FcÎ³ receptors was higher in M1-polarized macrophages than those in M2-polarized or non-polarized M0 macrophages in our unreported in vitro study. We also performed a cellular uptake study under the FcÎ³ receptorâs inhibition and found that the accumulation of 99mTc-NC-mAb in M1-polarized macrophages was significantly suppressed by the pretreatment with an anti-FcÎ³ receptor antibody. These findings suggest that IgG itself is accumulated in M1-polarized macrophages via FcÎ³ receptors in the atherosclerotic plaques. During the course of atherosclerotic progression, various biomolecules are expressed or activated. Thus, various PET/SPECT imaging probes targeting biomolecules related to the progression of atherosclerosis have been developed [18]. Among them, some probes are developed with based on monoclonal IgG and have been evaluated in animal models such as mouse and rabbit [19, 20]. In those studies, xenogeneic antibodies were used, whose nonspecific accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions was not taken into consideration. However, considering that the probes will be used clinically, the IgG used as a basic component of probes should be humanized, and it would be necessary to note its nonspecific accumulation as we have seen in this study. Radiolabeled IgG has been widely applied to the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and infections, although the mechanism of its accumulation is still unclarified [21]. Our preliminary study is the first to show that pro-inflammatory M1-polarized macrophages contribute to the accumulation of radiolabeled IgG, which is in agreement with the conventional use of such IgG as mentioned above. In the nuclear imaging for diagnosis of atherosclerosis, 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) has been widely used [22]. 18F-FDG is reported to accumulate in macrophages, particularly M1-polarized macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions [23], which is similar to radiolabeled IgG behavior. Therefore, radiolabeled IgG would provide information similarly to 18F-FDG in the diagnosis of atherosclerosis. In this study, we found that IgG itself can be potentially used for the visualization of atherosclerotic plaques, especially atherosclerotic lesions in active inflammation independent of its target biomolecules. However, we also observed the high retention of radioactivities in blood 24 h after administration of 99mTc-TSP4-mAb (apoE / , 17.2  2.1 %ID/g; WT, 17.2  1.5 %ID/g), which were about three times higher than those in aortas. This may be because that IgG has a high molecular weight (about 150 kDa), which leads to a low rate of clearance from blood. To overcome this problem, the molecular weight of IgG should be decreased with its affinity to FcÎ³ receptors maintained. That is, an Fc fragment (about 50 kDa) obtained from IgG would be a suitable basic compound for atherosclerotic imaging. We are now developing an Fc fragment-based probe and evaluating to determine whether this probe can be used to visualize the inflammatory active areas of atherosclerotic lesions."
344,210,0.986,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"4 The Way Forward The studies by Pauw and Thurlow (2011) and Ecker et al. (2012) are fairly similar in their approach to measuring the links between (agricultural) growth, poverty, and nutrition. The Tanzania analysis explicitly aimed at identifying agricultural subsectors that are most effective at reducing poverty and hunger, while the Malawi study was more focused on how plausible future economic growth paths might affect nutrition across multiple nutrition indicators. Both studies highlight the importance of the structure of growth in determining the pace of poverty reduction and nutritional improvements, with agricultural growth identified as a particularly important sector given its strong ties with rural poor households. Urban households, however, also benefit from increased availability of cheaper food, which is important for countries such as Tanzania where malnutrition levels are higher in urban areas. Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Missing from both is an assessment of how growth affects the âutilizationâ dimension of food security and nutrition. For example, more rapid growth may be associated with (or the result of) improved infrastructure and better government service delivery in health and education, which either improves nutrition outcomes or raises the responsiveness of nutrition to higher incomes. Such effects are not easily modeled as endogenous outcomes of growth in standard CGE models; moreover, these models typically assume no changes in household consumption behavior over time and hence also not the way in which food is utilized. Analyses that incorporate the utilization dimensions may therefore require a different modeling framework altogether. A limitation particular to the Malawi study is that it does not consider how consumption responses in the LES (CGE model) compare with those of the QUAIDS (nutrition module); in fact, even the income elasticities are defined and"

92,27,0.986,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Lived Experiences The challenges of realising good health in an urban context affect both internal and cross-border migrants. These challenges include poor mental health; mediated by education level, marital status and socio-economic situation, as well as country or province of origin. The urban environment contributes to growing inequity in wellbeing; in the case of peripheral urban spaces, economic, social and physical changes over the past few decades have reinforced marginalisation. Pathways that affect the health of migrants living on the periphery relate to unemployment and crime; inadequate shelter, infrastructure and services; a complex food environment in which it is difficult to achieve food security; a built environment that is not conducive to safe physical activity; and high levels of depression and stress â linked to, poverty, crime and fear of crime and deportation. Improving the understanding of lived experiences requires engagement with differing understandings of health and ill health, and alternative health and help-seeking strategies, such as churches and community support â including from others from their country of origin, and from those back home. Role of Governance and Policy A key focus of many researchers at the symposium was on how cross-border migrants navigate and negotiate healthcare in public facilities and in turn how migrants are perceived as a public health threat or a liability by the state, by healthcare professionals and by local citizens. Securitisation with regard to migration is not limited to border control but extends to the (increasing) securitisation of healthcare and communicable diseases surveillance in SA. This is despite the fact that, often, rather than bringing communicable diseases, it is the marginalisation that cross-border and internal migrants face in SA cities that can put them at risk of contracting communicable diseases after arriving in the city. Migrantsâ well-being in host societies is partly informed by the extent to which they can access healthcare and other social services, safe housing, and secure livelihoods. One important dimension of speaking to policy involved the explicit definition and consideration of contested terms. For example, it was vital to engage in a discussion of what is meant by human mobility. In SADC, this was determined to encompasses travel that is circular and involves cycles of return that can be rapid (daily, weekly, monthly), as well as more permanent movement (annual trips home, or even less frequently). Mobility in the region is still dominated by working-aged individuals and families, meaning that issues related to maternal and child health remain important focal areas for consideration. Furthermore, the legal experience of those who migrate relates to health. For example, the category of refugee has (unevenly) invoked legal protection, and also specific health responses on the part of the state."
230,546,0.986,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"Exceptions to this include shellfish such as mussels, clams and some shrimps that are eaten whole or with their gut. The risk of ingesting microplastics contained within other tissues depends on the degree to which uptake of microplastics and translocation and redistribution and retention within other body tissues occurs. This concept is discussed further below, in relation to human ingestion. In addition to the potential for ingestion to cause adverse biological effects due to gut blockages and/or damage, or the reduction in energy assimilation (Wright et al. 2013), the large surface area of microplastics means that environmental pollutants may sorb to the surface of the particles, with the potential to be transferred into body tissues once ingested. For a more comprehensive coverage of the uptake of microplastics by wildlife organisms, and the transfer to tissues of hydrophobic pollutants adsorbed from the surrounding environment, the reader is referred to excellent recent reviews (e.g. Engler 2012) and to other chapters in this issue (Koelmans 2015; Lusher 2015).

Data on latitude, elevation and land area for Singapore are added to the physical factors dataset of CID. 104. This inclusion is stimulated by the works of Alesina et al. (2003) and Stulz and Williamson (2003), for example. Alesina et al. (2003) argue that the ethnic and religious fractionalizations in a country are associated with its economic success and institutional quality. Stulz and Williamson (2003) show that culture, proxied by ethnic, religious and language differences, explain why investor protection differs across countries and how investor rights are enforced among countries. 105. The inclusion is due to La Porta et al. (1998) who suggest that the legal origin of a country is helpful in explaining the extent to which investor rights are protected in it. More specifically, countries with a Common Law tradition tend to place more emphasis on private rights protection and less on the rights of the state, while countries which have adopted a Civil Law tradition do the opposite. 106. The Andrews (2005) approach is very general in the sense that the effects of common shocks, which are Ï -measurable, may differ across population units, in a discrete or continuous fashion, and may be local or global in nature. 107. The addition of the spatially lagged dependent variable results in a form of endogenity, rendering the OLS an inapplicable method for spatial lag model. To estimate the spatial lag model consistently, the Generalized 2SLS and Maximum Likelihood approach (ML) have been proposed (Kelejian and Prucha, 1998, 1999; Lee, 2003, 2007; Kelejian et al., 2004; Anselin, 2006). 108. Since the spatial error model is a special case of a regression specification with a non-spherical error variance-covariance matrix, more specifically, the offdiagonal elements are non-zero. OLS estimates remain unbiased whilst the standard errors are biased. The OLS method can therefore be applied to this model with the standard errors adjusted to allow for error correlation. The spatial error model can be consistently estimated by GMM or ML (Kelejian and Prucha, 1998, 1999; Anselin, 2006). 109. This evidence is preliminary. One might find that countries like Brazil, closer to Paraguay, have large CDM credit flows. This suggests that, apart from geographic distance, other geographic variables are also important in the process of CDM development, and so are the institutional variables and financial variables. 110. Data on the great circle distances are also from Gleditsch et al. (2001). 111. If Moranâs I is greater (smaller) than its expected value, E(I), and/or Gearcyâs C is smaller (larger) than its expected value, E(C), the overall distribution of the variable in question can be reflected by positive (negative) spatial autocorrelation. 112. In this analysis, we also explore the impacts on CDM credit flows of other geographic factors such as being landlocked, the minimum distance from one of the three capital-goods-supplying centres (New York, Rotterdam and Tokyo), mean distance to the nearest coastline or a river navigable to the"

There is considerable scope for reducing the undesirable effects of wastewater use in irrigation through selection of appropriate irrigation methods (FAO 1992). Toxicity symptoms can appear in almost any crop if concentrations of toxic materials are sufï¬ciently high. Toxicity often accompanies or complicates salinity or inï¬ltration, although it may appear even when salinity is not a problem (FAO 1992). Comprehensive management approaches in the longer term will need to encompass treatment, regulation, farmer user groups, forward market linkages that ensure food and consumer safety, and effective public awareness campaigns (Scott et al. 2004). Clear policy guidelines on how to optimise the beneï¬ts and minimise the risks of untreated wastewater are lacking (van der Hoek 2004). Current government policies focus on the regulation of wastewater use and wastewater treatment and are unable to offer practical solutions to the user (van der Hoek 2004). For a complete understanding of issues related to wastewater use at a basin level, the macro-, mesoand micro-levels need to be studied from a multi-disciplinary perspective addressing socio-economic, health and technical issues (Buechler 2004). It is important to recognise that in many situations where wastewater is used in agriculture, the effective treatment of such wastewater may not be available for many years (Carr et al. 2004). The annual risk of contracting infectious diseases, including typhoid fever, rotavirus infection, cholera and hepatitis from eating raw vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater, is in the range of 5â15 % of consumers eating such vegetables who will develop disease compared to 0.0001 % of those eating vegetables irrigated with wastewater treated efï¬uent that meets the WHO guideline of 1000 faecal coliforms (FC)/100 mL (Fattal et al. 2004). A standard leading to âno measurable excess riskâ to health is an unattainable and unhelpful medium term goal under the conditions of indirect wastewater use seen in many cities (Cornish and Kielen 2004). Despite strong government support, treated wastewater use in irrigation has faced several constraints, chief among them being problems of social acceptance, agronomic considerations and sanitation, and restrictive regulations that have tended to limit its full potential for development (Shetty 2004). The farmers at most locations realised the contribution of wastewater to fertiliser and its availability year round at low/no cost, and hence they irrigated ï¬eld crops with this water. Farmers faced the problems of odd smell, skin infection, injury to hands and legs, and damage to water lifting pumps in some areas (Mojid et al. 2010). The farmersâ perceptions do not necessarily reï¬ect the quality of water delivered to the farm. The farmersâ actual and perceived capacity to control water"

Boserup presents the relation between indicators and technology groups in the form of a table. In general, the technology groups exhibit a rise in life expectancy, literacy, and âconnectivityâ from one group to the next using different levels of fossil fuel inputs. What becomes much more apparent when presented graphically is the relative homogeneity of technology groups IâIII according to these indicators. Then, there is an increase through group IV to group V clearly related to fossil energy use. Thus, what she shows here are not the subtle differences within the agrarian regime that were her original focus (differentiation by fallow periods and gradual intensification of land use) but the progressive use of fossil fuels as a source of energy.1 In her next step, she puts her core hypothesis of 1965, that high population density, far from making people starve, moves them in a position to advance technologically, to a test with these data. The results (see graph in Fig. 3.2) do not convince her. She feels there is no longer as close a correlation as between population density and high technological levels as âthere seems to have been before the industrial revolutionâ (Boserup 1981, p. 14), but even now she sees a pronounced inverse relationship only happening rarely, recognizing that âit became possible for a sparsely populated area by very rapid technological development to become the leading industrial nation in little more than a century.â (Boserup 1981, p. 144) Clearly, the proportion of high-density countries is highest among the top technology group, but the proportion of low-density countries does not continuously This transition is also reflected in several other tables in chapter 1 (Boserup 1981); there is never a more or less steady increase from group 1 to group 5. However a consistent pattern can be observed that groups 1â3 are fairly similar and then there is rapid change through 4 to 5. She fails to register this explicitly."
365,871,0.986,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"may be some underlying differences in their risk functions, for instance. To control for this possible source of heterogeneity, we included a set of dummy variables to capture the specificity of the different crops.20 The question now is whether farm households that implemented climate change adaptation strategies experienced a reduction in downside risk exposure (e.g., a decrease in the probability of crop failure). As described in the previous section, we assess the probability distribution of the stochastic production function by applying a moment-based approach. A simple approach to answer the aforementioned question consists in estimating an OLS model of downside risk exposure that includes a dummy variable equal to 1 if the farm household adapted, 0 otherwise (Table 2, column (1)). An increase in skewness implies a reduction in downside risk exposure. This approach would lead us to conclude that the adaption significantly reduces farm householdsâ downside risk exposure (the coefficient of the dummy variable adaptation is positive), although the effect is weak (significant at the 10 percent statistical level). This approach, however, assumes that adaptation to climate change is exogenously determined, while, in fact, it is a potentially endogenous variable. As such, the estimation via OLS would yield biased and inconsistent estimates. In addition, OLS estimates do not explicitly account for potential structural differences between the skewness functions of the adapters and non-adapters. The estimates presented in the last two columns of Table 2 account for the endogenous switching in the skewness function. Both the estimated coefficients of the correlation terms Ïj are not significantly different from zero (Table 2, bottom row). This implies that the hypothesis of absence of sample selectivity bias may not be rejected. However, the differences in the coefficients of the skewness functions between the farm households that adapted and those that did not adapt illustrate the presence of heterogeneity in the sample (Table 2, columns (3) and (4)). The skewness function of the adapters is significantly different from the skewness function of the nonadapters (Chow test p-value = 0.000). Among farm households that in the past adapted to climate change, assets such as animals are significantly associated with an increase in the skewness, and so in a decrease in downside risk exposure. Inputs such as seeds display an inverted Uâshape relationship. The total marginal impact (estimated at the sample mean) is positive. This implies that seeds have a positive effect in reducing downside risk exposure for the group of the adapters. While it is difficult to understand the reasons behind such results, one may speculate that the adapters may have better access to markets for inputs and this allows them to better manage risk of crop failure. Infertile soils are instead associated with an increase in downside risk exposure. However, these factors do not significantly affect the downside risk exposure of farm households that did not adapt.21 We find instead that climatic factors play a very important role in explaining risk exposure of the group of non-adapters. These non-adapters are, indeed, significantly affected by the rainfall"

With this lack of official control and information, media are the main source of information for consumers. Most of these media are controlled by the state, and behave as the voice of the leading Communist Party (Kerkvliet 2001). On several occasions, they have revealed and exposed criticisms towards the practices of stakeholders of the food system, like street vendors, or local authorities, for example, regarding the local implementation of state regulation, in the case of avian flu crisis (Tuong Vu 2010; GuÃ©nel and Klingberg 2010). Moreover, social media and the internet may facilitate whistle blowers as they did during the measles crisis in 2014,9 or function as a âsocial amplifier of crisisâ. The phoÌ Ì crisis is a good example of that situation. PhoÌ Ì is a culinary specialty of HÃ  NÃ´Ì£i; consumed at any time of the day (see Peters, this volume). This is a beef broth poured over strips of beef and rice noodles, fragrant star anise, and ginger. In 1999, controls made in various street restaurants revealed the presence of formaldehyde in seven samples out of ten. Formaldehyde is toxic to humans. It is used to preserve noodles and keep them soft. These revelation by the press (NhÃ¢n DÃ¢n, 6 Jan. 2000) caused what has been called âphoÌ Ì crisisâ. In the days that followed, phoÌ Ì consumption fell by up to 80 per cent. After this, consumers progressively resumed their consumption habits. The use of formaldehyde is probably not new. What is new is the role of the press in the uncovering the massive scale of formaldehyde contamination, and the way to interpret it. Using formaldehyde was characterized as a serious crime against the national gastronomic culture, a crime motivated by the pursuit of profit by a few individuals at the expense of the general interest. Indirectly, the criticisms point out that economic liberalization adopted in 1986 has allowed private entrepreneurship and capitalist values to develop. A similar interpretation can be applied to the revelation by the press of mass food poisoning affecting workers employed by foreign companies in Vietnam as a consequence of these reforms. The phoÌ Ì crisis may be the first food scandal of the second modernity: a scandal largely mediatized, affecting consumersâ behaviours massively, but with no (registered) victims.

Examples are multipurpose reservoirs and the construction of dykes along coasts and rivers. The required investments are large and typically can only be made by governments or state-owned companies. â¢ Water is a medium that can easily transfer external effects. The use of water by one activity often has negative effects on other water using activities (externalities). The obvious example is the discharge of wastewater into a river may save the discharger money but it may have negative effects on downstream users requiring cleaner water. Only the government can address many of these issues and hence âgood governanceâ is necessary for good water management. An insufï¬cient institutional setting and the lack of a sound economic base are the main causes of water resources development project failure, not technical inadequacy of design and construction. This is also the reason why at present much attention is given to institutional developments and governance in both developed and developing regions and countries. In Europe, various types of water agencies are operational (e.g., the Agence de lâEau in France and the water companies in England), each having advantages and disadvantages. The Water Framework Directive of the European Union requires that water management be carried out at the scale of a river basin, particularly when this involves transboundary management. It is very likely that this will result in a shift in responsibilities of the institutions involved and the establishment of new institutions. In other parts of the world experiments are being carried out with various types of river basin organizations, combining local, regional, and sometimes national governments."
114,285,0.985,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"A Global Revolution Rather Than a Local Evolution We can foresee that healthcare systems will change dramatically in the way they are organised and the way care is delivered. We will need different kinds of hospitals with fewer beds, shorter stays, advanced technologies and new competencies. Much more care will be delivered in the home and community, as we cope with extended life expectancy and the rise in chronic conditions. The consequences for those working in healthcare and the organisation of care are profound. In addition to this people no longer view healthcare as they have in the past and assumptions about what is achievable and what is expected are also changing rapidly. Ageing and well-being are coming to be seen as the right of every citizen with the concomitant expectation of reasonable living conditions, medical support, social rights, pensions, and an ability to maintain a full life in the community. This is an empowering emphasis in most respects but it greatly increases the challenges for healthcare as the demands seem ever growing and sometimes impossible to meet. We are now sometimes seeing a presumption of error and poor care if the outcome does not meet expectations rather than, in the past, an acceptance of the course of the disease with only secondary consideration of the possibility of error. The patient journey is new for healthcare but already replaced in many peopleâs minds with the concept of a lifetime citizen journey. Medical problems are no longer considered in isolation but in the longer term context of a personâs life. Legal aspects of this transformation in mindset are already clearly visible. For instance when a patient is harmed by healthcare and seeks compensations there are legal guidelines for assessing the amount due. This total compensation is assessed on several dimensions which include physical disability, suffering and permanent damage and the impact on personal and professional life, loss of earnings and so on. In France the assessment of compensation used to be restricted, apart from some exceptional cases, to the immediate aftermath of the event with the assumption of recovery in a reasonable time period. However in recent years the legal guidelines on both time period and quality of life have been greatly extended so that compensation can now be made for reduced wellbeing and quality of life in the mid and long term (BÃ©jui-Hugues 2011) We will also need in the coming decade to rethink and adapt the surveillance of the healthcare system, learn more from the introduction of electronic information for the purpose of surveillance, develop accreditation methods which encompass patient journeys, assess the impact of the movement of professionals and patients across borders, and last but not least, rethink the whole payment scheme of healthcare to reflect the growing collective and interdependent nature of care delivered to patients.

311,2622,0.985,The Physics of the B Factories,"As we have already observed, for tagged ISR analyses the hadrons, produced in a cone around the direction opposite to the tagged photon, generally fall in an instrumented region of the detector. The detection eï¬ciency is thus only weakly dependent on the final state hadronsâ angular distribution in the reference frame where the hadronic system is at rest, and the uncertainties related to the theoretical models used for simulation are significantly reduced. This is in contrast with both untagged ISR analyses and direct e+ eâ measurements, for which the region at small polar angles is largely inaccessible. There are also prices to pay for using the ISR technique. As discussed in Section 21.2.3, a good mass resolution and absolute mass scale are obtained in ISR analyses, but in direct e+ eâ measurements these quantities are given respectively by the beam energy spread and by the beam energy setting, which are determined far more precisely. The sources of background events for ISR measurements are significantly larger than those for direct e+ eâ measurements. In the latter case, the main backgrounds to a given final state come from other e+ eâ â hadrons reactions, due to undetected low momentum particles or to wrong particle identification, but such backgrounds are limited by the requirement of four-momentum conservation. For ISR events, a source of background of the same kind is due to mis-reconstructed events from other ISR processes where one or more particles escape detection. The constraint of four-momentum conservation is much less eï¬ective in this case because of the relatively poor resolution on the measurement of the energy of the ISR"

Heteroaggregation with natural colloids, clays, and other high-density suspended particles will lead to faster sedimentation of the plastic particles that are captured in the aggregate [35, 36] (Fig. 2). Another unique feature is the high persistence of plastic. Other particles with similar density and size, e.g., wood, algae, detritus, or other natural organic matter solids, disappear through degradation and mineralization within rather short time scales. Plastic debris however, once buried in the sediment, will only be mineralized on very long time scales, rendering them highly accumulative, bioavailable, and also subject to further transport. As long as plastic particles are close to the sediment surface, they can be resuspended if the flow velocity is high enough to exceed the critical shear stress [86]. However, after prolonged sedimentation, the particles could become âburied.â Buried plastic debris would not resuspend anymore, unless turbulence would increase sharply due to storm events or flash floods, for example. In the laboratory under accelerated weathering conditions, plastics have been shown to become brittle and fragment [28], and it is likely that this also occurs in freshwater systems. This process however is very slow in nature [87] and probably much slower than the typical residence times of plastic in rivers. In lakes with a large retention time, weathering is potentially important though. Fragmentation is caused by photodegradation, thermo-oxidation, hydrolysis, physical abrasion, and/or biodegradation [1, 88]. Most of these processes require either light, friction, or oxygen to act on the surfaces of the particles, which implies that once buried in anoxic sediment layers, plastic will be preserved for at least decades [89]. Several model categories exist that can use the above mechanistic evidence to simulate the fate of plastic debris in rivers, some of which already have been published in the literature [36, 37, 72]."

Climate uncertainty is one piece of information input to the policy process to help determine the built infrastructure. Other inputs would include population changes and the economics of building and maintaining the infrastructure: reservoirs, aqueducts, and pumping stations. The projections from climate models might be of sufï¬cient certainty to motivate policy changes, such as managing seasonal runoff from high mountains in order to beneï¬t human and natural systems. The long lead times to form, approve, permit, and implement a water system allow for both the accumulation of additional observational evidence as well as the improvement of modelsâto inform actual speciï¬cation of evolving infrastructure. Each problem has its own unique requirements on uncertainty, and these requirements can simplify the inherent complexity of the uncertainty sources. At least the analysis can reveal the key uncertainties. For example, a problem to be addressed in the next two decades, with a solution needed to function for the two decades after implementation (i.e., a lifetime in the next 40 years), has relatively little sensitivity to the carbon dioxide emission scenario. A problem requiring speciï¬c knowledge of Arctic sea ice in the next 20 years relies on model components that have strong sensitivity to the initial state (ocean currents), a rapidly changing physical environment (melting ice changes radiative forcing), and complex multi-scale physics that are not especially well represented (see discussion in Chap. 11, and Fig. 11.6). The more speciï¬c the application, the easier it might be to characterize the key uncertainties. If the application is to estimate sea ice to determine the feasibility of shipping routes in certain seasons in the Arctic, then the key features are narrowed to a season, and perhaps a particular threshold (sea-ice thickness less than some threshold for which an icebreaker is available). This might lead to speciï¬c uncertain processes that govern sea ice in particular seasons. Instead of looking at all available model simulations with large uncertainty (see Fig. 11.6), a subset of models could be used. The subset of models would contain those models with a good current sea-ice thickness in a particular season. Therefore, a productive way is to step back and focus on the state of the knowledge in Fig. 11.1. This ultimately relies on fundamentals of the scientiï¬c methodâobservations, theory, simulation; the emergence of consistency among these three pillars; and reproducibility by many investigators coming from different approaches and scientiï¬c techniques. The state of knowledge is different for different processes and phenomena. It is well established, for example, that sea level will rise as the planet warms up. Our knowledge of the amount of sea-level rise remains incomplete (see Chap. 11). One way to narrow the range of knowledge is to consider how fast ice might melt and increase sea level. Estimates of the physical timescale can be combined with timescales of planning, building, operations, and maintenance to narrow the range of the incomplete knowledge.

10,254,0.985,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Regarding instruments, the current existing instruments addressing droughts have not been developed within a strategic approach. The instruments were developed very independently for each of the different relevant areas. Because only a limited number of instruments relevant for drought purposes are in place, in general the instruments do not overlap. Smaller problems exist, e.g. between groundwater recharge and rainwater storage, which should be taken into consideration for new instruments. Over the past years, the topic of water scarcity and droughts has been integrated in several strategy papers and the Flemish vision on water. However, the future development of these issues could be helped by a more strategic approach. Further activities for a coherent approach in water management in general, can be seen in the synchronization of the planning period of sub-basin RBMPs (and basin RBMPs. Also the integration of drought measures in the RBMPs (from 2015) shows a tendency to a harmonized approach of developing and implementing drought measures with other water management measures. The responsibilities for water scarcity and droughts are unclear or not assigned in many organizations and levels, including the Flemish regional level. Within in VMM, responsibilities are associated with different departments and therefore are very fragmented. This fragmentation leads to own individual discussions with the ânormallyâ involved institutions and levels.

169,554,0.985,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The Ecological Assessment of River Quality Is Older than the Science of Ecology There is a simple answer to the question âSince when do we need water quality assessment?â: since humans destroyed their surface waters in a way that deteriorated drinking water quality. The ï¬rst written record of water pollution was given about 350 years before Christ, when Aristotle reported on âblack mudâ and âred tubesââas he called itâgrowing out of a âwhite slimeâ in brooks of the city Megara polluted by domestic sewage (Thienemann 1912). The famous Greek philosopher was the ï¬rst who linked human pressures with observations of oxygen reduction (black decaying mud), a community of Beggiatoa sulfur bacteria (white slime), oligochaete sludge worms, and chironomids (red tubes). Aristotleâs knowledge fell into oblivion, and the beginning of water quality assessment had to wait for about 1800 years. Anyhow, observations of a correlation between the composition/distribution of certain aquatic invertebrate species and different water pollution levels are not very recent ï¬ndings. One could even say that this knowledge is older than âecologyâ itself (as deï¬ned by Ernst Haeckel in 1866). As early as Kolenati (1848), it was already concluded by F. A. Kolenati that the absence of caddis larvae from a stream can be caused by the presence of factories upstream (Stettiner Entomologische Zeitung 9). Triggered by the severe cholera epidemics in Europe, two researchers, A. H. Hassal, London (1850), and F. Cohn, Breslau (1853), discovered and published the relationship between organic pollution, river fauna, and the quality of drinking water based on bioindicators. In the United States, the earliest biomonitoring research originates from Forbes (1887) who invented the biological community concept. Basically, using this concept plant and animal communities of a river were used to assess the degree of organic pollution. Around 1900 two German scientists (R. Kolkwitz & M. Marsson) studied polluted rivers around Berlin and described deï¬ned communities of organisms in different zones of organic enrichment. They developed the concept of âbiological indicators of pollutionâ in their so-called saprobic system, which is still in use in several Central and Eastern European states."

However, not only do many bat species thrive in diverse agricultural landscapes, but also their loss could affect the provision of pest suppression and pollination services and result in reduced crop productivity. Given the many disadvantages of chemical control of pests, managing agricultural landscapes to maximize the abundance and diversity of bats and other natural enemies must form a key aspect of sustainable agricultural production. However, the design and management of such systems to maximize bat diversity, activity, and ecosystem services is largely unknown, although European conservationists are at the forefront with their strategies to promote biodiversity-friendly farming. Chemical and mechanical inputs are not the only tools of agricultural intensification. Within recent decades, genetic modification of crops (e.g., Bt corn and cotton) has become increasingly prevalent (James 2011). In the short term, adoption of such varieties does reduce the need to rely on bats and other predators for pest limitation (Lopez-Hoffman et al. 2014), resulting in a âdevaluationâ of the natural capital provided by bats, and undermines arguments for bat conservation that are based exclusively on provision of ecosystem services. However, as is the case with pesticides, insects are rapidly evolving resistance to Bt crops across the world, resulting in a rapid devaluation of manufactured capital (Lopez-Hoffman et al. 2014). While the value of batsâ natural capital may fluctuate, it likely devalues far less slowly: Bats and insects are engaged in an evolutionary arms race dating back millions of years (Conner and Corcoran 2012). Without bats to buffer the inevitable loss of efficacy of chemical inputs and GM crops, the technological advances that make agricultural intensification possible leave production vulnerable to potentially catastrophic failures to limit pest damage."

2,163,0.985,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"The argument that privatisation creates a more diversiï¬ed supply of services is not universally accepted. In other types of care for the elderly âfor example, home care servicesâit has been argued that there has been a âdecrease of choice despite the rhetoric of freedom of choiceâ (Dahl and Rasmussen 2012, 41). The cause of this paradox can be found in procedures of codiï¬cation of care, which are a prerequisite for contracting out services. Codiï¬cation of care refers to the speciï¬cation of the amount of time devoted to, as well as the coding of, the performance of various tasks (Dahl and Rasmussen 2012, 41). In sum, this development implies greater local government steering, which leaves less room for the differentiation of services necessary to create different proï¬les of care. Whether local government steering has in fact diminished, or whether the opposite is true, remains an open question, because very little is known about the local governing of nursing homes within the context of marketisation. Previous studies, at least in Sweden, have focused mainly on national laws directed at marketisation and elderly care (Erlandsson et al. 2013; Szebehely 2011). Considerably less attention has been devoted to the question of how municipalities handle their relationships with different types of welfare providers and what consequences this has for the proï¬ling of welfare services. The work presented here seeks to address this topic. Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to compare and explain similarities and differences in the service provision of nursing homes managed by different types of providers (public, for-proï¬t and nonproï¬t) in six municipalities in Scandinavia. The primary focus of the comparisons is different types of providers. However, we will also explore differences between Scandinavian countries. The following research questions guided the study: Are there any differences between public and private (nonproï¬t or for-proï¬t) providers with regard to developing a distinct proï¬le of services?

Table 5 presents the themes and sub-themes that emerged from our analysis of benefits reported by participants. The most benefits are related to what the test coverage provides the developer, such as a safe refactoring, confidence to evolve and change the code, bug prevention, and consistency of code working correctly. The quality of the code is another benefit much-mentioned and perceived by almost all participants. Curiously, one of the developers reported that he could not identify improvements in code quality using TDD compared to Test Last. Instead, he mentioned only a greater comfort in implementing new features since the tests were in place, and a reduction in time to identify flaws introduced in the code. Software design and baby steps were two topics identified, but in fact were little mentioned."
376,985,0.985,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","meters (dedha). Traditional grazing managers and water managers for the Boran have customarily overseen the integrated use of these strata; creativity and flexibility are needed to effectively balance forage supply and demand every year. In the past 20 years, however, the traditional system has been augmented by pastoral associations (PAs) which are governmental administrative and political units; PAs have become involved in resource-use decision making, and contestation of authority between traditional and PA institutions has led to problems (Homann et al. 2008). Resource fragmentation problems now occur at all spatial levels, while another challenge at the most local level is ultimately an inability to control stocking rate, and hence forage utilization (Tezera et al., unpublished data). Annual rates of forage utilization among four PAs have been estimated to vary from 70 to 90 %â one outcome of such heavy use is soil erosion and bush encroachment, as previously noted. Coping with such challenges has largely been left up to the traditional leadership of the Borana pastoralists in concert with decision makers from government agencies, but it is evident that population pressure, emergence of very wealthy pastoralists, and reduced adherence to traditional pasture-use norms have undermined grazing regulation in recent decades. Progress, however, is being made on several fronts. This includes (1) finalization of a land-use plan by government that should limit cultivation on grazing lands; (2) efforts to restore traditional grazing access beginning at the dedha scale of resolution; and (3) workshops to address the need to reduce stocking rates and limit forage utilization at the local level to help arrest rangeland degradation. Thus, there are opportunities to assist pastoralists to update traditional grazing rules and regulations to better accommodate the new reality of higher demand on natural resources. Increasing scarcity of surface water and forage is recognized by pastoralists as a critical problem that merits new, collaborative approaches for problem solving (Coppock et al. 2014). Sahel. In the Sahel, pastoralists exploit the high variability of rainfall across space and time via highly mobile livestock.27 Population growth, land-use change and resulting land fragmentation, and unfavorable policies, however, have contributed obstacles for herd mobility at local and regional scales. Traditional pastoral institutions facilitated access to constantly shifting patches of natural resources (de Bruijn and van Djik 1995; Niamir-Fuller 1999). Colonial and postcolonial land policies, however, ignored pastoral rights and this, coupled with socially malleable rights to pastoral resources among pastoral groups, has made pastoral resources vulnerable to competing land uses, especially with the rapid growth of human populations since the 1950s (Guengant et al. 2002). Since the 1990s, programs to decentralize natural-resource management authority, as well as recurrent attempts to privatize land, have contributed to the enclosure of key pastoral resources (Marty 1993). While these changes have generally not caused widespread sedentarization of pastoralists and their livestock, they have reduced mobility, altered movement patterns, reduced livestock access to grazing,"
230,495,0.985,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"desorption from the plastic inside the gut, in relation to gut retention time. This means that the direction of an effect of PE ingestion would be calculated correctly but that its magnitude may have been overestimated because the model could not account for the extent of non-equilibrium in the gut. Interestingly, the authors found a counterintuitive decrease in predicted body burden upon an increase in PE in the diet. This was explained by the fact that without plastic, food organic matter is digested leading to high concentrations in the gut that subsequently are transferred to the organismsâ lipids. In the presence of plastic, however, which is not degraded, a gradient from lipids towards plastic exists, leading to cleaning of the organism by the plastic. Koelmans et al. (2013a, b) presented a general POP bioaccumulation model framework for marine aquatic organisms combining Eqs. 11.1â11.9, which was implemented for A. marina (Fig. 11.1). The model accounted for dilution of exposure concentration by sorption of POPs to plastic (POP âdilutionâ), increased bioaccumulation by ingestion of plastic containing POPs (âcarrierâ), and decreased bioaccumulation by ingestion of clean plastic (âcleaningâ). Kinetics in the gut were explicitly taken into account. The model was evaluated against bioaccumulation data from laboratory bioassays with PS microplastic. Further scenarios included PE microplastic, nano-sized plastic and open marine systems. Scenario studies assumed equilibrium of organisms and plastics prior to ingestion, as would occur for POPs in the environment. Model analysis showed that PS will have a decreasing effect on bioaccumulation, governed by dilution. For stronger sorbents such as polyethylene, the dilution, carrier and cleaning mechanism were more substantial. In closed laboratory bioassay systems, dilution and cleaning dominated, leading to decreased bioaccumulation. Also, in open marine systems a decrease was predicted due to a cleaning mechanism that counteracts biomagnification, similar to that recognized earlier by Gouin et al. (2011). However, the differences were considered too small to be relevant from a risk assessment perspective. Pollution by POPs is diffuse, which implies that POPs will be always present at background concentrations, often at solid phaseâwater equilibrium (Van Noort and Koelmans 2012). In the early life stages of organisms, POP concentrations in the organism will be in equilibrium with the ambient water too, which implies that ingestion of polluted microplastic will coincide with the ingestion of polluted food, rendering the contribution of microplastic relatively unimportant. For additives, however, plastic ingestion by marine organisms may potentially be more relevant than for diffusely spread POPs because the plastic could still be a source of the additives (Teuten et al. 2009; Hammer et al. 2012; Koelmans et al. 2014b). Furthermore, compared to worms, leaching of additives or residual monomers may be more relevant for larger and longer-lived species, with longer gut retention times, such as fish. Two recent controlled laboratory studies confirmed that dietary exposure of organisms to microplastic pre-adsorbed with POPs or additives leads to chemical transfer from the microplastic to the organism (Browne et al. 2013; Rochman et al. 2013b). A remaining question, however, is what the relative importance of this microplastic uptake pathway is under natural conditions, where other pathways like dermal uptake, uptake via the gills or consumption of natural"

In such circumstances they are empowered to cancel the flight and indeed have a clear professional responsibility to do so. In contrast in healthcare the underlying assumption is to cope and carry on even in the face of considerable risk to patients. There are comparatively few areas in which âno goâ is explicitly understood and respected in healthcare. National guidelines on equipment standards exist in anaesthesia. If faults are detected in core equipment it must be replaced, and if a suitable replacement is not available the case should not proceed without a specific, documented reason (Hartle et al. 2012). There are parallels between aviation and the operating theatre. An operation is a complex process that depends on the correct functioning of a number of different components, both human and technical. There are certain types of equipment failures in which it is assumed no anaesthetist would proceed (for example the airway gas analyser is unavailable), a situation in which some anaesthetists would proceed (an ultrasound is unavailable for a case requiring central venous cannulation), and a situation in which most anaesthetists might be expected to proceed (hospital uninterruptible power supply is unavailable, but all primary systems are functional). In practice however, although specific guidelines exist, there are very few clear âno goâ standards and the decision is left to the theatre team who are inevitably influenced by productivity pressures and other factors (Eichhorn 2012). âNo goâ conditions could be defined in surgery to protect both patients and teams by imposing an inviolable limit which can only be bypassed in cases of emergency. âNo goâ conditions are objective, absolute, minimum safety standards. They correspond to the thresholds above which activities of care must stop. The no go value correspond to a stage beyond which there is no capacity for safe care whatever the other strategies."
268,58,0.985,Self-Reported Population Health : An International Perspective based on EQ-5D,"In addition to describing population norms, the EQ-5D database archive also offered the opportunity to explore health inequalities as reported by general populations of 18 countries. We have seen that age, and gender to a lesser extent, played an important role in explaining EQ-5D data across individuals. A social indicator, education, was also available in most datasets that were analysed alongside age and gender to explain EQ-5D data. The level of attained education is important as it represents the cultural component of an individualâs socio-economic status, and is an indicator of living circumstances in the earlier part of oneâs life. Education level is fairly stable over the life course of an individual. Later in life it shapes oneâs occupation and expected income potential. Through this mechanism, its indirect link with health is stronger than its direct effect (Singh-Manoux et al. 2002). Among the higher education groups, lower prevalence of health risk factors has been observed. Given the existing health problems, individuals with a lower level of education experience greater ill-health (Eachus et al. 1999). Higher education can directly or through its vehicle mechanisms (such as being able to afford domestic help, acquisition of home appliances, reduced workload or part-time work) enable extra coping pathways that are not available to individuals with lower levels of attained education (Simon 2002). Furthermore, observational studies among people suffering from chronic conditions revealed that, through better self-management"
320,59,0.985,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"Along with the increasing world population and the technological advancement during the last centuries both energy consumption and the demand for land have increased simultaneously. Climate change at its estimated pace poses serious challenges for society, policy, and the economy. In order to develop suitable strategies for adaptation, fundamental knowledge about the climate in the past, present, and potentially in the future is required on a global and a regional scale. Thus, a scientific assessment of observed and projected changes of climate variables and indices is an inevitable precondition for appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures. Because the terms âweatherâ and âclimateâ are often misunderstood, a few general definitions have to be explained first. While âweatherâ means the state of the atmosphere in a certain moment, hour, day, or week, âclimateâ is defined as the statistical description of weather, including averages and variability as well as the return intervals of extremes over a period of at least 30 years [defined by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)] (WMO 2011). The most relevant climate parameters characterising this period are surface variables- air temperature, precipitation, radiation, humidity, cloud cover and wind. Closely related to this definition I.

As a consequence, elderly migrants are overrepresented among the most disadvantaged groups of the retired population in Switzerland (Bolzman et al. 2004). Small-scale studies in the cities/cantons of Geneva and Basel (Bolzman et al. 2001, 2004) have highlighted special features of the living conditions of elderly people coming from abroad compared to the overall population. Most of them worked in low-skilled jobs (e.g. construction, industry, cleaning). Their income is on average lower than that for Swiss natives because of an earlier retirement age (explained by bad health status due to the demanding nature of the work and higher risk of unemployment) and/or a shorter contribution period to the retirement funds (e.g. due to carrying out professional activity in two or more countries). Those with the worst health status were active in the construction sector; half of whom receive benefits from disability insurance (Bolzman et al. 2004). Nowadays, elderly migrants have either chosen to, or must, spend the last stage of their lives in their host country. They are on average younger than the Swiss population but the share of elderly migrants within the total population aged 65 and over is increasing steadily.3 People originating from Italy, Germany, France, Austria, and Spain are the most numerous. But the proportion of each nationality in relation to the total foreign population varies over time. This evolution reflects the various migration movements during the last century. Italians constitute the most important group among elderly migrants, representing around 40 % of the foreign population aged 65 and over. This share has not varied much over time, while by contrast, other nationalities are constantly on the rise, especially those from southern Europe, including more recent migration flows such as those originating in Portugal or Turkey. In contrast, there has been a large decrease in the number of Northern Europeans in the foreign aged population of Switzerland. When surveying these groups, including those coming from the south of the continent, numerous obstacles induced by their life trajectories and current living conditions may engender their underrepresentation in the responding sample. Scientific literature reveals that there are various barriers that make people with a migrant background hard to reach by standard survey fieldwork procedures. Not speaking the survey language is one factor. But having living conditions that make someone uneasily reachable by standard procedures or having a system of beliefs and values that make the questions not understandable constitute major difficulties as well (Feskens et al. 2006; Lipps et al. 2011; Elcheroth et al. 2011; LaganÃ  et al. 2011).

The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) complements monetary based methods and also reveals the extent and distribution of deprivation. The MPI also captures the magnitude and degree of deprivation overlap (UNDP 2010). About 90 % of the Ethiopian population was deprived access to two or more indicators related to education, health, and living standard between 2000 and 2008 (UNDP 2010). The scale of multidimensional deprivation was as high as 65 %. Of the three categories of human development measures, deprivation in living standards (food, clothing, housing, water, and sanitation) has been greatest. In terms of practically all MPI criteria, the situation of the Ethiopian people compares poorly to other populous countries of the region (Nigeria, Egypt, and neighboring Kenya) (Table 17.2). The extent of income inequality among Ethiopians (Gini-coefficient) has not been substantial in comparison to the other three regional countries during the same period. This situation implies that deprivation and multidimensional poverty in Ethiopia are phenomena experienced by the majority, and are largely explained by the lack of economic capacity rather than skewed distribution of resources. This can largely be attributed to the excessive reliance of the majority of the people on traditional subsistence agriculture. Ethiopia has the largest population of livestock and is the third largest contributor to agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa. Agriculture in Ethiopia is characterized by high labor and livestock intensity, and the use of traditional practices. Among the top five agricultural producers on the continent, it utilizes the least number of tractors and the application of chemical fertilizers is relatively modest. Overall labor productivity or output per farmer is extremely low. The average farmer in Ethiopia earns only around 13 % of the annual earnings of a farmer in Nigeria. Reliance on rainfall and low-technology methods contributes to the extreme poverty of farming households in rural Ethiopia (Table 17.3)."

Since cholera was not endemic, the population lacked immunity. Within months, thousands of people had died and hundreds of thousands had been sickened. NGOs and some international donor agencies, including from the U.N., who were already in Haiti dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake, diverted resources to combat cholera. They distributed medical supplies, organized educational campaigns on cholera prevention, trucked clean drinking water and water purification tablets across the country, and worked with local hospitals to institute rigorous infection control measures. The Haitian and international response to the cholera outbreak rapidly brought the case fatality rate from around 9 % to less than 1 %. Although the outbreak died down, the aid efforts failed to rectify the dire state of Haitiâs water and sanitation infrastructure. During the rainy season, cases would spike again, exposing the difficulty of improving the Haitian health care system so that it could respond to new outbreaks without external assistance. Haiti had been cholera-free for more than a centuryâso how had cholera got there? Almost as soon as the outbreak started, rumors circulated blaming U.N. peacekeepers. A contingent of soldiers from Nepal, where cholera is endemic, had arrived in October 2010. They were stationed at a camp on a tributary of the Artibonite River near where the outbreak began. Waste management at the base was rumored to be inadequate and had allowed sewage to flow into the river. Initially, U.N. officials denied responsibility for bringing cholera to Haiti. But rumors and public protest persisted, fueled by independent investigations suggesting the camp as the source (Piarroux et al. 2011). Finally, the U.N. Secretary General convened an independent panel of experts charged with determining the source of the cholera outbreak. The panel completed its report in May 2011. It argued that the evidence from the Artibonite Riverâs tributary system, the epidemiological timeline, and genetic analyses of Haitian V. cholerae bacteria indicated that the outbreak resulted from contamination of the river with feces carrying a strain of the current South Asian bacterium. Moreover, the report noted that the âhaphazardâ plumbing construction in the main toilet and showering area offered significant potential for cross-contamination, and that heavy rains could cause the open septic pit into which black water was deposited to overflow into the tributary (Cravioto et al. 2011). The report offered a series of recommendations to prevent similar occurrences and concluded The introduction of this cholera strain as a result of environmental contamination with feces could not have been the source of such an outbreak without simultaneous water and sanitation and health care system deficiencies. These deficiencies, coupled with conducive environmental and epidemiological conditions, allowed the spread of the Vibrio cholerae organism in the environment, from which a large number of people became infected. The independent panel concludes that the Haiti cholera outbreak was caused by the confluence of circumstances as described above and was not the fault of, or deliberate action of, a group or individual (Cravioto et al. 2011)."
126,368,0.985,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Turkana villagersâ urgent requests that the GOK stop the threat to the lake from the Gibe III have been sidelined or ignored altogether. Even widespread pleas by northern Turkana ï¬shing communities for GOK support of their ï¬shing rights in the face of Ethiopia-based commercial ï¬shing fleets exploiting Kenyaâs northern Lake Turkana waters have gone unheeded. Members of the Beach Management Units (government controlled but locally based ï¬sheries management bodies) at Lake Turkana continually complain about the governmentâs refusal to respond to their extreme fear of their livelihood being destroyed by the Omo basin developmentsâand in immediate terms by the large, Ethiopia based commercial ï¬shing boats taking major catch from the northern reaches of Kenyaâs lake. â¢ The GOK failed entirely to inform its vast population in the lake region regarding the actual impacts of the Gibe III and its associated development on their communities, let alone earn for their âfree and informed consent,â as mandated by the United Nations, the African Union and the GOK itself. Chap. 9 briefly described how âcommunity consultationsâ with the AFDBâs socioeconomic impact assessment consultants were orchestrated events with what were clearly predetermined outcomes. Villagers in two different communities where such âconsultationsâ were held reported to SONT (South Omo/North Turkana Research Project) researchers that the AFDB âvisitorsâ gave them assurances that the Gibe III dam would bring major amounts of food, clothing, health care and schooling to their communities. No mention was made of lake retreat or its effects on their ï¬shing, their livestock raising or their households. To the contrary, the consultants repeatedly stressed that the lake âwould not be harmedâ by the dam. In their written report for the AFDB (in 2009), the socioeconomic consultants stated in their report (AFDB 2009) that their role was to describe the âbeneï¬tsâ of the dam for local communities. By all accounts, Kenyan police, local government ofï¬cials and âtranslatorsâ were highly intimidating in these meetings (one of which SONT researchers attended.) Despite the consultantsâ assurances to communities regarding the Gibe III and âpositiveâ conclusions regarding the socioeconomic impacts of the dam in their report back to the AFDB, the consultants did notate (although inconspicuously in the reportâs main textâsee Chap. 6) extreme anger expressed by village elders over the dam project, which they had learned from other sources would bring destruction to their ï¬shing and livestock raising at the lake. The exceptionally low quality of information gathering and analysis by the AFDB socioeconomic impact consultants for the Lake Turkana region, combined with their obvious bias (even self described) throughout the process, underscore the assessmentâs invalidity. There has been no adequate socioeconomic or environmental comprehensive impact assessment of the Lake Turkana region facing extreme crisis. â¢ A major proportion of Turkana pastoralists and ï¬shers settled in villages along Lake Turkana (see Fig. 9.4 and in nearby lands were either omittedâor in some cases. vastly underestimatedâin the GOKâs 2009 census. These communities are therefore unlikely in the extreme to be accounted with the dismantlement of their ï¬shing and pastoral from the effects of lake retreat. Those households and communities surviving destruction from lake retreat who do manage to relocate to a town with the hope of receiving assistance are likely to be regarded as drought victims rather than development victims. Given the highly aridic conditions of the region and the immense distances required, few would be able to reach Kenyaâs international borders to be counted as ârefugeesâ. When discussing their situation and their fear of changes to come, comments such as, You will just come across our bones on the landâ are commonplace among village elders at the lake. Ironically, these types of comments by the Turkana are also common among their northern neighbors, the Dasanech, with whom they are locked into increasing armed conflict in the face of their equally desperate efforts to survive (Fig. 5.3). â¢ Fear of Kenyaâs security forces prevails throughout the northernmost Turkana territory, as these forces are widely known to operate with impunityâincluding with brutality, in some areas. Although to date, the GOK has not exercised politically repressive measures equal to those of the GOE, the government is intolerant of opposition, whether to the Gibe III development or to the widespread incursion of oil corporations into Turkana lands (see Appendix A). Such threats have caused major curtailment of community voice throughout the area. â¢ In 2012, Kenya and Ethiopia, along with the World Bank and the AFDB, announced their partnership to build a USD 1.2 billion energy transmission line from Ethiopia to Kenya: the Eastern Electricity Highway Project, or"
214,441,0.985,Demystifying Climate Models : a Users Guide To Earth System Models (Volume 2.0),"11.4.1 Tropical Cyclones Tropical cyclones are an important and relatively small-scale atmospheric phenomena. A climate model at low resolution will not adequately represent tropical cyclones, but it will typically have weak versions of them: warm-core cyclonic systems in the tropics that propagate like tropical cyclones but with very low wind speeds. These can be estimated, and how these âpseudo stormsâ change in the future can be used as a guide. Or the âpotentialâ for storms can be derived. For tropical cyclones, this is often based on an index derived from present conditions that predict average storm intensity from the large-scale moisture and wind ï¬elds. These indexes of âpotential stormsâ or âpotential intensityâ can be estimated in climate models now and in the future. This is one example of downscaling discussed in Chap. 5: using large-scale output to represent what ï¬ne-scale structures should be present. The danger with a lot of these proxy or downscaling methods is the danger of overï¬tting to the present day: If a measure of tropical cyclones is based on sea surface temperatures of the tropical oceans, and the current maximum is 82 Â°F (28 Â° C), how will this work if the maximum rises to 84 Â°F (29 Â°C)? We are out of the range of observations. There is no guarantee that the proxy based on sea surface temperatures will represent the same variability in cyclones now or in the future if we are forced to extrapolate a statistical model to future conditions that have not been experienced in the past."
219,429,0.985,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"(Nkonya et al. 2013). This is consistent with Orubu and Omotor (2011) who observed that African countries are turning the environmental Kuznet curve at a much faster pace and at a lower income level than countries in other regions. The cost of land degradation however has a positive relationship with GDP suggesting increasing degradation beyond the inflection point. This shows the potential for severe degradation even in high incomes that are observed in Chap. 6. Interestingly, severity of poverty, as represented by the infant mortality rate, is negatively related to cost of land degradation and cropland expansion. The results suggest that poor people have the capacity to sustainably manage their land if other mediating factors are taken into account. Export leads to higher cost of land degradation but reduces cropland expansion. The impact of export on cost of land degradation is consistent with Rudel et al. (2009b) and Foley et al. (2011)âpredominantly agricultural export volume. The negative impact of export on cropland expansion is contrary to Lambin and Meyfroidt (2011) and could be explained by the greater intensiï¬cation of export crops compared to non-export crops (Kelly 2006; Crawford et al. 2003). For example, fertilizer application and use of improved varieties is greater for high-value and export crops than on other crops (Ibid). The contradictory results of higher cost of land degradation and reduced cropland expansion could be explained by the fact that cost of land degradation is a sum of all types of LUCC. It is possible that export crops are planted on a relatively smaller area but are replacing high value biome such as forests. For example, the recent large foreign agricultural investment in SSA with heavy orientation towards meeting food and energy needs of investing countries, rather than for domestic consumption (Anseeuw et al. 2012; World Bank 2011) has triggered cropland expansion into forested areas even when there is intensiï¬cation (Schoneveld et al. 2011). The expansion into forested area could occupy a smaller but higher value area and could therefore imply reduced cropland expansion but lead to high value LUCC. As expected, ODA funding reduces cost of land degradationâsuggesting a favorable impact of international budget on environmental and agricultural ministries in SSA. Similarly, ODA funding has a negative impact on cropland expansion for the reduced model (Table 9.16). The results suggest that public investment can help efforts to address land degradation. Cattle density has negative impact on cost of land degradation suggesting that areas with higher cattle density are less degraded than other areas. This supports other ï¬ndings which have shown that pastoral areas are less degraded than cropland areas in SSA. This is consistent with Nkonya and Anderson (2015) who observed greater propensity to sustainably manage land with greater cattle density and with Bai et al. (2008), who observed greater land improvement in pastureland. The results suggest that there is great potential for rehabilitating the 339.80 million ha of degraded grazing areas (Chap. 8).

73,413,0.985,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"As outlined above, the process of assessing and managing risks associated with the extraction of CSG and shale gas is complex because there is no one comprehensive CSG and shale gas speciï¬c risk assessment approach that encompasses community concerns and consultation and the entire CSG shale gas extraction process. In addition, as outlined above, in NSW there are two contradictory risk assessment requirements. Similarly, in Queensland there is no all-encompassing risk assessment methodology that addresses all of the above concerns. Complications also arise in both jurisdictions because of the competing interests of gas producers and communities and the highly politically charged government decision making processes. As explained above, governments are caught between an economically driven imperative to extract CSG and shale gas and a community objective to prevent the vitiation of potable water, groundwater and aquifers. Relative to divergence of the two legislatively mandatory NSW (CoPs) there are contradictory risk assessment requirements for fracking and gas wellhead extraction methods: On the one hand the Code of Practice for Coal Seam Gas Fracture Stimulation Activities requires a Fracture Stimulation Management Plan (FSMP) that must be in place prior to the commencement of a fracture stimulation activity and, on the other hand, âThe FSMP is a non-technical document which is designed to demonstrate to the NSW Government and other stakeholders that the titleholder will appropriately manage the risks associated with the fracture stimulation activity"

Both states capture this income directly from the activity of extractive industries of minerals and hydrocarbons, and these rents substitute other sources that are more politically expensive to obtain (e.g. taxes). Thanks to these rents, the states can carry out distributive policies that are less expensive than their alternatives (e.g. urban or rural property reforms). These characteristics interact to produce an overall effect of acceptance of the government in power and more generally of the state. Beginning in the years from 2000 to 2002, approximately, Bolivia and Ecuador have regained signiï¬cant economic growth rates; and this growth has been accompanied by signiï¬cant reductions in poverty and inequality.1 These trends are due to three main factors. First is the increase in world-market prices of the oil, gas and minerals exported by both countries.2 Second, the Andean states have recovered their ability to capture the rents produced by the exploitation of natural resources. Third, the governments have invested in improving the state capacity to manage the rents, orienting them towards the broad distribution of the"
83,44,0.985,Housing Market Dynamics in Africa,"Abidjan clogged drainage systems, damaged roads, and killed 23 people living in the cityâs slums. There is therefore a need to redesign city sewerage and drainage systems to meet current rising demand. This is essential to improving the livability of Africaâs cities. Limited transportation infrastructure has made many cities heavily congested, lowering the quality of life of urban dwellers and the ease of doing business, thereby reducing productivity. Similarly, low urban electrification rates in Africa, ranging from 4 percent in South Sudan to 100 percent in Mauritius with a continental average of 68 percent is also a serious threat to African firmsâ productivity and competitiveness (IEA 2015). Moreover, it is well known that the unreliable power supply affects the delivery of quality health care services and peopleâs well-being. Therefore, it is clear that the current urbanization processes around the continent have generated dysfunctional cities with poor service delivery, notably with respect to decent and affordable housing and infrastructure. Such unsatisfactory outcomes reflect the lack of adequate incentives and mechanisms to enable relevant stakeholders, particularly governments which are responsible for urban planning and strategies, to take appropriate measures to ensure that the urbanization process, in tandem with the housing sector development, can be harnessed for Africaâs structural transformation. The current inadequate incentive system could be characterized as follows: â¢ Cost to remedy inadequate urban planning and strategies is very high and potential benefits uncertain. In fact, in most African countries, the urbanization plans and strategies were conceived following independence but with a strong influence and inheritance from colonial times (see Chaps. 1 and 4). It is also important to note that, as reported by Parnell and Simon (2011), some African countries do not even have an urbanization strategy. Although some countries are now trying to update their urban plans and strategies, the process in most countries has been very slow. This is due to the fact that most cities were built from back to front, which has generated numerous problems or deleterious outcomes that are difficult to reconcile in one policy or strategy and, most importantly, are very costly for governments. Those deleterious outcomes include huge housing deficits, high costs to retrofit"
4,271,0.985,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"initiatives to collect child development data have been completed in Rio de Janeiro, and data on provider-level quality for center-based care services have been collected in Florianopolis, Brazil. Critics of many current assessments base their skepticism on differencesâ mostly culturalâthat, they argue, make it difficult to generalize expectations regarding what young children should know or be able to do at a given age. Despite the difficulties involved, however, countries in the region urgently need to agree on a set of instruments for measuring early child development that can be collected on representative samples of individuals, as is done in the household surveys, and others that can be collected for the population at large. Second, data are not always up-to-date or well aggregated. For example, whether due to fiscal limitations or governmental choices, or both, Guatemala relies on census data that are more than a decade old. That current data do not exist is troublesome as it is the only available information to determine the siting of programs and the allocation of resources. Data aggregation is also challenging. In Trinidad and Tobago, for example, fairly recent data are collected and even reported, but much of the data is aggregated for children from birth to 19 years of age. Given this aggregation frame, it is difficult to filter out relevant data to improve programs or for other key decisions that affect age-related services for younger children. Third, shortcomings in institutional and human capacities contribute to all of the challenges involved in generating, managing, and using information systems. In some countries (and in less-developed regions within all countries), technological gaps and connectivity problems still impose constraints on the construction of modern data systems. Technical and institutional capacity varies greatly not only between countries, but also across different sectors and institutions within each country. Conceiving quality from a systemic perspective requires thinking beyond programmatic data collection efforts toward more systemic collection and utilization of data. Data collection efforts do not necessarily need to be integrated into one central database; they can still be housed in separate sectors. What makes them systemic is that the different data sets are conceived as part of an integrated system, with the data being available to, and easily merged with,"
56,139,0.985,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"maintaining inclusion in the French healthcare system is an important priority for older hostel residents, and one which timetables their trips to France. The rationale for these back-and-forth trips constitutes the heart of this bookâs analysis. However, back-and-forth mobility itself can have a negative impact on health: this is the third way in which health and migration interact, underlining the complex interrelationship between migration and health (Findley 1988). I term this inter-relationship the âhealthâmigration order.â With this term I wish to build on Sally Findleyâs bi-directional concept of âhealth-migration relationsâ, namely whether declines in health status influence the propensity to migrate and, vice versa, whether the act of migration impacts negatively on health (Findley 1988). Findley shows that health-migration relations are particularly salient for older people, while young peopleâs patterns of poor health and migration do not seem to be correlated (ibid). However, Findley draws her findings from crosssectional survey data mainly recording within-country moves rather than international moves, overlooking a key dynamic insofar as international migrants are widely thought to be selected by better health vis-Ã -vis their peers, giving rise to the âhealthy migrantâ effect (Abraido-Lanza et al. 1999; Marmot et al. 1984; Moullan and Jusot 2014; Razum et al. 2000).1 While utilising cross-sectional survey data provides robust tests of different health-migration models in the studies cited here, the added value of a qualitative lifecourse approach â which this research adopts â is to highlight the influence of both bad and good health on decisions to emigrate, return and/or circulate across borders, in different historical periods and under different border control regimes (Montes de Oca at el. 2011). As Baykara-Krumme (2013) concludes, health status is a factor in the decision to return but its influence is not clear-cut. For some, poor health leads to a bi-residence strategy in order to benefit from better quality and/or subsidised healthcare in host countries, whereas for others poor health may force individuals to settle definitively either in the home country or the host country (Baykara-Krumme 2013). The findings of this book, in this chapter and Chap. 7, support this insight about the ambivalent effect of poor health. Just as was found in Chap. 3, the menâs ânon-standardâ biographies have a bearing on their interactions with welfare institutions, in this case healthcare professionals. As will be covered below, non-standard biographical features include premature ageing due to difficult working conditions and work accidents; language barriers in the patient-carer relationship; and lack of family entourage to provide informal care, meaning that an extra duty of care falls upon formal providers. Finally, the epigraph to the previous chapter showed how an identity based on papers can compensate for the loss of the identity of âworkerâ which occurs at retirement. In the concluding pages to this chapter, I speculate as to whether an alternative identity based on illness can play a similar âcompensatoryâ role, functioning as a rationale for non-return, especially when justifying this decision to family members remaining back home. Other scholars speak of a migrant mortality paradox: in many contexts, migrants have lower mortality rates than non-migrants, once socio-economic status is controlled for (Darmon and Khlat 2001; Deboosere and Gadenye 2005; Norredam et al. 2015; Wallace and Kulu 2015)."

At 18,000 people per day on the systemâs first line that covers 16.5 km, transport capacity is very high, and costs are twenty times lower than those of an elevated train. These mobility patterns primarily prove one thing: There is no single answer to the question of how to manage ever-increasing traffic volumes. Instead, there is a variety of answers that give consideration to issues ranging from local conditions to topography. It can also be seen that, at least in urban areas, local authorities are keen on finding solutions and have identified mobility as a factor in the international competition over geographic locations."
151,379,0.985,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"There is concern about potential adverse effects of pesticides on pollinators (EFSA 2012; NAS 2007). Chlorpyrifos (CPY; CAS No. 2921-88-2) is an organophosphorus insecticide and acaricide that is widely used in agriculture and horticulture in the U.S. and other countries to control a wide variety of foliage- and soil-borne insect pests on a variety of food and feed crops (Solomon et al. 2014). Many of the agro-ecosystems where CPY is used contain populations of managed and wild pollinators. In some of these, such as almonds, citrus fruits, and cranberries, pollinators play a critical role in the production of the crop being protected with sprays of CPY. Other crops, such as soybean and corn, which are treated with CPY, do not directly rely on pollinators for production because they are mainly pollinated by wind, but can nonetheless serve as a source of forage for multiple species of pollinators during parts of the season. In addition to food (pollen and/or nectar), pollinators might also obtain nesting materials and occupy nesting sites in habitats exposed to CPY. In this study, the risk posed by use of CPY to insects that serve as pollinators was assessed. Patterns of use of CPY that are currently registered in the U.S. and Canada were the main focus (Solomon et al. 2014), but tests with formulations used in other countries were considered when relevant data from the U.S. were lacking. Because microencapsulated formulations are not used in the U.S., they were excluded from the assessment. Bees were the focal taxa but other groups of insects were also considered when data were relevant and available, particularly where they are used as surrogate species in regulatory risk assessments. Non-insect pollinators were not considered. Most studies and scenarios explored for the risk assessment were concerned with agricultural systems, but patterns of use of CPY in horticulture and landscaping, such as turf were considered."
169,807,0.985,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"27.5.2 Socioeconomic Factors Inï¬uencing Fishery Sustainability As previously noted, SUSFISH was founded in recognition of the history of failure of development projects grounded only on technical and/or scientiï¬c advances. In BF alone we found examples of failure to adopt modernizing technology in the form of abandoned equipment and infrastructure (ï¬sh ponds, refrigerators, ï¬sh weighing scales, ï¬sh shops). For that reason SUSFISH sponsored research into the social, economic, and political barriers and bridges the gap to sustainable ï¬sheries. Our research indicates that, while some encouraging examples exist, there are abundant barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries provided by challenges of governance at multiple levels in BF. Our results conï¬rm that ï¬sh size and ï¬sh community diversity are associated with the degree and quality of management, both of ï¬sheries directly and of the habitat surrounding the ï¬shery. For example, the Nazinga site has relatively unimpacted habitat (land management) and has a closed ï¬shing season that is well-regulated (ï¬sheries management), and it has signiï¬cantly larger ï¬sh and a higher share in adult ï¬sh than any other sampling site. Furthermore, both ï¬sh and BMI diversity are higher in protected areas, e.g., Nazinga, Mare aux Hippo than in others. Just as important to biodiversity conservation as the legal content of policy is its execution at the appropriate level (subsidiarity) by well-organized and led local actors. For example, in Moussodougou the ï¬sheries are directly controlled by a local association that effectively enforces rules. Situations with effective management are associated with an increased biomasses and abundance with large ï¬sh specimens. A prominent overarching challenge is that it appears that ï¬sheries management is not equally applied all over BF but is concentrated in a few large reservoirs of ânational economic interest,â e.g., Ziga, Bagre, Kompienga, and Sourou. Fishing in these large water bodies is dominated by commercial ï¬shermen, who are regulated and in good communication with government ofï¬cers. However, elsewhere in BF communication is not so good for management organs devoted to smaller reservoirs, except for four ï¬shing concessions given to the associations of the local ï¬shermen (Bapla, Moussodougou, Tandjari, and Lera). Aside from these few examples of successful organization of local management capacity, for the most part, there are gaps between national and lower levels of governance. Brieï¬y, a governance system that effectively functions from the central, national level out to the regional and local levels has yet to be established. Often the link between law and practices to monitor ï¬sheries is missing (law is not adopted in practice). Therefore there is little effective police monitoring or enforcement of ï¬shing practices at the lower levels, e.g., smaller-scale ï¬sheries. While efforts to decentralize management authority have been underway for years, the failure to comprehensively bridge institutions from national to local levels is hampered by the frequency of shifts of governance responsibilities (institutional nomadism) for ï¬sheries management at the national level. One salient example of the poor communication that results from such âadministrative ï¬uxâ is the general"
302,371,0.985,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"1 The Social-Ecological Risk Perspective: Addressing Global Risks A common risk definition is that âthe term âriskâ denotes the likelihood that an undesirable state of reality (adverse effects) may occur as a result of natural events or human activitiesâ [1]. A classical risk analysis calculates the possibility of an adverse event and the potential damage, for instance, an assessment of ecotoxicity of hazardous substances based on dose-response relationships. For âglobal risks,â also termed systemic risks, classical risk analysis is not so easily applicable, since the characteristics of âglobal risksâ comprise complex cause-effect linkages, which are not fully known, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity in assessing the risk. For this reason, consent to risk management strategies is difficult to obtain [2, 3]. Who or what can be âat riskâ? In social-ecological risk research, risks to humans and biophysical entities (e.g., biocoenoses, ecosystems) are considered. The causes of risks mostly lie in human activities, since many natural resources and biophysical processes are influenced by societies [4]. In social-ecological risk research, it has become clear that assessment of the risk alone is not sufficient for management and policy decisions [5]. It is also important to consider the risk perception and concerns of different interest groups [6]. In the case of complex risks which are accompanied by uncertainty, it is important to define the degree of tolerability and acceptability in order to find management strategies acceptable to all interest groups [7]. Therefore, a prerequisite for risk management and related policy-making is not only scientific evidence but also an agreement of the different interest groups on how to understand, interpret, and value the evidence. Hereafter, we will outline the characteristics of global risks from a socialecological perspective and present four arguments framing microplastics as a global risk. (a) Global risks are not produced by an extreme event or a disaster but are created in modern societies as a side effect of an âeveryday modeâ of systemâs operation [8, 9] and regulation of the supply system [4]. From this understanding, we derive our first thesis, arguing that the risks of microplastics are produced as an unintended side effect of everyday operations in modern societies. (b) Global risks are complex; thus, no clear evidence of a cause-effect linkage exists or can be proven, due to âintervening variables,â âlong delay periods between cause and effect,â or âpositive and negative feedback loopsâ [10]. These and the state of ânot knowingâ [8] contribute to a high degree of uncertainty regarding effects, especially in terms of scope and time. Thus, we"

Even with no net global change, there can still be regional changes in climate. The spread in results from the different formulations of climate models is due to different forcing and different responses to forcing. The response to a forcing includes all the feedbacks in the system that determine (in Fig. 11.2) how the system will respond to climate forcing. A larger response to the same forcing is a more sensitive climate (higher sensitivity). Note in particular that given the spread in models (model uncertainty, the shaded regions in Fig. 11.2), the scenario uncertainty is dominant after 2060 or so (the shaded regions no longer overlap). The model predictions of this scenario are within these bands, and thus the resulting surface temperature really depends on the scenario uncertainty after the middle of this century. The current generation of models is not likely to be very wrong. Counting on the scientiï¬c community to be very wrong on these metrics is not a prudent strategy. The global surface temperature record is far from smooth, which makes understanding and attributing these large-scale curves difï¬cult. In fact, there is plenty of evidence of the âï¬ts and startsâ to the global average surface temperature. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.3, showing the historical temperature changes from 1870 to 2010 from observations (black lines) and model simulations of these changes. There are multiple black thick lines reflecting different observational data sets: these overlap for the last 50 years or so but deviate from each other before that. Some of the big sudden dips in models and observations occur due to volcanic eruptions that put a lot of sulfur gas (sulfur dioxide, SO2) into the stratosphere. The"

Also climate models predicted that precipitation will shift from the north to the south (Boonyawat and Chiwanno 2007). Based on climate data generated by a global circulation model temperature in Thailand projected to increase 2Â° Câ4 Â°C by the end of the century (ADB 2009). Jesdapipat (2008) stated that storms in Thailand have become more intense which is consistent with the subjective perceptions of respondents in our sample. In Vietnam it has been predicted that most regions will experience an increase in temperature of 2Â° Câ4 Â°C by the end of the century (Cuong 2008). The same author also found that in most areas of Vietnam, overall rainfall intensity has increased considerably while monthly rainfall has decreased between the months of July and August, but has increased between September and November. It is also expected that the Southern part of Vietnam will become drier. In Table 3, we illustrate the perceived impact of climate change by farmers on the performance of agriculture, in particular in crop production and their adaptation measures. It is striking that in all six provinces of the two countries a considerable share of households reports a decline in yields. The highest shares with over 60% of households reporting are in Buri Ram and Dak Lak, both provinces with a strong agricultural potential. In these two provinces the occurrence of drought stress was most frequent which is quite consistent with their observations on the change in climate generally and in rainfall reported in Table 2. In spite of the high share of households who report an impact on crop production only between one fourth and two fifth undertake adaptation measures. This kind of discrepancy has also been observed in a study of farmers in Ethiopia"

The goal is to compare participants with non-participants who are as similar as possible except for receiving the programme in order to measure the differential impact of the intervention. The âwithâ data are observed in a household survey that records outcomes for recipients of the intervention. The âwithoutâ data, however, are fundamentally unobserved since a household cannot be both a participant and a non-participant of the same programme (see Asfaw et al. 2012 for detail). However, the outcomes of non-beneficiaries may still differ systematically from what the outcomes of participants would have been without the programme, producing selection bias in the estimated impacts. This bias may derive from differences in observable characteristics (e.g., location, demographic composition, access to infrastructure, wealth, etc.) or unobservable characteristics (e.g., natural ability, willingness to work, etc.). Some observable and unobservable characteristics do not vary with time (such as natural ability) while others may vary (such as skills). Furthermore the existence of unobservables correlated with both the outcome of interest and the programme intervention can result in additional bias (i.e., omitted variables)."

166,302,0.985,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),Surveying a population requires some prior information to be able to design the sample. In the case of surveying vulnerability this would mean knowing beforehand who might potentially be in a vulnerable condition. Such priors are drawn from previous results and surveys that indicate which population strata are more at risk of being vulnerable and need particular attention. For instance it is a common practice in birth cohort studies to oversample children from immigrant or low-income families. This approach produces high-quality data to investigate important issues concerning for instance inter-generational transmission of vulnerability. However it focuses on the life trajectories that have a vulnerable condition as their starting point but may fall short of capturing transitions into vulnerability. In addition while birth cohort studies can easily survey second-generation immigrants they provide poor information on the first generation. Collecting the same type of data on this population would require starting the study in a foreign country and monitoring the migration to the country of interest. Given these drawbacks it appears retrospective methods may be necessary to investigate certain research questions. Starting from these considerations researchers have used different methods to minimize memory errors in surveys including decomposition (e.g. breaking a class of events into subclasses) the use of reversed chronological order the use of landmarks (e.g. transition points) and incrementing the time to answer survey questions (see Tourangeau 2000). Among these methods life history calendars (LHCs) seem to perform particularly well because they enhance several aspects of memory retrieval (Caspi et al. 1996; Freedman et al. 1988). The LHC is typically a two-way grid with the temporal dimension on one side and different life domains (e.g. residence family employment) on the other. Respondents report events for each life domain relating them to what happened in other life domains or to other time markers. With LHCs respondents can visualize their life trajectory linking what happened to when where it happened and for how long it lasted. Thus the calendar tools facilitate respondentsâ ability to place events into a temporal context by relating them to other synchronic (parallel) or diachronic (hierarchical) events and episodes that occurred in the life span (Belli 1998). Researchers have produced a large corpus of evidence in the last 30 years comparing the quality of data obtained with LHCs and conventional questionnaires. For instance Becker and Sosa (1992) showed the LHC resulted in more consistent reports (i.e. less superposition of mutually exclusive behaviours) than the conventional questionnaire. Goldman et al. (1989) and Yoshihama et al. (2005) argued that the calendar was more effective in enhancing the recall and reporting of specific events (e.g. contraceptive use domestic violence victimization). Engel et al. (2001a) suggested that the LHC performed better than the traditional question-list in terms of completeness. The visual nature of the calendar makes it easier for the interviewee and the interviewer to spot incongruous answers in the data reducing the unaccounted for amount of time in the respondentâs life course. Test-retest reliability studies showed very high agreement for reported life events such as marriages and migrations (Engel et al. 2001b).
364,311,0.985,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract We are frequently required to assess, mitigate, and monitor certain environmental risks involved in our daily activities at both the local and global environment levels. Corporations, in particular, can cause environmental pollution or other risks as a result of either accidents or natural events. In order to limit, and hopefully prevent, these environmental impacts, environmental risk management places a strong emphasis on targeting the problems that could arise, and implements a system of metrics that help with prevention and management. Eutrophication is one example of a widespread environmental pollution phenomenon that is currently worsening in lake basins. Proliferation of phytoplankton is due primarily to high concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) discharged from industrial and urban waste. However, assessing, managing, and forecasting the pollution of basins requires considerable time and support tools to analyze a range of water quality indicators over time and geographical area. This study investigated the relationship between organic matter (chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total N, and P) and biomass of phytoplankton (indicated by Chlorophyll-a) in order to shorten the period required for analysis, predict eutrophication of lakes ahead of time, and promptly prevent the spread of contaminants. Based on this relationship, we can use Chlorophyll-a as a biological indicator in monitoring and assessing the levels of organic pollution. In addition, we can identify ways to reduce pollution and transportation of pollutants in stagnant lake basins, and contribute to reducing the damage due to environmental risks.

73,720,0.985,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Despite the existence of the ICSU research program Integrated Research on Disaster Risk, the science plan for IRDR (ICSU 2008) indicates that food security is not an aspect of its research mandate. Thus the international aspects, including the urban aspects, of the agricultural disruption, economic disruption and logistical disruption to food availability, food access and food quality as a result of natural disasters remains an under-researched topic. Climate change is affecting (and will affect) global food production and hence global food security. Urban agriculture plays a signiï¬cant role in maintaining and improving the health of city dwellers, particularly those disadvantaged. Climate changes are likely to impact more severely on urban environments with associated negative effects on food security, as has been discussed. Existing research programmes are not addressing these aspects of climate change effectively and deserve immediate attention.

77,138,0.985,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Previous Research on Health Inequalities and CF People with CF from more disadvantaged groups in the UK and US die earlier than those from more advantaged backgrounds. In the UK, the first study to look at social differences in survival in CF found a consistent trend from 1959 to 1986 towards higher age at death in CF patients in more advantaged social groups on the basis of occupational class (Britton 1989). The authors speculated that the observed lower survival chances in lower social classes could relate to lack of access to the appropriate services, poorer nutrition, increased parental smoking, and poorer quality housing. Evidence from the US corroborated these findings, and indicated higher survival rates in the 1980s and 1990s among more advantaged socio-economic groups, measured by Medicaid status and area-based income, compared with their less advantaged counterparts (Schechter et al. 2001; Schechter 2004; OâConnor et al. 2003). For instance the adjusted risk of death was around four times higher in CF patients with Medicaid cover (used as a surrogate for poverty) compared to those without Medicaid cover (Schechter et al. 2001). Two studies from the US showed differences in lung function on the basis of measures of SES. For instance Schechter et al. also showed significantly lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (%FEV1 ) at age 5 in the Medicaid patients (9.2 percentage points, 95 % CI 7.1â11.4), and this gap increased slightly in an age dependent manner up to age 20. OâConnor et al. extended the work of Schechterâs team by demonstrating a social gradient in the relationship between area-based income in the US, and mortality rates, lung function and weight (OâConnor et al. 2003). The authors point out the limitations of the ecological (area-based) measure of SES used in their analysis, and suggest that the associations observed may be due to poor adherence to medications, or local environmental conditions. In many chronic illnesses, differences in access to specialist health care by SES are evident. These differences often contribute to the exacerbation of health inequalities, since a bias towards more advantaged groups is widespread across health care (Stirbu et al. 2011). This could be particularly important in the context of inequalities in outcomes for a disease like CF, where treatment advances have had such a profound effect on survival. The studies exploring access to services and treatments in CF have been predominantly from the US, and have demonstrated a mixed picture, depending on the type of treatment under consideration, and the exact measure of SES used (OâConnor et al. 2003; Schechter et al. 2009, 2011). For instance, one study showed greater access to intravenous (IV) antibiotics for older"

The points, which represent the incidence of OJT in LAC countries, are mostly located above the line. Thus, the incidence of OJT in LAC is generally higher than in other countries with similar per capita income. The only exceptions are Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Panama. However, measures of incidence do not differentiate between firms that train many workers and those that train a few. For this reason, we also consider intensity indicators, which measure the proportion of workers trained. Because of the design of the WBES, this indicator can only be calculated for the manufacturing sector, where firms that provide OJT programs typically train between 38 and 78 % of their workers (Table 5.2). The intensity of OJT can also be measured in terms of training duration.

This may be psychological or physical and may include illnesses such as diabetes and cardiac, respiratory or renal disease. Sometimes social and practical considerations may exclude a patient from undergoing stem cell transplant, yet as nurses we must aim to support where possible to ensure the best treatment options can be delivered. Co-morbidity index tools have been used to predict outcomes in patients with cancer for several years, and some validated index tools such as Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) consider medical history to estimate a prognosis or oneyear mortality. Each factor is assigned to a point number of 1, 2, 3 or 6. Patients may have more than one disorder in each group, clearly increasing risk; however, the CCI was felt not necessarily relevant to patients undergoing HSCT because the factors within the groups would often already be considered an exclusion to transplant and did not reflect frequent morbidities experienced by haematology patients (Sorror et al. 2005). Subsequently the HCTI, which is considered more relevant to HSCT, was designed. This tool reflects the conditions that some of the patients face prior to transplant, which may be as a result of previous therapies used to treat the disease or indeed the disease itself and can be used to risk assess potential co-morbidity prior to allogeneic transplant. Karnofsky Performance Status, also known as KPS, has scores ranging from 0 to 100 (0 being deceased and 100 being normal with no problems with activities of living or disease present). KPS can be used to infer a patient prognosis and ability to perform activities of normal living. Dependent on the indication for transplant and patient wellbeing prior to commencing condi-"
230,18,0.985,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"1.1 Introduction From messages in bottles to exotic tropical seeds washing up on temperate shores (Guppy 1917; Muir 1937), the dispersal of floating debris at sea has long fascinated people. As early as 1870 Jules Verne provided a graphic description of how floating debris accumulates in ocean gyres in the chapter on the Sargasso Sea in his famous novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea. However, this review focuses on the last 50 years because from the perspective of environmental impacts the history of marine litter research is closely linked to the development of plastics. Plastics are a diverse group of synthetic polymers that have their origins in the late 19th century, but which really came to the fore in the mid-twentieth century. Their low density, durability, excellent barrier properties and relatively low cost make plastics ideal materials for a wide range of manufacturing and packaging applications. Their versatility has seen the amount of plastic produced annually increase rapidly over the last few decades to an estimated 288 million tonnes in 2012 (Fig. 1.1), and this total continues to grow at about 4 % per year (PlasticsEurope 2013). However, the properties that make plastics so useful also make inappropriately handled waste plastics a significant environmental threat. Their durability means that they persist in the environment for many years, and their low density means that they are readily dispersed by water and wind, sometimes travelling thousands of kilometres from source areas (Ryan et al. 2009). As a result, plastic wastes are now ubiquitous pollutants in even the most remote areas of the world (Barnes et al. 2009). Over the last 60 years we have seen a major shift in perception surrounding the use of plastics, especially in one-off applications. Once seen as the savior of the American housewife (Life Magazine 1955), there are now calls to treat waste plastics as hazardous materials (Rochman et al. 2013a), reiterating a point first made by Bean (1987) that persistent plastic wastes qualify as hazardous wastes under the US Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Most of the threats posed by plastics occur at sea (Gregory 2009; Thompson et al. 2009), where waste plastics tend to accumulate (Barnes et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2009). This chapter briefly summarises the history of marine litter research. Trends in the numbers of"
46,106,0.985,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"the distinction between individual, relational and institutional factors (Yoshikawa, Aber and Beardslee 2012). Important factors found include the influence of family poverty on parenting stress, depressed parental mood, marital conflict and household violence; all of these correlate with neglect and reduced parent investment in the child. The lack of cognitively stimulating materials and experiences appears to contribute in particular to differences in cognitive development, which also affects the benefit children can obtain from schooling and further education. Neighborhood poverty, again, is related to an insecure environment, the quality of schooling and the availability of youth programs; exposure to these stressors may overwhelm children and influence their neural development. Studies that observed the influence of childhood poverty on adult mental health also found it to be correlated to a range of mental health problems and psychological disorders (Evans and Cassells 2014; Gilman et al. 2002; Najman et al. 2010). This evidence on the illbeing and ill-becoming due to child poverty makes clear that poverty heightens the risk of growing up in an adverse environment but that lack of money alone is not the cause for mental ill health. Rather, we must look at what is often caused by the combination of a low socioeconomic status and the lack of a comprehensive welfare system; namely, stress and insecurity, which affect families and children living in these circumstances in such a negative way. Evidence also shows that children in low socioeconomic level families show self-harming behavior such as overdose and self-injury, which, in turn, shows that poverty takes a high toll on the minds of children and adolescents (Ayton, Rasool and Cottrell 2003). While it is true that children in rich families might also develop mental ill health due to all the above-mentioned reasons, living in poverty makes it much more likely. Likewise, it is a problem of justice because poverty can be prevented. The effects of poverty during pregnancy have also been researched â it can act as a chronic stressor, and high levels of prenatal stress are suspected of negatively affecting the brain development of the fetus, which in turn leads to lower general intellectual and language abilities in toddlers (Laplante et al. 2004). When it comes to physical health, studies have demonstrated many negative influences of child poverty on both children and adults: The low socioeconomic status of the mother is correlated with lower birth weight and preterm birth, both significant health risks for the infant (Dunkel Schetter and Lobel 2011). A recent study found that the effects of childhood poverty are especially predictive of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes and that they appear in large part to be biologically embedded, such that later improved life circumstances have only a"
219,950,0.985,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Conclusions The vastness of the territory of the Russian Federation inevitably leads to a diversity of natural conditions that causes the development of multiple approaches to the economic use of land resources. Climatic conditions have a direct and indirect impact on biological components of natural landscapes and soil forming processes. In their turn the biophysical conditions determine the shape of agricultural development of the territory, with various land-use systems and with different major degradation processes. The major drivers of degradation include climatic change, unsustainable agricultural practices, industrial and mining activities, expansion of crop production to fragile and marginal areas, inadequate maintenance of irrigation and drainage networks, and overgrazing. The calculations show that the total land use/cover dynamic changes are about 130 million ha, and the total annual costs of land degradation due to land-use change only, i.e. without the costs of land degradation due to soil-ecological conditions and productivity within the same land use, are about 189 billion USD for the period of 2001â2009. i.e. 23.6 billion USD annually. The total economic value of ecosystem goods and services is estimated to equal about 3700 billion USD in Russia, exceeding the GDP by 3 times. The costs of action against land degradation are lower than the costs of inaction in Russia by 5â6 times over the 30 year horizon, meaning that each dollar spent on addressing land degradation is likely to have about 5â6 dollars of returns. In our opinion this is a signiï¬cant economic justiï¬cation to favor rational agricultural and sustainable land use practices and also actions against degradation. Almost 92 % of the costs of action are made up of the opportunity costs of action. On the other hand, at the level of Azov district, Rostov province, we have found that the cost of action against land degradation is 1.07 times higher than cost of inaction. We recommend raising awareness on the ELD in Russia for improving the effectiveness of agricultural production, however we have to mention that the average TEV used in these calculations should be corrected in future work, with reference to Russian local surveys and data."
242,196,0.985,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","By sending women to Spain for the picking of strawberries as part of a temporary migration scheme, the Spanish and Senegalese governments hoped to offer them a job in Europe as well as finding cheap labour for agricultural enterprises. Due to harsh working conditions and low wages which were misaligned to their profiles and expectations, some Senegalese women preferred to abandon the fields for other Spanish cities where they joined other Senegalese working in domestic service. Without regular residence permits, some of these women found themselves in precarious situations reducing their statutory and contractual rights. They encountered abuses such as overtime being rarely paid, extremely variable working hours, and sometimes even verbal, physical, and psychological violence. Domestic workers with legal status also face difficulties such as the downgrading of skills, isolation, and not being allowed to change employers or become pregnant for a certain number of years. From the findings presented here, we can draw conclusions and policy implications for both temporary (agricultural) work schemes and for the situation of female migrant domestic workers in Spain, all of which revolve around labour market issues, questions of regulation, and unforeseen outcomes in terms of social (in)justice. In documenting the process of transition from one sector to another, we have also seen that while choices are limited as a result of the restrictive migration regimes and economic adverse conditions, agency remains important (Van Nieuwenhuyze 2009: 195). The findings on the temporary agricultural work scheme show that policies which fail to understand the temporary migrant workersâ lives â that many are well educated, that they are not merely pairs of harvesting hands, that they have networks in Spain, that allocation of places in temporary migration schemes will in Senegal inevitably be partly on the basis of patronage â can never obtain their objectives. As for the findings on migrant domestic workers presented here, they illustrate very clearly the special characteristics found in the domestic work sector, namely âthe intimate character of the social sphere where the work is performed; the social construction of this work as a female gendered area; the special relationship between employer and employee which is highly emotional, personalized and characterized by mutual dependencyâ (Lutz 2008: 1, cited in Dobner/ Tappert 2010: 8; see also GutiÃ©rrez-RodrÃ­guez 2010)."

Today, Georgia sees energy generation through hydropower as a key political target, and related development is taking place rapidly (Vogel and Schmutz 2015). As a number of Georgiaâs riversâe.g., the Kura Riverâare shared with neighboring countries, the aforementioned data gaps are particularly problematic. Existing data gaps, the lack of monitoring, and environmental baselines regarding water status hinder the comprehensive assessments of possible impacts from hydropower at both the national and transboundary levels. In addition, the development of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) that are aligned to internationally recognized best practices also becomes a challenge. Data gaps and incomplete assessments result in hydropower development that is more based on assumptions than data and analysis. This increases possible risks of negative impacts on water resources and socioeconomics and of ineffective measures. Accumulation of negative impacts at transboundary scales that cause disputes with basin-sharing countries has so far not been sufï¬ciently taken into account. Considering these challenges, Georgia is currently undertaking steps to close data gaps and to assess hydropower impacts more comprehensively (Vogel and Schmutz 2016). These activities aim to increase knowledge and minimize risks that might otherwise be irreversible. Another data gap example occurs currently in the Congo River Basin, where only nine functioning monitoring stations still exist. In this context, data gaps, ostensibly due to a lack of willingness and interest of riparian states, may ultimately result from lacking technical and ï¬nancial capacity. Incoherent datasets pose another challenge. Cooperating countries in transboundary basins often use different methodologies and independent monitoring approaches to collect and assess data (e.g., regarding water status, aquatic ecosystem health, socioeconomics). This usually leads to un-harmonized, incoherent assessment results that cannot be compared between the countries in a basin. This can cause misunderstandings between different countries concerning the interpretation of resultsâfor instance, in interpreting potential transboundary impacts of projects in one country on another riparian country. As a consequence, this often affects cooperation between basin states as a whole. A comparative study by the European Commission on coordination mechanisms in international river basins in Europe beyond EU territory (2012) showed that out of 75 European transboundary river basins, joint monitoring is fully or partially in place in 51 basins and joint databases are operated in 30 basins (European Commission 2012). In the remaining basins, monitoring and databases are either not jointly coordinated or not in place at all. In other parts of the world, data and information sharing also differs considerably across basins. While in some basinsâfor instance, in basins shared by Canada and the USAâdata information sharing (e.g., through joint monitoring) is well advanced, many basins in the developing world do not have such mechanisms in place. To tackle these challenges, many RBOs aim for and implement jointly agreed monitoring programs. Some also conduct joint river surveys, constituting a particularly advanced way of joint monitoring. For example, the Danube countries agreed,"
253,1142,0.985,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","30.3.8 On the Relationship Between Risk Constellation and Introduction Scenario The risk constellations described here are based on qualitative and exploratory considerations from the current world of mobility. They therefore have a certain plausibility, but also contain speculative aspects. They should not be understood as predictions, but as guideposts that should be observed along the way to the research, development and introduction of autonomous driving. Indeed, they cannot be predictive because any future occurrence of particular risk constellations depends on the introduction scenario for autonomous driving and its speciï¬c characteristics, and both of these elements are unknown today. For example, the contours of the âprivacyâ risk constellation will depend heavily on whether an on-board autonomous driving scenario is implemented or autonomous vehicles continuously need to be connected to the internet and control centers. The public perception of the risk will depend largely on how autonomous driving is introduced. If it happens as part of a gradual automation of driving, the potential to learn gradually from the experiences gained along the way will greatly lessen the risk of a âscandalizationâ of autonomous driving as a high-risk technology for passengers and bystanders. Steps on the way to further automation such as Trafï¬c Jam Assist, Automated Valet Parking or Automated Highway Cruising (Chap. 2), the introduction of which seems likely in the coming years (Chap. 10), would presumably not lead to an increased perception of risk because they would seem a natural development along the incremental path of technological advancement. Unlike switching on a nuclear reactor, for example, the process of increasing driver assistance towards greater automation has so far progressed gradually. The automatic transmission has been around for some decades, we are comfortable with ABS, ESP and parking assistants, and further steps towards a greater degree of driver assistance are in the works. Incremental introduction allows for a maximum degree of learning and would also enable gradual adaptation of the labor market, for example, or privacy concerns (see above). In more revolutionary introduction scenarios (Chap. 10) other and likely more vexing challenges would present themselves for the prospective analysis and perception of risks. The public perception would then react especially sensitively to accidents or critical situations, the risk of âscandalizationâ would be greater and the âinvestmentâ risk constellation (see above) could develop into a real problem for individual suppliers or brands."

The shielding factor (SF) needs to be considered, since the evaluation above is the ideal case where the ground is smoothly spread over the infinite disk. For ordinary ground cases, Ref.

Hence, reductions in bat populations as a result of hunting could have expensive ramifications on local communitiesâ water supplies, agriculture, and eco-tourism industries. Finally, the hunting of bats may also expose human communities to potentially zoonotic pathogens (Leroy et al. 2005). In the past decade, considerable attention has been paid to bats as natural reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases (Calisher et al. 2006). Studies that link infectious disease outbreaks to bats demonstrate the spillover potential through contact with bats or exposure to faeces and urine in bat habitats (reviewed by Plowright et al. 2015). Most notable are the Ebola virus outbreaks, which have attracted international attention. Leroy et al. (2009) suggest that the 2007 emergence of Ebola virus in the Occidental Kasai province of DRC could be attributable to the consumption of freshly killed bats. The authors trace the virus spread from a first patient with bat bushmeat contact to an outbreak of the disease in 260 persons resulting in 186 deaths in 2007. The re-emergence of the disease in 2014 may also have arisen from contact with bats (SaÃ©z et al. 2015) and has proven far more deadly."

Although central nervous system measures (i.e. electrocarâ diogram) has high reliability in measurement of driverâs MWL [13], the applicability of these measures is limited due to the expensive instruments so it was not suitable to the conditions of this experiment. Therefore, the central nervous system measures were not used in this study. Eye activity is a technique that captures eye behavior in response to a visual stimulus, and this technique has become a widely used method to analyze human behavior [27]. Eye response components that have been used as MWL measures include pupil dilation, blink rate, blink duration and ï¬xations. Human pupil dilation may be used as a measure of the psychological load because it is related to the amount of cognitive control, attenâ tion, and cognitive processing required for a given task [28]. It also has been previously shown to correlate with the cognitive workload, whereby increased frequency of dilation is associated with increased degree of diï¬culty of a task [29]. In the driving study, pupil dilation was able to reï¬ect the load required by tasks [30], and it would measure the average arousal underlying the cognitive tasks [31]. The blink of the eye, the rapid closing, and reopening of the eyelid is believed to be an indicator of both fatigue and workload. It is well known that eye blink rate is a good indicator of fatigue. Blink rate has been investigated in a series of driver and workload studies with mixed results attributable to the distinction between mental and visual workload [31]. They suggested that blink rate is aï¬ected by both MWL and visual demand, which act in opposition to each other, the former leading to blink rate increase, the latter to blink rate decrease. Besides blink rate, blink duration has been shown to be aï¬ected by visual task demand. Blink duration has been shown to decrease with increases in MWL. The studies mentioned in Kramerâs review all found shorter blink durations for increasing task demands (both mental and visual) [32]. Some studies show that blink duration is a sensitive and reliable indicator of driver visual workload [8, 33]. Eye ï¬xation duration is also extensively used measures and is believed to increase with increasing mental task demands [34]. Recently, ï¬xation duration and the number of ï¬xations have also been investigated in a series of studies about driver hazard perception and they found that increased ï¬xation durations during hazardous moments, indicating increased MWL [20].

Numerous studies show that HR reï¬ects the interaction of low MWL and fatigue during driving [35, 36]. In addition to basic HR, there has also been growing interest in various measures of HRV. Spectral analysis of HRV enables investigators to decompose HRV into components associated with diï¬erent biological mechanisms, such as the sympathetic/ parasympathetic ratio or the low frequency power/high frequency power (LF/HF) ratio, the mean inter-beat (RR), the standard deviation of normal RR intervals (SDNN), etc. The SDNN reï¬ects the level of sympathetic activity about parasympathetic activity and has been found to increase with an increase in the level of MWL [13, 25]."

The main prey species of the lynx is the snowshoe hare and the negative feedback at lag 2 may reï¬ect the timescale of this predatorâprey interaction. The hares are known to cause medium-term induced reductions in the quality of their food plants as a result of heavy browsing pressure when the hares are at high density, and this could map through to lynx populations with lag 4.

As Fig. A2.2 indicates, there is very little discrepancy among those aware of the BACC report as to the question of whether the report tended to underestimate or overestimate the possible magnitude of future climatic change. If anything, the scientists tended towards the claim that a number of climate change phenomena are slightly underestimated in the report. Only for surface air temperature and coastal erosion were there claims of slight overestimation. Overall, it could be concluded that there is considerable agreement among the survey participants that the BACC report reflects the claims of the broader scientiï¬c community."
118,177,0.985,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"4.3.2.2 Natural Dispersion The second mechanism, natural dispersion, refers to the fact that cesium isotopes can move through the natural environment as a result of rainfall, wind, and the flow of water in surface and subsurface regions. To understand this mechanism, we need to know about the behavior of cesium in the environment, ranging from microscopic levels (such as the interaction of cesium with soil particles and microorganisms) to macroscopic levels (such as transport of cesium by groundwater, rivers, and off-shore ocean currents). The behavior of cesium in the environment is highly site-specific, heterogeneous at different scales, and evolves over time. Despite such complexity, the IAEA recommends a provisional value of 0.05 yearâ1 [3] for the rate constant of this process. This value asserts that the radioactivity observed at a location of interest will be halved every 15 years, if only natural dispersion mechanisms are in play. Recent measurements have revealed that natural dispersion mechanisms in Fukushima could be faster than the rate of 0.05 yearâ1 IAEA recommends. Figure 4.6 indicates that the dose rates at various locations measured in December 2011 were about 70 % of those measured in June 2011. In other words, during this 6-month period, radioactivity decreased by about 30 % through spontaneous radioactive decay and natural dispersion. Note that no artificial decontamination activities were done during that period. With this data, the rate of natural dispersion is calculated to be 0.534 yearâ1, which is about 10 times greater than the IAEA-recommended value. We consider two cases in the following analysis: fast (0.534 yearâ1) and slow (0.05 yearâ1) natural dispersion."
215,115,0.985,institutional Reform For innovation and Entrepreneurship : An Agenda For Europe,"knowledge and innovations. One such measure consists of the number of patents per capita (column 5). Indeed, we can see a strong cross-country correlation between R&D spending and the rate of patenting.26 Increased R&D spending can thus be associated with an increased production of economically valuable knowledge, as measured by the rate of patenting. However, this does not imply that a policy of increased government R&D spending will automatically result in more economically valuable knowledge. First, patents are not the only way of measuring new economic knowledge; when Da Rin et al. (2006) examined 14 European countries in a panel between 1988 and 2001, they did not ï¬nd any positive relationship between public R&D spending and the rate of innovation, which they deï¬ned as the share of high-tech and early-stage venture capital investments. Furthermore, as shown in the last column of Table 3.7, the share of R&D in the business sector that is directly or indirectly funded by the government is lowest in countries with the highest R&D spending by business enterprises (see Appendix Table A.2 for a more detailed overview). In line with our previous discussion, this suggests that higher spending on R&D does not automatically produce more innovations or more entrepreneurial activity. Instead, if a well-functioning entrepreneurial ecosystem is not already in place, the full potential from increased R&D cannot be reaped. Therefore, quantitative R&D goals risk becoming a waste of resources, as focus and resources are directed towards factors that would have found a better use elsewhere in the economy. Instead, in an economic system encouraging productive entrepreneurship, a great deal of R&D is undertaken because the results from R&D are demanded. Here, entrepreneurs and demanding customers in the ecologyâs skill structure serve as particularly crucial sources of information regarding consumer needs and preferences (von Hippel et al. 2011). Policymakers cannot hope to offset deï¬ciencies in other policy areas by directly favoring R&D. In line with the argument in Sect. 2.2, the main role of the government should be to enable and facilitate rather than to subsidize certain industries or ï¬rms. Most importantly, governments should adhere to the late Steven Klepperâs (2016) persuasive ï¬ndings that strong and highly dynamic industry clusters could emerge anywhere and gain momentum through entrepreneurial spinoffs from the leading ï¬rms. The implication is clear: it should be easy to start a business, and incentives for individuals to behave entrepreneurially and grow the new businesses should be strong. However, it is still important to avoid spoiling the strong tradition in many European countries of harboring innovations, even of a radical kind, inside large ï¬rms through intrapreneurship (Stam and Stenkula 2017). Research also reveals that geographic proximity facilitates knowledge spillover and knowledge transfer, suggesting a potential role for the government in promoting networks, clusters and urbanization.

Though an accident traditionally implied no human agency, changing understandings of the accident blurred the boundaries between accident and intentional act. âAccidentsâ coalesced to form a body of cases that were explained in the press as events neatly attributable to an inefï¬cient and immoral asylum system. The broken rib scandal occurred at a time when âaccidents went public,â both in terms of the arena in which they occurred and in terms of rising public concern for safety.33 Both Roger Cooter and Jamie Bronstein have emphasised the penchant of the Victorian press for the large-scale accident such as the mining disaster.34 Generally âit was the somewhat atypical âsingle event catastropheâ that captured newspaper attention,â or shock epidemic diseases like cholera.35 However, in the case of factories and workshops, individual cases could also be crucial in raising public awareness of the need for preventative measures such as safety railings or breathing respirators. Stories of individual asylum deaths like Rees Priceâs carried within them a distinct thread of humanitarian concern and tapped into contemporary fears about the medical profession. The broken rib scandal was reminiscent, for example, of fears surrounding âchloroform deathsâ (patients dying whilst under sedation) in the 1840s and 1850s.36 Whilst it was not until 1885 that the BMJ felt it appropriate to comment on factory accidentsâ and even then in a manner which suggested such things were private mattersâit published a lengthy list of stories from the 1870s that dealt with the âasylum problem.â37 Yet ofï¬cial statistics suggested that broken ribs in asylums were not as common as many supposed: the Blue Book of 1896 recorded 7182 deaths in English and Welsh asylums that year, 11 of which were a result of fractures or dislocations.38 Some speculated that incidences of fracture were less common in asylums due to extra precautionary measures, whilst others cited increased inspection as the reason for deaths coming to public attention.39 The recording of accidental injury was indeed increasing at this time and just as we may read slightly sensationalist accounts of broken ribs as evidence of a widespread phenomenon, we may also read the reports as representative of a few isolated casesâas Edward Baines observed of the cotton industry in the 1830s, where singular cases of injury led to condemnation of the industry as a whole.40 Leonard Smith has noted that the âmythology of crueltyâ emphasised by lunacy reformers"

Therefore, numerical simulations were used to characterize concentrations of CPY in water and sediment for three representative high exposure environments in the U.S. The fate of CPY in the environment is dependent on a number of dissipation and degradation processes. In terms of surface waters, fate in soils is a major driver of the potential for runoff into surface waters and results from a number of dissipation studies in the laboratory were characterized. Aerobic degradation of CPY exhibits bi-phasic behavior in some soils; initial rates of degradation are greater than overall rates by factors of up to threefold. Along with fate in water, these data were considered in selecting parameters for the modeling concentrations in surface waters. An assessment of vulnerability to runoff was conducted to characterize the potential for CPY to be transported beyond a treated field in runoff water and eroded sediment across the conterminous U.S. A sensitivity analysis was performed on use practices of CPY to determine conditions that resulted in the highest potential runoff of CPY to aquatic systems to narrow the application practices and geographical areas of the country for selecting watersheds for detailed modeling. The selected focus-watersheds were Dry Creek in Georgia (production of pecans), Cedar Creek in Michigan (cherries), and Orestimba Creek in California (intensive agricultural uses). These watersheds provided realistic but reasonable worst-case predictions of concentrations of CPY in water and sediment. Estimated concentrations of CPY in water for the three watersheds were in general agreement with ambient monitoring data from 2002 to 2010 in the datasets from US Geological Survey (USGS), California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR), and Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE). Maximum daily concentrations predicted for the watershed in California, Georgia, and Michigan were 3.2, 0.041, and 0.073 Î¼g Lâ1, respectively, with the 28-d aerobic soil metabolism half-life and 4.5, 0.042, and 0.122 Î¼g Lâ1, respectively, with the 96-d soil halflife. These estimated values compared favorably with maximum concentrations measured in surface water, which ranged from 0.33 to 3.96 Î¼g Lâ1. For sediments, the maximum daily concentrations predicted for the watersheds in California, Georgia, and Michigan were 11.2, 0.077, and 0.058 Î¼g kgâ1, respectively, with the 28-d half-life and 22.8, 0.080, and 0.087 Î¼g kgâ1, respectively, with the 96-d soil half-life. CYP was detected in 12 samples (10%) out of 123 sample analyses that existed in the USGS, CDPR, and WDOE databases. The concentrations reported in these detections were from <2.0, up to 19 Î¼g kgâ1, with the exception of one value reported at 58.6 Î¼g kgâ1. Again, the modeled values compared favorably with these measured values. Duration and recovery intervals between toxicity threshold concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 Î¼g Lâ1 were also computed. Based on modeling with the half-life of 28 d, no exceedance events were identified in the focus watersheds in Georgia or Michigan. Using the half-life of 96 d, only three events of 1-d duration only were identified in the Michigan focus-watershed. Frequency of exceedance was greater in the California focus watershed, though the median duration was only 1-d."

From the policymakersâ perspective the production of such knowledge is not necessarily a purely academic affair.

Solitary Cnidaria (sea fans, sea pens, anemones) are salient sessile members of the megafauna. Sea fans occur on small tar pillows on the Shenzi (oil and gas) field but not on soft mud nearby (Williamson et al. 2008). MacDonald et al. (2004) observed them associated with asphalt volcanism in the Campeche Knolls in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Trawl surveys in the northern margin of the deep Gulf of Mexico have noted that large anemones occur most frequently associated with submarine canyons and are especially common in the De Soto Canyon (Ammons and Daly 2008). It should be noted that these sessile organisms are all filter feeders that depend on a rain of detritus for nutrition, thus limiting their distributions to locations where a nutritional POC source is available. For food, they may also depend on horizontal or depth-contour controlled bottom currents to supply them with organic particulate material. As illustrated in Figure 7.68, the echinoderms are an important component of the deep megafauna. Within this diverse phylum, the holothuroids (sea cucumbers) appear to be the most widely distributed in the deep Gulf of Mexico, with a prominent MDM. However, they are difficult to sample. This is suspected because of trawling and multishot seafloor photography in the same locations of the seafloor. For example, photographs of a species of Peniagone sp. illustrated that it maintained a density of about 160,000 individuals per hectare (10,000 m2 or 107,640 ft2). The mean length of this species in these photographs was about 2.75 cm, or just over an inch. But individuals of this species were never captured in the trawls at the same location and time. Many holothuroids are more or less neutrally buoyant and thus it was thought that these individuals were not captured because they were pushed or swept away by the trawlâs bow wave. Many species of holothuroid are known to be able to swim or drift slowly over the deep seafloor. This information is contained in the Northern Gulf of Mexico Continental Slope Study Annual Report, Year 3, Vol II, Technical Report (Gallaway et al. 1988). This preliminary report is a font of knowledge that is not found in the final report (Pequegnat 1983) or a lone published summary of the work (Pequegnat et al. 1990). According to Ziegler (2002), the invertebrate megafauna densities of the continental slope and abyssal plain of the Gulf of Mexico are one to two orders of magnitude less than equivalent depths in other studies at higher latitudes (Rowe and Menzies 1969; Ohta 1983; Lampitt et al. 1986; Mayer and Piepenburg 1996). This supports the suggestion that in general the Gulf of Mexico is oligotrophic (Smith and Hinga 1983), based on low densities and biomass of macrobenthos (see above section on macrofauna), but this generalization ignores the numerous slope assemblages supported by fossil hydrocarbons or the fauna in the Mississippi and De Soto canyons. While this generalization may apply to the open continental slope and the abyssal plain, it may not apply to exceptional habitats such as seeps and canyons where food supplies are enhanced."
165,386,0.985,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"The residential outcomes that give rise to segregation index scores can be assessed in terms of whether they are relevant for investigating different theories of segregation dynamics. In the final analysis, theories of segregation must reckon with the micro-level dynamics that produce the residential patterns that aggregate indices summarize. It is easy to see how the residential outcome registered by S â namely, area racial mix (p) â is relevant for theories of residential attainment dynamics. For example, Lieberson advanced the hypothesis that segregation arises in part when Whites strive to maintain high levels of same-group contact and avoid more than incidental levels of contact with minorities (Lieberson 1980, 1981: 75; Lieberson and Carter 1982). Combining this hypothesis with the assumption that Whites have greater ability to influence residential dynamics leads to straightforward predictions regarding how S will vary when city racial composition varies over time or across cities. For example, the hypothesis that discrimination by Whites serves to keep White contact with Whites from falling below fairly high levels (say 85 % or higher) leads to the prediction that S will vary as a positive, nonlinear function of proportion Black in the city.1 The implications for D, G, R, and H are much more complicated and indirect. I not aware of any theories that suggest Whites may specifically strive to attain or avoid particular levels on the residential outcomes that determine the values of these indices. Figure 5.1 introduced earlier shows D, G, R, and H score values of p differently across cities depending on the racial mix of the city. For present discussion, consider D when formulated as a difference of means when neighborhoods are In a city where proportion Black is very low â say 1â5 %, S can be low since Blacks can experience high levels of contact with Whites without causing problems for Whiteâs desires to have limited contact with Blacks and high contact with Whites. This changes when proportion Black increases. In order to maintain White contact with Whites (PWW) at 0.90 or higher as proportion Black in the city increases, Black contact with Whites (PBW) must fall. This will cause S to increase since, in the two-group case, S = PWW - PBW . The relationship will be nonlinear. Initially, S will increase rapidly as proportion Black in the city (Q) increases; then the rate of increase will decline."

349,352,0.985,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"of the studies they are taken from is however biased toward measurement campaigns conducted in Europe and North America. Other emission factors are estimated based on very limited data (e.g., single values for carbon stocks in agroforestry systems) or expert opinion (e.g., emission factor for methane emission from enteric fermentation is based on modeled results, not measurements, for Africa) (IPCC 2006). Global default emission factors are published in the National Guidelines for Inventories while other regionally relevant emission factors are available in the IPCC Emissions Factor database, peer-reviewed literature and in the future will be made available through the SAMPLES web platform. Empirical models are typically thought to generate reasonable approximations of GHG fluxes at higher levels of organizations and large spatial extent (Del Grosso et al. 2008), presuming the activity data are well constrained. This is because it is thought that at large scales such as across countries, the departure of actual fluxes from average emissions factor values will average out with aggregation of multiple land units. However, for any local scaleâfarms for example, where local environmental and management heterogeneity of conditions are not well represented in the global datasets, applying empirical models and emissions factors may represent a significant departure from actual fluxes. The relevance of using empirical models for farm-scale estimates of GHG balances is untested and perhaps spurious, especially for farming systems in developing countries. IPCC guidelines using Tier 1 default factors were not designed for this purpose. Tier 1 approaches were intended to be used when the source activity was relatively inconsequential to total GHG budgets, perhaps contributing less than 5 % of the total (IPCC 2006). Furthermore, significant variations in GHG flux rates occur between point locations due to edaphic mechanisms that control biological emission processes. Because observations of GHG fluxes for tropical smallholder farming systems are scarce or nearly missing in available databases, Tier 1 default factors may considerably misrepresent flux rates for such systems. In view of the low use of N fertilizers in sub-Saharan Africa it is therefore not surprising that many of the N2O fluxes currently being measured there are 1/3 to 1/2 of those estimated using the Tier 1 IPCC emission factors (Hickman et al. 2014; Shcherbak et al. 2014). A comprehensive evaluation of Tier 1 emission factors relating to GHG impacts measured in tropical regions is currently lacking. Despite these concerns and the uncertainty of the results, disaggregation of whole farms into component activities and applying available empirical models remains a way to estimate relative impacts of smallholder farming activities at the whole-farm level (Seebauer 2014), as well as understand emission hotspots and the research gaps. Emissions from livestock production in the tropics, namely from enteric fermentation and manure management, present their own challenges due to data scarcity (Goopy et al. 2016). Similarly to soil fluxes, emissions from both sources are poorly constrained and according to the review by Owen and Silver (2015) data for dairy manure management are limited in Africa and extremely scarce for other systems (Predotova et al. 2010). Yet in many countries, these sources are thought to be substantial contributors to total GHG budgets (Gerber et al. 2013)."

193,134,0.985,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"Hungary between 2006 and 2008. The same study also showed that circulation to Hungary is typical for Serbians, Romanians and Ukrainians and is observed primarily in border regions. It is arguable whether three movements already amount to circular migration. The other question is whether official registries enable circular movements to be captured adequately. The authors admit that their study covered only officially defined migrations which lasted for 1 year or longer. Consequently, all shorter trips to Hungary were ignored. It should be stressed that even if registries include shorter migrations (but usually not longer than 3 months), the problem of neglecting some part of circular mobility not captured in official registries usually remains. Other elaborations on the character of circular migration can be found in works on Ukrainian migration to Poland that discuss not only cross-border traders but also economic short-term migrants. OkÃ³lski (1997, 2001) proposed the concept of âincomplete migrationâ to describe this circular flow of migrants. OkÃ³lski draws on Chapman and Protheroâs (1983â1984) definition of a âterritorial division of responsibilities, activities and goodsâ, with people linked to a pendulum, having no clear intention of a long-term change of dwelling (OkÃ³lski 2001: 56). He classified as âincomplete migrantsâ those spending most of the year in the country of migration, and for whom the income earned abroad constituted an important part of the overall household income in the country of origin. Incomplete migration is characterized by circulation and work in the secondary labour market. According to the results of one of the earliest studies on Ukrainian migrants, an ethno-survey carried out in three localities in Ukraine between 1993 and 1996, the average length of Ukrainian migrantsâ stay in Poland was between 2 and 3 weeks (OkÃ³lski 2001). The study identified three major strategies characterizing incomplete migrants from Ukraine to Poland: migration as a physical survival strategy (for households with income below subsistence level and those where none of the members worked); migration as a transformation-period survival strategy (attempting to preserve the previously acceptable living standards and diversifying the sources of household income); and migration as an entrepreneurial strategy, with the goal of creating or developing oneâs own business (ibid.). The concept was used not only to analyze Ukrainian migration to Poland, but also Polish migration to Western European countries (JaÅºwiÅska and OkÃ³lski 1996, 2001) in the 1990s. However, its usage is limited in later migration studies, because the incomplete migration approach is embedded in the context of the post-communist economy and has not been further developed to accommodate the transition towards a market economy in CEE countries. As in the above overview of Ukrainian incomplete migrantsâ strategies, the role of a householdâs place of residence in conceptualizing migration was also stressed in the typology of mobility proposed by GÃ³rny et al. (2010b) for immigration to Poland. The study was based on 160 qualitative interviews (including 75 interviews with Ukrainian migrants) conducted in different studies in 2005â08 by the Centre of Migration Research, University of Warsaw. The typology was based on two dimensions: (1) whether a migrant lives in Poland (operationalized by the presence of other household members and the duration of stay); and (2) the number of countries in which a migrant lives. The proposed categories include âimmigrantâ (living"

While in terms of amounts of financial resources deployed by them, aside from China whose assistance figures are ambiguous, may not appear very large, the question to be addressed is whether these new actors have brought a different approach to issues of peacebuilding, more especially with reference to projects being demand-driven and owned by recipient societies. China, and to a lesser extent India, is accused of tailoring its assistance to take advantages of natural resources available in African countries. This criticism is further buttressed by the conviction that such flows from âemerging donors might increase the recipientsâ debt levels, ignore environmental and social impacts, and focus on extracting resources â¦ resulting in an erosion of the progress that has been made in the traditional aid community in these areasâ (Dornsife 2013).

These flows and dimensions include the crucial feedback loops of grasping and framing a natural phenomenon wherein knowledge and belief, correct or not, are born and take life. Although providing the crucial substrate to social potential, molecular or genetic components cannot predict the formations and flow of society. SNA is inter-disciplinary, then, in the sense that it allows us to draw in the concepts and ideas about the natural and human worlds at all levels, and study how they work within the social and cultural arenas of collective human action. Social scientists have taken note of the role that networks and networking play in social and political change, from improving safety conditions in nuclear power plants to negotiating new legislation on the supra-national level within the European Union. SNA has been used to analyze the discursive dimensions around political processes as well as coalition formation among organizations around environmental activism. The effectiveness of political or social movements is often determined by the nature of linkages between actors within a social network. Social network analysis can be used to examine political mobilization and the formation of advocacy coalitions as well as the spread of scientific knowledge and the dissemination of social or behavioral norms. By representing scientific knowledge as an information network along with other types of networks, a network approach can integrate the perspectives of different sciences (consilience) to study their conjoint and interactive effect upon the process of climate change production and solution. And nowhere is the interaction between human society and the environment on a greater scale than in how our behaviors affect that greatest of global commons: the Earthâs atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earthâs atmosphere from human industry have begun to change the planetâs climate regime. And with the change in climate, have come changes to earth systems that humanity is dependent on. Sea levels are rising, threatening coastal communities; ice sheets have begun to melt, threatening fresh water supply; crops in some areas have begun to fail, threatening food supply. While human beings are adaptable, our capacity to do so will likely be overwhelmed as the scale of these impacts increase (IPCC 2007a). In order to reduce the emission of GHGs that spur climate change, norms of collective responsibility will need to be disseminated on a global scale (Broadbent 2010). But how will this happen? Indeed, can it happen? When ozone depletion was operationalized as a problem within the 1980s, the driving force (production of chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs) was linked to a few specific activities (use of aerosol cans, use of specific refrigerants, use of certain packing materials) within a few economic sectors. The industries were able to substitute less harmful chemicals at low cost, and consumers did not have to radically change their behavior. Operationalizing climate change as a scientific certainty, let alone a problem, has been such a contentious debate because of the irreducible complexity of the issue. Greenhouse gases, which drive climate change, are not just produced by a few components of a few choice industries. Rather, they are omnipresent in virtually all economic activity and embedded within the production and maintenance of much of the globeâs infrastructure. They are diverse in their"

165,413,0.985,New Methods for Measuring and Analyzing Segregation,"This raises the concern that our understanding of segregation patterns is based on a particular subset of cases and comparisons chosen for practical, not theoretical and substantive, reasons. Equally importantly, it raises the related concern that researchers cannot undertake studies of segregation in many situations that have potentially important value for understanding segregation dynamics. For example, it is of obvious scientific interest to study the trajectory of segregation over time for new immigrant populations. But this currently is not possible because prevailing restrictions on study designs preclude the possibility of assessing segregation in the early stages of this process when the group is small in both absolute and relative size. In some areas of inquiry the impact of concerns about index bias on the scope of segregation studies is pervasive and near-total. One example of this is the near total disappearance from the literature of studies that assess segregation at smaller spatial scales. Analysis of segregation based on block-level data once was common (Taeuber 1964; Taeuber and Taeuber 1965; Sorenson et al. 1975; Schnore and Evenson 1966; Farley and Taeuber 1968, 1974; Roof and Van Valey 1972; Van Valey and Roof 1976). Nowadays it is rare. This change in the literature is not based on theoretical or substantive concerns. To the contrary, assessing segregation at small spatial scales has obvious substantive value because it can potentially detect segregation that might otherwise be missed. Accordingly, block-level analysis is better suited for studying the emergence of segregation patterns for newly arriving migrant or immigrant populations because patterns of segregation during their initial settlement would not be evident if segregation is measured using larger units such as census tracts.7 Similarly, block data are relevant for nonmetropolitan areas and non-core counties where census tracts are too large to sustain meaningful segregation analysis. But contemporary empirical studies rarely investigate segregation using block data. It is not because segregation in these settings just mentioned is substantively unimportant or scientifically uninteresting. Instead, it is because segregation study designs have âretreatedâ to supposedly safer ground to avoid the complications of index bias that arise when measuring segregation based on small areas. The unfortunate byproduct of this is that it has inhibited the investigation of segregation in smaller cities and communities. Another closely related example is that empirical segregation studies systematically avoid examining segregation in metropolitan areas where one of the populations in the analysis is a relatively small proportion of the population or is small in absolute population size. For example, Farley and Freyâs (1994) influential study of trends in segregation from Whites for Blacks, Latinos, and Asians restricted its analysis to metropolitan areas where the minority group in the comparison either reached 20,000 in overall population or represented 3 % or more of the city population. As a result, out of 318 total metropolitan areas, their analysis included only 232 areas for"

This increase in temperature is about double that observed in the northern hemisphere over this period. The modelling studies discussed in Sect. 24.4 show that it is still difï¬cult to determine to what extent the observed warming in Scandinavia is caused by global climate change and to what extent it is caused by the strong regional decline in aerosol concentrations. However, the Baltic Sea area is on one of the major outflow paths of air pollutants from the European landmass, and so it is feasible that a substantial fraction of the observed warming is due to the strong decline in sulphur emissions over the last 20 years. Black carbon emissions have also decreased over this period although substantially less than for sulphur. Some of the warming might have been offset by the decreasing black carbon. Precipitation in Sweden seems to have increased between 1990 and 2005, but it is not statistically signiï¬cant compared to 1960â1990 (see climate records at www.smhi.se). Current climate models have considerable uncertainties in describing precipitation and its dependence on aerosols, which complicates discussions on the influence of air quality on precipitation. A better understanding of aerosolâcloud interactions is needed for climate models to better simulate observations, not only for precipitation but also for aerosols, gases, clouds and other parameters affecting precipitation (see Chap. 10)."
391,599,0.985,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"Obtaining meaningful air-sea gas transfer estimates for CO2, CH4 and N2O in coastal systems is a substantial challenge and the ranges in Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7 have large inherent uncertainties. These uncertainties reflect the heterogeneity and biogeochemical complexity of coastal systems and include: (i) gross scaling errors arising from the degree to which study sites are representative globally of each âcompartmentâ; (ii) bias in the CO2, N2O and CH4 values reflecting incomplete spatial and temporal data resolution; (iii) uncertainties in gas exchange rates arising from selected gas transfer relations and representative wind speeds (Chap. 2) (Upstill-Goddard 2006; Wanninkhof et al. 2009). Minimising gross scaling errors largely relies on the availability of accurate area determinations. General problems of defining the extent of oceanic upwellings are well documented (Nevison et al. 2004; Naqvi et al. 2005), as are the difficulties of defining representative estuarine areas (Barnes and Upstill-Goddard 2011). Minimising measurement bias has a clear seasonal aspect; production and consumption of CO2, N2O and CH4 are biologically driven and as such have strong temperature dependence. Seasonality also affects the intensity of upwelling and river runoff, which affects nutrient and carbon supply. Unfortunately, most sampling campaigns take place during summer. There is also a regional aspect; most coastal regions outside the northern hemisphere are either undersampled or are not sampled at all. Given the likelihood that coastal regions will play an important role in future trace gas budgets due to increased economic and population pressures, additional studies of CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes from key coastal regions will be required. Sampling campaigns should be spatially and temporally focused and ideally coordinated internationally. In particular CH4 emissions by ebullition and from seeps and inland waters need more to be more accurately quantified."
344,179,0.985,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"(IFPRI) in recent years used this as one of the key benchmarks against which the policy was evaluated (see Diao et al. 2012)âimproved food and nutrition security is arguably equally important as a development goal. Because agriculture implies food production and because agricultural growth benefits the poor disproportionately in developing countries, there exists a perception among policymakers that the links between agricultural growth and nutrition are inevitably strong. In fact, growth in general is believed to be good for reducing malnutrition in as far as it raises household incomes, thus allowing households to access better or more nutritious food. However, some countries have seen nutrition deteriorate despite growth.1 In India, for example, rapid income growth has not translated into nutritional improvements, with stunting and wasting remaining widespread and per capita caloric availability declining (Deaton 2010). This is puzzling and hard to explain, confirming, as Timmer (2000) argued a decade before, that the mechanisms through which growth impacts on nutrition are not yet well understood analytically or quantified empirically. The obvious conclusion is that improved nutrition is not a necessary consequence of growth-induced increases in incomes or reductions in poverty. This reflects the fact that the concept of âfood and nutrition securityâ has several dimensions: âavailabilityâ of sufficient quantities of domestically produced or imported food; âaccessâ to sufficient resources to acquire a nutritious diet; and âutilizationâ of food through adequate diet, water, sanitation and health care (Heidhues et al. 2004). In order to understand how growth impacts on nutrition it is necessary to consider how growth affects all of its dimensions. This paper compares and summarizes findings from two recent papers, by Pauw and Thurlow (2011) and Ecker et al. (2012) in which at least two of the dimensions of food and nutrition security were modeled (i.e., availability and access). Both studies used a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model complemented with microsimulation nutrition models, and specifically consider how alternative economic growth paths ultimately impact on nutrition. The paper is structured as follows. It first compares the methods used in the respective studies and next summarizes the key results. The chapter ends by drawing general policy conclusions and outlining the way forward for these types of analyses."

Finally, there is the question of the presumption of individual units of labour in the wage economy. Anthropological research has long drawn attention to the circulation of family units or male/female pairs for wage labour in some industries/activities that are virtually completely reliant on migrants. For example, millions of migrant workers are recruited in pairs (jodis) or family units by contractors for brickmaking across the country and for harvesting sugar cane across large areas in western and southern India.15 Where direct piece rates are paid for the output of collective units of labour, whether of pairs, families, or ad hoc gangs, conceptual difficulties regarding the basis for the calculation of individual wages are inevitable, although disputes often remain hidden by social conventions. The point is that individual units of labour are not always clearly measured or as universal as is assumed by the employment and migration data and indeed even by the laws related to labour. In sum, Indian government data and much associated work on migration in India reflect a permanent settlement paradigm, a monocausal approach to migration that tends to a rigid distinction between economic and social reasons for migration, a lack of focus on circular modes of labour migration, and a flattened-out conception/definition of work/employment that is purely based on the individual labour unit. Such a perspective makes the macro-data conceal many important features and trends in relation to labour, gender, and migration that operate in reality in India. At the same time, many questions that the macrodata raises have not received due attention. We may begin by flagging the most striking feature of the data on enhanced female migration: the phenomenal increase in marriage migration rates in rural India. According to the NSS figures, the proportions of women migrating for marriage increased from 25 per cent of the rural female population in 1993 to 38 per cent in 1999â2000 and then to 44 per cent in 2007â08. Increased rates of rural marriage migration is confirmed by census data for the 1990s, foregrounding an immediate question as to what processes have led to a substantial rise in migration for marriage in rural areas.16"
219,734,0.985,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Estimates of Cost Our estimates using the TEV approach presented in the methodology section are given in Table 15.8. The total annual costs of land degradation by land use and cover change in 2009 as compared to 2001 in India are estimated to be about 5.35 billion USD. The biggest share of these costs are occurring in Kerala, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh, whereas the lowest land degradation by land use change are in Haryana, Punjab and Goa (Fig. 15.3). These land degradation costs estimates are only due to land use and cover change, and do not yet account for costs of land degradation when land use did not change, i.e. when cropland stayed as cropland between 2001 and 2009, but crop yields were negatively affected by land degradation. As for the per capita costs of land degradation, the highest per capita costs are observed in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh and the lowest per capita costs again in Haryana and Punjab. The reason for such low ï¬gures for Haryana and Punjab is that there has been very little land use change in these two States. However, these estimates exclude the costs of land degradation other than land use change, which are expected to be more prevalent in these states. The share of LD in the regional GDP shows that the share is signiï¬cant in the Northern and North-eastern regions of India (Fig. 15.4). The estimates in Table 15.9 conï¬rm that the cost of inaction exceeds cost of action in every state. The ratio of action over inaction is in the range 20â40 % in humid regions in general and above 40 % in sub humid and arid regions. Further cost of action for crop and grassland are more or less similar to cost of taking action against deforestation. However when it comes to inaction there are wide variations between the two. Cost of inaction against deforestation, is consistently higher in all the states. Cost of inaction in crop and grass lands is the highest in Madhya Pradesh which is a relatively backward region and the smallest in Punjab & Haryana province. In this region, the land use change is much less and the land degradations mainly occur in the form of loss of productivity due to salinity. This region exposes"

Complexity has been defined by Kennedy et al. as: âThe interaction of many parts of a system, giving rise to behaviours and/or properties that are not found in the individual elements of the systemâ [4]. Or as Wolfram put it: âIt is possible to make things of great complexity out of things that are very simple. There is no conservation of simplicityâ [5]. Self organisation is defined by Camazine et al. as â... a process in which pattern at the global level of a system emerges solely from numerous interactions among the lower-level components of the systemâ [6]. Features of self organising systems that are essential to emergent behaviour are the existence of: positive feedbackâthat leads to amplification of fluctuations; negative feedbackâto counterbalance amplification and provide stabilisation; multi stabilityâthe coexistence of many stable states; and the existence of state transitionsâleading to dramatic change of the system behaviour, i.e. âbifurcationsâ in behaviour occur when some parameter/s are varied. Goldstein [3] identifies five essential features of emergence: â¢ Radical noveltyânovel behaviour occurs that cannot be predicted. â¢ Coherence or correlationâthe novel behaviour has some level of coherence over time. â¢ Global or macro-level behaviourâcoherence occurs at the macro level. â¢ Dynamicalâthe macro-level, while having some coherence in time, also evolves over time. â¢ Ostensiveâemergent behaviours are recognised ostensively, i.e. by showing themselves. While Goldstein identifies that emergence is inherently unpredictable, Fromm [7] proposes that there are four types of emergence, only two of which are unpredictable. The four types of emergence proposed by Fromm are shown in Table 6.1. Using Frommâs classification scheme, there is a clear gradation in the complexity of systems that display emergent behaviour, from the least complex in Type I, to the most complex in Type IV. The following Sections will examine the implications of emergent behaviour in swarm intelligence systems, specifically in relation to their potential use in autonomous systems. As identified in Table 6.1, based on Frommâs classification scheme, swarm intelligence systems fall into Type II âWeak and predictableâ emergence.

255,100,0.985,Railway Ecology,"Physical barrier constraints mainly affect species of small size with reduced mobility, such as herptiles. For instance, Kornilev et al. (2006) reported that eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina) in the USA enter a railway at crossings with roads (where surfaces are at the same level), but then become trapped between the rails as they are unable to climb over them, and ï¬nally die due to thermal stress. A study of Hermannâs tortoises (Testudo hermanni) in Romania found that the impossibility of overtaking obstacles (e.g., ditches with angles of over 60Â°) led to an increase in the distribution of railway-kills at the end of the ditches (Iosif 2012). Bumblebees (Bombus impatiens and B. afï¬nis) in the USA (Bhattacharya et al. 2003) provide an example of a species to which the railway is a behavioral barrier. These species are reluctant to cross railways (and roads) because of their high ï¬delity to their foraging site. In experiments, individuals of these species could come back to their patches of origin after being translocated, or could leave their patch when their food was removed, but these movements were rarely in-control (non-translocated) individuals (Bhattacharya et al. 2003). Bhattacharya et al. (2003) observed that foraging bees turned back when they reached the edge of a patch (i.e., bisected by a railway); thus, rather than physically impassable barriers to bumblebees, railways acted as barriers because they are likely to be strong landmarks. On the other hand, most of the translocated gatekeeper butterflies (Pyronia tithonus) crossed the French High Speed Rail (hereinafter âHSRâ) to return to their capture plot, as this species shows a strong homing behavior (Vandevelde et al. 2012; see also Chap. 16). Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) are able to cross fenced railways in Mongolia (Ito et al. 2008), but they usually do not do so (Ito et al. 2005, 2013, and see Chap. 14). Therefore, these fenced railways represented a barrier effect affecting population dynamics as it caused disruptions in long-distance gazelle migrations (Ito et al. 2005, 2008, 2013). Stopping migration routes prevents gazelles from reaching their traditional food-rich winter quarters, potentially increasing their winter mortality due to starvation (Ito et al. 2005, 2008, 2013). This conservation problem is compounded by the current climate change, as drought events reducing vegetation productivity could require gazelles to migrate longer distances, instead of the current average of 600 km (Olson et al. 2009). To date, railways do not seem to have been a barrier for gazelle gene flow, although this assertion should be explored with more suitable markers (Okada et al. 2012; see below). Although it has been less studied, the conservation threat of the critically endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) in Kazakhstanâas a consequence of migration disruption due to fenced railwaysâseems to be similar to that of Mongolian gazelles (Olson 2013; see also Olson and van der Ree 2015). In a study carried out in Sweden, Kammonen (2015) found that a motorway and a railway running in parallel acted as barriers for two bat species (whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus and Brandtâs bat M. brandtii) in a forest-dominated area. Although this author did not differentiate between these two infrastructures, she found that bats did not directly cross them; rather they used either the green bridge or the underpass both to cross it and to forage (Kammonen 2015)."
302,477,0.985,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Another analysis of GHG emissions compared the current strategy in Los Angeles of landfilling the vast majority of waste to a combination of three strategies in a modern MRF, namely, (a) anaerobic digestion of wet waste, (b) thermal gasification of dry waste, and (c) landfilling residuals [87]. Their analysis did not consider economic, environmental, or social parameters, only GHG emissions, and was based on an assumption of 1,000 ton of waste per day entering each scenario for 25 years; then they modeled the GHG emissions for the century that followed. In each scenario, the GHG emissions from transportation, operation, and avoided emissions by replacing fossil fuels were factored in. Results showed that continued landfilling resulted in a net increase of approximately 1.64 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E), while the MRF scenario results in a net avoided GHG emissions of (0.67) million MTCO2E, showing that a shift to a MRF where multiple waste management strategies are employed resulted in a total GHG reduction of approximately 2.31 million MTCO2E. Those residuals that exist after diversion of waste to recycling and anaerobic digestion could be landfilled, and in some cases waste-to-energy could have a role. This would be appropriate only after diversion efforts of recyclables and compostables have been maximized. Also, building incinerator infrastructure could create tremendous debt or include a demand for large volumes of waste, also called a âwaste quotaâ that could undermine local efforts to eliminate products and packaging that generate microplastics. Simultaneously, a market for recycled materials must be encouraged, while all environmental and worker health concerns are prioritized. Waste-to-energy could have a role, but long after all other efforts to manage waste have been employed. Section Summary In the linear economy contrasted with the circular economy, we see two world views on how to solve the plastic pollution problem. While the linear economic system benefits production by eliminating competition from recycled material, it is more polluting than the circular system because of multiple points of leakage along the supply chain. Plastic pollution is lost at production as pellet spills, lost by the consumer as litter with no inherent value, and lost at collection and disposal as waste is transported. In the circular system these are mitigated when systems to focus on material control and capture are implemented. Zero waste is the ideal of the circular economy, where the need for destruction through energy capture, or landfill, are increasingly unnecessary."
232,214,0.985,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"Keeping in mind the variety of continued damages and issues described above, we should start to consider problems of social structure behind the 3.11 from the viewpoints of âinformationâ and âmedia.â Huge amounts of information and discourses concerning the 3.11 have persisted, and in our opinion, this is one of the most signiï¬cant features of the 3.11. We surmise that many readers can imagine the effect of the Internet and social network sites (SNSs) in the 3.11 contexts. Actually, the spread of information via the Internet enables us to create and use large amounts of information. This situation has been reinforced by SNSs such as Twitter, Facebook, and so on. These convenient informational tools set the base of information for volunteers in a disaster. However, we should take a point of view that there is an information gap according to social stratum, income, age, etc. Looking at the status of Japanese Internet usage just before the 3.11, the reports published by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) in 2011, we can extract three important aspects: â¢ Generally speaking, the coefï¬cient of use of Internet for elderly people is lower than for younger people (e.g., 60â64 age, 70.1%; 65â69 age, 57.0%; 70â79, 39.2%; over 80, 20.3%). â¢ Families with low annual incomes have a low coefï¬cient of use of Internet (e.g., under 2 million, 63.1%; 2 million to 4 million, 68.6%; over 6 million, over 80%). â¢ Use of Internet depends on the geographical area. The Tohoku region has a low score compared to other metropolitan areas. When we think of 3.11, we should take such conditions of the Japanese information society into account, in addition to destruction of information infrastructure. Generally, the damaged areas from 3.11 are aging and low income communities. Moreover, in the 1970s, Japanese society attempted to be a society where âall of the citizens are middleclass.â As a result, many upper-middleclass people appeared. However, looking at the media usage, the relationship between social class and usage and thoughts regarding media has been discussed and investigated since the 2000s. Several gaps according to social stratum have been recognized, such as the term âdigital divide.â For example, lower social capital cultures use mobile phones"
183,305,0.985,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"16.3.4 Response Capability (Education and Preparedness) It is important that potentially affected people adequately understand the goals and procedures of the EWS and share a common interest in these efforts. It is therefore crucial to inform and train the public and the involved authorities, both technically and socially. Each actor needed a different training, according to their responsibilities and capabilities. A process of institutionalization has been carried out for local authorities (Municipality of Carhuaz, Civil Defense) in order to increase the efficiency (clear and transparent rules and simplified procedures for the implementation of risk management). It is also worth mentioning the work with the population with whom information and awareness workshops have been carried out about the real state of the danger they face. Carey et al. (2012) noted that when the population does not participate in the processes of risk management, they see the results as an imposition, causing them to resist management actions even though these will help them to save their lives. To embody and apply learned lessons, test alarms and evacuation simulations are very effective means to train both authorities involved in the EWS and civilians (Frey et al. 2014). Such simulations can be used not only to expose the population to an evacuation under near-realistic conditions but also to test the action plan and the decision process of the responsible authorities. Civil response to the EWS is a key aspect when assessing its effectiveness and has been tested several times since its implementation, and emergency simulations are scheduled every year for the entire country.

20,103,0.985,"Communicating, Networking: Interacting: The International Year of Global Understanding - IYGU","The Sharing Economy The rise of the âsharing economyâ is one of the clearest comparisons between developed and developing nations, with respect to the effect of communication technology on everyday practice. The sharing economy has the potential to disrupt the way we traditionally exchange goods and services and function as markets. This technology is underpinned by the recent growth of application-based programs on mobile communication devices that have decreased the transaction costs of exchange. Speciï¬c examples of such applications, and how they have changed the business landscape of selected industries, have already been researched and discussed in the business studies literature; such as the accommodation service AirBnB (Zervas et al. 2015) and the ride-sharing system Uber (Anderson 2014); while more generally, (Belk 2014) reinforces how such innovations force us to re-think the old adage âyou are what you ownâ. The dynamic pricing model for companies such as Uber provides incentives for those with capital assets (cars) to respond to increases in demand. In the developed world, such technology plays a signiï¬cant part in collaborative consumption, essentially between strangers, thus stimulating the volume of everyday practices that typically people would otherwise often undertake in partnership with existing friends, colleagues, associates or family members (ie. within their own network of individuals). Rising incomes in the past few generations have occurred contemporaneously with losses of networks and a sense of communityâ consistent with other social indicators, such as declining birth rates (Ahn and Mira 2002), smaller household sizes (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2010) and an increasing incidence in mental illness (World Health Organization 2015). Under such trends, these applications have served the potential to ï¬ll the void of community breakdown in expanding non-technology collaborative consumption outcomes, which is arguably forecasted to become increasingly necessitated by dwindling global levels of natural resources relative to population. By stark contrast, in the developing world, with far less (both) human and physical capital, but greater social capital, end users and service providers are typically already connected and have an intimate sense of each otherâs preferences; while the role of trust is clearly critical. Thus, the traditional levels of collaborative consumption have not reduced signiï¬cantly during the modern era in the ï¬rst instance. In this environment, the uptake and impact of these applications is expected to be somewhat more limited, at least in the short-term."
118,783,0.985,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"24.2.2 Era of Human Error As advanced technologies have been introduced, the complexity of systems exceeded the capacity limits of human operators or users, and many accidents occurred due to human error. The Three Mile Island, Unit 2 (TMI-2) accident that occurred in 1979 was a typical case in this era. The accident started with a minor malfunction in the secondary loop, but subsequent unfavorable events made the situation worse, finally leading to severe damage of the reactor core. Some of the critical events that caused the accident include operatorsâ human errors. The operators, for example, misjudged that the reactor vessel was full of coolant water, and they tripped manually the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) which had been initiated automatically. The point where humans interact with human-made equipment is called a human-machine interface. Analysis of the TMI-2 accident revealed that there were improper human-machine interfaces behind the operatorsâ errors. At the beginning, for example, more than 100 alarms were initiated at the same time, and the operators were unable to comprehend what had actually happened in the plant. In addition, the indication of the relief valve position did not reflect the actual valve position. This defect in interface design caused a delay in operatorsâ correctly recognizing the internal state of the reactor vessel. Individual human factors and prevention of human errors became key issues in this stage [1], and efforts were made to design working conditions and humanmachine interfaces appropriate for physical and cognitive human characteristics. Suppression of unimportant alarms based on prioritization of alarms is an example of functions that have been adopted in nuclear power plants after the TMI-2 accident. Since consideration of human factors is nowadays the standard requirement in designing socio-technical systems, the probability that human error may cause a serious accident has been greatly reduced."
232,51,0.985,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"3 Loss, Damage and Victims The term âlossâ is used to designate the consequences of degradation. In some areas, these consequences can be anticipated, while in others they cannot. For example, in an armed conflict the intentional bombing of a military building can lead to its destruction. While this may have been the intention of those who undertook the action, it can also destroy buildings or injure people who were not the target. This is referred to as âcollateral damageâ.5 In this case âdamageâ is most meaningful when injury has been caused to a person or group, their property, or an environment (if there is an interest in claiming compensation). Losses can be immediate or longer term. When it concerns a person, group, non-human living species, or an environment the term âvictimâ must take on a broader meaning. Not only can it be used to designate people, but also living or non-living entities that have representatives who are able to speak on their behalf. For example, the quality of a coastline is said to be degraded following an oil spill and the media do not hesitate to describe the shoreline as a âvictimâ. Bees are another example. This living species is the victim of agricultural chemicals, or, as described in a French newspaper, the âvictim of the lack of biodiversityâ.6 Finally, before work-related accident legislation was implemented, there were no ofï¬cial victims of occupational accidents or illnesses. They could not be acknowledged until dangerous working conditions or hazardous machinery was recognised. Similarly, an analysis of breakdowns due to human factors can be seen as the clumsy (or even malicious) use of machines by operators. In general terms, there are no non-human victims. Instead, they are represented by individuals or groups who speak on their behalf and defend their interests before an authority that is responsible for estimating the loss they have suffered."
347,216,0.985,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"improved hydrographical measurements and navigation charts, not only in domestic waters but also in collaboration with neighbouring countries, have been successfully undertaken (Hassler 2011). The global features of marine oil transportation are not what is important, but rather the fact that the country carrying the costs is also the prime beneficiary of the undertaken project. Whether to make this investment or not thus becomes an issue of domestic cost-benefit analysis which does not need to turn into a tragedy of the commons. Basically, it then becomes a question for the authorities in that country to decide how to finance this investment. Second, different countries will benefit disproportionally from most kinds of pollution control. Countries with extended coastlines close to major marine traffic lanes, for example, are typically more vulnerable to oil spills. It could be expected that these countries would be more proactive vis-Ã -vis stricter regulations, everything else being equal. Not only would these countries be expected to undertake measures having primarily local effects as described above, but proactive positions in relation to international regulation would also be anticipated. Considering that lobbying for stricter international regulation is typically not costly in relation to what could be gained in case of successful interventions, there is no reason to expect barriers for collective action in these cases, given that domestic interests are sufficiently strong. This is most likely one important reason why Sweden and Finland have been strong proponents of stricter international regulations with regard to environmental hazards in the Baltic Sea, not only when it comes to marine oil transportation but to most other threats to the integrity of Baltic Sea ecosystems as well. In a similar manner, but conversely, countries with large stakes in marine oil transportation could be more hesitant to accept costly measures to reduce risks of oil spills. This would, according to the logic of collective action rationality, especially apply to stricter international regulations since these might threaten economic interests. On the other hand, local improvement in, for example, port facilities or hydrographical charts could be more appealing for countries in geographically vulnerable situations. Third, and finally, not only interests matter, but capability as well. Countries with more resources, know-how and experience could be expected to be more proactive in relation to risk prevention as well as the build-up of impact reduction and cleaning up capability compared with countries that have less resources and experience with these issues. This aspect has considerable relevance in the Baltic Sea region as there is a marked difference in resource availability and administrative experience between the former Soviet Union states on the one hand and the Nordic states and Germany on the other. This has had significant implications not only for national environmental management, transposition of EU regulations and implementation of international agreements but also in a wider, regional sense. It has been shown, especially during the first decade of independence in the 1990s, that the Nordic states influenced the Baltic States by giving targeted support to strengthen their administrative capability and assisting them in their preparation for becoming EU members (Hassler 2003a). It is clear in summary that perceiving environmental governance of marine transportation as globalised and therefore uniformly prone to collective action problems"

In other words, growth is possible but leads to a diminishing marginal utility of labour. When this limit is reached, we find the âtypicalâ picture of agrarian societies, in which the majority of the population, including children, incessantly performs demanding physical work while still suffering from shortages of essential resources. This logic, which Ester Boserup has studied on a worldwide basis and of which she provides a detailed description, represents a fundamental limitation of societal development in agrarian regimes: as a rule, growth in this regime eventually leads, despite progress made regarding methods of husbandry and plant cultivation, to the stagnating or even diminishing availability of per capita material and energy resources. Furthermore, the absence of the possibility to transform heat energy into mechanical work limits the degrees of freedom. Mechanical work can only be performed through the physical work of humans, animals and water/wind energy; thus, the productivity that was thereby attainable remained relatively low.5 Altogether, the size and structure of societal metabolism and its spatial differentiation were subject to limitation through the controlled solar energy system. In Europe, before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, 2â4 t of raw material and 30â70 gigajoules (GJ)6 of primary energy were appropriated per capita and year, whereby biomass accounted for over 80 % of all material and 95 % of all energy inputs: food for human populations, livestock feed and wood for construction and fuel. Regional differences in metabolism were related in particular to the varying relevance of holding livestock and climatic conditions.7 Starting in seventeenth century England, increased use of coal led to the development of a new energy system. At the core of this energy transition was a transition from the use of energy flows with low power density in the form of biomass that is regrown annually to the exploitation of large-scale energy deposits that had accumulated over geological eras and existed in a concentrated form as coal, with a high power density (Smil 2003). Initially, coal was used solely as an often quite unpopular fuel for stoves in the households of manufacturing workers in urban centres, whose increasing requirements could not be supplied by fuelwood alone. Fortunately, coal supplies in England were found close to these centres, and coal could also be transported at low cost via waterways.8"

When measures were agreed though, the regulatory strength of the EU was much greater than in the 1960s, even though the complex science-policy interface in EU legislation, placing a very strong burden of proof for measures, led to significant policy delays.13 When it comes to the policy approach, the PBDE group has been regulated mainly on the basis of the chemicals and polluter-oriented policy, not based on an environmental approach, and even less so on a precautionary approach. The latter is particularly true for decaBDE, where action was stalled during lengthy and politicised decision-making and legal processes (Eriksson et al. 2010a, 2010b). The environment-oriented approaches in the case of MSFD, for example, have so far not led to significant phase-out measures in themselves, and there are obvious implementation problems. In the case of WFD, in its third implementation report, the European Commission was unable to even establish a baseline for the chemical status of surface waters due to data gaps and insufficient monitoring (more than 40 % of surface water bodies in the EU were reported as having âunknown chemical statusâ) making it very difficult to estimate the EU-wide or Baltic Sea situation (European Commission 2012). Similarly, while BSAP is based on EAM (in theory linking hazardous substances, negatively, to biodiversity objectives on the one hand and to eutrophication on the other, where goal achievement may lead to higher concentrations of pollutants in biota), the practical responses to these insights still have to be implemented broadly. Nevertheless, BSAP sets out to link the work of HELCOM-identified substances to the national implementation plans under WFD, thereby helping policy efficiency in practice. More generally, the implementation of BSAP may help to broaden the implementation of WFD in EU Member States, and conversely, some environment-oriented EU policies may then be implemented in the HELCOM context. As for PCBs, there is thus a positive interplay between EU and HELCOM policies, when it comes to BFRs."

This ecosystem restoration project has involved numerous local, state and federal agencies. The project impacts a large population and agricultural industry that want secure and reliable water supplies and flood protection. Its current estimated cost over some three decades is about $8 billon. Hence it involves politics. But its goal is primarily focused on restoring a unique ecosystem that is increasingly degraded due to extensive alterations in its hydrology over the past half-century. The motto of the Everglades restoration project in south Florida is âto get the water right.â Those who manage the regionâs water are attempting to restore the ecosystem by restoring the hydrologic regime, i.e., the flows, depths, hydroperiods, and water qualities, throughout this region to what they think existed some 60 years ago. The trick is to accomplish this and still meet water supply, flood protection, and land development needs of those who live in the region. Clearly achieving a hydrologic condition that existed before people began populating that region in signiï¬cant numbers will not be possible. Hence the question: what if water managers are not able to âget the water right?â What if they can only get the water right on 90 % of the area, or what if they can only get 90 % of the water right on all the area? In either case what will be its likely impact on the ecosystem? Are there opportunities for changing hydrology to improve ecology? Where? To address questions such as these in the Everglades, at least in a preliminary way prior to when more detailed ecological models will become available, this ï¬ve-step approach outlined above is being applied. It is being used to extend their simulated hydrological predictions to produce relative values of ecological habitat suitability indicators for selected indicator species, as illustrated in Fig. 9.8, and topographic characteristics. This ï¬ve-step procedure does not ï¬nd an âoptimalâ water management policy. It can however contribute useful information to the political debate that must take place in the search of that"
157,40,0.985,"The Economy as a Complex Spatial System : Macro, Meso and Micro Perspectives","expenditure on manufacturing production: the âproductivity effectâ â a larger provision of public services in one region, by lowering the labour input requirement, attracts ï¬rms to that region; and the âdemand effectâ â the tax rise necessary to ï¬nance such provision, by contracting private expenditure for manufactures, induces a non-favorable change in the relative market size, driving away ï¬rms from that region. The relevant policy conclusion is that a central government whose aim is to reduce regional inequalities, can choose a suitable ï¬nancing scheme for public expenditure that could weaken the demand effect inducing ï¬rms to relocate in the backward region. The demand effect will be negligible if also taxpayers residing in the advanced region contribute on the basis of their income to the ï¬nancing. Finally, it is also possible that the provision of public goods in the South could, even in the presence of the âcrowding-outâ effect, increase the local level of private capital or could improve welfare in that region. These results are in general conï¬rmed in the much simpler FC setting without investment sector considered by Commendatore et al. (2009), where it is shown that the provision of a productivity-enhancing local public good may redistribute the industrial activity, counterbalancing differences in market sizes between regions. Furthermore, it is also conï¬rmed that the process of agglomeration in the larger region following market integration could be slowed down or even overturned by increasing sufï¬ciently the provision of productive public expenditure. Commendatore et al. (2010) relax the assumption of pure local effects of productive public expenditure within a FC framework. Focusing on the case of R&D public expenditure, the authors explore how knowledge creation and diffusion across regions impinges upon the processes of spatial agglomeration and dispersion. The productivity-enhancing effect of public expenditure takes place by lowering ï¬xed costs in the manufacturing sector, so that the number of ï¬rms may vary even if the number of capital units is given. Hence, public policy can impact on the endogenous number of ï¬rms as well. Two possible scenarios are studied. In the ï¬rst scenario, knowledge spillovers â in the form of new ideas generated in public universities and research institutions â are (perfectly) global beneï¬tting all ï¬rms independently of their location. In this scenario, public policy is able to affect the number of ï¬rms as a lower number of these units is required for each variety of the manufactured good: an increase in public expenditure unambiguously increase the total number of varieties. On the other hand, public policy is unable to affect the regional distribution of capital units. However, if the productivity effect is weak, the demand effect can reduce the dimension of the industrial sector in the region that ï¬nances public expenditure. In the second scenario, knowledge spillovers are (partially/perfectly) local. The impact of knowledge on productivity gains is spatially limited depending on its local speciï¬city and on the absorbing capacity of ï¬rms, so that knowledge generated by R&D activities beneï¬ts ï¬rms, which are located in the region where public expenditures occurs. In this scenario, as in Commendatore et al. (2008 and 2009), both productivity and demand effects play a role in determining the equilibrium regional shares of capital as well as the number of varieties produced in each region. Moreover, it is shown that the relationship between the overall number of ï¬rms and public expenditure could be non-monotonic. These results hold in the dispersed equilibrium, when the at least some industry is located in both regions. In an agglomerated equilibrium, when industrial sector is concentrated only in one region, the total number of ï¬rms always increases"
248,92,0.985,"Eating, Drinking : Surviving","Beyond Surviving to Living with Dignity As Sanjay Wijesekera, head of UNICEFâs global water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programmes stated, âAlthough it is the poor who overwhelmingly do not have toilets, everyone suffers from the contaminating effects of open defecation, so everyone should have a sense of urgency about addressing this problem (UNICEF).â Eliminating open defecation could signiï¬cantly diminish the spread of diarrheal diseases (and others) that can lead to death, malnutrition, and stunting. Handwashing can halt the spread of diarrheal disease through the fecal-oral route, but discussions of handwashing necessarily come back to provision of clean water that can be used for this purpose. If communities are responsible for environmental health, then both quantitative and qualitative research can shed light on community norms of sanitation behavior (Mehrotra and Patnaik 2008). This begins with an understanding that vast differences exist across populations, across states, and across regions. It is clear from the WHO/JMP (2015) MDG report that the rich begin with greater access to WASH services and are those who enjoy the greatest improvements in services. By contrast, the poorest of the poor are the least likely to have services and remain the most underserved. All regions with the least access to sanitation exhibit large inequalities between the richest and the poorest 20 %, and these broad categories can be additionally parsed into rural/urban dwellers and the kind of services they receive (WHO/JMP 2015). The reasons for why the worldâs poorest are the poorest can be explained by geographic factors, political-economy, and social marginality. Cross-cutting inequalities like widowhood and caste, geographical remoteness and indigeneity, homelessness and language barriers make social marginality difï¬cult to untangle. They suggest that provision of WASH services to marginal communities requires a concerted, long-term effort. However, the effort goes beyond outreach to these poor communities. Efforts inside communities to address social inequalities are also required. For example, Community Led Total Sanitation approaches that galvanize rural communities into latrine building for all and community monitoring of open defecators have had great success in Bangladesh, where CLTS was developed (Kar and Chambers 2008). But strategies for behavior change like CLTS that include shaming of open defecators can add to stress already felt by the poor and those on the margins (Hirve et al. 2015). Whatâs more, in rural areas, both the poor and the wealthy may be contributing to contaminated landscapes through open defecation, even those who have individual household latrines. Wijesekeraâs clarionâs cry that âeveryone should have a strong sense of urgencyâ sounds reasonable, but such statements are not wholly benign. Middle class urban residents malign the poor for contaminating their cities, without acknowledging how social and political inequalities generate the disparities of class often found contained within the cities of developing countries. Not only do the urban poor struggle to meet their livelihood needs, they struggle to meet their hygiene and sanitation needs without an infrastructure that supports either (Joshi et al. 2011). Lack of access to sanitation may be especially difï¬cult when social norms require greater levels of privacy for womenâs defecation than for men. Without access to a"

Institutional Fragilities were revealed along the process, ranging from the lack of personnel, high turnover or experience of partnersâ staffs, and the lack of planningbased management (which includes the lack of integration and knowledge of monitoring and other data). The perception of these institutional fragilities as challenging is well documented in the notes of the third technical workshop (Salvador, INEMA (BA), November 19â20), and more specifically in the discussions about the monitoring network gaps and bottle necks that were identified through an institutional and IT analyses performed to support the DM process."

In a way, GCM uncertainty could be likened to emission uncertainty in the sense that a particular RCM projection is conditional to the choice of the emission scenario and the boundary conditions. The latter comprise large-scale inflow and outflow (winds, temperature, humidity) into and from the regional domain, from the driving GCM. RCMs can also be provided with boundary conditions from global reanalyses (e.g. Dee et al. 2011), which is often the case in model evaluation studies as comparison with actual observations is more straightforward than in the case of runs with boundary conditions from GCMs. A key motivation of RCMs is that they facilitate simulations at higher resolution. Today, RCMs are starting to provide climate simulations at resolutions of 1â10 km, compared to around 25 km some 5â10 years ago, and 50 km or more some 10â15 years ago."

Once the panel members have participated during a few consecutive waves, their nonresponse is not because of a missing contact but rather because of other reasons like health problems, refusal or family-related difficulties. At the same time we can also suppose that it became easier to trace individuals due to the internet. Another explanation for the lower dropout rates due to missing contact information is that the interviewers put more effort in finding panel members after the change of the follow-up rules in 2006 and 2008 mentioned in Sect. 3. Figure 2 also suggests that refusal conversion and the use of unconditional incentives, two other measures enhanced in 2006 to counter attrition, had a positive impact on the participation rate, as the failure rate due to this cause becomes less important after 2006. The cumulative incidence plot (Fig. 3) illustrates the dropout rates according to the different events. As in Fig. 2, we can see that refusal at individual or household level was the most cited reason for nonresponse, followed by non contact. It is also visible that both curves become flatter as time of analysis increases, which is partly due to a general lower dropout rate, but also due to competing risks that become more important such as health or age problems."
251,133,0.985,inter-Group Relations and Migrant integration in European Cities : Changing Neighbourhoods,"In investigating places in the context of inter-group relations in the three neighbourhoods in Nuremberg we found two main functions of space: space can connect people and lead to interactions, but it can also be the object of disputes and conflicts. The same space can have both functions at the same time, but in different contexts. For the prevention of conflicts, frameworks of rules that are jointly agreed upon are essential. The two functions of space as well as the high relevance of the rules for the use of space were found with regard to housing and the use of public places: housing as such, depending on how it is arranged, carries the potential of bringing people together and fostering interaction, but it can also be the object of conflicts, as analyzed in the case study of Werderau. We find that the rules on the use of space, as a result of social productions and perceptions, are more relevant for the actual use of public spaces than the existence and availability of these spaces as such. The extent to which the connecting potential of public spaces can be taken advantage of depends much on the rules of their usage. Clear and joint agreements on these rules as well as their communication to all people concerned are necessary to prevent potential conflicts. The case studies of Werderau and Langwasser illustrate that conflicts over space can turn into ethnically framed conflicts. The overlapping of length of stay and ethnic belonging as well as external interference, e.g., by right-wing groups and biased media reportage, are identified as enabling factors of this ethnic framing and as enforcing factors for boundary-making. Mediation activities are often an effective tool to ease ongoing conflicts."
114,150,0.985,Safer Healthcare : Strategies For The Real World,"Innovation Safety problems are sometimes resolved because of the introduction of a completely new way of investigating or treating an illness or a new way of providing and organising care. Innovation in healthcare can take many forms, ranging from drug therapies, surgical procedures, devices, and tests, through to new forms of health professional training, patient education, management, financing and service delivery models. These innovations generally aim to provide better or more efficient care for patients, but safety may also be improved as a virtuous side effect of the action Healthcare is remarkable in the breadth and pace of innovation which both improves safety and, as we have argued earlier, also changes the boundaries of what is acceptable and so creates new safety problems. The pace of innovation is such that medical knowledge dates extremely rapidly. In 2007, the median time before medical knowledge needed significant updating was only 5 years; 23 % of systematic reviews needed updating within 2 years and 15 % within 1 year (Shojania et al. 2007). According to both the United Kingdom National Institute of Clinical Excellence and the American Heart Association most recommendations and treatment guidelines need substantial adjustment every 5 years (Alderson et al. 2014; Neuman et al. 2014).

But the perspective remains the abstracted generalized gaze typical of an economist. Women migrants receive very little specific mention. Only two-thirds of the way through the book â and two-thirds of the way through a fifty-page chapter on the impacts of migration focusing overwhelmingly on measured economic impacts â do women migrants at last specifically appear, in one brief mention that they are the most absolutely and relatively disadvantaged participants in labour markets compared to the native workers (p. 194). The treatment of the social costs of outmigration more broadly remains remarkably brief and superficial (e.g. p. 193). In these respects the book is typical of many treatments of migration, which underrate the various aspects of societal reproduction, including the biological, familial, emotional, psychological, and cultural. The present book has in contrast explored the lifeworlds of migrants, especially migrant women, the impacts on migrantsâ security and insecurity of the systems of nation-state membership and exclusion and of global market power, and how migrants seek to cope and respond. This concluding chapter reviews and reflects on themes arising from these studies, from a workshop on the draft volume held in Trivandrum in February 2013, and from wider literatures.4 It does not attempt a summary, which has already been offered in chapter 1. Instead it essays an interpretation and commentary with reference to key issues, of which some are specific to women migrants and others common to all migration or all international migration. Part of our analysis will locate migrant womenâs problems within the context of market-dominated development transformations and nation-state systems (sections 21.2â21.6); and part will highlight the specific and additional difficulties that millions of migrant women face, and the shifts of cognition and representation that are needed to acknowledge and respond to these, as well as sister shifts needed to respond to the structural forces that affect all migrants (sections 21.7â 21.9). Since the opening chapter has theorized gender dimensions in some depth, this closing chapter pays considerable attention to the latter forces too. It seeks to identify causal structures and also their social construction, and thus to indicate some spaces for reform efforts."

AER IIa is the most diversified region in terms of livestock as expected with an average of 1.75 types of livestock per household, followed by AER I and AER III. Households in all AERs have on average at least two income sources. AER IIa has the highest count index of income diversification, followed by AER III. The income diversification is the only dimension that switches the rankings going from count index to Gini-Simpson index, as AER I has the highest Gini-Simpson index for income diversification, indicating that the income shares are more equally distributed in this region contributing more to diversity (measured by proportional abundance) even though it is the third most diverse by the count index. The observed diversification patterns are the results of both push and pull factors, and the AER classification provides only a broad insight into the climatic push factors into diversification. For example, given the projections of higher temperatures and even lower rainfall in AER II, if the push factors dominate we might expect increased income diversification with lower welfare in this region. AER IIa, however, also includes the urban centers of Lusaka and Eastern provinces, which provide opportunities for pull factors that might be associated with higher diversification at higher welfare levels. Similarly, AER III is projected to have increased rainfall on soils that are already highly leached, but it also includes Copperbelt province with significant mining activity providing potential pull factors. Understanding which factors dominate in driving diversification and what types of welfare outcomes might be expected requires analyses at higher resolution that control for all potential factors as we do below. We first look at district level climatic variables and diversification outcomes before moving to household level analysis. Figure 2 shows the distribution of long term average of seasonal rainfall and its coefficient of variation (CoV), and Fig. 3 shows the diversification indices by district. Whereas the long run average rainfall in our data conforms to the classification of AER, there is more heterogeneity across districts within AERs in terms of CoV of rainfall indicating climate risk management strategies need to be based on site-specific analyses. It is interesting to note that households seem to diversify their crops more in areas with higher long term average seasonal rainfall, and similarly livestock diversification seems higher in areas where the long term variation in rainfall is higher. Income diversification on the other hand shows no clear pattern correlated with the weather variables plotted in Fig. 3. The heterogeneity within AERs in climatic variables (especially for the variation in rainfall over time) and diversification, provides further evidence that agricultural development planning at the AER level may not be able to capture all factors at play in shaping livelihood decisions. The unconditional averages plotted in these figures provide suggestive evidence only, as it remains to be seen whether and how weather shock variables drive diversification outcomes controlling for other variables that affect livelihood decisions and risk attitudes."

Uncertainty is perhaps the dominant focus. Uncertainty is present in many forms. As we have discussed, uncertainty can be related directly to initial observations (initial condition uncertainty), to the physical climate model (structural uncertainty), and to future emissions (scenario uncertainty). There is also uncertainty from observations used in evaluation (usually a part of structural or model uncertainty). There is another class of uncertainty about the impacts of the resulting climate projections on the anthroposphere. Impacts of climate change on human systems include impacts on agriculture, built infrastructure, and ecosystems. These impacts are often highly dependent on the local facts and details, including policy and management practices that are in place. There is uncertainty associated with the response of people. The response is often discussed in terms of changes to technology and future energy systems to reduce emissions. This is called mitigation.

For example, obtaining yearling animals during favorable times and having somewhere to send these animals as forage conditions deteriorate can present challenges for land managers under a flexible strategy. For more remote areas distant from markets, a flexible strategy can present challenges due to logistical difficulties and costs of transporting animals. Transporting livestock from a property with a forage deficit to another property with a forage surplus (agistment), where the livestock owner leases the land for grazing the livestock, is an important management option in Australia (McAllister et al. 2006). Benefits to the livestock owner can include (1) an avoided forced sale of livestock with depressed prices, (2) a more rapid vegetation recovery following the end of drought by reducing degradation due to drought, and (3) maintaining a core breeding herd. A risk is prolonged drought and the leased property also running out of forage, potentially forcing the eventual sale of the livestock. Agistment is less common outside of Australia, although in the USA there was a substantial movement of cattle from Texas and California to the Northern Great Plains during recent droughts. Nomadism and transhumance are practiced in some African and Asian rangelands as a means of buffering the effects of climate variability, but this mobility is rapidly being lost (Chap. 17, this volume). Provision of supplementary feed as a drought management strategy is problematic in many rangelands because of the conflict between drought policies and economics of purchasing supplemental feed. The cost of purchase and transport of supplemental feed can be considerable, particularly for remote regions and extensive enterprises with large herds or flocks typical of many rangelands, and in the case of multiyear droughts (Kachergis et al. 2014). Maintaining livestock on rangelands by means of supplementary forage can degrade natural resources, including vegetation and soils. Providing supplementary feed can only be justified for maintaining a limited number of animals, such as valuable core breeding stock. For example, placing cows in drylots for calving and breeding may be advantageous for both cow and subsequent calf performance compared to supplementing cows on pastures during these periods, due to controlling rations for protein, energy, and fat content (Wilson et al. 2015). In shrub-dominated rangelands experiencing drought, livestock will increase use of shrubs (Estell et al. 2012)."

However, despite a vaccination campaign and other measures, such as ensuring surge capacity, rates of morbidity and mortality associated with the virus have increased drastically during the pandemicâs second wave. The resulting increased number of patients needing hospital beds has overwhelmed even the surge capacity of the CCUs of a metropolitan cityâs tertiary care hospitals. To meet this challenge, a teleconference has been scheduled between several members of the hospitalsâ administration, the CCU directors from each hospital, and public health officials involved in leading the jurisdictionâs pandemic response. As a public health official who played a central role in developing the pandemic plan for your jurisdiction, you have been included on the call to provide guidance for the pandemic response. During the meeting, a number of CCU directors report that their physicians and nurses are concerned about the type of patients being admitted into the CCU. Some of the directors see a trend that they suggest is ultimately undermining the efficiency of the pandemic response. They argue that, as the severity of the pandemic continues to increase, their triage criteria should be modified so as to use CCU resources to save the most lives possible. They worry that admitting those who present with the most need is preventing treatment of those who will benefit most from CCU admission. âSo long as our triage scheme saves the most lives, it is ethically justifiableâ a number of them declare. The group takes up the proposal of a CCU director to triage according to Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoresâwhich are derived using a tool that determines a patientâs organ function and failure rate to predict outcomes (Vincent et al. 2000). Were the pandemicâs severity to increase, the group suggests that, in addition to the CCU directorâs proposal to use SOFA criteria, even more inclusion, exclusion, and priority criteria could be added with the goal of saving as many lives as possible. Theyâve proposed exclusion criteria for CCU admittance that include patients with a poor prognosis, patients with other known health issues, and some mention of age cut-offs, to name a few. Others involved in the teleconference question whether this is the right approach to take. They argue that, by aiming to save the most lives possible, those who may benefit less from CCU admission, like older adults or individuals with disabilities, will be unfairly affected. They say, âwe should not just aim to save lives, but rather save lives fairly.â As you and your public health colleagues are leading the pandemic response, the hospital administrators and CCU directors look to you for a recommendation or decision about how to proceed."

However, it is important to take into consideration the potential disservices of this technology, even if they seem to be marginal or they are just disadvantageous for specific stakeholders (Baggethun and Barton 2013). Green roofs and especially living walls may have a higher investment price compared to the majority of traditional building envelope technologies. Nevertheless, they provide a significantly higher benefit value, a study undertaken in Hongkong (Peng and Jim 2015) showed a Return of Invest time of 6.8 years for extensive and 19.5 years for intensive green roofs taken a 40-years lifetime into consideration. Policy schemes, incentives by the state and a broader transfer of benefits into financial terms can significantly change the cost-benefit calculation (Bianchini and Hewage 2012). Green roof and wall technologies can also require more frequent maintenance than traditional facades and roofs. Especially in the first one or two years after installation â during the establishment period of the ecosystem â the lack of proper care can lead to poor results and unhappy customers (Magistrat der Stadt Wien 2015; Mann 2015). In contrast to living walls, providing cooling effects for public due to their close distance to street spaces and ground level, green roofs cool on roof level only and extensive roofs donât cool effectively during heatwaves (Rittel et al. 2011). Some authors state a missing acceptance of green walls near windows and consider irrigation needs of living walls not as a contribution to the local climate but as a lack of resource efficiency (Rittel et al. 2011; Mann 2015). And finally, the fear of insects, rodents, etc.: human biophobia in general is something to take into consideration when applying these technologies. Studies show, that co-creation and co- implementation can help to create high levels of citizen acceptance and identification to overcome potential fears (Davies 2015). Unfortunately, there is still a lot of incorrect information about other disservices. One of the typical examples is that green roofs are a hazard for waterproofing. It is the opposite, because green roofs protect, thus considerably prolong the lifetime of waterproofing (Pfoser 2013)."

After radiation exposure, children are reported to be more radiosensitive for about 30 % of tumor types when compared with adults. These types include leukemia and thyroid, skin, and brain cancer. They have the same sensitivity as adults when it comes to 25 % of tumor types such as kidney and bladder, and are less sensitive than adults when it comes to 10 % of tumor types including lung cancer. For effects that are bound to occur after high doses, UNSCEAR [9] concluded that, as seen with carcinogenesis, there are some instances in which childhood exposure poses more risk than adult exposure (e.g., for effects in the brain, cataracts, and thyroid nodules). There are other instances where the risk appears to be about the same (e.g., neuroendocrine system and effects in the kidneys), and there are a few instances where children's tissues are more resistant (lung, immune system, marrow, and ovaries)."

This coincidence of criteria is however not always the case and some conspicuous phylogenetic relicts are quite widely distributed, including the horseshoe crab (e.g., Selander et al. 1970) and some tropical bird species (FjeldsÃ¥ 1994).

A âremnantâ species strongly restricted geographically (typically isolated or peripheral) is not necessarily a relict that is isolated by extinction of its closest relatives. Phylogenetic or genetic studies could infer other less expected scenarios. The related group of the remnant could have been affected by both extinction and increase of neighboring distributions or the remnant may have originated after a dispersal event from a large distribution source (Fig. 2). The traditional view of geographical restriction still expressed by various authors also considers the territories harboring one or several famous relicts as antique refuges (Gibbs 2006; Heads 2009). Generally, this biogeographic reasoning is quite circular, justifying the presence of relicts by the old geological age of the deep basement and considering it as a Noahâs Ark (without consideration for more recent and decisive paleogeographic events such as land submersion, major climatic changes, etc.) and vice versa, without searching for independent biological evidence (Waters"
308,309,0.985,Contemporary Bioethics : Islamic Perspective,"Genetic Testing As currently practiced, genetic testing occurs at one of six stages in the life cycle: (1) Premarital Genetic Diagnosis (Vide Supra); (2) during the neonatal period; (3) prenatally, that is, between implantation and birth; (4) during the preimplantation stage of embryonic development, following in vitro fertilization; (5) when couples are considering whether to reproduce; or (6) when a person, often on the basis of family history, recognizes a higher-than-average risk of developing a particular disease later in life, for example, Huntington disease or breast cancer. Genetic testing and screening raise some of the most difï¬cult issues in the entire ï¬eld of bioethics. On the one hand, it is clearly beneï¬cial to reduce the incidence of severe disease, especially among children. In addition, individuals and couples can exercise their autonomy by deciding whether, when, and under what circumstances they will try to have children. And societies can focus their resources on people whose illnesses cannot be prevented and on people who are injured in accidents. On the other hand, deliberations about prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion are often agonizing for the people involved [22]."

118,503,0.985,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"human exposure to an external source of this radionuclide is relatively short [41]. It is volatile and can be inhaled. It can also be ingested because it readily enters the food chain (131I deposits on the ground). Similar to stable iodine, 131I is actively taken up by the thyroid gland. Once 131I is taken up by the thyroid gland, a constant bombardment of surrounding tissue can overwhelm the repair mechanisms of cells and trigger cancer [3]. Tokonamii et al. calculated the median thyroid equivalent dose to 4.2 and 3.5 mSv for children and adults, respectively [44]. Stable iodine tablets were distributed to Fukushima accident evacuees within a week after the accident. An oral dose of stable iodine blocks the uptake of 131I by the thyroid, although the timing of the intake of stable iodine relative to exposure is important to optimize the effect of this protective measure [38]. Nagataki reviewed the results of thyroid equivalent doses in the initial phase of the accident in the most affected areas of Fukushima prefecture and concluded that 96 % of the children received <10 mSv, with a maximum of 35 mSv, which is lower than the IAEA intervention level (50 mSv) [46, 47]. It should be noted, however, that any increase in thyroid cancer cases may not be evident until several years following the incident (as was the case in the children and adolescent age groups in the Chernobyl region) [41]. 134Cs and 137Cs, with a half-life of 2.1 and 30.2 years, respectively, pose a longterm threat since they remain on the ground [48]. Examples of deterministic health effects induced by inhalation of Î²-Î³ emitting 137Cs include mild bone marrow depression and erythema (1â10 Gy), bone marrow failure, pneumonitis, and GI failure (10â1,000 Gy), with a very high risk of death above 100 Gy. Increased stochastic effects induced by inhalation of 137Cs is estimated to occur at a dose of 1 Sv [4]. Current recommended decorporation therapy in the event of cesium intake is oral administration of Prussian Blue. Overall, solubility of particles affects the biokinetics in the body. Soluble forms would be better absorbed into the blood and result in higher content in tissues. The system biokinetics of Cs is similar to that of K, although Cs does not cross cell membranes as readily as K does. Inhaled or ingested, Cs is readily absorbed either from the GI tract or the lungs and is subsequently taken up by most tissues [10]. Upon reaching the systemic circulation, Cs distributes uniformly in the body, with a higher concentration in skeletal muscle than in most other tissues [4]. According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, radioactive cesium in foods is less than 1 % of 1 mSv/year as of April 2014, and that radiation levels in public water supplies are below allowable limits [49]. The third largest source of radioactivity released from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP is 132Te. This radionuclide has a half-life of 3.2 days and decays to 132I, which has a half-life of 2.3 h, and then becomes 132Xe, which is a stable isotope. Hence, 132Te is biologically relevant during the first few days after a nuclear accident [43]."

Congenital and genetic disorders are responsible for a major proportion of infant mortality, morbidity, and handicap in Arab countries. The population of the region is characterized by large family size, high maternal and paternal age, and a high level of inbreeding with consanguinity rates in the range of 25â60 % [4]. Several factors may contribute to the high prevalence of genetically determined disorders: â¢ High consanguinity ratesâ25 to 60 % of all marriages are consanguineous, and the rate of ï¬rst cousin marriages is high. â¢ The high prevalence of hamoglobinopathies, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deï¬ciency, autosomal recessive syndromes, and several metabolic disorders. â¢ The rate of children with Downâs syndrome in some Arab countries exceeds the 1.2â1.7 per 1000 typical for industrialized countries. This may be related to the relatively high proportion of births to older mothers in the region (up to 50 % of children with Downâs syndrome in the region are estimated to be born to mothers aged 40 or over). In the west, prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome ends in abortion in most cases. â¢ The lack of public health measures directed at the prevention of congenital and genetic disorders, with inadequate health care before and during pregnancy, particularly in low income countries. â¢ Services for the prevention and control of genetic disorders are restricted by certain cultural, legal, and religious limitations [5].

Healthcare professionals in the West may assume that Muslim families will not consider termination of pregnancy, but this may not be the case.

The different environmental conditions indeed have an effect on the stability of the oscillator and some of these effects can be reduced when these conditions are known. Available protocols (e.g., the Network Time Protocol â NTP) are able to compensate constant drifts of the local clock of a computer system, if the environmental conditions are not changed after the reference clock is disconnected. However, many CPSoSs operate in environments, within which it is infeasible â or at least only with a considerable effort (e.g., by constantly heating the crystal oscillator) â to keep these conditions stable. In contrast, sensors to determine the environmental conditions are often already available in those systems, or can be installed at relatively low cost."
241,984,0.985,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"catchments or headwater streams. The implications at a larger scale may be less pronounced. For instance, Futter et al. (2010) estimated the contribution of short-term increases in nitrate leaching following stem-only harvesting at a larger scale and suggested that this effect accounted for about 3 % of the overall Swedish N load to the Baltic Sea, despite the fact that short-term increases in nitrate leaching can be very pronounced in headwater streams after harvesting (Rosen et al. 1996). Model simulations of N and P fluxes from Swedish forest land to the marine environment suggest that over 93 % of the leaching losses can be attributed to background loads and the small remainder to forest practices (Brandt and Rapp 2008). Similarly, forestry in Finnish river basins was estimated to contribute 9 % of the total N export to the Baltic Sea on average (Lepisto et al. 2006). KenttÃ¤mies (2006) estimated the loading of P and N from forestry to be 8 and 5 %, respectively, of the total anthropogenic load in Finland. A major reason for the relatively minor contribution of forest practice to large-scale losses is that the extent of forested land area that is annually affected by forest practices is relatively low; in Finland, about 2.5 % of the entire country (Kortelainen and Saukkonen 1998). LepistÃ¶ et al. (1995) showed that within both Swedish and Finnish headwater catchments large-scale forest management practices were needed before any clear effect on spatial variability of N leaching could be detected. Although forestry is often the largest-scale human impact in headwater streams, it is thus reasonable to assume that any effect on element fluxes to the Baltic Sea related to forest management can only relate to large-scale change in forest practices. Climate is the overall factor that might impact waterborne fluxes of elements. Although several studies from forested headwater streams indicate that, for instance, change in winter conditions affect DOC losses, it still remains to be shown that climate change will also have large-scale impacts in large catchments flowing to the Baltic Sea. Over the coming century, climate change is unlikely to affect the spatial distribution of wetlands in the Baltic Sea basin. In general, however, increased ambient and soil temperatures (including permafrost thaw) and increased precipitation could lead to increased DOC export from wetlands, especially during baseflow conditions. This increase is likely to be more pronounced in the boreal/sub-Arctic regions of the Baltic Sea catchment. In fact, recent scenario studies indicate that DOC production from terrestrial vegetation, modelled by the LPJ-GUESS ecosystem model, could increase by 30â 43 % (Omstedt et al. 2012). Rising temperatures causing an increase in net ecosystem production, increasing both the available substrate and the rate of decomposition of plant biomass derived organic matter, provided the most important explanation for the increase in DOC export from wetlands and forests. In the scenario calculations of riverine fluxes, DOC fluxes to the Baltic Sea generally increased, especially"
255,238,0.985,Railway Ecology,"Abstract Train-wildlife collisions can impact wildlife populations as well as create human and resource management challenges along railways. We identiï¬ed locations and railroad design features associated with train-wildlife collisions (strikes) on a 134 km section of the Canadian Paciï¬c Railroad (CPR) that travels through the Banff and Yoho National Parks. A 21-year dataset of train strikes with elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus spp.), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and grizzly bears (U. arctos) were compared to relative abundance estimates, and nine train and railroad variables. Train strikes and relative abundance varied spatially for elk, deer and bears. Hotspots and relative risk estimates were used to identify potential problem locations. Hotspots were deï¬ned as segments of the train line where strike counts were above the 95% conï¬dence interval based on a Poisson distribution, and could be identiï¬ed for elk and deer but not bears. Relative risk was estimated as the ratio of strike counts to that expected based on relative abundance. High relative risk locations, where more strikes occurred than were expected, were identiï¬ed for elk, deer, and bears. Relative abundance was positively correlated with strikes for elk and deer but not bears. Train speed limit was positively associated with strikes for elk and deer. For bears, the number of structures (e.g., overpasses, tunnels, snow sheds and rock cuts) and bridges were positively correlated to strikes. To reduce the risk of train strikes on wildlife, our management recommendations include train speed reduction, habitat modiï¬cations and railroad design alterations.

Despite tremendous efforts and progress with EWS, the world has seen increasing economic losses and continued high tolls of death, injuries and illnesses from the impact of natural hazards such as storms in the USA, the Philippines, and Myanmar; floods in European countries, Thailand, India and Pakistan; the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola in West Africa; droughts in Africa; heat waves in Europe and Asia; tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and the Northwest Paciï¬c Ocean and disastrous earthquakes in Haiti, Ecuador and China. What has been deï¬ned as the âlast mileâ of EWS (Shah 2006)âi.e. reaching the most remote and vulnerable population with timely, meaningful, and actionable warning information and integrating a gender-sensitive and inclusive perspective into EWSâhas been difï¬cult. Most EWS focus on the hazard component of risk. But the necessity to promote an understanding of social vulnerability as a fundamental element of risk information and early warning to address the needs of the most vulnerable and account for the differential disaster impacts has been internationally recognised, and so has the need to tailor DRM strategies and practices to local capacities and needs (cf. UNISDR 2015b; Hewitt 1983). Thus, operational challenges exist for technical agencies, such as national geological, meteorological and hydrological services, to work together with DRM/civil protection agencies, statistical ofï¬ces, and other relevant stakeholders such as NGOs, to incorporate in their warning activities relevant vulnerability and impact information (including hazard and risk maps) that is requisite to forewarn, empower and guide at-risk individuals, groups and communities to assume a more proactive role in the delivery of services for DRR. Several gaps persist due to weak multi-disciplinary coordination and collaboration among the actors and agencies concerned, lack of standard operating procedures (SOP) and interoperable information systems, limited public awareness and participation in risk management, insufï¬cient political commitment, and limited public/private ï¬nancial support for the implementation of these systems (UNISDR 2006a, b; UNEP 2012; Clinton et al. 2016). Additional efforts are needed to institutionalize and strengthen MHEWS that provide multi-hazard risk communication messages tailored to the needs of speciï¬c individuals and communities, while following common standards such as the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) and colour-coded warning messages based on risk matrixes. All these factors add to the scientiï¬c and technical challenges of developing some of these systems and are critical prerequisites for their operationalization (cf. e.g. Clinton et al. 2016). Global societal changes such as rapid urbanization, increased mobility of populations and the growing exposure of people and assets to hazards are resulting in a highly"
233,612,0.985,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"In contrast, MPD is independent of species richness, and high values of MPD indicate the presence of distantly-related species co-occurring in a particular area. The balanced nature of the phylogenetic tree partly explains the low variation in Mean Phylogenetic Diversity (MPD) across Madagascar (Fig. 2c). This measure provides additional insight into the distribution of phylogenetic diversity, being of particular interest in those areas with low species richness and low values of PD. In this case, high values of MPD could indicate areas in which ecological convergence has occurred in separate lineages of Sarcolaenaceae. We note, however, the absence of areas that concurrently exhibit low species diversity and high values of PD, although some areas do have low species diversity and low PD but high MPD. The most important areas for conserving PD in Sarcolaenaceae are concentrated in the central-northern portion of Madagascar âs Eastern region, including and adjacent to the eastern edge of the Ankeniheny Zahamena Forest Corridor (Figs. 3 and 4b). However, as this area does not include any representatives of Xerochlamys and Mediusella, and because the distributions of these two genera do not overlap, the ideal strategy for protecting all lineages of Sarcolaenaceae and to maximize conservation of PD for this family, would be to include two additional protected areas: the Bongolava Forest Corridor in the northwest (Fig. 4g) and the Itremo Massif (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these three regions contain 84.9 % of the PD of Sarcolaenaceae. It is also of critical importance to consider preserving sites with high MPD values because (1) they harbor distantly related species that do not share the same evolutionary history, (2) might be impacted by different threats, and (3) require different conservation procedures. Buerki and colleagues (2015) recently suggested that the current distribution of MPD in endemic Malagasy legumes could be explained by a range of factors, such as the role of watersheds and dispersal corridors during past climatic changes, as well as by the evolutionary history of the groupâs most important dispersers, viz. extant and extinct lemurs. They conclude by advocating that a sound conservation plan should incorporate, in addition to the traditional biodiversity measures (species richness, PD and MPD), a detailed investigation of the biotic and abiotic factor that play (or have played) a role in the dynamics of each ecosystem. The trends observed in the PD of Sarcolaenaceae differ signiï¬cantly from those observed in Malagasy legumes by Buerki et al. (2015), where high values of species richness and PD are found in the subhumid highlands and lower values in humid eastern forests. However, the Bongolava Forest Corridor (Fig. 4g) and Midongy du Sud (Fig. 4c) are two sites where MPD values are high for Sarcolaenaceae that were regarded by WilmÃ© et al. (2006) and Buerki et al. (2015) as low- and high-elevation watersheds, respectively, and considered by them to represent potential refugia during the Quaternary climatic shifts. The list of important areas for conserving Sarcolaenaceae would thus also include the Bongolava Forest Corridor, Midongy du Sud, along with Makira and Masoala in the northeast and the eco-geographically diverse Behara-Tranomaro-Andohahela-Tsotongambarika area in the southeast, which spans a sharp ecotone from humid forest in the east to subarid ticket in the west (Fig. 4)."

This describes the negative values of ecosystems such as diseases, parasites, predators, or certain insects that are often overlooked in valuation attempts of ES (Dunn 2010). In the context of river landscape management, the ecosystem disservice âï¬oodingâ is of speciï¬c importance. While ï¬ooding also provides valuable services, such as supporting ï¬sh nurseries in the ï¬oodplain or storing water in the ï¬oodplain and the aquifer, especially in areas where people settled or built too close to water bodies or in previous ï¬oodplains, ï¬ood events are considered as âbadsâ (Nedkov and Burkhard 2012). However, there is often little awareness of the fact that many of these disservices are actually caused by human activities in the ï¬rst place. Although the ES concept is highly popular in the scientiï¬c realm and is discussed in countless research articles and policy papers, its application in practice lags behind (Portman 2013; Hauck et al. 2013; Albert et al. 2014). One reason for this researchpractice gap is seen in the lack of any guidance for policy-makers to deï¬ne, measure, and value ES and to integrate them in policy and governance (Bouma and van Beukering 2015). This points to the need for more direct science-policy interaction between researchers and stakeholders and a better communication to stakeholders and the public (NeÃhÃ¶ver et al. 2013; de Groot et al. 2010).

The most obvious effects are the consequences for the farmers themselves. The machines connected to GPS signiï¬cantly relieve the driver, allowing him/her to focus on the collected data. The monitoring of animals using sensors and computers reduces the need for presence in the stable to a minimum.18 It is doubtful though whether automatic rules can replace the experience and knowledge of farmers, and if this trend development really is an improvement. Also, the use of new technology is challenging and requires intensive periods of training for the farmers.19 Last but not least, there are costs for purchasing and installing the new technology. They can be quite substantial, thus favoring bigger companies, as the new technology is only proï¬table for companies of a certain size. The ever-increasing automation of procedures contributes to a continuing, decade-long structural change in Germany and the EU that results in the formation of even bigger companies and a simultaneous reduction of jobs.20 Along with IT companies that collect and analyze data, new and old players enter the sector. Companies such as Monsanto collect and analyze data and make predictions concerning particular questions, such as predicting the best use of fertilizers. They are even able to predict the expected yield for the year by merging the data. Through these precise predictions, they gain advantages in futures exchanges and business negotiations. Apart from the dependence on seed companies, farmers could also become increasingly dependent on companies collecting and analyzing data. This dependence could be preventedâat least in partâby supporting âOpen-Source Data Analyticsâ.21 Customers could potentially proï¬t from the collection of data.

182,264,0.985,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Complementing Basque beliefs about sheepdogsâ dietary requirements and their lack of knowledge about cysts, the transhumant patterns described above left shepherds, dogs and sheep in joint isolation for long periods of time, on a series of lands located at a distance from the home ranch. In these circumstances, feeding dogs on dead sheep provided a convenient source of sustenance. After all, the profit margins in the industry were small, and wasting the meat of a dead sheep seemed uneconomical. More profoundly, however, Araujo and Schwabe claimed, in this isolating system of ranching, â[r]elationships between shepherds, dogs and sheep are highly mutualisticâ, with the means of subsistence literally enabled or provided to each other by each member of the tripartite relationship.69 Araujoâs study also revealed the presence of additional links in this ecosystem. Taking a day to follow a sheep owner and his favourite dog, he carefully recorded the manifold contacts the dog had with people of all ages and stations at the ranch, particularly the children. And in observing the dumping of excess dead sheep, he suggested the possibility that wild canidsâcoyotes and feral dogsâmight also provide new host environments for E. granulosus.70 The entanglement of wild animals in the parasiteâs movement through domestic and agricultural systems had been verified in multiple contexts, as we have already seen in this chapter. As with the hyenas in Kenya, Schwabe and his collaborators discovered that the parasite had found another cohort of hosts in coyotes and had, in fact, also begun to exploit deer as an intermediate host, in place of sheep.71 As American E. granulosus continued to draw attention to itself, it soon became apparent that it had found its way to other human communities that practised modes of animal husbandry similar to those of the Basques. Like Californian coyotes and Alaskan moose, these disparate groups of people had been caught up in a series of new, loosely interconnected ecosystems that E. granulosus, through its own mode of 69 Araujo et al.

The story of the parasiteâs path from the domestic and agricultural settings generated by humans into wild populations of animals is still developing today, particularly as the âwildâ increasingly merges into the borderland around the intensively urban. for example: Catalano et al. (2012). As Chapter 6 describes, the âwildâ is one category of animal that OH advocates attempt to include beneath their umbrella. Animals are primarily regarded in that sphere as disease vectors."
182,158,0.985,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Subsequently, as contributors to the deepening depression in agriculture, their continuing deaths encouraged the state to assume some responsibility for this activity. Throughout, sheep exerted influence over how and where research was practised, and by whom. In the earlier period, the symptoms they suffered, and the geography and seasonality of their diseases, reinforced agricultural sponsorsâ perceptions of them as products of place, and led to their positioning at the hub of research networks populated by experts in their bodies and environments. Their tendency to fall ill at particular times and in particular places shaped the questions that these experts asked of them, and led to their investigation on farms. State-funded researchers in the early twentieth century paid less heed to the farmed environment and conducted narrower, discipline-specific, laboratory-based enquiries that were underpinned by their different perceptions of sheep as hosts and transmitters of infection. However, their non-human subjects forced them to return intermittently to the field. Throughout, the sheepâs variable responses to both disease and scientific investigations generated a host of conflicting claims about their diseases. Their acknowledged importance as research subjects also encouraged ambitious veterinarians to enrol them in a campaign for professional advancement, which drew strength from the lengthy and intimate relationships that vets claimed to have developed with them. In the course of these activities, sheep built relationships between diverse human and non-human actors including: scientific experts and the state; the microbes, parasites and environments implicated in sheep diseases; the human and animal victims of analogous diseases that helped to shed light on sheep; and the multiple species of experimental animals that acted as sheep proxies. Through these relationships, sheep were awarded new roles as patients, pathological specimens, experimental material, culture media, victims and shapers of their environments, subjects of field trials, hosts and transmitters of infection, food for parasites, points of comparison with other species, and commercial products. Made and remade in the course of scientific enquiries, the sheepâs identity was in a constant state of flux. Their lived experiences also changed. As scientific subjects, sheep underwent clinical monitoring and treatment, feeding trials, dipping, experimental inoculations, parasitic infections, and premature, purposeful deaths. This had ramifications for farmed sheep, which were treated by dipping, drenching, dosing, isolation, managed grazing and restricted breeding in efforts to promote their health."

Nevertheless, our results suggest that immigrants are more likely to be influenced by the presence of a third party in an interview, and that the risk of bias in these cases is higher than it is for non-migrants. This finding supports our first working hypothesis. We had assumed that migrant descendants would be more subject to non-private interview settings than natives due to differences in their opportunity structures (Reuband 1992; Hartmann 1994). In order to test this hypothesis, we controlled for household characteristics as well as individual variables. Including these variables led to a slight decrease in the differences between the groups in the presence of a third party, but they remained significant. This indicates that differences in the socio-demographic compositions of the groups explain some of the differences in the interview settings. The most important factors were marital status and the number of children. However, these control variables could not fully explain the increased likelihood among immigrants of the presence of a third party. The following question therefore arises: Why did we find more immigrants interviewed in non-private settings for reasons not related to opportunity? While Allerbeck and Hoag (1981) argued that language proficiency may play a role, we do not think that this applies to our sample, since all of the Turkish descendants were born in the survey countries (this was the sampling criteria) and attended school there. Hartmann (1994) and Lander (2000) brought up the jealousy hypothesis, which may of course apply to individuals regardless of their migration history. The jealousy hypothesis was put forward mainly in order explain the higher percentages of bystanders in interviews with women than with men. We indeed found such a gender effect, but only among Turkish descendants. In the comparison group, the odds of a bystander being present were not significantly different between women and men. We should note, however, that the type of bystander also varied between the groups: whereas the third person in the interviews with the natives was most likely to have been the partner, which would support the jealousy hypothesis; the third person among the Turks was most likely to have been a parent or a sibling. This difference may be related to the young age structure of the second generation in our sample, with some of these respondents still living with their parents. Instead of being viewed as evidence of jealousy, the presence of a third party among the migrant respondents may instead be seen as an indicator of the high level of social cohesion and the relatively strong intergenerational ties within Turkish families. In addition to opportunity structure, support, and social control, we suggest another explanation for the more frequent presence of third parties in interviews with migrant descendants. The literature shows that, compared to members of other minority groups, members of the Turkish migrant community are more subject to discrimination in various areas, such as education, the labor market, and the practice of religion, in all of the western European countries where they reside (Crul and Vermeulen 2003; Foner and Alba 2008; Safi 2010). This may be related to a high correlation between people of Turkish origin and the Muslim faith, which is a minority religion in Western Europe. Especially immediately after the attacks of 9/11, Muslims faced hostility throughout Europe. In the following years, immigrant"

In most cases, release or destruction of the bloodspot requires a signed formal request by a parent or legal guardian. Research to date has provided important findings for both clinical decision making and public health. For example, studies exploring childhood leukemia have used bloodspots to identify whether genetic changes are present at birth, or have accumulated over time, helping to clarify how the disease is caused. Others have considered the effects of public health policies, such as the removal of perfluorinated compounds, and examined the levels of these in bloodspot samples, noting significant declines in analyte levels following the phasing out of these compounds (Spliethoff et al. 2008). As such, bloodspots may provide a useful resource for evaluating public health policy. Bloodspot samples may also be requested by the coronerâs office or be used in forensic investigations as was proposed, for example, in the Netherlands following an explosion at a fireworks factory (Couzin-Frankel 2009; Douglas et al. 2012). However, there has been a great deal of media discussion regarding the retention, storage, and use of dried bloodspots due to public concerns about privacy (CouzinFrankel 2009; Muchamore et al. 2006; Bombard et al. 2012). In particular, there has been debate regarding the secondary use of stored bloodspots for research, which are seen as having tremendous research value (Tarini 2011). This has culminated in several lawsuits in the United States and Canada (Lewis et al. 2012; Armstrong 2010) that have led to changes in storage policy and the destruction of millions of dried bloodspot samples (Lewis et al. 2012)."
84,614,0.985,Eye Tracking Methodology,"display (this may take another 33 ms for a system with update rate of 30 frames per second). Loschky and McConkie (2000) conducted an experiment on a gaze-contingent display investigating spatial, resolutional, and temporal parameters affecting perception and performance. Two key issues addressed by the authors are the timing of GCDs and the detectability of the peripherally degraded component of the GCD. That is, how soon after the end of an eye movement does the window need to be updated in order to avoid disrupting processing, and is there a difference between the window sizes and peripheral degradation levels that are visually detectable and those that produce behavioral effects? In all experiments, monochromatic photographic scenes were used as stimuli with a circular, high-resolution window surrounded by a degraded peripheral region. An example of Loschky and McConkieâs GCD is shown in Fig. 24.7a. In one facet of the experiment, it was found that for an image change to go undetected, it must be started within 5 ms after the end of the eye movement. Detection likelihood rose quickly beyond that point. In another facet of the study concerning detection of peripheral degradation, results showed that the least peripheral degradation (inclusion of four of four possible levels) went undetected even at the smallest window size (2â¦ ), where the opposite was true with the highest level of degradation: it was quite detectable at even the largest window size (5â¦ ). The GCD was also evaluated in terms of performance effects, in the context of visual search and scene recall tasks. In the end it was found that the generation of an imperceptible GCD was quite difficult in comparison to the generation of a GCD that does not deteriorate performance. Although greater delays (e.g., 15 ms) and greater degradation (inclusion of only three of four possible levels) produce detectable visual artifacts, they appear to have minimal impact on performance of visual tasks when there is a 4.1â¦ high-resolution area centered at the point of gaze. Parkhurst et al. (2000) investigated behavioral effects of a two-region gazecontingent display. A central high-resolution region, varying from 1 to 15 degrees, was presented at the instantaneous center of gaze during a visual search task. An example of Parkhurst et al. display is shown in Fig. 24.7b. Measures of reaction time, accuracy, and fixation durations were obtained during a visual search task. The authorsâ primary finding is that reaction time and accuracy co-vary as a function of the central region size. The authors note this as a clear indicator of a strategic speed/accuracy tradeoff where participants favor speed in some conditions and accuracy in others. For small central region sizes, slow reaction times are accompanied by high accuracy. Conversely, for large central region sizes, fast reaction times are accompanied by low accuracy. A secondary finding indicated that fixation duration varies as a function of central region size. For small central region sizes, participants tend to spend more time examining each fixation than under normal viewing conditions. For large central regions, fixation durations tend to be closer to normal. In agreement with reaction time and accuracy, fixation duration is approximately normal (comparable to that seen for uniform resolution displays) with a central region size of 5â¦ . For screen-based VR rendering the work of Watson et al. (1997) is particularly relevant. The authors studied the effects of Level Of Detail (LOD) peripheral"

Griseofulvin was given prophylactically to American troops in Vietnam, though this did not stop ringworm being a major cause of disability.133 Only reduced exposure, in shorter combat rotations, affected the overall incidence of ringworm and relapses were blamed on poor compliance in prolonged treatment.134 Griseofulvin, as a treatment for most forms of ringworm, united athleteâs foot with other sites of infection, such that tinea pedis became distanced from hygiene and fitness. This shift exemplified a trend in medicine from the late nineteenth century of moving definitions of infections based on symptoms to specific causes. Ringworm was not unified by a specific cause, because there were many fungal pathogens, but rather by a treatment â griseofulvin. The drug was a major contributor to athleteâs foot and other forms of ringworm, becoming defined as types of âdermatophytosisâ, a term which grew in popularity from the 1960s. It was in fact a quite general, hybrid causal-symptomatic definition, literally, skin infection with fungi. Azoles: âA major advance in medical mycologyâ135 The success of griseofulvin, more than the earlier nystatin for candidiasis, changed the prospects of antifungal therapy and further new drugs were anticipated.136 In the event, a widely adopted, oral antifungal alternative to griseofulvin for dermatophytosis did not emerge for nearly 20 years, until in 1977 the Belgian company Janssen announced ketoconazole.137 Branded as âNizoralâ, it was one of the group of synthetic compounds called âimidazolesâ, or more generally âazolesâ, that the company had been screening since the late 1960s. The first two widely used drugs from this work were announced in 1969: clotrimazole from Bayer and miconazole, also from Bayer, which were targeted at Candida infection and deep seated systemic mycoses. Ketoconazole was different. It was promoted as a broad spectrum antifungal that could be used to treat dermatophytosis as well as candidiasis, histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis.138 Following the precedent of griseofulvin, Janssen sponsored a meeting to review progress and spread the word.

At times during any growing season some changes can be made in response to changes in prices and the actual availability of water. If the farmers frequently ï¬nd that insufï¬cient water is available in the short run to meet livestock and crop requirements, then they will reassess and perhaps change their long-run plans. They may shift to less water-intensive activities, seek additional water from other sources (such as deep wells), or sell their farms (and possibly water rights) and engage in other activities. For the purposes of modeling, however, this planning hierarchy can generally be described by two levels, denoted as long-run and short-run. The appropriate decisions included in each category will depend on the time scale of a model. These long-run and short-run beneï¬t and loss functions are applicable to some water users, but not all. They may apply in situations where beneï¬ts or losses can be attributed to particular allocations in each of the time periods being modeled. They do not apply in situations where the beneï¬ts or losses result only at the end of a series of time periods, each involving an allocation decision. Consider irrigation, for example. If each growing season is divided into multiple periods, then the beneï¬ts derived from each periodâs water allocation cannot be deï¬ned independent of any other periodâs allocation, at least very easily. The beneï¬ts from irrigation come only when the crops are harvested, e.g., at"
365,684,0.985,Climate Smart Agriculture : Building Resilience To Climate Change,"Interventions that target improved feed resources can result in faster animal growth rates, higher milk production, earlier age at first calving, and increased incomes. Better nutrition can also increase fertility rates and reduce mortality rates of calves and mature animals, thus improving animal and herd performance and system resilience to climatic shocks. For cattle, such interventions may include the use of improved pasture and agroforestry species and the use of nutritious diet supplements. Feed availability for ruminants can be a major constraint in the mixed systems of the tropics during the dry season. The options available to smallholders include higherdigestibility crop residues, diet supplementation with grain, small areas of planted legumes (âfodder banksâ), the leaves of certain agroforestry species, and grass species that can be planted on field boundaries or in rehabilitated gullies (with added erosion control benefits). These kinds of supplements can substantially increase productivity per animal while also increasing resilience by making substantial impacts on income. For example, the feeding of 1 kg of Leucaena leucocephala leaves per animal per day can nearly triple milk yields and live-weight gains (Thornton and Herrero 2010). At the same time, because these supplements improve the diet of ruminant livestock, the amount of methane produced by the animal per kilogram of meat and milk produced is substantially reduced (Bryan et al. 2013). There may also be soil carbon sequestration benefits from planting trees and deep-rooted pasture species. For example, planting Leucaena trees on farms increases carbon sequestration in the soil, possibly by up to 38 tonnes of carbon per ha (Albrecht and Kandji 2003). In many regions, crop residues (stover) are a critical feed resource; increases in stover digestibility of 10 percentage points are well within the range of variation in digestibility that has been observed in sorghum, for example (BlÃ¼mmel and Reddy 2006). Such genetically improved dual-purpose crops (food and feed), both cereals and legumes, are widely grown in some parts of the tropics. Improving the diets of ruminants is one of the most direct and effective ways of increasing productivity and incomes, while mitigating GHGs at the same time. Mixed crop-livestock system diets are often complex and amenable to modification. Widespread application of the different options above is plausible in many situations. Adoption rates of up to 43% for genetically improved dual-purpose crops have been observed in some parts of West Africa, though lower adoption rates are more usual (Kristjanson et al. 2002). There may be constraints at the local level, however: diet intensification may require additional household labour, and the availability of appropriate planting material may be inadequate, for example. In addition, some of these alternatives require appropriate technical capacity to manage them as well as some cash investment. Some also require land, although sometimes competition for land can be avoided: in an example from Ethiopia, degraded land is given to female headed households or landless youth, who thus get a chance to produce small stock for sale. Overall, the above constraints may not pose insuperable barriers to the continuing uptake of climate-smarter feeding practices in the future."
188,278,0.985,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Conclusions The different components of this case study have enabled us to extend our understanding of the potential impact of the ROLE technologies within a wide variety of informal learning contexts and scenarios. This case study has numerous rich contexts in which there is potential for significant impacts of both PLEs and SRL. The challenges faced and lessons learned in each component of this case study have also been reported here. As with every new technology, some resistance was expected and initially faced in most cases by the participants be they educators or managers in HE institutions or likewise e-Learning practitioners elsewhere. Overwhelmingly, however, most of the ROLE tools were positively received by those who participated in the events, activities, or used the artifacts. Each event, activity or artifact that has been explored has also involved a cross section of representative individuals. This approach has enabled the ROLE project as a whole to collect experiences covering a large variety of learning contexts and requirements.

Yet, there is little doubt that a number of the patients received there exhibited violent and even dangerous behaviour. By the 1890s, asylum case notes contained a field marked âdangerous to othersâ. Table 7.1 reveals that those committed to more expensive asylums, particularly Hampstead and Highfield, were the most frequently described as being dangerous to others. The diagnoses assigned to patients in this study also reveal medical recognition of violent symptoms among paying patients. The two primary diagnostic categories of mania and melancholia encompassed a wide range of symptoms and behaviours.145 of the two, mania, which was medically associated with violence and disruptiveness, was the more common diagnosis, accounting for almost half of first admissions (see Table 7.2). Melancholics were the next largest group, constituting over one-fifth of first admissions. Aside from these two classic diagnoses, a much smaller proportion of paying patients were diagnosed with dementia, general paralysis, epilepsy or other far less common conditions such as paranoia, imbecility and congenital mental deficiency. Paying patients in rural asylums, Ennis (65.8%) and Enniscorthy (73.1%), were particularly prone to mania diagnoses. This contrasts with the neighbouring Carlow asylum, where only 39% of diagnosed patients (pauper and paying) were identified as suffering from mania,146 and implies that paying patients were perceived as being especially violent. Male (46.4%) and female (46.5%) paying patients had almost equal chances of being diagnosed with mania, suggesting that women were considered just as capable of violent acts as their male counterparts. Certainly, violence was a distinctive feature of asylum life and perpetrated by paying patients of both sexes. The disruptive behaviour which characterised mania posed challenges to the moral therapy regimes.147 Voluntary and private asylum patients were reportedly particularly violent. At Bloomfield, patient John P.I. was âliable to outbursts of violence and has assaulted patients and attendants but less so latterlyâ.148 Another patient, Mary L., âpulled Mariaâs [the attendantâs] hair and kicked herâ.149 Violent behaviour also extended to elderly patients.

297,1632,0.985,The R Book,"r temporal pseudoreplication, involving repeated measurements from the same individual; r spatial pseudoreplication, involving several measurements taken from the same vicinity. Pseudoreplication is a problem because one of the most important assumptions of standard statistical analysis is independence of errors. Repeated measures through time on the same individual will have non-independent errors because peculiarities of the individual will be reï¬ected in all of the measurements made on it (the repeated measures will be temporally correlated with one another). Samples taken from the same vicinity will have non-independent errors because peculiarities of the location will be common to all the samples (e.g. yields will all be high in a good patch and all be low in a bad patch). Pseudoreplication is generally quite easy to spot. The question to ask is this. How many degrees of freedom for error does the experiment really have? If a ï¬eld experiment appears to have lots of degrees of freedom, it is probably pseudoreplicated. Take an example from pest control of insects on plants. There are 20 plots, 10 sprayed and 10 unsprayed. Within each plot there are 50 plants. Each plant is measured ï¬ve times during"

In an average SEA in our sample 50% of the households participate in any of the groups mentioned above. Almost half of the households have a member with kinship ties to the headman, whereas only 11% have kinship ties to the chief. Village chiefs in Zambia are representatives of their tribe, whereas headmen are elected by the community and deal with day to day activities in the village. We, therefore, expect the kinship ties to the headmen to be stronger drivers of diversification outcomes. Access to urban centers and markets is one of the frequently cited pull factors for diversification as summarized above. We use the distance to a tarmac road and an established marketplace with many buyers and sellers to test this hypothesis. Given the role that institutions can play in driving diversification outcomes, we use a set of variables to capture the access to relevant institutions. The Farmer Input Support Subsidy Programme (FISP) is one of the most important programmes in Zambia, accounting for around 60% of the poverty reduction programme budget of the ministry of agriculture. It provides fertilisers and seeds to âvulnerable but viableâ farmers (i.e. those that have the ability to produce at least 0.5 ha of maize) that are members of cooperatives/farmer groups (Mason et al. 2013). Depending on the specific interventions, such programmes can increase or decrease incentives for diversification. In Zambia, only hybrid maize seed was distributed along with fertilizers until 2009, after which rice, sorghum, cotton and groundnuts were included (Mason et al. 2013). We use the share of households in a given SEA who received FISP support to control for the effect of FISP on diversification. The Food Reserve Agency (FRA) is another important government programme that takes up the rest of the ministry of agricultureâs poverty reduction programme budget (Mason et al. 2013). FRA buys maize from farmers at above market prices, aiming to take some of the price risk away from farmers. By making maize incomes less risky, it increases incentives to grow maize, and hence may be expected to decrease crop diversification. However, it may also increase crop diversification if farmers experiment with other crops given the improved security about their maize income, making the a-priori expectations ambiguous. FRAâs effect on other indices of diversification is ambiguous as well, as it depends on other factors at play. We use the number of FRA depots in the district to understand these interactions. Access to credit is very limited in rural Zambia. Only 15% of households in our sample received a loan from any source during the 2010/11 season. Around 11% of these were from out-grower Schemes (65% of all loans in our sample), while only 0.25% were from commercial banks. Rather than using access to loans as reported by households, which is likely to be endogenous, we use the number of banks per 100 km2 and the number of tobacco and cotton buyers, who are the main suppliers of agricultural credit, to control for the role of credit. Whereas each district has almost one (0.82) cotton or tobacco buyer on average, the average number of banks per 100 km2 is only 0.03. Last but not least, we also use the number of extension agents in each district to understand the impacts of the availability of the information and technical assistance provided by all available extension sources in driving diversification choices."
274,249,0.985,Firm innovation and Productivity in Latin America and The Caribbean : The Engine of Economic Development,"variables, the marginal effects measure the effect of changing the variable from 0 to 1. Horizontal bars show the 95 % confidence intervals. The figure shows that, regardless of firm size, the most important determinants of the decision to train are those that measure innovation and technological development. For example, for small firms, the probability of training is associated with an increase of 18 percentage points if the firm has a quality certificate, 19 percentage points if R&D expenditures increase by 1 %, and 10 percentage points if the firm has changed or improved its production processes in recent years. Interestingly, we find no difference in the marginal effects of the variables that measure innovations in products versus innovations in processes, even though the literature has stated that these may have differential effects on skill demand and on employment. Recent evidence for LAC has shown that product innovation may be more complementary to skilled than to unskilled labor (Crespi and E. Tacsir 2012). Having credit with a commercial bank is also a significant determinant of training for small and medium firms (7 and 6 percentage points, respectively), suggesting liquidity constraints on OJT investments. Interestingly, the measures of the degree of competition (i.e. the number of competitors faced by the main product or product line in the market and the fraction of domestic sales) are not associated with training either, even though firms in more competitive markets could have greater incentives and need to invest in the human capital of their workers. It is important to emphasize that the characteristics of the workforce, such as the proportion of skilled workers, do not seem to be associated with the decision to train. The same applies to the share of workers with a temporary contract, which is not statistically significant in any of the three models, even though this is a measure of turnover, which could lower a firmâs incentives to provide training in general skills because of the appropriation problem. The study by Almeida and Aterido (2010) on small firms in developing countries also failed to find significant effects of worker turnover on OJT. In summary, the three results presented in this section highlight the importance of the demand for skilled workers in the decision to train. The subset of firms that do not train may have fewer requirements for skilled workers, which could be associated with a lower degree of technological development. These results are consistent with the studies by Bassanini et al. (2005) for European countries and by Almeida and Aterido (2010) for developing countries.19 However, due to the available data, we can only examine correlations between the decision to train and the firmsâ attributes, and no causal interpretation should be given due to endogeneity."
182,142,0.985,Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine,"Working with the Edinburgh zoologist, Theodore Rettie, McGowan began in 1912 to investigate louping ill, which he saw as analogous to poliomyelitis in humans. He moved on to braxy (which he attributed to the same bacteria as louping ill), a type of jaundice he thought analogous to human cholera, and the obscure disease known as scrapie which was reportedly increasing in prevalence. His enquiries proceeded along established lines. Continuing to view diseased sheep as problems of place, he considered the local influences of season, pasture, weather patterns and landscape on their bodies. Working at the Edinburgh Lunacy Boardâs farm in Linlithgowshire, on private farms and in his laboratory at the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh, he examined sheep clinically in life and by post-mortem after death, and conducted bacteriological experiments on their bodily tissues and fluids. Sheep both facilitated and impeded his enquiries in the ways outlined above. Landowners and farmers provided crucial assistance âin obtaining information regarding the occurrence of the disease, in procuring diseased animals for observation, and in other waysâ.90 His recommendations focused on the improvement of pasture, and the management of sheep grazing and breeding.91 In contrast, this approach was rarely adopted by the beneficiaries of BA and DC funding. Departing from the received view of sick sheep as products and shapers of unhealthy environments, they focused instead on sheep relationships with other infected and infective bodies. Believing that environments were unimportant, they sidelined the farmers and natural historians who knew about them, ignored the local specificities of vegetation, topography and sheep, and considered climate only in its effects on bacteria and parasites. They pursued their enquiries by extracting sheep and their infective agents, physically and conceptually from their specific farms of origin, and refashioning them within laboratories into generic subjects of investigation, which they hoped would produce universal knowledge of disease more readily than the locally specific sheep of the field. Zoologists and entomologists investigated different stages in the life cycles of parasitic mites and ticks by âfarmingâ them in glass tubes and incubators, and working out how changes in temperature and moisture"
371,12,0.985,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"This edited volume focuses on migration as a speciï¬c strategy developed by EU citizens to adjust to an adverse socio-economic environment. In particular, we propose to look at the mobility of EU citizens proceeding from the Southern European Member States that have been most affected by the crisis (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) and moving to Northern European Member States, where the job market has remained attractive in spite of the crisis (Belgium, France, Germany, United Kingdom). In other words, this book seeks an answer to the following question: have old South-North migration routes within Europe reopened? More precisely, our objective for this volume is twofold. First, we intend to identify the scale and nature of this new Southern European wave of emigration and the socio-economic integration of these migrants within Northern European destination countries. This will be achieved through a quantitative analysis of the most recent data on the ï¬ows and proï¬les of this new labour force using databases from both sending and receiving countries (labour force surveys, census records, migration ofï¬ce statistics on national and EU levels, Eurobarometer surveys, etc.). Such analysis will, overall, point to the differences and similarities between this current wave of Southern European migration and previous ones. However, as the different chapters in this volume show, quantitative data often presents limitations that invite us to use such information with great care. For instance, the measurement of the migration ï¬ows of EU citizens can be undermined by the voluntary non-registration of EU migrants with the authorities in both the home and the host country. EU migrants do not have a strong incentive to register as permanent residents in the host country. In fact, they may have important reasons not to deregister as residents in their home country; for example, to avoid losing entitlements to health care provision, social security rights or unemployment insurance, amongst others. Alternatively, not registering with the host country authorities may be a conscious strategy by EU citizens concerned about the removal of their residence permit if they are in a ï¬nancially precarious situation (see Chap. 7). In addition, the circular nature of migratory moves applies to a non-negligible number of Southern Europeans. Some migrants may thus not be interested in registering upon arrival if they plan a short-term stay. Such data limitations entail the possibility that recent migrantsâlike the newly arrived Southern Europeansâare under-represented in ofï¬cial data, while longerterm migrants, who arrived well before the crisis, are over-represented. As underlined in Chap. 8, well-settled migrants with stable housing and jobs are more likely to be included in large surveys such as the Labour Force Survey than are new migrants in a precarious housing situation. Second, this book will look at the politics and policies of immigration from the perspective of both the sending and the receiving nations. Because of the uncertainties regarding the proï¬le and motivations of those who leave their home country, Southern European governments have been speculating on the impact of this loss of labour force and on the appropriate policy response to adopt. Similarly, Northern European governments have had mixed attitudes towards this new inï¬ux of EU citizens. Reactions in Northern Europe have varied: some countries have set up programmes to actively recruit and train these migrants, while others have promulgated the stigmatization of mobile EU citizens. In this volume, each chapter has designed"
233,495,0.985,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Conservation Cost The cost for each PU was obtained from WWF (Soares et al. 2012). The database was built by the Conservation Science Team based on potential future deforestation, using Land Change Modeler module of Idrisi Selva. Distance to roads, to cities, to infrastructure and to previously deforested areas were included as driver to changes in land cover from 2002 to 2010, and then applied to 2010 natural vegetation map to predict which areas are more likely to be deforested in the next 10 years. Focal Species Eighty-two out of 209 amphibian species known to occur in the Cerrado (Valdujo et al. 2012) were selected as focal species. The criteria were based on endemism, range size (both obtained from Valdujo et al. 2012) and level of tolerance to anthropogenic alterations in habitat quality (two classes: tolerant and nottolerant; species were classiï¬ed based in our ï¬eld experience, so that species commonly seen in disturbed areas were considered as tolerant). We used both endemism and extent of distribution as independent criteria because some species are endemic to the Cerrado but have a wide range within this biome, whereas some other species are range restricted (e.g. <60,000 km2) but occur in a transition zone between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, and so they are not endemic to the Cerrado (Valdujo et al. 2012). Since we were prioritizing among natural areas within the Cerrado, widespread species do not add to the ï¬nal solution, and neither do species that can tolerate habitat degradation. Species Distribution Models We prepared geographic distribution maps for all 82 species, using distribution models constructed through the Maximum Entropy algorithm â MAXENT (Elith et al. 2006; Phillips and Dudik 2008). We included as predictors elevation and all 19 bioclimatic variables with a 10 arc-min spatial resolution provided by Worldclim (Hijmans et al. 2005). For each species we used the mean model of 20 runs and converted probabilistic models to binary models using the 10 percentile training presence logistic threshold. Distribution maps were lately validated by a group of experts during a workshop organized by the Ministry of Environment and WWF aiming to identify priority areas for biodiversity conservation in the Cerrado, in 2011, following the procedure recommended by Graham and Hijmans (2006). The distribution map for each species was superimposed onto the PUsâ map in order to calculate how much of its distribution area is contained in each PU. All distribution maps were overlaid to obtain the richness surface of endemic species of amphibians in the Cerrado. Evolutionary History Prioritization In some cases the outcome of area prioritization through SCP analyses fails to meet all targets. To ensure that at least the most important species meet their targets, it is possible to set a penalty factor (SPF) for each species that penalizes solutions more heavily when not achieving these targets. We assigned SPF based on both threat and phylogeny, using ED scores (Evolutionarily Distinctiveness) obtained from Isaac et al. (2012), ranging from 4669 to 17,903. Mapping Total Evolutionary Distinctiveness We calculate the total ED of each PU by summing the value of all species occurring in it. As ED is highly correlated with richness, here we used a weighted value, obtained by dividing summed ED by richness in each PU."
151,11,0.985,Ecological Risk Assessment for Chlorpyrifos in Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems in North America (Volume 231.0),"The ultimate role of publishing scientific research is to enhance understanding of the environment in ways that allow the public to be better informed. The term âinformed publicâ as used by Thomas Jefferson in the age of enlightenment conveyed the thought of soundness and good judgment. In the modern sense, being âwell informedâ has the narrower meaning of having access to sufficient information. Because the public still gets most of its information on science and technology from TV news and reports, the role for scientists as interpreters and brokers of scientific information to the public will grow rather than diminish. Environmentalism is the newest global political force, resulting in the emergence of multinational consortia to control pollution and the evolution of the environmental ethic.Will the new politics of the twenty-first century involve a consortium of technologists and environmentalists, or a progressive confrontation? These matters are of genuine concern to governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. For those who make the decisions about how our planet is managed, there is an ongoing need for continual surveillance and intelligent controls to avoid endangering the environment, public health, and wildlife. Ensuring safety-in-use of the many chemicals involved in our highly industrialized culture is a dynamic challenge, for the old, established materials are continually being displaced by newly developed molecules more acceptable to federal and state regulatory agencies, public health officials, and environmentalists. Reviews publishes synoptic articles designed to treat the presence, fate, and, if possible, the safety of xenobiotics in any segment of the environment. These reviews can be either general or specific, but properly lie in the domains of analytical chemistry and its methodology, biochemistry, human and animal medicine, legislation, pharmacology, physiology, toxicology, and regulation. Certain affairs in food technology concerned specifically with pesticide and other food-additive problems may also be appropriate. Because manuscripts are published in the order in which they are received in final form, it may seem that some important aspects have been neglected at times. However, these apparent omissions are recognized, and pertinent manuscripts are likely in preparation or planned. The field is so very large and the interests in it are so varied that the editor and the editorial board earnestly solicit authors and suggestions of underrepresented topics to make this international book series yet more useful and worthwhile. Justification for the preparation of any review for this book series is that it deals with some aspect of the many real problems arising from the presence of foreign chemicals in our surroundings. Thus, manuscripts may encompass case studies from any country. Food additives, including pesticides, or their metabolites that may persist into human food and animal feeds are within this scope. Additionally, chemical contamination in any manner of air, water, soil, or plant or animal life is within these objectives and their purview."
224,230,0.985,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Within our theoretical framework, human time is characterised by the following metabolic characteristics. First, and analogously to the other relevant biophysical resources (materials, energy and land), human time is a limited resource. Each individual has 24 h per day at his/her disposal. All human time has to be used in some manner, and preference for one activity over another is contingent on culturally prescribed means of self-maintenance and reproduction. In addition, each human lifetime hour, whether âproductiveâ or not, requires a certain metabolic input (i.e. matter and energy). Otherwise, social conflict arises, and people starve and die. The time at oneâs disposal, whether oneâs own time or that of other individuals, is one critical indicator of freedom and power. How human time is used, therefore, is a crucial variable that determines and is determined by the systemâs social metabolism and its regime transitions. In some instances, societies have resisted transitions from hunting and gathering to agriculture because they were not prepared to invest the greater amount of labour time required; in contrast, the willingness of other societies to do so paved the way for agricultural transitions (Carlstein 1982; Ellen 1982)."
370,91,0.985,Investigating the Body in the Victorian Asylum,"case the heart of 15-year-old John C. was preserved, along with his stomach, for the Asylum museum.34 As well as the degenerated or anomalous appearance of the organ that could be seen at postmortem, several asylum doctors made heart disease the subject of physiological investigation. Ofï¬cial statistics seemed to show a rise in the incidence of heart disease among the general population at this time, and popular knowledge of it was spreading with the condition becoming something of a âfashionable complaintâ in the second half of the nineteenth century. Popular periodicals like The London Journal ran accessible, easy to understand, accounts of the condition; âA Conversation on Heart Diseases between a Physician and his Patient,â for example, highlighted the bad habits that could exacerbate heart conditions, namely over-eating.35 Physician John Milner Fothergill suggested that disorders of the heart were also increasing in the general male population due to the struggle for success that characterised the late nineteenth centuryânot unlike the competitive and tense âType A personalityâ of the 1950s who was thought to be at increased risk of heart attack.36 Heart disease was linked by Fothergill and others to minor emotional or mental changes such as irritability or personality change, and the behaviour of asylum patients appeared to offer an exaggerated version of these states. It was not unreasonable to suppose, then, that heart disease, circulatory problems, and degeneration of the organ would be prevalent among asylum patients. Indeed, Cecil Beadles of Colney Hatch Asylum was emphatic that what was âpopularly known as a fatty heart [was] common in lunatics.â37 The heart has long been an organ that â[blurs] the boundaries between cultural supposition and apparent medical fact,â linked to other physical and emotional disturbances and held up as a symbolic object signifying much more than the merely physical.38 In the eighteenth century, disorders of the heart were associated with high living and over stimulation; by the late nineteenth century, this association was still evident despite the shift towards pathological anatomy and precision measurement with instruments such as the sphygmograph to chart the pulse and blood pressure. Although the brain was the primary object of investigation for asylum researchers, it did not eclipse other parts of the body, all of which were considered to have some relationship with that organ. At the West Riding, J. Wilkie Burman tabulated the results of 500 postmortems to investigate the incidence of heart disease among the insane, reasoning that if insanity was to be cured by âremoving bodily disorderâ then heart disease should be a major area of investigation.39 With more attention being paid to the"

260,395,0.985,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Import risk analysis (IRA) is a procedure that can be used to determine the threat of a pathogen entering a system. The consequences of pathogen introduction can be monitored directly (Sect. 2) or simulated using models (Sect. 6). The guidelines for IRA have been primarily developed from a trade perspective between two countries or regions to assess the disease risk associated with the import of live terrestrial production animals. However, the same principles can be applied to assess the risk of ranavirus introduction in wild or captive populations. In general, IRAs focus on possible infection of one species or several species within the same taxonomic class. As discussed in Duffus et al. (2015), ranaviruses are multi-species pathogens that have the capability of infecting three vertebrate classes, which makes IRA for ranaviruses complex. IRAs can be used to establish or revise trade or translocation guidelines for wildlife that could be subclinically infected with a pathogen (Smith et al. 2009). The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) lists ranaviruses that infect amphibians as notifiable pathogens, meaning that a subsample of amphibians that are involved in international trade should be verified ranavirus negative prior to shipment (Schloegel et al. 2010). Currently, these regulations are not being enforced in most countries (Kolby et al. 2014). The procedures we outline below are based on principles and recommendations of the OIE (Vose 2000; OIE 2014), with examples of how they can be applied to parts of an IRA for the introduction of a ranavirus into an uninfected area."
61,300,0.985,Mergers and Alliances in Higher Education : international Practice and Emerging Opportunities,"the number of African first-degree graduates growing by 50 % between 1995 and 2010 (Council on Higher Education 2013a). Whether or not this gross expansion would have happened without mergers is of course unknowable; clearly, though, mergers have not impeded overall expansion. In 2012, the government published a new National Development Plan. This has called for this expansion to continue, and to result in ten million graduates in 2030 (one in every six people), in contrast with 2001, when there were 2.6 graduates in the South African populations as a whole, one in every 17 people (Government of South Africa 2012). Despite this overall growth, the National Development Plan is explicit in its criticisms of the suitability of the countryâs graduates for national workforce requirements: âthe data on the quality of university education is disturbing. South African universities are mid-level performers in terms of knowledge production, with low participation, high attrition rates and insufficient capacity to produce the required levels of skills. They are still characterised by historical inequities and distortions. The university sector is under considerable strain. Enrolments have almost doubled in 18 years, yet the funding has not kept up, resulting in slow growth in the number of university lecturers, inadequate student accommodation, creaking university infrastructure and equipment shortages. The number of institutions that have recently been put under administration is an indication of the leadership and governance challengesâ (South African Government 2012). These deficits have been examined in detail by the Council on Higher Educationâs Task Team on undergraduate curricula structure (Council on Higher Education 2013a). When considered in terms of participation rates (using the standard Gross Enrolment Ratio), the targets set in the 2001 National Plan for Higher Education have been met, increasing from 15 % in 2000 to 18 % in 2010. However, pronounced racial inequalities persist. While white participation is comparable with developed country levels, the participation rate for black students is persistently low. The task team concluded: âthe output of higher education is not meeting the countryâs needs [. . .] the system has low internal efficiency in utilising human and material resources (and consequently does not provide a sound basis for growth), and [. . .] the scale of the failure and dropout occurring within a small and selected student body points to substantial systemic problems that require systemic responses. It can be said that, in relation to its educational role, higher education in South Africa is a âlow-participation, high-attrition systemâ [. . .] that has not yet come to terms with its developing-country environmentâ (Council on Higher Education 2013a). At the overall system level, then, outcomes of mergers have been mixed. What is still unclear is what will emerge from the five remaining, new universities that have certainly not failed, but which were still implementing key aspects of their mergers at the time of their HEQC audit reports. Leaving aside the special case of the Unisa, these are the Durban University of Technology, the Tshwane University of Technology, the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the University of Fort Hare. Two are metropolitan, and two span the complex spread of urban and rural catchments. Three are universities of technology. Given their particular missions,"
36,76,0.985,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Roosts Some of the ancillary structures built with roads, in particular bridges (e.g. Keeley and Tuttle 1999), can provide roosts for bats. Road bridges over water or wooded valleys are the most likely to be used, those over busy roads much less so. Old stone road bridges over water are widely used by bats, most notably by Daubentonâs bat in Europe, but also other Myotis species and by Nyctalus species (e.g. Senior et al. 2005; Celuch and Sevcik 2008; Angell et al. 2013). In North America bridges are widely used by Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis (e.g. Allen et al. 2011) and some other species (e.g. Bennett et al. 2008). Effective mitigation and compensation for the loss of roosting and foraging sites will make the environment close to a road more attractive to bats, but may do so at the expense of greater risk of collision with traffic. Light Artificial light, particularly short-wavelength light such as mercury-vapour (not most LED lights) attract insects that are common prey to bats. Insect swarms around lights are exploited by open-air foraging bats such as Pipistrellus and Nyctalus (Rydell 1992; Blake et al. 1994; Stone et al. 2009, 2012). One consequence of this is that bats feeding around lights on busy roads may be at significantly greater risk of mortality from collision with traffic. The balance between the positive and negative effects will be dependent on species, topography, the position of lights, etc. and further study would be useful. A very thorough discussion of the positive and negative effects of artificial light can be found in the chapter by Rowse et al. Flight corridors In rural environments roads are often bounded by hedgerows or treelines. The wide verges often associated with hedges in landscapes managed for wildlife can be among the most species-rich habitats in some agricultural areas. Minor roads in particular can therefore be both foraging sites and commuting routes, but even major roads are used by some species (e.g. Nyctalus leisleri, Waters et al. 1999) where they are bounded by suitable habitat such as a woodland edge. Depending upon structure, this habitat could be used by a wide range of species. However, Bellamy et al. (2013) found that even low road densities had a negative effect on most species of bats, most noticeably the woodland-adapted species Myotis and Plecotus. Only the distributions of common pipistrelles and noctules had a positive association with roads at low to moderate densities and only when in close proximity (<100 m) to woodland. A similar result was found for railway verges (Vandevelde et al. 2014). As road density increased above moderate levels, the probability of presence of all species declined. The effects of roads of different classes have yet to be investigated in depthâthe roads in this study were predominantly minor and rural."
309,409,0.985,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"rapid shift of an impoverished food environment (through economic closure and the sidelining of some national food patterns and cuisines) to a context where food cultures are multiplying, intertwining, and becoming more complex is a potential source of concern and anxiety. The switch from a simplified food environment to a more complex one, in which certain influences coming from the outside are claimed by Vietnamese, has multiple and interacting effects: an increase in food anxiety, the destabilisation of regulatory devices, and a questioning of social identities. The feeling of anxiety is reinforced by the multiplication of crises and scandals that, as in many Asian countries, make the front pages of Vietnamese newspapers and the headlines of TV news. Here too, the different levels of crisis are entangled: food safety and health risks, food security (exacerbated since the international food security crises of 2008 and the Vietnamese stock building policies), fraud, and other controversies. In the face of the growing number of scandals due to the use of banned products in livestock and/or agriculture and the press reports, the Municipality of Ho Chi Minh City has announced the establishment of a âspecial committeeâ in charge of food safety (HÃ´ng Nga 2016). Controversies over GMO rice led the Vietnamese Food Association and its Thai counterpart to commit to zero GMO production (Rice Trade Cooperation 2006)."
337,190,0.985,Understanding Society and Natural Resources : Forging New Strands of Integration Across the Social Sciences,"our ability to predict and respond to EID. This is particularly true in Vietnam where government policies have facilitated what can broadly be called a âtransition to the marketâ (Arkadie and Mallon 2003; De Vylder 1990; Fforde and Vylder 1996). Economic policies have driven changes in the built environment that have created new ecological health risks (Oliveira et al. 2004; Smith 1997), migration to cities has simultaneously uprooted residents from local social networks and placed them into new neighborhood associations, water user-groups, and other forms of social organization (Crane 1994; Spencer 2007). These new socio-physical ecologies present new challenges that, in turn, require new forms of social organization and governance, many of which do not yet exist, to provide basic services such as water and sanitation, education, housing, and public health. A final social science perspective that has received little attention to date in the developing world relates to theories of behavioral decision making and perceptions of risk. This field draws primarily from economics, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, and cognitive science. Researchers have developed tools such as the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (Kasperson et al. 2003; Pidgeon et al. 2003) to describe and explain the societal processing of risk signals, but tests of such frameworks are rare because of the difficulty in predicting when risk amplification conditions are likely to occur (Frewer et al. 2002). A central insight of decision theory is that risk responses are based on socially constructed perceptions of risk. That is, risk means different things to different people; it cannot be measured independent of our minds and cultures. People prioritize risks in different ways, depending on their beliefs about the need to try to reduce a risk (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982; Hofstede 1984; Park et al. 2007). Research conducted in the developed world suggests that perceived risk is related strongly to feelings of control and trust (Slovic 2000). Some authors suggest that people perceive low risk during modernization because they feel they are in control of technology, nature, or society and that regulatory authorities can be trusted (Bauman 1992; Beck 1999; Giddens 1992). Over time, however, perceived risk increases as feelings of control and trust are eroded. Some people will respond swiftly and comprehensively to a risk event and others will respond more slowly, depending on a range of psychological and socio-cultural variables and environmental conditions. However, the relative importance of various elements in CNH systems (i.e., socio-ecological and socio-psychological factors) in determining perceptions of and responses to the risk of EID in rapidly developing societies has not been examined. To understand the relationships between characteristics of decision makers, their environmental context, and their risk responses, the field of decision science uses a wide range of methodological approaches and analytical tools. Qualitative interviews and focus groups permit an in-depth exploration of risk perceptions and responses, allowing participants to describe beliefs and experiences in their own words, rather than as a choice between predetermined survey responses (Pope and Mays 1995). These methods are useful in defining the range and variability of conceptualizations of risks such as disease outbreaks and how they might relate to environmental change (OâBrien 1993). Quantitative methods (e.g., decision analysis, process tracing, surveys) are more readily applied with larger samples and allow"
30,23,0.985,Determinants of Financial Development,"There is less work directly addressing the potential correlation between geography and financial development in comparison to that for policy and institutions. However, much research attention has been paid to the importance of geography for general economic development, emphasizing three aspects in particular. The first group is concerned with the correlation between latitude and economic development. Countries closer to the equator typically have a more tropical climate. On the one hand, research by Kamarck (1976), Diamond (1997), Gallup et al. (1999) and Sachs (2003a, 2003b) suggests that tropical location may lead directly to poor crop yields and production due to adverse ecological conditions such as fragile tropical soils, unstable water supply and prevalence of crop pests. On the other hand, tropical location can be characterized as an inhospitable disease environment, which is believed to be a primary cause for âextractiveâ institutions (Acemoglu et al., 2001). A second strand of research relates to countries being landlocked, distant from large markets or having only limited access to coasts and rivers navigable to the ocean (Sachs and Warner, 1995a, 1995b, 1997; Easterly and Levine, 2003; Malik and Temple, 2009). As natural barriers to external trade and knowledge dissemination, geographic isolation and remoteness to some extent determine the scale and structure of external trade in which countries engage. The potential to enter a large economic market and exploit economies of scale may be limited by particular geographic circumstances. The ability to develop a competitive manufacturing sector may be constrained when some intermediate inputs for the production of manufactured goods need to be imported from distant markets. As the main feature of external trade for these countries, the limited range of primary commodities exported determines the vulnerability of these countries to external shocks. The last strand of research focuses on the link between resource endowment and economic development. Diamond (1997) suggests that countries with a richer endowment of grain species have more potential for high-yielding food crops and technological development. Isham et al. (2005) argue that a developing countryâs natural resource endowment affects its economic development through an unique channel in which"

The data coverageâthe SEER data start in 1973âand the large size of data, combined with the ease of access, make the SEER data an ideal instrument for the analysis of cancer survival by age over calendar time. We were using data that were released in April 2014 with a follow-up cutoff date of December 31, 2011 (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program 2014). The SEER data do not cover all cancer diagnoses of the United States. It is a collection of data from several registries. With the exception of Seattle (Puget Sound) and Metropolitan Atlanta that started in 1974 and 1975, respectively, we only used registers that covered the whole time span from 1973 until the end of 2011. Although we use less data than we could have, we thought that a heterogeneous set of registers would have induced problems for the analysis over time. The registers included in our analysis were: San Francisco-Oakland SMSA, Connecticut, Metropolitan Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah as well as Seattle and Metropolitan Atlanta. In our analysis of cancer survival in Chap. 10, starting on page 123, we selected five cancer sites: Breast cancer; cancer of the lung and bronchus; cancer of the colon, rectum, and anus; pancreatic cancer; prostate cancer. As shown in Table 3.3, those five cancer sites constitute about 55% of all cancer diagnoses for women as well as for men out of the 4.5 million cases recorded during our observation period. The largest categories are by far breast cancer for women (30.44%) and prostate cancer for men (25.79%). The absolute and relative frequencies of the other cancer sites as well as their respective ICD codes can be inspected from Table 3.3. While ICD-8 was in use at the beginning of the observation period in 1973 and cancer cases are typically coded by the ICD-O standard, all ICD codes were converted to ICD-10 by SEER."

370,92,0.985,Investigating the Body in the Victorian Asylum,"links between mind and body, the physical connections between heart and brain made it commonsensical that the state of one would affect the other. Commenting on his ï¬ndings, Burman suggested that hypertrophy of the heart in asylum patients was likely due to the strain put upon the organ, comparing West Riding Asylum patients with people in the general population whose condition was attributed to overwork or mental stress. This comparison to the general population was apt, as investigators like Fothergill struggled to prove that either heart disease or congenital abnormalities were more common in the insane than the sane population. Fothergill had come to the conclusion that heart disease was actually comparatively rare among the insane and Burman, too, had to admit that heart disease âas a certiï¬ed cause of death, [was] scarcely more common in the West Riding Asylum than in the West Riding of Yorkshire generally.â40 In addition, it was difï¬cult to establish a chain of cause and effect with regard to heart disease and insanity: it was possible that the circulatory problems came ï¬rst, altering the circulation and nutrition of the brain, or that the heightened emotions of insane patients had impacted directly upon the organ. Though the results of investigations like Burmanâs or Fothergillâs were inconclusive regarding the prevalence of heart disease among âthe insaneâ more broadly, the physical state of the heart as seen at postmortem suggested that it was directly and profoundly affected in general paralysis. The degeneration, fattiness, or deformity of the heart muscle in these patients neatly paralleled their external bodily appearance and that of other body parts, from the large (muscles of the limbs) to the microscopic (nerves). Rather like the eighteenth-century gentleman suffering from heart problems as a consequence of an overly luxurious lifestyle, general paralytic patients were personally implicated in the aetiology of their disease. Although it would be some years before a conclusive link was established between general paralysis and syphilis, doctors in the late nineteenth century made a connection between the disease and what they considered to be abnormal or illicit sexual activity, or behaviours such as excessive drinking. Patients diagnosed with general paralysis were frequently noted to have a history of venereal disease, to have been involved in a large number of sexual liaisons, or to be given to drinking to excess. William C., a police constable, was diagnosed with general paralysis that was attributed to sexual excess and syphilis, having previously been treated with mercury, and was said to have attempted rape several times before being committed to the Asylum.41 This lack of moral self-control was mirrored in patientâs"
18,41,0.985,Radiation Monitoring and Dose Estimation of the Fukushima Nuclear Accident,"The nuclear accident that occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) of Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) on March 11, 2011 was caused by an extremely massive earthquake, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and a gigantic tsunami rarely seen in history, which resulted in the severe accident that extended over multiple reactors simultaneously. Although some details of the accident are still not well known, the sequences, causes, and consequences of the accidents have been basically clarified by the efforts of investigation committees, such as Independent Investigation Commission [1], TEPCOâs Investigation Committee [2], National Dietâs Investigation Committee [3] and Governmentâs Investigation Committee [4]. The fission products (FPs) released to the environment were estimated by the severe accident analysis code from inside the reactor core, and also by atmospheric dispersion simulation code by coupling with environmental monitoring data in the reverse estimation method from outside the plant. Lessons learned from the accident are identified mostly by those investigation committees, which cover the wide spectrum of insufficient measures in hardware, software, management, and regulation [1â4]. In the present chapter, the current status of the accident is described in terms of basic information, sequences of the accident, estimated fission products released, and lessons learned from the accident."
376,974,0.985,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","tribute to wind erosion. Climate change studies indicate warming and drying trends, both in the recent past and future forecasts (Savage et al. 2009). Currently, unsustainable dryland cultivation is the greatest threat to livestock survival during winter, spring, and fall when the high-elevation summer pastures are unavailable. Sustainable dryland cultivation is the greatest threat in terms of the fragmentation of pastoral migration routes and staging areas.22 Both situations will only get worse if climate change scenarios are verified, as more cultivated areas are abandoned in the most fragile landscapes and drought becomes the norm rather than just a temporary or cyclic event. The Ethiopian situation illustrates too many people and livestock (i.e., cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) exploiting a diminishing natural resource base. This trajectory was predicted over 20 years ago (Coppock 1994). Symptoms are ecological and socioeconomic (Coppock et al. 2014). The former include bush encroachment and gullying on certain soil types. The latter include land-use fragmentation due to de facto privatization of grassland parcels annexed from communal resources, loss of dry-season grazing to maize cultivation, and occupation of former drought grazing reserves by people who have arrived from overpopulated places elsewhere. Bush encroachment has been exacerbated by decades of overgrazing and (past) official bans on the use of prescribed fire that have shifted the competitive balance from perennial grasses to woody plants (Coppock 1994). This loss of grasses means a decline in fine fuels that are needed to carry fires that might otherwise control the recruitment of woody seedlings. Maize cultivation by pastoralists is a food insecurity response to a declining ratio of livestock to people and thus is symptomatic of the trend of increasing poverty (Desta and Coppock 2004). Chronic food insecurity has led to dependence on food aid, the provision of which effectively delays resolving the root causes of hunger (Coppock et al. 2014). The Sahel differs from southern Ethiopia in many respects, but shares some of the same broad outcomes. The Sahelian belt occurs at a continental scale, with far more variation in terms of climate, land use, and rangeland ecology (Table 17.1). Sahelian production systems vary from pure pastoralism to highly integrated agropastoralism where crop residues provide livestock fodder, and livestock manure enhances crop yields (Heasley and Delehanty 1996; Turner et al. 2014). In the Sahel the overall challenge for pastoralists is how to exploit the highly variable occurrence of fodder over space and time most efficiently. Fragmentation of landscapes and natural resource endowments has occurred due to population growth, spread of cultivation, and national policies that attempt to reassert tougher border controls, although efforts have occurred to accommodate pastoral mobility across national borders (Zoundi and Hitimana 2008).

193,136,0.985,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"Apart from developing a rich definitional framework to analyze the circularity of Ukrainian migrants to Italy, Vianello (2013) points also to a transnational âdouble presenceâ of migrants, who engage in transnational practices to cultivate family ties in Ukraine. These practices enable Ukrainian women to perform roles related to their multiple identities, not only as workers, but also as mothers and grandmothers. This âdouble presenceâ, which Vianello refers to also as âthe migrant in transitâ (see Chap. 10), also demonstrates the durability of temporary forms of mobility, creating a transnational social space within which repetitive movements continuously occur. Summarizing, among the concepts that have been most frequently used in the analysis of Ukrainian migration to Europe are circular migration and transmigration (or transnational practices). We can talk about some ânational/regional approachesâ as regards the usage of these two terms. Studies on Ukrainian migration in CEE usually refer to circular migration, while research in Southern Europe discusses, rather, transmigration or transnational activities. The term âreturn migrationâ has been much less popular in studies of Ukrainians in Europe presumably because the return movements to Ukraine are typically short visits and do not relate to intention to return as suggested by studies both in Central and Southern Europe. More nuanced approaches to these migration concepts can be also found in the literature reviewed here. Time dimensions addressed in them include, for example, duration of stays in the home and destination countries, and number (intensity) of trips. These approaches usually take the form of empirical-only typologies proposing some specific diversifications of types of circular and/or transnational migrants coming to the given country (cf. GÃ³rny et al. 2010b; IllÃ©s and Kinces 2012; OkÃ³lski 2001; Vianello 2013). What they virtually all have in common is an emphasis on the role of a household and its location (country of origin or migration) in determining patterns of mobility. However, novel terms introduced by researchers to capture temporariness in Ukrainian migration, even if defined, are difficult to operationalize, and thus their use is rather limited."

133,164,0.985,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Aims and Hypotheses The aim of this study is to assess the association between the different household arrangements and self-perceived health in individuals between 30 and 59 years of age in Europe. We compare twelve countries classiï¬ed into the ï¬ve welfare state regimes. Comparing different countries allows us to test whether the health differentials are related to the welfare state types that are associated with different norms and values. Men and women are analyzed separately to capture gender differences according to the norms and values applying to them. We characterize household arrangements by an individualâs position within the household instead of using the household as a common context for all members. The position is deï¬ned by whether the person shares a household with a partner, children, or another person outside the family nucleus. In addition, we distinguish whether partners live in a consensual union or in a marriage. We use self-perceived health because it reflects the integral dimension of health recommended by the World Health Organization2 and has shown the capacity to capture differences in populations with a rather homogenous health proï¬le in terms of objective health, such as is the case for young and middle aged adults. In addition, it has been shown that self-perceived health provides information about the evolution of an individualâs health rather than only informing about the current status (Idler and Benyamini 1997; GumÃ  and CÃ¡mara 2014). However, self-perceived health levels differ widely between countries, reflecting not only differences in health but also culture-speciï¬c differences in answering health questions in surveys. Thus we do not explore country-differences between the health outcomes related to different household positions but rather the extent of the health gap between the most favorable household position and all others. A large number of studies have shown that the married with two or more children usually have the best health proï¬le (see the chapters of Hank and Steinbach as well as Tomassini, Di Gessa, and Egidi in this volume), thus we use these as the reference group. We developed the following hypotheses extending the institutionalization hypothesis. First, household position is more important for womenâs health than for menâs due to the prevailing cultural norms and values. Second, compared to the married living with children, all other household positions are disadvantaged. Third, the health of individuals living in a consensual union is worse than of those who are married. However, based on the institutionalization hypothesis we"

Unless hunting increased, this would increase the sensitivity of Fennoscandian forests to wind felling (Swedish Forest Agency 2007). There is also a risk that pathogens and insects having marginal impacts under present-day conditions could become more important and that new insect pests could move in from the south. To maintain resilience, in terms of production, biodiversity and other forest uses, adaptive strategies should be considered at regeneration. For example, planting more tree species and favouring a higher number of species when cleaning and thinning than is usual today (Swedish Forest Agency 2007). Problems may also be encountered due to the higher frequency and intensity of extreme events, such as droughts, storms and spring and summer freezing (CCIRG 1996; Nikulin et al. 2011), with consequent damage to forests. The Baltic Sea basin has only a few tree species of economic importance in forestry, such as Scots pine, Norway spruce, birch and oak. However, changing tree species composition may be an appropriate adaptive management strategy (Ge et al. 2011a). The following changes in tree species composition are possible adaptive management strategies: â¢ A shift from mono-species to mixed species stands (see KolstrÃ¶m et al. 2011). â¢ Incorporating other indigenous tree species, currently of minor importance in forestry, but with high potential for timber production or carbon sequestration under climate change. â¢ Increasing the share of broadleaved species assumed to perform better under climate change. â¢ Substituting species sensitive to drought and late spring frosts by drought-tolerant and frost-resistant tree species or provenances. â¢ Replacing low-productivity tree populations with high productivity ones when the current population does not make full use of the potential productivity of a site. Changing tree species can be an appropriate adaptive management strategy for improving productivity, which also includes the adjustment of thinning (intensity, interval, pattern: from above/below). In this context, adjusting the rotation period is an effective means of managing timber production and the carbon budget of forests. Over the rotation, the timing and intensity of thinning determine the growth rate and stocking, which control the rate of carbon sequestration and the amount of carbon retained in trees and soils. In most European countries, growing stock is still increasing, because timber harvest (thinning, ï¬nal felling) is less than the increment. This means that the total carbon storage in the forest is increasing. On the other hand, the age-class distribution of the forests in the Baltic Sea basin is shifting towards the older age classes, and the overall length"

Nearly one-half of all respondents (46 %) felt that bribery of inspectors was common or very common; 30 % believed it took place sporadically, and only 6 % believed it never happened. The lack of a consistent, predictable relationship with taxpayers is a common feature of these findings.

The combination comes about because indices such as G, D, and R can respond with high scores when displacement from parity involves group differences in pairwise contact that are quantitatively small. Indices that register group separation and neighborhood polarization take low values in these situations because the two groups are living together, not apart, with most minority individuals living with Whites and few residing in predominantly minority residential areas (e.g., ghettos and barrios). It is important to be aware of this possibility for many reasons not the least of which being that it affects the potential policy implications of eliminating uneven distribution. When group separation and area polarization are absent, majority-minority differences in residential outcomes will change little when uneven distribution is eliminated. When separation and polarization are present, the residential outcomes experienced by minority individuals can potentially change dramatically when uneven distribution is eliminated. I believe this is an important aspect of the correspondence, or lack of it, between different indices. Accordingly, I review the issue in more detail in Chaps. 7 and 8."

246,50,0.985,Rewilding European Landscapes,"If the abandoned land is too degraded assisted regeneration may be needed (Cramer et al. 2008). Active restoration would involve large-scale native trees plantation and tree growth management (Rey Benayas et al. 2008). An intermediate level of intervention involves the creation and management of forest regeneration sources or âwoodland isletsâ (Rey Benayas and Bullock 2012; see Chap. 7). Another problem often requiring intervention is the vulnerability of intermediate stages of natural succession to natural perturbations, such as invasive species (Kull et al. 2004; Stoate et al. 2009) and fire (Pausas et al. 2008). Fire is a particularly acute problem as it has impacts not only on biodiversity but also on human health (ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2010b). If fire regime is not appropriately managed, frequent fires will favor fire-prone scrubland and halt succession towards forest, in a selfreinforcing feedback loop (ProenÃ§a and Pereira 2010a). One of the strategies to manage fire regimes is to maintain open spaces in the landscape (see Chap. 8), minimizing also the impacts of revegetation on species that prefer open areas (Fig. 1.2). This strategy can be implemented by increasing the populations of large herbivores (Hodder and Bullock 2009; Sutherland 2002), including reintroduction of extinct species (Svenning 2002). In the case of species regionally extinct, it is possible to use individuals from other populations. For instance, seven European bison were recently reintroduced in northern Spain, 1,000 years after their extinction (Burton 2011). A more complex situation occurs with species that are globally extinct, such as wild relatives of some domesticated species. A possible solution is to release into the wild individuals of breeds that are most likely to be successful in replacing the ecological role of their wild ancestors. For instance, Iceland ponies have been released in the former arable fields of the Dutch-Belgian border (Kuiters and Slim 2003): their grazing favored a dense grass sward and after 27 years open grassland still represented 98 % of the area. Natural colonization of abandoned land by carnivores can also be limited by the availability of prey, as is the case for the Iberian lynx ( Lynx pardinus) currently negatively affected by the scarcity of rabbits, decimated by diseases (DelibesMateos et al. 2008), or as can be expected for some populations of wolves and bears currently preying on livestock (Russo 2006). Rewilding may be a future option in areas that are undergoing agricultural development or intensification today. There is currently a debate between land sharing and land sparing approaches to reconcile food production with biodiversity (Phalan et al. 2011). In land sharing, biodiversity conservation and food production goals are met on the same land, with biodiversity friendly agricultural practices and extensive agriculture, whereas in land sparing, land is divided between areas of intensification and of exclusion of agriculture. In practice, it is difficult to determine which is the best option because species respond differently to the alteration of their habitat (Phalan et al. 2011). To maintain future options for rewilding, both land sparing and land sharing are needed. On the one hand, land sharing is essential to limit land degradation and to maintain the appropriate seed bank for future passive revegetation (see Chap. 7). On the other hand, land sparing would allow for the conservation of populations of species that are currently in conflict with human activities, making âcohabitationâ very difficult."
212,389,0.985,Life Cycle Management,"Life cycle management as a process has a history that reaches back more than 25 years, while as a term it has risen to prominence only about 15 years ago. Big progress has been made in collecting and analyzing data and information on environmental interventions along the supply-chains and working together to improve the environmental performance of many thousands of products and many tens of thousands of processes, worldwide. The life cycle data availability for this kind of analysis has constantly grown and now allows â while less so for countries with a shorter history in life cycle approaches â to get reliable results also for complex products, particularly, if the producing industry is actively involved and experienced experts support the analysis. Product life cycle analysis and management was and still is the core also for the slowly developing field of sustainable consumption analysis, which needs to employ in addition to LCA complementary methods and data to also capture the secondary consequences outside the analysed product and directly connected products. While first life cycle based studies on the secondary consequences go back to the late 1990s, given the much more complex effects and higher effort, a much smaller share of studies has looked into it and the body of evidence is growing only slowly. With increasingly better availability of process-based life cycle data and more and more companies publishing Environmental Product Declarations and Footprints, the evidence and process-based life cycle data basis for consumption and lifestyle studies is now further expanding. If we want to achieve a reduced global environmental impact, we need to approach this from both the production and the consumption side. Unfortunately, the reduced environmental impact of many products and per functional unit is so far overcompensated by increased overall consumption â more products with a larger function per average person and an overall growing world population."

302,175,0.985,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"As the birthplace of our species, the African continent holds a unique place in human history. Current scientific consensus places the evolution of modern humans in East Africa approximately 200,000 years ago from where they successfully dispersed approximately 72,000 years ago during the late Pleistocene [1, 2]. From here our species continued to spread and over the next 50,000 years or so colonized the majority of the Earthâs land surface. Fast-forward through the following epoch, the Holocene, which is regarded as being relatively stable in terms of climate, and we arrive at a point in time in which humankind have established themselves as the dominant force and major driver for environmental change. Accordingly a new era is said to have now dawned â the Anthropocene [3, 4]. While the exact start date of the Anthropocene is subject to much current debate, the advent of the industrial age (ca. 1800s) changed the dynamics between humans and the environment. The Anthropocene is thus defined by human actions which perturb the Earthâs land, oceans, and biosphere [5]. These dramatic effects include climate change, ocean acidification, deforestation, and plastic pollution. Plastics (and microplastics, MPs, defined as <5 mm in size) are considered a hallmark of this new anthropogenic age, having become widely used in the last 60 years [6], and are now a ubiquitous pollutant found worldwide and in all aquatic compartments (surface waters, water column, and sediments) and numerous animals (invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and marine mammals) [7]. Up until recently MP pollution had been viewed solely as a marine issue, but there is now an increasing amount of information regarding the presence of MPs in freshwaters [8, 9]. MPs have been sampled from both freshwater lakes, such as Lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior in Canada [10], Lake Geneva in Switzerland [11], and Lake Garda in Italy [12], and rivers, such as the River Thames in London (UK, [13]), River Seine in Paris (France, [14]), and the Danube [15], to name but a few. In this last study, the mass and abundance of drifting plastic items in the Austrian Danube were found to be higher than those of larval fish [15], which is an indication of the magnitude of the problem. However, there is remarkably little information on the presence of MPs in the freshwaters of Africa â the place where it all started for humans!

At the same time, pressures on the natural environment have increased tremendously: âEvery minute of every day we have been losing the equivalent of 50 soccer fields of forest. Over one billion people already face water scarcity, and this may triple by 2025. Climate change is costing $700 billion per year, with the greatest impact on the poorâ (WRI 2014). The sheer amount of goods shipped around the world is also unprecedented. Ten billion tonnes (10 gigatons, Gt) of materials and products were shipped between countries in 2005 (Dittrich and Bringezu 2010). And this figure includes only the direct physical trade, i.e. actual shipment of materials and goods. As will be shown later in this chapter, raw materials are also extracted and processed in order to enable exports, even though they never leave the country. Adding these indirect material flows or âraw material equivalentsâ to the actual physical trade resulted in a total amount of 29 Gt of materials associated with trade flows between countries in 2008 (Wiedmann et al. 2015). In addition to growing in scale, trade has become more complex and fragmented. The production process of many products occurs in small stages in different countries, interlinked through complex global supply chain networks. Supply chains have become longer, more fragmented and more complex. World merchandise exports of intermediate and final products were almost identical in 1993 (7â8 % of world GDP), but exports of intermediate exports have grown faster since and were 15 % of GDP in 2012, whilst exports of final goods only reached 11 % of GDP. Longer and more fragmented supply chains also mean that places of production and consumption are more separated and that it becomes more difficult to establish the link between environmental impacts exerted by the production process and the final destination of the product. In other words, the âcradle-to-gateâ life cycle becomes longer, more convoluted and more difficult to assess. Increasingly sophisticated global models have had to be developed to evaluate impacts embodied in global supply chains (Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013; Wiedmann 2009; Wiedmann et al. 2007, 2011)."

38,570,0.985,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.3.1 Pan-Arctic Arctic ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are experiencing growing pressure from various stressors (e.g., development, climate change, contaminants). However, established research and monitoring programs have remained largely uncoordinated, and therefore lack the ability to effectively monitor, understand and report on biodiversity trends at the pan-Arctic or regional scale (MA 2005). The maintenance of healthy arctic ecosystems is a global imperative, as the Arctic plays a critical role in the Earthâs physical, chemical and biological balance. A coordinated and comprehensive effort for monitoring Arctic ecosystems is needed to facilitate effective and timely conservation and adaptation actions. While all Arctic states, as well as a number of non-Arctic states and organisations, conduct monitoring of various elements of Arctic biodiversity, the lack of coordination has limited their geographic, thematic, and temporal scope and are not evenly spread across the Arctic. In particular, northern areas of Canada, Greenland and Russia have very limited biodiversity monitoring, whereas areas in northern Scandinavia, the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Iceland have relatively intense, on-going biodiversity monitoring (Fig. 13.4) and in many cases, long-term datasets. Given that the area in question is 32 million km2 (three times the size of Europe) and is comprised of largely remote and extreme ecosystems, it is not surprising that current biodiversity monitoring efforts are seen as inadequate. Indeed, recent issues regarding state ï¬nances and priorities have made it more difï¬cult to sustain even existing efforts. The current situation facing the Arctic demands a well-designed, scaled, pan-arctic, ecosystem-based approach that not only identiï¬es trends in biodiversity, but also identiï¬es underlying causes of these trends. It is critical that this information be made available, as plans for adaptation and mitigation need development, which ultimately depend on rigorous, integrated and efï¬cient monitoring programs that have the power to detect change within a âmanagementâ time frame. To meet these challenges, the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Working Group of the Arctic Council launched the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP) in 2005. The CBMP is working with over 80 global partners in building the capacity to expand, integrate and enhance existing Arctic biodiversity monitoring efforts, thus facilitating more rapid detection, communication and response to signiï¬cant trends and pressures.

260,133,0.985,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"One of the perplexing characteristics of ranavirus epidemics is the variation in the outcome, from no (apparent) mortality to massive die-offs. This apparent ârandomnessâ has led to the hypothesis that environmental factors, which can vary a great deal in space and time, may play an important role in disease outbreaks (Gray et al. 2009a). Natural and anthropogenic stressors are broadly thought to suppress immune function, making individuals in stressful environments more susceptible to infection and disease (reviewed in Martin 2009; Blaustein et al. 2012). Although many researchers use the term âstressâ to mean any aversive, generally unpredictable condition that would seem to challenge the organisms, there is a physiological basis to the âstress-induced susceptibilityâ hypothesis. It posits that chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoid âstressâ hormones have negative impacts on the immune system, such as reducing circulating lymphocyte populations, decreasing cytokine production, or suppressing cell-mediated immune responses (Sheridan et al. 1994; Haddad et al. 2002; Dhabhar 2009). Defining stress and identifying stressors and the responses they elicit a priori, however, is often difficult, particularly in the absence of detailed information on the environmental, developmental, and evolutionary context of the organisms (Martin 2009). For example, Warne et al. (2011) found that pro-metamorphic wood frog tadpoles challenged with a ranavirus had elevated glucocorticoid concentrations relative to controls and also experienced faster development and more rapid weight loss. As glucocorticoids are responsible for mobilizing resources (e.g., to respond to infection) as well as accelerating metamorphosis in pro-metamorphic tadpoles, the authors hypothesized that this surge in glucocorticoids led to an energetic trade-off. Only those individuals with large enough energetic reserves could support rapid development and a robust immune response at the same time (Warne et al. 2011). Clearly, linking elevated glucocorticoid concentrations to immunocompetence is fraught with difficulties, even with considerable context. It is thus not surprising that the reported effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on host susceptibility to ranaviruses are highly variable."
231,841,0.985,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"resilience. Increases in species richness seem to have been due to the addition of warm-temperate species without the loss of cool-temperate species. The warm period since the late 1980s is still too short to determine whether the present ecosystem state is transitional and whether the cool-temperate species will gradually disappear, but evidence from archaeological material laid down during the Mesolithic warm period (4000â7500 y BP) indicates that cool-temperate species may remain (Enghoff et al. 2007) at least until temperatures rise by considerably more. The time taken for this to happen depends on the rate of global warming but also on decadal regional variability, which could maintain a cooler state over the next few decades. Substantial biological changes in the Northeast Atlantic including the North Sea have been associated with shifts in the sub-polar gyre and warming over recent decades (Hatun et al. 2009). This includes large-scale modiï¬cation of the phenology and distribution of plankton assemblages (Beaugrand et al. 2002; Edwards and Richardson 2004; Richardson and Schoeman 2004), changes in the availability of food resources and species, reproduction of benthic animals, composition of ï¬sh assemblages (Attrill and Power 2002; Simpson et al. 2011), and recruitment to the North Sea cod stock (Clark et al. 2003; Olsen et al. 2011). The diversity of the North Sea ecosystem may lead to contrasting responses to future climate change. For instance, the increase in temperature, light (through improved transparency), and wind in the south-eastern North Sea have probably contributed to the increase in algal biomass in this region during the period 1948â2004 (Llope et al. 2009). While their data suggest that phytoplankton biomass may have reached a maximum in the southernmost parts of the North Sea, Llope et al. (2009) concluded that phytoplankton biomass in the northern North Sea would continue to respond positively to a warmer, brighter, and windier future if current trends are maintained. Projections of the phenological responses of individual species under climate change have not yet been made, but the empirical evidence suggests that phenological changes will continue as climate warming continues. It is currently uncertain whether genetic adaptations within species populations will be able to cope with these changes, at least partly, or whether the pace of climate change is too fast for genetic adaptations to take place. This uncertainty is further compounded by the difference in phenological responses between species and functional groups. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching and result in disruption of the functioning, persistence and resilience of North Sea ecosystems. It is not clear whether general species attributes (e.g. trophic level) are sufï¬cient to predict future outcomes or"

Before delving further into Palepu and Khannaâs framework describing the types of essential market intermediaries, it will be useful to examine several recent studies that also categorized and quantified business environment voids. From them, we can get an initial sense of the common threads of infrastructure that are necessary to do business in emerging digital economies and how others have been thinking about the importance of market intermediariesâas well as how Kenya benchmarks in these areas regionally and globally. The World Bankâs Doing Business report (2015) is an annual report on the state of health of various economies, based on detailed diagnostics of their underlying and embedded characteristics, such as regulatory systems, the efficacy of the bureaucracy, and the nature of business governance. The report is used by policymakers and businesses to catalyze debate and improve reform. Kenyaâs overall ease of doing business ranking (1â189, with higher numbers worse) was 108th. The country ranked higher than 100th across all factors except âGetting credit,â where it ranks 28th. In spite of a thriving entrepreneurial culture, the country was 151st for ease of starting a business, particularly because of the costs (percent of income per capital) of starting a business and the number of procedures. Indeed, these rankings were not surprising, given Kenyaâs classification as a lowermiddle-income country (i.e., having annual gross national income per capita of $1046â$4125) (The World Bank 2015). The World Economic Forumâs annual Global Competitiveness report (2014) is an analysis of the institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country and of the countryâs rates of return and growth. It is an attempt at explaining why some countries are more prosperous than others, prompting discussions at annual gatherings of policymakers, particularly when a country moves significantly up or down in the rankings. The report breaks down determinants of competitiveness into 12 pillars, including institutions, infrastructure, and macroeconomic environment. Kenya ranks 99th out of 140 countries indexed, with an overall score of 3.9 (on a 1â7 scale, with higher numbers"

However, indirect effects were also found to be signiï¬cant. Irrigation demands were found to increase by up to 90 % for the SRES A2 scenario. Although groundwater levels generally increased with increasing mean precipitation, the water content of the root zone was found to decrease during summer in response to decreasing summer precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration. Changes in land cover from grass to forest and changes in growing season length resulted in minor effects on groundwater recharge. More signiï¬cant effects were found when assuming that plant respiration became more water efï¬cient with increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. A simple approach was used where future potential evapotranspiration (PET) was assumed to equal present PET and not to increase in response to the projected rise in future temperature. The resulting reduction in actual evapotranspiration was found to have a relatively large impact on groundwater recharge, groundwater levels and stream discharge. Sea level rise of 0.5 and 1.0 m was shown to have a pronounced effect on groundwater levels in coastal areas, where groundwater was affected up to 10 km inland from the coast. van Roosmalen et al. (2011) studied the impact of the bias correction method on the response of a hydrological model. The delta change method (Chap. 10, Sect. 10.3.1.2), where the observed database of meteorological variables are perturbed according to the changes projected by the climate model, was compared to a distribution-based scaling (Chap. 10, Sect. 10. 3.1.1; Piani et al. 2010), where the projected meteorological variables are corrected. In contrast to the delta change method, the distribution-based scaling method reproduced the dynamics of the climate model, for example prolonged periods of drought and possible changes in the number of days with precipitation. Comparing the hydrological simulations using both methods, only small differences in the hydrological variables were found. Only average quantities were analysed, however, such as annual groundwater recharge, mean change in groundwater level or mean monthly river discharge. The authors recommended that additional analyses are needed, addressing extremes and sensitivity to catchment characteristics, such as sandy versus clay catchments."
376,817,0.985,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Box 15.2: Collaborative Management as a Means to Minimize Climate Risk: Mongolian Plateau, China Inner Mongolian rangelands can be environmentally challenging for people and the primary industry of raising livestock. The climate of Inner Mongolia is cold; average annual temperatures vary between 1 and 2.5 Â°C. Precipitation is low and erratic with the majority occurring during three summer months. Winter storms can be harsh and frequent drought is associated with wind erosion. The culture had adapted to this harsh climate using strategies based on three core components: mobility, cooperation, and reciprocity (Dalintai et al. 2012). These strategies helped to sustain the resilience of this tightly connected socioecological system. For drought, these strategies included otor and surug. In otor, herds, through kinship relations, were moved to better grasslands in response to drought conditions; surug was a system in which herder leased a core number of their young female animals to herders in areas not as affected by drought. When the conditions in the original herdersâ area improved, they took back their livestockâthis short-term leasing provided a way to maintain the core of their herd by matching forage production with animal demand. The social setting in this area of China has seen a continual change since the 1950s with collectivization between 1950s and mid-1980s and then market reforms in the early 1980s. These changes affected many of the tight connections in the socio-ecological system. Collectivization strengthened production but weakened the mobility component by encouraging seminomadism. Market-oriented reforms emphasized rights of ownership by individual households, attempting to incentivize herders to use their grasslands rationally and sustainably. However, these changes eroded the strategies to adapt to the harsh climate. Mobility of herders was limited; consequently grasslands were overgrazed. Further, government structures assumed the role of providing services, weakening the kinship-based social structure of cooperation and exchange. At the start of the twenty-first century, a top-down effort by the government was initiated to address the degradation of grasslands. Grazing management strategies included restrictions on where and when grazing could occur, thus making it difficult for herders to migrate herds. Grass planting occurred and the government instituted a supplemental feed program. Herders were also moved away from the grasslands. These changes exacerbated the herdersâ poverty. However, degradation continued; Dalintai et al. (2012) suggest that the policy aimed at protecting the grasslands and improving herderâs living standards proved ineffective because these most recent changes were implemented in a top-down manner. Essentially, over all of these social and economic changes, the vulnerability of the socio-ecological system to drought and winter storms increased. A project was implemented to address issues of poverty and environmental degradation and to help preserve the traditional culture in the Sonid Left Banner area of Inner Mongolia, located on the south-eastern part of the (continued)"

According to one Edinburgh toxicologist: âThe first resuscitation centre dedicated to poisoned patientsâ opened in Copenhagen in 1949. In England, the North-East Metropolitan Regional Barbiturate Unit was set up in Romford in the 1950s.25 Comments made in the late 1950s by the head of the Romford unit indicate that certain forms of poisoning have affinity (in the eyes of some clinicians) with suicidal gestures: âbarbiturate poisoning is notorious in that it is not a particularly lethal variety of poisoning[;] [it] is important because of its frequency and not because it is highly lethalâ.26 He does not comment further on the consequences of toxicological assessments of lethality for psychological assessments of intent. However, Stengel and Cook make a connection with poisoning in general, arguing that â[c]learly, the degree of danger to life is not a reliable measure of seriousness of intent, especially with poisoning, i.e. in the majority of suicidal actsâ.27 Thus, ambiguity of method is transposed onto ambiguity of intent, giving this method increased visibility. However, there is nothing inherently ambiguous about this method; such a claim falls into technological determinism. The explicit, conscious nature of the appeal in Kesselâs self-poisoning overrides any ambiguity"
376,878,0.985,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","ing that key areas can be selected to be truly representative of the conditions in an area, a set of key areas will underestimate the variance of any indicator because they are a sample of only the average conditions in the area. As a result, confidence intervals will underestimate the uncertainty in the indicator estimates, and statistical tests will tend to show significant differences more than is warranted (i.e., inflated Type I errors). Finally, key areas are often representative of a single land use. Because the spatial distribution of different land uses and resource concerns vary across a landscape, a set of key areas selected for monitoring livestock impacts may not be representative for other objectives. Additionally, the ability of a key area to represent the land condition also may change over time as conditions within a landscape change (e.g., new roads are created or range improvements installed). A statistically valid sample of a resource has several properties (Thompson 2002; Lohr 2009). First, the estimates of an indicator for that resource are unbiased. Unbiased in this context means that there is nothing inherent in the sampling design approach that would result in systematically over- or underestimating the indicator values. This is accomplished through explicit and careful definition of the study area (i.e., population) and sampling units (Table 16.3). The use of randomization techniques in selecting sampling units for monitoring allows the uncertainty about indicator estimates to be characterized and confidence intervals to be constructed around monitoring results. Uncertainty estimates (often expressed as a standard error or confidence interval, or used as part of a statistical test) are not direct measures of the variability of an indicator, but a reflection of how close an indicator estimate is to the actual indicator value in the study area."
375,70,0.985,Musical Haptics,"also very present in mucoscal membranes. In the glabrous skin, they have up to 50 terminations for a single main axon [30]. The physiology of Merkel cells is not well understood [54]. They would participate in mechanotransduction together with the afferent terminals to provide these with a unique firing pattern. In any case, Merkel complexes are associated with slowly adaptive responses, but their functional significance is still obscure since some studies show that they can provide a Paciniantype synchronised response up to 1500 Hz [27]. The Ruffini corpuscle, which we already encountered while commenting on joint capsules, has the propensity to associate itself with connective tissues. Recently, it has been suggested that its role in skin-mediated touch is minor, if not inexistent, since glabrous skin seems to contain very few of them [58]. This finding was indirectly supported by a recent study implicating the Ruffini corpuscle not in mechanical stimulation due to direct contact with the skin, but rather in the connective tissues around the nail [5]. Generally speaking, the Ruffini corpuscle is very hard to identify and direct observations are rare, even in glabrous skin [12, 31]. Finally the so-called C fibres, without any apparent structure, innervate not only the skin, but also all the organs in the body and are associated with pain, irritation and also tickling. These non-myelinated, slow fibres (about 1 m/s) are also implicated in conscious and unconscious touch [76]. It is however doubtful that the information that they provide participates in the conscious perception of objects and surfaces (shape, size, or weight for instance). This properties invite the conclusion that the information of the slow fibres participates in affective touch and to the development of conscious self-awareness [56]. From this brief description of the peripheral equipment, we can now consider the receptors that are susceptible to play a role in the perception of external mechanical loading. As far as the Ruffini corpuscles are concerned, several studies have shown that the joints, and hence the receptor located there, provide proprioceptive information, that is estimation of the mechanical state of the body (relative limb position, speed, loading). It is also possible that they are implicated in the perception of the deformation of deep tissues which occurs when manipulating a heavy object. It might be surprising, but the central nervous system becomes aware of limb movements not only by the musculoskeletal system and the joints, but also by the skin and subcutaneous tissues [22]. It is clear that the receptors that innerve the muscles also have a contribution to make, since at the very least the nervous system must either control velocity to zero, or else estimate it during oscillatory movements. Muscles must transmit an effort able to oppose the effects of both gravity and acceleration in the inertial frame. Certainly, Golgi organsâwhich are located precisely on the load pathâwould provide information, but only if the load to be gauged is significantly larger than that of the moving limb. Lastly, the gauged object in contact with the hand would deform the skin. From this deformation, hundreds of mechanoreceptors would discharge, some transitorily when contact is made, some in a persisting fashion. At this point, it should be clear that the experience of the properties of an object, such as its lack of mobility, is really a âperceptual outcomeâ arising from complex processing in the nervous system and relying on many different cues, none of which"
252,27,0.985,The Ethics of Vaccination,"vaccination. The naturalness bias is âthe tendency to prefer natural products or substances even when they are identical to or worse than synthetic alternativesâ (Di Bonaventura and Chapman 2008, p. 2). Now, strictly speaking, it is not correct to consider the vaccines routinely offered or mandated as âsyntheticâ, because these vaccines contain the very same pathogens that cause diseases and because authentically âsyntheticâ vaccines obtained using a variety of molecular antigens only constitute a subgroup of vaccines that have more recently been developed (Jones 2015). However, we can still say that, in the case of vaccination, naturalness bias manifests itself in the tendency to see natural remedies or even the natural germs themselves (i.e., germs that naturally infect people) as preferable to vaccines, which consist of the same germs (either live or inactivated) but are produced in âsyntheticâ laboratory conditions. DiBonaventura and Chapman showed that naturalness bias, as revealed by peopleâs preference for a herbal drug over a chemically identical synthetic drug, was negatively correlated with participantsâ intention to obtain a flu vaccine. In the same way, they showed that omission bias, as revealed by parentsâ refusal of vaccines carrying a risk of iatrogenic disease lower than the risks entailed by the possibility of catching the disease without vaccination, was negatively correlated with the intention to vaccinate. One study found that â[t]he association between non-vaccination and omission bias is not peculiar to those with more or less education, although the more educated respondents (â¦) were more likely to resist vaccinationâ (Asch et al. 1994, p. 121). While it is true that correlation (between biases and vaccination decisions) is not the same as causation, it is reasonable to suppose that these biases do play a role in determining vaccination decisions and that therefore such decisions are not rational or based on knowledge about vaccines. This seems to be confirmed, at least with regard to omission bias, by another study that analysed omission bias in vaccination decisions by observing how it affects parentsâ sense of responsibility for the health outcomes of their children. The study (Ritov and Baron 1990) found that many parents would feel more responsible for the hypothetical death of their child if the death were caused by a vaccine they decided to administer to the child than if the childâs death were caused by the very disease against which they decided not to vaccinate. The fact that the same outcome, resulting in both cases from their decision, is associated with a different sense of responsibility depending on whether it is the result of an action or an omission seems to suggest that there is an omission bias at play here. In the qualitative part of the study, a subject said: âI feel that if I vaccinated"

Though all of the problems listed can be attributed to some degree to any family, the definition uses strong blaming language to portray these problems as arising from migration, and migrant families as inherently flawed. Actual research into the effect of migration on various aspects of migrantsâ childrenâs lives calls into question both results and ethical principles. Thus, according to a survey conducted in 2006 by La Strada Ukraine in several regions of Ukraine and discussed in greater detail in Molodikovaâs (2008) report, in Ternopol (one of the regional centers in the west of Ukraine) one in four school children (25.5%) had a parent abroad, and 4.2% had neither parent at home. The 103 children of labour migrants who were surveyed provide some data as to the length of separation: 36% of fathers and 30% of mothers worked abroad for up to 3 years, with 14% of fathers and 11% of mothers abroad for more than 5 years (quoted in Molodikova 2008: 25). The report suggests there are negative behavioural changes among children whose parents work abroad: children of migrants are reported to leave school, study badly and generally lack discipline. They become angry and aggressive, and make the wrong friends. Among other problems, Molodikova identifies drug abuse, prostitution and suicide. The author suggests âthe situation is especially dangerous when the mother migrates. It is also noticed that children brought up by fathers sometimes canât identify themselves [sic] and tend to homosexual relationshipsâ (Molodikova 2008: 25). Such conclusions, lumping together drug abuse, prostitution and homosexuality, speak of the demonization of migration and place the main responsibility for familiesâ well-being on womenâs shoulders. They lack both social and economic contextualization of the childrenâs background and comparison with the results of similar research conducted among the children of non-migrants in the same area. The lack of similar research in the Ukrainian context paves the way for harmful policy recommendations. Thus, Molodikova (2008) suggests an institution of state guardianship should be developed where care for migrantsâ children is provided by state, NGO and religious institutions but sponsored (conveniently so) by migrating parents: âIt is necessary also to promote sports, tourism and other activities. Taking into consideration the stateâs financial deficit, such events could be fee paid as migrantsâ children have enough money to pay for themselvesâ (2008:29). Similar conclusions and ideological connotations are found in research by some Ukrainian scholars. Levchenkoâs text (2006) on problems facing labour migrantsâ children attempts to explore the effect of parentsâ migration on childrenâs psychoemotional state and behaviour and seeks the roots of deviant behaviour in the children. Kluchkovska and Hlumnytskaâs (2010) edited volume, which uses the term âsocial and national orphansâ as a neutral, non-problematized term in the title of the collection, provides a selection of texts addressing a range of problems from the perspectives of psychologists, teachers, policy makers and civil servants, making a number of policy recommendations as to how to reduce the negative effects of migration on migrants and their families.

Until recently, surprisingly little work had quantified the impact of bat predation on insect biomass (Maas et al. 2015). Exclosure studies have long been a mainstay for studying the impacts of bird predation; however, it was widely assumed that such methods would not be suitable to measure the impact of bat insectivory, due to the misconception that all insect eating bats take highly mobile, flying prey. However, bats capable of gleaning insect prey from substrates exist throughout the world, and their impacts could be monitored via exclosure studies and disentangled from those of birds. This approach has been used fruitfully in the past five years, demonstrating significant increases in arthropod density when bats are absent, in agroecosystems (Williams-GuillÃ©n et al. 2008; Maas et al. 2013), reforestation (Morrison and Lindell 2012), and natural forests (Kalka et al. 2008). In Mexican polycultural shade coffee, arthropod densities on coffee plants during the rainy season nearly doubled in the absence of bats, with marked increases in densities of hoppers, katydids, cockroaches, and beetles (Williams-GuillÃ©n et al. 2008). However, no effects on plant damage were observed in that study, perhaps as a result of the short duration of the study or release of spiders and other arthropod predators. In Indonesian shade cacao, excluding bats resulted in a 29 % increase in arthropod numbers (Maas et al. 2013). Although herbivory did not differ significantly between cacao plantations with different levels of shade or proximities to primary habitats within the landscape, exclosure of bats resulted in a significant decrease in yields, with the effects of bird and bat predation together valued at an astonishing US $730 per ha and year (bat predation was valued at US $520 per ha and year). However, the effects of bat predation on crop pests are not universal: An exclosure study in Costa Rican coffee found that excluding bats alone had virtually no effect on the density or damage caused to beans by the devastating coffee berry borer (Karp et al. 2013). Exclosure studies are not suitable to measure the impact of high-flying insectivores, such as molossids. However, careful extrapolations taking into account bat feeding rates, population sizes, pest reproduction, and survivorship, and the costs of inputs allow for estimation of the economic impact of predation for other bats, particularly molossids forming large colonies. Cleveland et al. (2006) estimate that Mexican free-tailed bats (T. brasiliensis) feeding on the cotton bollworm moth in Texas provide pest limitation services worth roughly US $183 per ha and year to cotton growers. Extending these estimates to agricultural areas throughout the USA suggests that bat predation could have a value of nearly US $23 billion annually (Boyles et al. 2011). These benefits hold for both conventional and transgenic cotton (Federico et al. 2008), although the introduction of Bt cotton (a genetically modified organism whose tissues produce an insecticide derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis), coupled with reduced area in cotton cultivation, has led to a decline in the overall value of this pest limitation service (Lopez-Hoffman et al. 2014)."
222,122,0.985,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"In the period of this research, the SDGs have been developed and adopted globally as development targets for 2030 (UN 2015). They comprise a set of 17 âGlobal Goalsâ with 169 targets between them and are encouraging global activity on how to achieve and how to measure these achievements (Szabo et al. 2016), including in Bangladesh. The SDGs have essential and ambitious targets that are important today. This is reflected in the short timescale aiming to achieve most of these goals by 2030. However, 2030 is too close to experience significant climate and environmental changes, and therefore, the long-term needs for adaptation are not explicitly embedded in the SDGs. While not designed explicitly to support the SDGs, the approaches described in this book have great potential in this regard. In particular they can provide interdisciplinary insights on several SDGs and consider both short-term and long-term trends and their context. This was discussed and supported in a two-day meeting presenting the results in this book, held at the Royal Society, London in November 2016. These approaches already provide a wide range of indicators across the societal and environmental domains, which may be more suitable than many simple measured indicators used previously. Trends in river flows, sediment fluxes and coastal salinity are three relevant trends discussed in this book that relate to various SDGs, and especially SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation). Furthermore, the methods are flexible and can be developed and targeted as required."
321,30,0.985,Beyond the Limits to Growth : New Ideas for Sustainability from Japan,"Let us for instance consider medical care. In general, it is believed that if oneâs cholesterol level is high, the probability of a cerebral hemorrhage occurring is elevated, but this conclusion was derived based on data pertaining to Westerners. So long as the investigation is restricted to Westerners, indeed a connection can be inferred between high cholesterol levels and the incidence of the disease. On the other hand, what is the situation for the case of the Japanese? Compared to Westerners, cholesterol levels overall are low, and there is not much correlation with incidence of cerebral hemorrhage. For Japanese, it is said that what is important is not whether the cholesterol level is high or low, but changes in the level. If levels begin to rise, caution is warranted. As can be understood from this example, in Japan the development of medical treatment based on data not only for Westerners, but for Japanese, is necessary. In the field of gene therapy, it is becoming clear from recent research that the gene arrangement of Japanese is closer to Chinese and Koreans than to Westerners. In this way, there is a context for data analyzed in Japan or for treatments developed in Japan to be readily accepted in the Asian region. The same may be said not only for medical treatment but for housing as well. If one is to attempt to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from households, it is necessary to build homes with high energy efficiency. In doing so, if we consider the climate in which the homes are located, compared to cool, dry Europe and North America, Japanâwith its hot, humid summers and dry wintersâis fundamentally more similar to other Asian regions. In particular, because Japan stretches in a long northâsouth arc from Hokkaido to Okinawa and moreover mountain ranges run through the center of the archipelago, although at the same longitude Japanâs area encompasses diverse climates. For just about anywhere in Asia, there is a place in Japan with a similar climate. Thus, if housing construction and town planning in each of Japanâs regions is carried out in a manner befitting the local climate, the knowledge and technology created in the process can easily be introduced into other Asian countries. For these and similar reasons, Japanâs being located in Asia may be said to be a stroke of good luck."

This also requires reforestation and other restoration efforts. Argentina faces great challenges ahead regarding the protection of wetlands, addressing the ecological imbalance caused by wetland degradation through LUCC, especially urbanization and waste-disposal of coastal cities. The case studies also revealed the potential of promising strategies that could achieve sustainable land management. Sheep production in Patagonia is experiencing land degradation but the rotational grazing system designed by INTA (TME) has been shown to be sustainable but its adoption rate is low. Increasing its adoption would require concerted efforts to provide extension services, incentives, and support that could help ranchers to overcome the high upfront costs. The incentives and material support could be justiï¬ed by the ecosystem beneï¬ts that result from rangeland management. The case studies in La Paz, and La Rioja also reveal that diversiï¬ed crop-livestock systems are more sustainable and proï¬table and reduce production risks than specialized production systems. In the case of the SW Buenos Aires Province however, specialized pasture management does offer more sustainable and proï¬table production systems crop production. But farmers practice mixed systems as a strategy to contend with production and market risks. Conservation agriculture also need to extend beyond the soybean production. This is especially important in dry areas affected by wind erosion. For example the study in Buenos Aires showed that 30 % of vegetation cover reduces wind erosion by 80 %. This will simultaneously increase agricultural productivity and reduce dust storms in cities and other heavily populated areas. Argentina has laid out elaborate land use planning strategies, land degradation and improvement monitoring that informs policy formulation. This was a result of political efforts which were strongly backed by FAOâs land degradation assessment (LADA) that was completed in 6 different countries. The countries could learn from Argentinaâs groundbreaking initiative of establishing an elaborate monitoring and evaluation of land degradation and improvement. It is therefore that Argentina started to share its knowledge in this ï¬eld through its Technical Cooperation Facility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ((FOAR), through which LADA experts of the Secretary of Environment and Sustainable Development gave training to institutions and farmers in other Latin-American countries. The world has a lot to learn from Argentina given its rapid poverty reduction and successful adoption rate of CA using public-private partnership. For Argentina to maintain its economic and social development, it will need to work harder to address its growth-related environmental challenges that affect the poor the most. Argentina of today is much better prepared to face these challenges and take advantage of the emerging opportunities.

99,115,0.985,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Despite ambitions to simultaneously reinvent the welfare regime and the local economy, lingering social problems remain, however, and new social tensions have arisen in the wake of the social and economic transformations. MalmÃ¶ has for several decades struggled with severe social problems, such as high unemployment, high costs of social benefits, and growing segregation (Nordfeldt and Segnestam Larsson 2012). The level of employment is lower in MalmÃ¶ than on average in Sweden, and there are significant differences between people born in Sweden and outside of Sweden, leading to a higher degree of social exclusion and growing differences in living conditions among social groups (Stigendal and Ãstergren 2013). To these recurrent social problems, a list of growing problems could be added. Income inequalities have indeed increased in Sweden overall, but since the year 2000 income inequalities have grown more in MalmÃ¶ than average in Sweden. The dynamic, demographic character of the city has also resulted in a higher degree of illegal immigrants and inhabitants outside of the workforce and the welfare system than in other Swedish cities (Salonen 2012). In interviews with politicians and civil servants in the city council, a set of social problems were highlighted, including unemployment and segregation (Segnestam Larsson and Carrigan 2013). According to interviewed representatives, poverty is affecting peopleâs health, life expectancy, and could be considered a matter of life and death (e.g. interviews 5 and 6). Child poverty is also part of the discourse on local welfare and the proposed main problems. Another major problem in the city of MalmÃ¶ is believed to be unemployment, in general, and youth unemployment, in particular (e.g. interviews 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16). We have had an enormous arrival of people to MalmÃ¶ from other parts of Sweden and we have not been able to catch up. That is simply the case. We have not been able to catch up with this influx of people and we have not been able to identify job opportunities to the degree that would have been needed (Interview 13)."

This path dependency and the resulting inertia of science and policymaking can also be seen in the chemicals case, where the traditional primacy of risk-based approaches (e.g. the âTDG machineâ) is strong. This phenomenon cannot be observed to an equal degree either in the case of eutrophication, where the NEST-HELCOM model offered a comparatively new approach of science-policy interaction, or in the emerging domain of IAS, where an institutionalised form of assessment-management interaction is not yet in place. Furthermore, well-developed institutional structures as they presently exist for EU fisheries management also seem to allow for the establishment of improved deliberative processes, which at least potentially could result in improved analysis of the socio-economic dimensions of the respective domain of marine governance (cf. Linke and Jentoft 2014; Urquhart et al. 2014). However, apart from an incremental âopening upâ of the linear science-policy structures in fisheries, we cannot find such tendencies developed to a similar extent for eutrophication, IAS, chemicals or oil transportation. In the cases of eutrophication, IAS and chemicals, it may also be substantially harder to identify clear groups of actors definable as âlegitimate stakeholdersâ to be included in the policy system than when one particular group of actors, for example, âresource usersâ (fishermen) or oil transporters (shipowners), can be defined as such and often accused of causing problems e.g. by the media. A rather clear identification of legitimate stakeholders, as we see in fisheries management, is not apparent in the cases of eutrophication (where farming only represents one of several important nutrient sources), chemicals (with a complex web of chemical producing and using actors), IAS or oil transportation. Regarding uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements, the observed assessmentmanagement interactions do not seem to adequately address the key challenges posed by the different states of knowledge as described in Fig. 8.2 and the sociopolitical ambiguities involved. With regard to management responses dealing with different forms of uncertainty and stakeholder conflicts, thorough analyses of the specific risk characteristics are not apparent, i.e. of the social and natural knowledge requirements or of the suitability of different management strategies such as a traditional science-based assessment, a precautionary approach, deliberative methods for stakeholder participation or extended peer review, etc. (see Sect. 8.2 and Fig. 8.2). Instead, all the studied assessment-management interactions can be classified as building primarily on traditional science-based assessments, which are then applied to policy- and decision-making (Table 8.1). We see, however, a number of ongoing changes and developments in each of the cases that illustrate adaptive responses to the key management challenges studied here. For example, we detect advancing processes of deliberation and stakeholder inclusion in both the science and management sector in the fisheries case, as an attempt to deal with the principal challenges posed by uncertainty in assessments and management, as well as to address conflicts of interests among the key actors. Concerning eutrophication, we can see similar challenges emerging (i.e. stakeholder"

There are two alternative ways of setting the guarantee level: a percentage (normally around 70 percent) either of a regional average yield or of an individual production history at the insuredâs location. The period under consideration should be five to ten years. In order to avoid anti-selection all plots cultivated with the same crop have to be insured.

In the following, we will address the key characteristics, as well as local adaptions, of the Nordic Barnahus models. Table 1.1 gives an overview of the key characteristics of the national Barnahus models in Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark, based on the more detailed country model descriptions in the appendix of this book (which also include descriptions of the models in Finland and the autonomous Nordic regions). The main arguments for only including Iceland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark in the table are that they are the Nordic countries where Barnahus is most widespread and/or where most evaluations and research have been undertaken so far, so that the data available are robust and thus comparable. To some extent, however, all Nordic countries and regions will be part of the comparative discussion. There are, of course, challenges when including comparable elements in a table like this one (Table 1.1). First, there are often discrepancies in data regarding how the Barnahus model on an ideological level is defined in the respective countries and how it functions in practice. For example, the target group could be defined more broadly in policy documents or regulations, while in practice reaching a more limited group of children, or vice versa. Secondly, there are difficulties in finding comparable data, resulting in various sources being used to describe the models in the different countries, even though we have tried to use additional sources in order to make the information as comparable as possible, as well as primarily focused on the four country models with most available data sources. Third, there are difficulties connected to the constant change that the collaborative Barnahus model is undergoing in respective countries, as well as local variations in implementation within countries (which applies more to some countries than others). Despite these difficulties, we have identified significant similarities and differences between the Nordic Barnahus models on an overarching level, which will be discussed in the following."
77,274,0.985,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Incomplete Data Virtually every longitudinal study faces the reality of not having all assessments at all time points on all participants. For instance, in the illustration above, by the end of the study 50.4% of the initial participants were no longer in the study. Modern methods allow obtaining unbiased estimates despite the incompleteness of the outcome data Y. Under specific conditions (see Rubin 1976), any variable X that may be related to the reasons of data incompleteness in Y is called informative or auxiliary. For instance, older and less healthy participants are more likely to drop out of a longitudinal study than younger and healthier participants. Thus, age and health are informative X variables that are related to the probability of not providing outcome Y values. Informative variables can be added to a longitudinal model to decrease estimation bias. This is why it is of chief importance to measure as many potentially informative X variables as possible at the first wave of a longitudinal study, when attrition (i.e., incomplete data in Y) has not yet occurred. This information may be used in subsequent waves to lessen estimation bias (for more detail, see Graham 2009, and Schafer and Graham 2002). In the previous illustration, satisfaction with personal relationships was related to the probability of dropping out, so that its inclusion in the model does not only address an interesting substantive issue but also reduces overall estimation bias. In some situations it is desirable to have incomplete data, mainly to avoid other, more deleterious effects. For instance, to understand the interrelationships among a very big set of variables, it is not necessary to administer all variables to all participants. Doing so could introduce major fatigue and demotivation effects, which are likely to lower the validity and reliability of the assessments. Rather, it is possible to randomly create subgroups of participants, each of which is administered a reduced set of variables. What matters is that the subsets of variables overlap across the participants, so that all interrelationships among the variables can be estimated. If carefully planned, then, the administration time and participantsâ burden can be reduced dramatically, without increase in parameter bias nor the need for informative variables (McArdle 1994). In longitudinal research this feature may be of crucial importance. Researchers interested in wide segments of the life course (say, young adulthood, from age"

This price can be influenced by the water resources managers and used as a control variable. When the cost of water use represents only a small portion of the total cost of an activity, however, an increase in its price may have little if any impact on water use. In some cases water use is a necessity of life no matter how high the costs. In such cases, the price of water (or taxation for waste water discharges) may not be an acceptable control variable (except perhaps to inform stakeholders on the consequences of possible cost reduction measures)."
55,171,0.985,Fungal Disease in Britain and the United States 1850â2000,"Our aim in writing this book, apart from presenting the first history of fungal diseases, was also to contribute to the historiography of medicine. In this conclusion, rather than restate and revisit our histories of particular mycoses, we focus on crosscutting themes concerning the history of infectious diseases, the limits of the medical gaze, the history of medical specialisation and biographies of disease. Our narrative has shown the value of approaching the history of infection in the twentieth century in terms of âseed and soilâ. Our reading of the medical record has been against the grain of the common focus on the âseedsâ â the specific causative organisms â of disease. It is no surprise that doctorsâ histories of infections are in this genre, after all the major trend in medicine in our period has been to define diseases in terms of their causes (aetiology), and from the middle of the century, to treat disease by targeting those specific causes with drugs, surgery or other technologies. The history of pulmonary tuberculosis exemplifies this trajectory. First, its medical name changed from phthisis (wasting) or consumption, a symptomatic definition, to TB.1 The latter conflated pathology (âTuberculosisâ) and aetiology (Tubercle bacillus), and approaching the disease in terms of its âseedsâ was reinforced after 1950, when antibiotics arrived as the long sought after âmagic bulletsâ that selectively killed the T. bacillus in the body. Doctorsâ histories of TB tended to write off pre-1950s treatments as âunscientificâ and ineffective, as they had focused on making the human âsoilâ unsuitable for the T. bacillus, either by strengthening the body through the sanatorium regime, or removing the nidus of infection by surgery. Historians of medicine have been less judgmental and, in recovering the thinking and practices of the pre-antibiotic era, have shown the contingent nature of assessments of scientificity and efficacy, and suggested that"
19,165,0.985,Perspectives on Nuclear Medicine for Molecular Diagnosis and Integrated Therapy,"A major challenge in clinical PET radiochemistry is that there are a greater number of hospitals or PET clinics than there are PET radiotracer production facilities. Furthermore, the demand for new clinical PET radiotracers is low due to the cost of production in a centralized location. New PET radiotracers are overwhelmingly used for research purposes only. To overcome this obstacle, a decentralized approach has been envisaged [1]. Here, scientists could produce their radiotracer of interest in-house, economically and on demand, leading to a concept that we have defined as Dose On Demand (DOD). This short review will cover the important aspects of DOD and detail the journey toward the DOD of short-lived radiopharmaceuticals."
133,223,0.985,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Conclusions This research provides insights on the extent and the ways in which contextual factors shape subjective health. Within this general aim, we document three more speciï¬c results: (1) the geographical effect on health, examined by means of a multilevel approach, is dramatically resized compared to previous studies of the Italian case which used an ecological perspective; (2) household appears as a key-element in influencing the perceived health of individuals, with a clear gradient from physical to mental component; (3) the mechanism of the household effect on perceived health can reasonably rely on the reciprocal influences between family members. When poor health enters into the family, even if solidarity is activated to cope with the need of the family member in poor health, cohabitation and emotional ties seem to act as a multiplier of poor health conditions, negatively altering the perceived health status of all family members. Health policies, traditionally targeted at single individuals, probably have positive effects that go far beyond the single recipient of the intervention. In fact, maintaining an individual in good health (and in good health perception) means that all of his/her family is protected from the process of health deterioration that could occur as a consequence of mutual influences on health. In this perspective, current evaluations of the beneï¬ts of social/"
376,460,0.985,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The SES framework was used to understand factors that impeded the use of herbaceous broad-leaved plants, or forbs, in restoration of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invaded Great Basin sagebrush steppe ecosystems of the western USA. Most of these ecosystems are managed by federal agencies, in particular the Bureau of Land Management. Forbs are an important component of biodiversity in these ecosystems (West 1993) and increasing native forb species richness can enhance resistance to invasive plants (Pokorny et al. 2005) including cheatgrass. By providing fine-textured, combustible fuels, cheatgrass increases susceptibility to wildfires, and wildfires have been growing in frequency and severity across the Great Basin (Brooks et al. 2004), a trend that is expected to continue as a result of climate change (Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011). Yet when rangeland managers choose seed mixes for restoring native plant communities after a wildfire, forbs are often underutilized. While reduced forb abundance after wildfires is a local- to regional-scale ecological issue, applying an SES framework revealed that it stems partly from higher level processes that affect agency budget choices, as well as individual variation in how managers perceive and interpret scientific information about rangelands and climate change. The SES framework accounts for factors, relationships, and feedbacks among scales that influence the relationship between forb restoration, climate change, invasive plants, and manager decision making. An SES-based analysis of key drivers of manager decision making helped to understand the limitations to the adaptive capacity of managers. Land managers may know which plant species to reseed after wildfire to suit past conditions, but predictions of future climate in these regions suggest more variable and extreme weather events, longer droughts, and increasing summer high temperatures (Ackerly et al. 2010; Polley et al. 2013). Part of this study was to evaluate the effect of summer warming on forbs to test the assumption that forb species choices for postfire rangeland seedings might need to be adapted to suit"
46,87,0.985,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"a result, the poverty threshold for a single person living in Austria, for instance, has increased over the years from an annual income of â¬10,200 in 2005 to â¬12,791 in 2011; for a household with two adults and two children under fourteen, the poverty threshold was an annual income of â¬22,681 in 2005 and â¬26,861 in 2011. In Greece, on the other hand, where the average income has decreased due to the economic crisis, the poverty line has decreased from an annual income of â¬7,178 in 2010 to â¬5,708 in 2012. If a household disposes of less income than that, all of its members are described as âat risk of povertyâ. These poverty thresholds are also relative in another sense; since they are national poverty thresholds benchmarked against the median income in a specific country, the at-risk-of-poverty thresholds are very different in each member state of the European Union. Just to give a few examples, for 2011 the at-risk-of poverty threshold was as high as â¬12,186 annual income in the Netherlands, while in Greece it was â¬6,591, in Bulgaria only â¬1,749 and in Slovakia â¬3,784. This means that a person with â¬10,000 annual income living in Vienna (Austria) is counted as being at risk of poverty, but if this person moves a hundred kilometers to live in Slovakia, she is no longer counted as poor unless her disposable income has changed. Using such national poverty thresholds obviously has certain advantages, because they are sensitive to the different income levels and to that extent also reflect differences in the living costs in the member states of the European Union. These different poverty thresholds also show the existing inequality in these dimensions. On the other hand, the EU also measures poverty as material deprivation by referring to a list of goods and services that are deemed essential. The background idea for such a list was developed by Peter Townsend, who argued that poverty is an issue of being unable to do and have what is normal or standard in a society (Townsend 1979). He claimed, however, that poverty is always context-sensitive: there is no useful measure that applies to all contexts. Still, he also insisted that poverty is not only about survival and basic goods or capabilities and functionings but also about doing and having what a given society considers standard. Although Townsend asserted that he wanted to separate poverty and inequality, he ended up, as can be seen, connecting them more closely. As we will discuss, material deprivation is also close to concepts of social exclusion, whose wider focus tries to capture the important dimensions of what it means to be part of a particular society (Nolan and Whelan 2010). Individuals, families and groups in the population can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the type of"

As Shepherd noted, this often resulted in misleadingly low estimates because many emotionally disturbed patients presented with somatic complaints.33 A study by John Fry, an early pioneer of research in general practice, for example, found that during the late 1960s, prevalence rates (per thousand) for neurosis among his patients were 238 for men and 528 for women. His conclusion was that the pattern of distribution showed âa marked preponderance of female patientsâ and that this conformed broadly with earlier reported figures from the same practice.34 Notable in the method and design of his study, however, was the fact that the diagnostic category of neurosis âdid not cover psychosomatic conditions or physical illnesses with a neurotic complaintâ.35 In contrast, research undertaken at another âaverageâ suburban practice by R. E. Perth found that 39.4 per cent of patients had suffered at least once during five years from some kind of psychosomatic complaint and that âhalf the work done during surgery hours was taken up by [these] conditionsâ.36 Women, of course, appeared regularly in numbers diagnosed with a wide range of psychosomatic disorders, including headaches, skin disorders and chest pains; however, men predominated in diagnoses of peptic ulcer and epigastric pain â conditions that, according to Perth, were often of psychogenic origin because symptoms disappeared or improved with psychological treatment.37 The lack of clarity surrounding the epidemiology and nosology of psychological illness was further compounded by the lack of a reliable screening tool to aid practitioners in making assessments about the mental health of their patients. Until the mid-1970s, the screening tool most often used in research was the Cornell Medical Index (CMI). Originating from Cornell University College, New York in 1949, its purpose was to provide âan instrument suitable for collecting a large body of pertinent medical and psychiatric data at a minimum of the physicianâs timeâ.38 The index contained a total of 195 questions relating to bodily symptoms, past illnesses, family history, behaviour, mood and feeling. Although the index was widely used in general practice research, by the 1970s practitioners had begun to suggest that the questionary scores and practitionersâ assessments did not correlate with sufficient accuracy. Indeed, Shepherd noted in 1966 that much of the variation between general practice studies could be accounted for by âobserver factorsâ.39 A study of psychiatric outpatients also showed that, when rated with the CMI, many patients would have been âmissedâ because their scores fell within the normal"
2,206,0.985,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"Welfare Providers from Different SectorsâA Comparison Based on the results of the empirical investigation, it is evident that the welfare mix of different providers within the ï¬eld of elderly care has not resulted in greater variety in the content of care. Whether nursing homes are run by public, nonproï¬t or for-proï¬t organisations, the services they provide are generally the same. This conclusion can be drawn based on interviews with site managers about the content of care and the existence of distinct proï¬les for their operations. The empirical ï¬ndings are also supported by the fact that surveys and interviews with relatives and nursing home residents do not point to any major differences among types of nursing homes. However, several minor differences can be noted; for example, a religious proï¬le or the existence of specially trained staff to care for residents suffering from dementia. Nevertheless, differences like these do not seem to have any major impact on the types of services provided. In all three countries, similarities cannot be explained in any signiï¬cant way by regulation through national law. For instance, in Sweden,the national law creates a framework that gives the municipalities a great deal of power to make decisions on their own. Following a Scandinavian"

Random effect models provide an unconditional inference of a larger set of studies from which only a few are included in the meta-analysis and assumed to be a random sample (Viechtbauer 2010). We compared both models based on the reported effect size and assessed the proportion of heterogeneity of bat responses between high and intermediate urban development (Ï2 highly urban- Ï2 small urban/Ï2 highly urban). In a second approach, we pooled data from high and intermediate urbanisation categories to investigate if the potential of bats to adjust to urban environments is determined by phylogeny or rather functional ecology using a mixed model metaanalysis. For this analysis we classified bats according to their taxonomic family and genus, their predominant food item (fruits, nectar and insects), foraging mode (aerial, gleaning) and foraging space (narrow, edge and open, following Schnitzler and Kalko (2001)) and included these classifications as moderators in our mixed model meta-analysis. We further investigated in detail how each of the categorical moderators influences effect size. Further, focusing on aerial insectivores, the majority of study cases in our dataset, we then investigated if moderators influencing the adaptability to urban areas are consistent between North and South America versus Europe, Asia and Australia. P-levels for all models were assessed using a permutation test with 1000 randomizations. In none of our models did the funnel plot technique (Viechtbauer 2013) reveal any significant publication bias or asymmetry in our dataset (function: regtest, package metaphor)."
246,118,0.985,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Large mammals are often regarded as flagship species of wild areas and the paradigm of wilderness untouched by, or at least relatively separated from, human activities (Ray et al. 2005). This is especially true for large carnivores. This view largely stems from the historic processes of direct human persecution and indirect habitat change that gradually reduced their presence in human-dominated landscapes such that they only persisted in the residual areas with little or no human activity. As a consequence, the view of large carnivores as beasts of the wilderness became consolidated, particularly in North America (Boitani 1995). Since Europe is home to more than 500 million people and lacks extensive pristine, uninhabited land areas and large protected areas with spectacular aggregations of large mammals, it might appear to have little to offer for large carnivore conservation. However, nothing could be further from the truth. In the last few decades, changes in the socio-economic settings and peopleâs values concerning nature and biodiversity have paved the way for new opportunities for large carnivores. As the situation develops a new conservation paradigm is slowly emerging based on the premises of coexistence instead of exclusion. In this essay, we firstly describe the current status and trends of the large carnivores in Europe and examine the main causes of the recent increase in numbers and range. Second, we discuss the available opportunities to sustain the positive trends and the challenges in driving the process toward a new balance between carnivores and human activities. Thirdly, we use the insights coming from large carnivore conservation to offer our views on the social and ecological implications of managing the ârewildingâ of Europe. In Europe, five carnivore species have been traditionally considered as âlarge carnivoresâ, but in this essay we will focus on the three most important ones, the grey wolf ( Canis lupus), the bear ( Ursus arctos) and the Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx); the other two, the Iberian lynx ( Lynx pardina) and the wolverine ( Gulo gulo) are restricted to small areas, respectively in southern Iberia and northern Fennoscandia, and are associated with very specific management issues."
376,176,0.985,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Water supply as a provisioning service is essentially a product of the array of regulating services discussed above. The amount of âblue waterâ supplied by a given landscape, i.e., water flow to streams and aquifers, is fundamentally a function of climate, vegetation, soils, and geology. Of these factors, vegetation andâto a lesser extentâsoils are the most affected by rangeland management. The concept of managing vegetation for the purpose of augmenting water supply has a long, complicated, and rich history. In fact, one could argue that it is a fundamental tenet of the science and art of watershed management (Wilcox 2010). The last decade in particular has seen a considerable refinement of our understanding of the linkage between vegetation and water supply on rangelandsâespecially concerning the effects of removing woody plants and invasive riparian species (Huxman et al. 2005; Edwards and Roberts 2006; Shafroth et al. 2010a; Doody et al. 2011; Hultine and Bush 2011; van Wilgen et al. 2012). With respect to the USA, the issue has been reviewed in detail in Archer et al. (2011). In general, large-scale woody plant removal has not resulted in measurable increases in streamflows or groundwater recharge, although increases would have been anticipated given (1) the long experience of similar manipulations (various levels of clear-cutting) carried out in forest watersheds (Bosch and Hewlett 1982) and (2) experience with the reductions in water yield brought about by the reverse type of intervention, i.e., the establishment of tree plantations in areas that were originally treeless (Farley et al. 2005; Jobbagy et al. 2013). The only areas in which there may be a true potential for enhancing water supply through woody plant removal appears to be those having annual precipitation above 500 mm (Zhang et al. 2001) along with at least one of the following conditions: (1) predominantly winter precipitation or significant snow accumulation; (2) permeable (sandy) and deep soils; and (3) karst geology (Huxman et al. 2005). Surprisingly, the conventional wisdom has even been overturned in the case of riparian areas invaded by alien shrubs. Until recently it was widely accepted that removal or control of invasive riparian shrubs such as Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia) and saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima) would result in substantial water savings. A recent comprehensive review on the subject, however, concluded that there is in fact little evidence for large-scale water supply augmentation through these interventions (Shafroth et al. 2010a). The primary finding was that the invasive species do not appear to use more water than the native vegetation they displace (Doody et al. 2011; Hultine and Bush 2011). Finally, studies of groundwater recharge in the sandy deserts of Central Argentina have yielded some paradoxical results. Certain regions that are highly degraded from constant wind erosion and dune formation, with severe loss of both forage and sediment, have nevertheless seen an improvement in freshwater supply as recharge gives rise to high-quality groundwater lenses (JobbÃ¡gy et al. 2011). Except for this peculiar example of vegetation denudation proceeding in concert with gains in groundwater, the region is characterized by low-quality groundwater. In undisturbed areas it exhibits high total salt and/or arsenic content, while in disturbed areas with high animal concentrations it is less salty but polluted with nitrogen (Aranibar et al. 2011; Meglioli et al. 2014)."
170,164,0.985,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"Majority of the studyâs respondents from this same township perceived both the mobile and the airtime to be expensive (Duncan 2013). One unanswered question is whether the high costs of ICTs are trapping people in poverty as suggested by Duncan (2013). This affordability question needs further exploration as regards to poverty and ICT. As mentioned earlier, the IDI has been helpful in comparing ICT uptake through an index across countries; however, limitations are raised in trying to measure a subpopulation such as poor households. Barrantes (2007) attempts to further the study at a micro- or household level in calculating how many of the income poor were also failing to have ICTs in what she called âdigital povertyâ. Digital poverty is defined as âthe minimum ICT use and consumption levels, as well as income levels of the population necessary to demand ICT productsâ (Barrantes 2007: p. 33). In conceptualising digital poverty, the extreme digitally poor are households who are deficient of all forms of ICT connectivity and have little capability or mean to accept or deliver electronic messages or to participate actively (two-way interaction) with information. On the other hand, the digitally wealthy participate fully through electronic media both in receiving or sending information usually through the Internet (Barrantes 2007). All the various ICT access, ownership and usage indicators are combined together and are composed into the ICT household index. In an example of over 17,000 Peruvian households (in 2003), she identified 68 % of the sample to be extremely digitally poor households. She then identifies the poor as those without sufficient income to cover the basic food basket of Peru, and this subpopulation was made up 17.59 % of the selected sample. Those who were extremely poor were nearly all extremely digitally poor in 2003. While this is an older study, it is one of the few trying to determine a composite indexed definition of ICT deprivation in relation to income poverty. This early study was limited in household data around ICTs as each of the household members can have their own individual range of digital wealth or impoverishment. The main changes from 2003 were to remove household telecentre and computer usage and add more specific individual Internet usage such as whether someone was either ICT active or passive. Active Internet users are those defined as having the ability to have two-way interaction through the use of ICT transactions (Barrantes 2010). Thus, in this later study, the topology of digital poverty is updated to the following individual indicators in Table 3 (Barrantes 2010).

38,543,0.985,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"from individual population time series sourced from published and grey literature. The global database currently runs into thousands of such time series, and the index is calculated from a 1970 baseline to the current day. The global LPI, like many other metrics used to underpin indicators (Walpole et al. 2009) is not perfect. The data it is built upon are patchy both taxonomically and geographically, being particularly rich in data from bird populations and temperate regions (Collen et al. 2008, 2009), although the construction of the index attempts to offset these imbalances. Despite this, it has signiï¬cant strengths as an indicator in a number of ways. First, it taps into a vast resource of existing data, and so is cost effective. Population abundance, for vertebrates at least, is one of the most commonly collected measures, both in discrete, time-bound studies and from continuous monitoring. Second, it tells a simple, easily understood message of overall, aggregate change. The LPI has achieved prominence as a tool for communicating global biodiversity change to the public via its central role in WWFs periodic Living Planet Report (WWF 2012). Third, it can be cut in various ways to answer different questions and provide indicators for different policy targets. From the global dataset it is relatively simple to draw out subset analyses, or cuts, of the LPI focusing, for example, on wetland-dependent species (of relevance to the Ramsar Convention) or migratory species (of relevance to the CMS) or harvested species (of relevance to sustainable use and human wellbeing concerns). Fourth, it can be improved with new data sources. Knowing where the data gaps are enables a focus on ï¬lling those gaps, whether through unlocking more existing data or by investing in new monitoring. Fifth, it can be applied in different settings and different scales. A national LPI built from within-country studies of population abundances of different species is simple and cost-effective to construct. Moreover, the same approach can be applied to create an index of aggregate change in habitat extent, as has recently been created for wetland extent for the Ramsar Convention (Dixon et al. 2016). In the same way, harmonising the use of metrics across policy contexts is not only an efï¬cient use of resources but also creates greater awareness and potential for mainstreaming biodiversity into other development sectors. Globally, metrics of forest change, ï¬sheries, threatened species and protected area coverage have been used to provide indicators in the context of both the CBD and the Millennium Development Goals. Nationally, there are increasing efforts to incorporate ânatural capitalâ (including biodiversity and ecosystem services) into national accounts (King et al. 2015). The more that biodiversity data can be used in these contexts, the greater impact it will have on decision-making."
391,151,0.985,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"1.3.1.2 Methyl Chloride Our improving knowledge of sources and sinks of methyl chloride (CH3Cl) has revealed a lesser role for ocean sources than previously thought. Chemical loss in the atmosphere of about 7  1010 mol year 1 is matched by a net ocean supply of about 5 % of that amount. It has been found that warm waters tend to be supersaturated with increasing temperature, while cool waters (below about 12  C) are undersaturated (Moore et al. 1996a). It is clear from decreasing concentrations of CH3Cl with depth in the ocean that CH3Cl sinks exist within the water column. Measurements of isotopically labelled CH3Cl have revealed biological uptake rate constants in the range 0â0.22 d 1 (mean 0.07 d 1) in Southern Ocean surface waters (Tokarczyk et al. 2003a) and up to 0.3 d 1 in coastal waters (annual mean 0.07 d 1, Tokarczyk et al. 2003b). Among the most firmly established marine sources of CH3Cl are those from reactions of CH3I and CH3Br with Cl in seawater, the rates of which are known to be strongly temperature dependent. There is evidence for more direct biological production of CH3Cl from laboratory studies of algal cultures (e.g. Scarratt and Moore 1996, 1998), though these normally do not uniquely identify the source as the cultured alga rather than associated bacteria. Furthermore, the measured rates are very modest in comparison with estimates of CH3Cl production in ocean waters. For example, taking the most prolific phytoplankton producer of CH3Cl amongst those studied, Phaeocystis, was estimated to be able to account for only 0.5 % of oceanic production (Scarratt and Moore 1998) based on estimates of the abundance of the organism within oceanic blooms and their areal extent. Other limitations of these studies include the major differences that exist between culture conditions and the ocean. Even when production has been demonstrated, it is important to be able to relate it to the growth phase of the organism. Thus, while Ooki et al. (2010) report enhanced concentrations of CH3Cl associated with elevated chlorophyll-a in the NW"

IRT scaling was introduced to NAEP as a way to summarize the data in a subject area (e.g., reading). This will be discussed below. â¢ BIB spiraling. BIB spiraling was introduced to address concerns about the dimensionality of NAEP testing data. To assess a large pool of items while keeping the testing time for an individual student to less than an hour, BIB spiraling involved dividing the item pool into individually timed (e.g., 15-minute) blocks and assigning the blocks to assessment booklets so that each item is paired with each other item in some booklet. In this way, the correlation between each pair of items is estimable. This method was suggested by Beaton and implemented by James Ferris. The idea was influenced by the work of Geoffrey Beall13 on lattice designs (Beall and Ferris 1971) while he was at ETS. â¢ Grade and age (âgrageâ) sampling. Previous NAEP samples were defined by age. ETS added overlapping grade samples so that results could be reported either by age or by grade. â¢ âBridgeâ studies. These studies were introduced to address concerns about maintaining the already existing trend data. Bridge studies were created to link the older and newer designs. Building the bridge involved collecting randomly equivalent samples under both designs. Implementing a new, complex design in a few months is challenging and fraught with danger but presents opportunities for creative developments. The most serious problem was the inability to produce maximum likelihood estimates of proficiency for the students who answered all their items correctly or answered below the chance level. Because reading and writing blocks were combined in some assessment booklets, many students were given only a dozen or so reading items. The result was that an unacceptable proportion of students had extreme, nonestimable, reading scores. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that the proportion of high and low scorers differed by racial/ethnic groups, which would compromise any statistical conclusions. No classical statistical methods addressed this problem adequately. The maximum likelihood program LOGIST (Wingersky et al. 1982; Wingersky 1983), could not be used. Mislevy (1985) noted that NAEP did not need individual student scores; it needed only estimates of the distribution of student performance for different subpopulations such as gender or racial/ethnic groupings. In fact, it was not permissible or desirable to report individual scores. Combining the recent developments in"

We are deeply grateful for the contributions of the co-authors of this volume, as their expertise and experience represents the state of knowledge on the topic of aquaculture as a potential multi-use of ocean platforms. We have covered technical, operational, biological, economic, social and political considerations, as well as case studies, where aquaculture was implemented at pilot scale on offshore oil rigs and wind turbine platforms. One important area that was not covered in this book was environmental and ecological risks associated with aquaculture. While we acknowledge that environment issues are extremely important, we felt that they have been covered exhaustively over the past three decades and that further discussion would not have added new information for this volume. A recent review paper by the US Department of Commerceâs National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration (Price and Morris 2013) does an excellent job of synthesizing thirty years of literature on all environmental aspects of marine ï¬sh cage culture, so we recommend that report to readers with interest of this topic. While most environmental impacts have been associated with marine ï¬nï¬sh culture, there are some concerns with shellï¬sh and macroalgae culture though to a much lesser extent. These issues are also covered extensively in the literature (Fabia et al. 2009; Hatcher et al. 1994; Langan 2007, 2012; Lloyd 2003; Paul 1999; Plew et al. 2005; Price et al. 2015)"

Differences in the characteristics of the workforce are also present, such as the fraction of skilled workers and the experience of the most senior manager. Interestingly, there are no significant differences regarding the share of temporary workers, an attribute that in theory could affect the incentives to train if more temporary workers lead to a greater appropriation problem.17"
241,1077,0.985,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"18.4.3.2 Past Changes A large set of historical CO2 data for the northern Baltic Sea including the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland is available for 1927â1938 when the ï¬rst pioneering studies on the marine CO2 system were performed by Kurt Buch and co-workers at the Finnish Institute of Marine Research (FIMR) in Helsinki. They determined equilibrium constants for the CO2 system that agreed reasonably well with those determined by more sophisticated analytical techniques in recent years. This indicates that their data can be compared against the presentday status of the marine CO2 system. The current text restricts discussion on possible change in the CO2 system to the surface water because interpreting the deep-water CO2 data requires detailed information about the chronology of water mass stagnation and renewal events. This is not available for the Buch (1945) data, which give only seasonal mean values. Surface water pCO2 reflects the interplay between biological production, mineralisation and mixing, and has undergone large changes during the past 80 years. In Buchâs (1945) data, the pCO2 minimum after the spring bloom in the eastern Gotland Sea was about 270 Âµatm. Taking into account the lower atmospheric pCO2 during the 1930s (about 320 Âµatm, Callendar 1940), a CO2 partial pressure difference, DpCO2, of about â50 Âµatm is obtained which indicates moderate undersaturation of the surface water with regard to atmospheric CO2. Recent pCO2 measurements show a spring bloom minimum of about 150 Âµatm which corresponds to a DpCO2 of â250 Âµatm (Schneider 2011). This undersaturation is about ï¬vefold larger than at the beginning of the last century and can be attributed to increased organic matter production as a consequence of eutrophication. Although this is consistent with other historic production estimates, it must be taken into account that Buchâs (1945) spring value refers only to a single year and so its representation for the spring bloom can be questioned. The changes in surface water DpCO2 during the past 80 years are even more pronounced in midsummer. Due to the intense N2 ï¬xation in July, the DpCO2 in the central Baltic Sea currently amounts to almost â300 Âµatm (Schneider et al. 2009), whereas the mean DpCO2 at this time of year for 1927â1935 was less than â40 Âµatm (Buch"
