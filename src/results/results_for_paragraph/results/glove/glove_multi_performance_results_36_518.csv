Politically less powerful actors also strive to rescale decision-making processes in order to overcome undesirable policies and developments, structural constraints or environmental degradation. Chapter 11 describes the efforts of local communities to build up both glocal connections and coalitions with local governments in order to have control over consultations and decide about the implementation of mining projects in Latin America. According to Chapter 10, the scaling down of environmental governance to the local level is fundamental in safeguarding the self-determination of local communities. Chapter 9 argues that social capital and institutional strength in communities are key factors for the protection of forest commons and for local capacities to face traditional and emergent pressures on forest ecosystems. The extent to which local communities and social movements succeed in bringing about institutional change partly depends on their interactions with other actors. In this respect it is also important to point out that social actors (the state, corporations, communities, etc.) are not homogeneous entities. They may consist of various groups with different power, interests and positions, which may shift over time. Local governments, for example, occasionally confront central governments by developing alliances with local communities or other state agencies. Also, experts from corporations, governments and environmental organizations may take very different stances on energy efï¬ciency, production technologies and social responsibilities, despite the fact that they work in the same sector or country (see the analysis of views and discourses of strategic actors in Chapter 6). In some cases, environmentalists support local communities against development policies that promote the expansion of infrastructure and extractive industries in fragile ecosystems (Chapter 11). In other cases, they may favour compensatory schemes in conservation policies, regardless of the criticism raised by environmental justice movements (Chapter 8). In sum, while the central state has repositioned itself in processes of environmental governance of Latin America, institutional adaptation to the new contexts, discourses and demands has come from a range of (contesting) actors, and the interactions among them, across multiple scales. Overall, elite groups have tried to adjust some of their discourses and practices in order to partly comply with new demands and regulations, without having to give up their prominent position. Simultaneously, various marginalized groups have attempted to strike back by (re-)establishing and (re)appropriating local decision-making processes"

These consultations have succeeded in pacifying local tensions, at least for a while. While contexts of activist and protest criminalization and repression are not new in mining struggles, the particularity of these cases has been the ability of EJM to transform a risky protest environment into a democratic participation process. To do so, EJMs have constructed a hybrid participation institution. Community consultations: A hybrid institution Latin American mining consultations/referenda are based on the claim that communities â whether indigenous or not â have the right to participate in high-stake decisions that affect their livelihoods, a right deemed legitimate by affected communities. This right is recognized in a variety of indigenous and non-indigenous, international, national and municipal norms and rights (Jahnchke Benavente and Meza, 2010; Fulmer, 2011). However, how participation is framed by regulations and actors varies widely, being mostly informing and non-binding. As analysed by Arnstein (1969) in his eight-rung participation ladder ((1) manipulation, (2) therapy, (3) informing, (4) consultation, (5) placation, (6) partnership, (7) delegated power and (8) citizen control), there are different levels of exclusion/involvement and empowerment. As pointed out by Arnstein, as we step down the ladder, frustration rises. Communities are struggling to climb this ladder. Community consultations reclaim and rebuild the right of affected communities to participate, in meaningful and empowering ways, in decisions regarding high-impact activities that affect them. With this aim, in each context, communities strive for local participation rights appealing to, combining and reshufï¬ing available regulations, rights and local traditions. This process of institutional bricolage draws on a particular mix of formal and informal, and modern and traditional, institutions according to the particular context. For instance, communities are expanding and resignifying, in their discourse and practices, the way âconsultationâ is framed in ILO 169 â and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People â forcing new debates about the conventionâs reach (McGee, 2008; Fulmer, 2011). ILO 169 asserts that consultations should be conducted by states. However, the studied consultations are not organized by the central government (Jahncke Benavente and Meza, 2010; Fulmer, 2011). Community consultations appeal to ILO 169 consultation rights,"
293,212,0.991,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Motives and Frames of Translocal Activities of Migrant Organizations Although studies of the transnational activities of migrant organizations are advancing, few address the question of why migrant organizations, as collectives, become transnationally active (Morales and Jorba 2010; Lacroix 2010a). The motives that do emerge encompass four categories: moral, political, economic, and philanthropic. Moral bonds lie at the basis of many of the transnational activities of migrant organizations. These bonds are strongly associated with the relationship between migrants in the destination country and the non-migrants remaining in the village of origin. Migration impacts the identity of a community and changes the roles or the status of the individuals attached to that community. Migration both separates and binds people. Villagers may support each other by providing money, offering places to stay, and establishing care systems for those who remain. As such, migration shapes a âmoral frameworkâ (Lacroix 2010a, 10). The role of migrant collectives, hometown associations in particular, is to guarantee that migrants comply with all kinds of communal duties while they are abroad, as âlong-distance villagersâ (Lacroix 2010a, 10; Godin et al. 2012; Fox and Bada 2008). Moreover, migrantsâ participation in development projects gives them a certain legitimacy towards the non-migrants (Lacroix 2009; see also Henry and Mohan 2003, 615). The quest by migrant organizations to engender political change in their country of origin can be a driver of transnational activities. In this respect, the question is to what extent the activities of migrant organizations can be considered political transnationalism. Some authors consider almost all activities to be political, as they change the local development scene and force local actors to react. Here, we use a narrower interpretation of the concept of political transnationalism as those activities that are directly related to political participation. Examples are efforts to extend political rights to migrant communities, to reincorporate returnees into homecountry politics, to empower local communities as a starting point for wider political change, and calls for democracy and political reform (Ãstergaard-Nielsen 2003; Itzigsohn 2000). Lacroix and Dumont (2012) mention in this respect the emergence of âa political voiceâ of Moroccan associations abroad. Moroccan migrant organizations have called attention to the contradiction between the impossibility of renouncing the Moroccan nationality and the lack of the right to vote and be represented in parliament. Economic motives of migrant organizations can be confined to the country of origin or extend to other developing countries. For instance, by pooling funds for investments in income-generating activities, migrant organizations may expect economic profit in the long run. Furthermore, by investing in the local economy, migrant collectives (e.g., hometown associations) might seek to improve the conditions for their own return (SchÃ¼ttler 2008; Lacroix 2005; Henry and Mohan 2003). Altruistic motives are another driver of the transnational activities of migrant organizations. Several studies point to the fact that migrant organizations, as collectives, want to do something for their communities back home. They feel privileged"

In connection with their efforts to gain recognition and elaborate local management strategies, control of water resources has been particularly contentious as communities try to assert their rights to adequate supplies and protect their sources. We are accompanying a number of communities in their efforts to reinforce control in their territories by developing systems for managing water resources and organizing to impede encroachment by national and state-level authorities trying to limit their historical access. These movements are now inextricably combined with others in opposition to large-scale construction projects for dams designed to harness waters for electricity generation or for longdistance transfer between water basins to supply urban areas where ageing infrastructure and excessive growth in consumption are causing shortages due to a lack of administrative and technical capabilities of dominant bureaucracies. As a result, many communities that have historically been able to satisfy their own needs and even share surpluses with neighbouring communities are now ï¬nding themselves involved in coalitions with others defending their water sources, along with ecologists who are generally arguing that the engineering and public works approaches of the public sector are inappropriate and simply postponing the day of reckoning with regard to the need for a more ecologically informed approach to water management. An interesting ï¬nding in our collaborations with communities involved with protecting water sources is the combination of traditional and leading-edge technologies applied to protect their natural sources â the streams and springs on which they depend. This combination of technologies with direct community involvement in water management contrasts sharply with the national water authoritiesâ approach that eschews local diversity, preferring a homogenous administrative"
284,331,0.99,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Communal approaches to environmental justice Communities across the Americas are involved in designing and implementing local solutions that contribute to their broad struggle for environmental justice under circumstances of harassment and overt violence exercised by state powers in the societies of which they are a part. While a great deal of energy must be devoted to protecting themselves from encroachment by forces attempting to control their natural resources and subject them to the various disciplines of markets and political systems, it is remarkable that they continue to mobilize locally and nationally while associating internationally with other communities and NGOs to consolidate new lines and technologies of production, and experiment with ways to improve existing activities. These actions are the product of the complex interaction of dynamic forces within the communities and reactions to outside pressures. They are part of a search for a unique identity that has become increasingly important as these peoples assert their legally binding rights to self-determination as deï¬ned by their varied histories and their understanding of the privileges accorded them by the ILO Convention 169 and similar agreements promulgated by other international bodies, and the ongoing efforts in the Organization of American States (2003) to draft a similar commitment (endnote ix). In Mexico, as elsewhere, this process has a long history, which was codiï¬ed in its constitution of 1917, as indigenous communities were recognized and granted collective rights by the agrarian reform.14 During the last half of the twentieth century, Mexican communities waged an unrelenting and difï¬cult battle to assert their rights to control the lands over which they were able to retain or regain control after the revolution. They were particularly effective in wresting exploitation contracts for their communal forests from private ï¬rms that had been given concessions to manage them (Bray and Merino-PÃ©rez, 2004). Today there are a variety of management plans in effect, testimony to skills that the communities have acquired as they attempt to reconcile pressures for ensuring conservation with the need to create jobs and generate incomes. The literature offers rich accounts of this variety of strategies, and many studies explore the relationship between these approaches and the cosmologies of the participating communities, particularly in community-managed forests, which comprise 71% of the nationâs forests (e.g. Bray, Merino-PÃ©rez and Barry, 2005; Cronkleton, Bray and Medina, 2011; Barkin and Fuente, 2013; Stevens et al., 2014).15 The movement to reassert indigenous identities in Mexico was further strengthened in the aftermath of the 1994 uprising in Chiapas"
284,338,0.99,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"of public services and the deterioration in the quality of those remaining in the public sector are a palpable threat to peoples in every country. Even as indigenous communities are asserting their new-found rights to proceed with forestry and water-management activities, governments are encouraging large-scale initiatives by transnational corporations that threaten to upset the delicate balance of productive activities on which the communities depend for their livelihoods and for ecosystem balance. These projects pose fundamental questions about the ability of the communities to defend their territories, including their substantial cultural, social and productive heritage that entrenches them in their ecosystems. The conï¬icts continue to this day, posing apparently irresolvable differences and often resulting in violent encounters, as mines, ecotourism and other projects (and with the recent reforms, fracking and other forms of resource extraction) threaten the very existence of the communities. The communities generally reject the assumption that the sacriï¬ces that this destruction entails can be compensated by monetary offers that would only force them onto a path of institutionalized marginalization as isolated individuals, a life of limited opportunities without the social support systems and safety nets that their communities offer. The ongoing initiatives to strengthen or generate âniches of sustainabilityâ by peasant and indigenous communities throughout the Americas are heartening and important. While the momentum in the global marketplace is clearly threatening social groups and environments everywhere, the continuing successful efforts of peasants and indigenous peoples to implement their own strategies for social and productive change that deliberately incorporate the environment in the process offer a window on the possibilities for making environmental justice a reality for increasing segments of the population. This will not happen where the capitalist structure of production and control dominates. Thus the implementation of local solutions that create regions for autonomous action will become even more signiï¬cant and effective as the spaces dominated by the global market continue to suffer from deteriorating environments and heightened conï¬ict."
224,276,0.99,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Additionally, the management of collective economic resources by women, such as rice fields in Senegal, did not appear to be included in development planning within the local administration. A female president was responsible for a rehabilitation programme for rice fields funded by external cooperation. However, there were at least two âcompetingâ women representing âthe womenâ in the village or district town. These kinds of (very important) efforts were not included in the village development plan. The plan also did not include such features as grain mills and cereal banks, because private economic endeavours were not accounted for. Additionally, these womenâs groups are not politically represented in the local council where they could participate in the consideration of new regulations. There is no arena where womenâs movements and groups can enter into a serious debate concerning transformation within the framework of decentralisation (case study, Lachenmann 2006). While it might be interesting for women to not be forced into male roles, communal and state control, groups and cooperatives primarily made up of male members tend to be formal(ised) as economic, whereas womenâs groups tend to be informal(ised) as social or developmental (Rosander 1997). The latter are influenced by traditional experiences, community development and home economics coming from the established channels. These channels are dependent on ministries of social affairs (and not of agriculture), and lost their support after a democratic change of government. In any case, their economic level of activity is being suppressed by this âsmall tradeâ and âsharing approachâ of credit. Not many of these female savings and credit groups are yet integrated in the formalising schemes of Mutual Saving and Credit Banks."
83,224,0.989,Housing Market Dynamics in Africa,"Slum upgrading is another potential source of land for housing as informal settlements often represent an important and often well-located reservoir of available land. A key challenge for using this land creation mechanism is to expand the formal rights of informal residents to occupy the new land so that these residents may upgrade their housing situations over time. Governments can play an active role in such a situation. In situations of stalemate within slums between structure owners and community residents who are tenants, as noticed in Nairobi, governments are in a unique position to break the impasse that stops upgrading from taking place. A solution could be found through some kind of arrangement giving tenure rights to long-standing, registered community members while compensating structure ownersâeither through additional housing units in a new housing development elsewhere, as in Moroccoâs thirdparty slum-upgrading program, or through other incentives. Governments should also partner with NGOs in slum-upgrading initiatives so as to leverage the collective knowledge of these stakeholders, who often have an inside knowledge of slum dynamics. Moreover, it is critical to involve local residents in major land transactions, especially during the planning phases. Continuously engaging the relevant stakeholders and residents through awareness campaigns at all stages of the slum-upgrading projects is key to ensuring successful outcomes. Finally, if all other measures fail, governments can use their eminent domain powers to release land for development in the public interestâ for building public infrastructure or low-income housing purposes. However, compensation should reflect market rates if the tool is to be"

Such understanding is long overdue in major agencies and government policymaking ofï¬ces.

The partnerships were particularly important in promoting multi-stakeholder collaboration, as the exchanges stimulated cooperation between governmental and nongovernmental actors in both Morocco and Turkey. In the cases studied, few linkages between governmental and nongovernmental actors had existed before the partnership was created. For instance, in a partnership between Haarlem (the Netherlands) and EmirdaÄ (Turkey), the University of Afyon worked together with a primary school, an environmental NGO, a provincial environmental organization, and the municipality to improve the waste management system and introduce a waste collection system. These arrangements should be viewed against the background of the decentralization processes that are taking place in many countries, including Turkey, whereby responsibilities and budgets are being transferred from the central to the local government level. Hence, local governments are increasingly seeking to work in multiactor arrangements (Pierre 2000; Van Kersbergen and Van Waarden 2001). There are few examples of local governments in North-Western Europe supporting NGO co-development initiatives without being actively involved in the exchange. Nonetheless, the idea of co-development was well established by the late 1990s in France, where it received official acknowledgement and also influenced governments and policies elsewhere in Europe (Grillo and Riccio 2004). The approach was central in Catalonia where a large number of local governments were engaged in supporting the initiatives of community-based organizations and NGOs (ÃstergaardNielsen 2011). This phenomenon was also observed in Italy, although few Italian local authorities actually engaged in co-development projects (Grillo and Riccio 2004). Research on the impacts of these activities is scarce. According to ÃstergaardNielsen (2011, 36), it will only be possible to evaluate the dynamics of codevelopment policies once more programmes have run their course. Most studies refer to various initiatives or analyse the impacts of these programmes on the groups of migrants who undertake the activities. Although most co-development programmes are open to all migrant groups living in municipalities in destination countries, among initiatives in origin countries those of West African migrants are clearly dominant. The migrant collectives with the highest participation rates in Catalonia were comprised of migrants from Senegal, Equatorial Guinea, and Gambia, though the migrant populations originating from these countries represents only 3 % of the total migrant population. The two largest groups in Catalonia (Moroccan and Ecuadorian migrants) were less involved, and representatives of these groups indicated that they were focusing more on integration processes within Catalonia (Ãstergaard-Nielsen 2011). The literature describes several other initiatives by West African migrants, including those of Malian migrants living in Saint Denis, a suburb of Paris (Petiteville 1995; Grillo and Riccio 2004). A limited number of initiatives by ItaloâSenegalese organizations and Senegalese organizations linked to or supervised by Italian organizations are also mentioned (Grillo and Riccio 2004). Grillo and Riccio discuss the importance of transnational networks but also note problems of control and misunderstandings related mainly to naive expectations and the idealization of partners. Policies are sometimes also received with scepticism by migrants,"
293,292,0.989,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","then local integration policies are stimulated and facilitated by these preceding national frameworks. This is why Dutch and Swedish cities have a relatively long history of local integration policies (Scholten et al. 2015; Penninx 2015). But, as we have seen, factual immigration is not necessarily followed by an integration policy at the national level. Most North-Western European countries did have sizeable immigration but did not develop national integration policies until the turn of the century. In the absence of national policies, many cities developed integration policies, to give just a few examples, Birmingham and Bradford in the UK, Berlin and Frankfurt in Germany, Vienna in Austria, and the cities of Zurich, Bern, and Basel in Switzerland (Penninx 2009). Local integration policies became much more visible during the past decade. Cities organized themselves internationally in networks. These networks have been strongly supported and funded by the European Commission, and their activities have been studied extensively, often at the networksâ or the citiesâ own request. Systematic comparison of local policies reveals signiï¬cant variation in the framing of policies and in the meaning of integration underlying local policies. Some initiatives, such as the Intercultural Cities Network, focus strongly on the cultural dimension of integration, using diversity as a strength and diversity management as a strategy. Other cities have framed integration policies primarily as a socioeconomic issue, using antidiscrimination and equality as strategies and mainstreaming as their governance principle. Still other cities have stressed the participation dimension of integration, looking at accessibility and opportunity structures, on one hand, and active âcitizenshipâ of immigrants, on the other. Some cities have even developed a local concept of citizenship, as opposed to national citizenship. Whatever the history of local integration policies or their basic orientation, tensions have increasingly developed between the local and national levels. Some of these tensions may be attributable to the different views on how to implement immigration policiesârestrictive or otherwise. For instance, how are government administrators to handle migrantsâ illegality in practice? What are the consequences of implementing restrictions on access to facilities and services in the domains of employment, housing, education, and healthcare to combat illegal residence? Friction may also arise on the new civic integration courses and the increased cultural knowledge required for continued residence and naturalization. While national policies may be quite ideological, local practitioners typically seek more feasible solutions. Tensions also arise when the ï¬nancing of integration facilities is at stake, particularly when national policies prescribe new actions but fail to deliver the ï¬nancial and other resources needed to implement them."

Whether or not this happens depends on the degree to which new elites are able to inï¬uence the positions and views of old elites. Chapter 6 suggests that the views, aspirations and environmental orientation of elites are not homogeneous. It is conceivable that we will see the ascendance of elites in the future with aspirations of a more sustainable development policy and environmental governance. It is also necessary to remember that centre-left governments in Latin America won the elections thanks to the support of wide segments of the population, particularly the marginalized and subaltern ones. These governments depended on various types of alliance between different grassroots organizations and social movements. If these movements and grassroots organizations are able to exert some pressure on their governments to address environmental concerns in the future, we may see a shift towards more equitable and sustainable models of environmental governance. If popular mobilization continues to be crucial for maintaining leftist governments in power, at some point the environmental concerns of the population need to be addressed."
364,175,0.989,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"stewardship. This is partly because communities often have better knowledge and expertise in the management of local resources than government agencies/private industry. Indeed, the involvement of local people in such development business may help reduce government costs. As such, local participation and decentralization are currently being promoted in many developing countries as an alternative approach to development and resource governance. Brown et al. (2002) argue that such a community-based approach often leads to more equitable and sustainable natural resource management. These authors provided a number of reasons to support their argument. One of those reasons concerns the issue of proximity to resources. Those in closest contact with, and whose livelihoods are impacted by, natural resources are best placed to ensure effective stewardship. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is an approach under which communities become responsible for managing natural resources (forests, land, water, biodiversity) within a designated area. CBNRM gives communities full or partial control over decisions regarding natural resources, such as water, forests, pastures, communal lands, protected areas, and fisheries. The extent of CBNRM control can range from community consultations to joint management or to full responsibility for decision making and benefit collection, using tools such as joint management plans, community management plans, stakeholder consultations and workshops, and communal land tenure rights. Together with decentralization reforms, CBNRM ensures stakeholder participation, increases sustainability, and provides a forum for conflict resolution (World Bank 2006). In Thailand, participation of local communities in natural resource management has been recognized and promoted by government agencies. Evidence of this is provided by the current National Constitution, which contains some articles giving rights to local people and communities to participate in such state-owned development projects. These local communities currently have a say in decision making processes related to natural resource management. In the forestry sector, the Royal Forest Department (RFD) promotes community forestry projects where local communities living in or adjacent to national reserve forests are given usufruct rights to resources within the community forest areas. The RFD also provides them with technical and financial support. It is worth noting here that the most economically and ecologically successful CBNRM is achieved when community participation is accompanied by the devolution of ownership rights over resources. Once a community has been given tenure over the resources they are helping to manage, they are able to gain benefits from the use of these resources and their interest in participation is naturally increased. The village of Pred Nai in Thailandâs Trat province has successfully re-forested 1,920 ha of mangrove forest that were previously converted into shrimp aquaculture ponds in the mid-1980s. Community conservation of mangrove forests in Pred Nai village emerged without outsider intervention more than 20 years ago. Clearly, the initiative by the Pred Nai villagers qualifies as community-based mangrove forest management and numerous lessons can be drawn from it. The successful implementation of community forestry has reaffirmed the role and significance of a communitybased approach in natural resource management. This community-based approach"
126,351,0.989,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"The pursuit of Omo River basin development is leading to a major human rights crisis in the Ethiopia-Kenya-South Sudan transboundary region of eastern Africa. Among the principal human rights being violated are those recognized by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) Treaty adopted by the U.N. General Assembly. Although the Ethiopian government is most immediately responsible for initiating human rights violations in the region, the Kenyan government and international development banks are variously complicit, collaborative and partnered in these transgressions. The World Bank, African Development Bank and major donor countries continue to supportâeven legitimateâthe development despite predictable destruction of hundreds of thousands of indigenous peoplesâ livelihoods and major political rights violations, particularly within Ethiopia. Cumulative and synergistic effects of the Gibe III megadam and its linked irrigated plantations and energy export transmission system must be integrally considered for adequate social and environmental impact assessment, yet both governments and development banks have failed to act on this mandate. A crossroads in public policy has now emerged: either pursue the present pathway toward massive scale hunger, regional economic collapse and major new cross-border armed conflict or suspend the development underway in order to take genuine account of human rights and proceed in a direction that is accountable to citizens and provides for a sustainable future for the three nations involved."
266,174,0.989,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"policing? While the term is omnipresent in across western policing discourse, an agreed and accepted definition of what it actually entails remains elusive (Cordner 1998). Despite this continued ambiguity, the core philosophy of community policing, and thus a common thread across all of its contemporary manifestations, can be distilled to focus on those activities which seek to forge working partnerships between the police and communities (Peak and Glensor 1996). While working in partnership with the community is a fundamental precept of community policing, actually forging and maintaining these relationships is a more complex and sensitive process than is often acknowledged. Different groups and communities are often so defined by the socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts that bring them together, meaning the requirements, in terms of enablers and barriers to successful collaboration, are disparate from one to the next, with no one-sizefits-all approach that can be implemented holistically. Moreover, community policing is a paradigm shift away from the normality of traditional police practice, meaning officers are often ill-equipped to overcome the unwillingness of communitiesâ to work with them and foster the working relationships which are so fundamental to the success of the approach (Sarre 1997). Thus, the challenge of working with communities that are considered disadvantaged or maligned is further accentuated by these factors, requiring organisational and cultural changes to foster engagement with the public and ultimately empower communities to participate in efforts to tackle local crime-related problems (Cameron and Laycock 2002)."
174,166,0.989,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"the categorIes of InterventIons Following from the above, South Africaâs approaches to peacebuilding are strongly informed not just by its own recent history, but a strong national interest that benefits from peaceful resolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. This, according to its policy documents, compels South Africa to participate in peace missions to alleviate the plight of other peoples who are struggling to resolve similar conflicts (Department of Foreign Affairs 1999). Specifically, the 1999 White Paper on South African participation in international peace missions contemplates that civilian assistance, armed forces, and police officers are essential tools for peace, and their work in promoting the respect for human rights, good governance, and institution building is critical to reconstructing sustainable peace as opposed to the use of force which was previously characteristic of military interventions (Department of Foreign Affairs 1999). South Africa therefore committed through this document to work with the UN, the AU, SADC, and other multilateral agencies such as BRICs and IBSA to make appropriate contribution to international peace missions. South Africaâs potential contributions include the services of a diverse group of civilians with expertise and experience in areas that may be fundamental to the success of a peace mission (conflict resolution, election monitoring, medical care, demining, telecommunications, etc.). Consequently, whether in South Sudan, the DRC, Burundi, or Somalia, the principles that have defined South Africaâs intervention and peace support have been the same and have adopted a more nuanced terminology of peace missions as opposed to the traditional peacekeeping or peacebuilding mandates. The difference is that, from inception, a government decision to support a fragile country or one in conflict is seen as a peace mission, and all support such as below seeks to transform the ailing configuration of conflict and restore durable peace by putting in place resilient institutions and infrastructure (see Tables 6.1 and 6.2). The tables above demonstrate the width of South African support to South Sudan and to the DRC and in a sense provide a snapshot of how peacebuilding support is channeled and funded.

These initiatives are important, but they alone cannot lead to a significant transformation of pastoral rights. Significant political and institutional questions have to also be addressed for effective implementation (Brottem 2013). In general, local understanding and enforcement of existing laws are weak. Some newly organized formal community-based rangeland management groups have creatively circumvented these challenges by working closely with their local government to obtain use rights over defined pasture areas, create their own management plans, and then lobby local government to pass an ordinance or decree that gives certain elements of their plan the force of law (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez et al. 2012; Upton 2008, 2009). For example, if a group of herders wants to rest a certain pasture area for a season, they ask the local government to issue an edict forbidding grazing in that area for the rest of the season, with violations punishable by a fine.28 Mongolia. The pasturelands of Mongolia are state property used in common by the herders within a given administrative district. Privatization of pasture is unconstitutional, but herders may obtain long-term private leases on nomadic winter and spring campsites (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez and Batbuyan 2004; Upton 2009). Mongoliaâs Law on Land contains provisions related to pastureland tenure and management, devolving most decisions and authority to regulate stocking rates and seasonal movements to the local level (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez and Batbuyan 2004). Under Mongolian law, organized groups of herders may obtain collective use agreements for defined areas of pasture, but âuseâ does not denote the right to exclude other potential users. Pastureland âpossessionâ would confer exclusive rights to a given pasture area, but pasture possession is not authorized under the current law.Mobility has been a hallmark of Mongolian pastoralism for centuries and continues to be an important strategy today. Mobility patterns historically have varied widely across the country, depending largely on local topography and climate. During the collective era, the collectives allocated pasture to their member herders and both regulated seasonal movements and provided transportation for moves (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez 1999). In addition, collectives arranged for long-distance moves in weather disasters such as severe winter storms. Following privatization of livestock and the dismantling of collectives, no formal institutions have filled the role of allocating pasture and enforcing seasonal mobility, although the current law"

Such initiatives have been coherent with the struggles of local communities over land and natural resources all over the region. The âdevolutionâ of forestlands to local populations has been an intense learning process, with a range of outcomes that need to be better documented and understood. This extends from the forest concessions to âcomunitariosâ in PetÃ©n Guatemala, the ofï¬cial recognition of traditional rights over the lands of the indigenous âmizquitoâ in Nicaragua, and the indigenous reserves in PanamÃ¡, Brazil and Bolivia; to the forest property of Afro-American communities in the Colombian Paciï¬c and rubber tappers in Brazil. Experiences of collective action, local governance, rural development and conservation coexist with cases of conï¬ict, elite capture and forest deterioration. âCommunity forestryâ has been a positive option for conservation and local livelihoods in different regions.1 However, community-based governance is neither a panacea nor a reality to be taken for granted. The outcomes of these experiences derive from a variety of historical as well as recent factors, on which public policy often has major impacts. Mexico stands as a singular case of community-based forest governance in Latin America. Mexican communities gained legal rights over lands and forests long before anywhere else in the contemporary world. At the same time, Mexicoâs deforestation rates were some of the highest in the world for decades (1970â1990).2 Forests cover more than 60% of the country, providing important ecosystemic services that beneï¬t a range of actors.3 During most of the twentieth century, the forest industrial sector searched for access to low-cost raw materials. Backed by government agencies that promoted economic growth, their position weakened with the implementation of NAFTA. Since 1994 the Secretaria de Medio Ambiente Recursos Naturales y Pesca (SEMARNAP) has promoted conservationist measures that sought to minimize forest use in order to protect the megabiodiversity within, often drastically limiting human presence in forested and wild areas.4 Conservationist policies have gained inï¬uence in public opinion, backed by national and international environmental agencies. They tend to regard deforestation as a generalized process in the country, mainly driven by collective property regimes and rural poverty. Local communities are the legal owners of the majority of Mexicoâs forests. Although they were favoured by agrarian reform, they have rarely received coherent policy support to develop forest-based livelihoods and to become forest stewards. Most forest communities have weak political voices and exercise little inï¬uence on other social sectors. Community residents value and beneï¬t directly from many of the forestâs ecosystemic âservicesâ: goods for"

This research is born from the curiosity of understanding how and why these consultations have emerged and spread, and how community consultations are challenging the governance of mining activities. Analysing the cases of community consultations conducted in Latin America from 2002 to 2012, we claim that these consultations (1) emerge in the context of environmental justice struggles and criminalization; (2) aim to reclaim the right of affected populations to participate, in empowering forms, in high-stakes decision-making that affect their lands and livelihoods; and (3) are a hybrid institution, the product of a dynamic multiscalar process where non-state and state actors, and formal and informal institutions, are mobilized to challenge the centralized governance of extractive activities."

At the centre of regional cooperation is the SADC Protocol, without which many of the joint fact-finding and knowledge-building exercises in the regionâs basins may not have been possible. Dramatic changes in South Africaâs political landscape since the early 1990s were initially accompanied by sweeping changes to that nationâs policies, laws and institutions. South Africa became a very active member of SADC, leading processes around issue areas such as devising national water policies, strategies and laws. South Africaâs water reform spurred the wave of reforms experienced in neighbouring countries post-1990 as well. However, like many developing countries, SADC states struggle with implementing many of their well-formed policies, laws and procedures. There are a wide variety of explanations regarding this relatively poor performance: human, financial and technological shortages, âpoor governanceâ embedded in unequal states, tensions around the creation of new sources of authority such as catchment management agencies or councils and water user associations, resource capture facilitated by neoliberal approaches to resource management and persistent global economic crises forcing resource-extracting economies to âstick to what they knowâ. Some critics have argued that rather than introduce a whole new set of structures, state actors should have worked with existing, already legitimate, forms of authority. Van Koppen et al. (2014) suggest that the nationalisation of water resources and the introduction of formal permit systems, while probably important in principle (particularly in highly unequal societies), have in fact facilitated further resource capture by the empowered and the undermining of local systems of governance. Yet there are success stories: Namibiaâs basin management committees, particularly in the western-draining ephemeral Kuiseb river basin, show the real potential for ideal-typical IWRM-style systems to emerge (Manning and Seely 2005). Indeed, the role of Rand Water, South Africaâs largest water services provider in the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area, suggests that public-private partnerships can work given a particular set of parameters4. In the transboundary context, states have shown a willingness to cooperate, though not quite extending to striking what Litfin (1997) describes as âsovereignty bargainsâ, such as those that typify the European Union. New modalities of decision-making have been successfully introduced; numerous multidisciplinary, transnational research and knowledge-generating projects and programmes are underway; and the important 14-year-old regional water research and education programme, WaterNet5, has been building the regionâs professional capacity. WaterNet is recognised as the water capacity-building arm of SADC, and its implementation through a set of regional universities and training institutions has promoted mutual understanding â even friendships â among regional water professionals. To be sure, some of these activities are being pushed by external actors, whose absence would quite possibly threaten the negotiation and bargaining processes. Much of this feels like one step forward, one step backward, yet"
381,627,0.989,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Mobilizing an Engaged Citizenry Professional accountability is not enough, however. There have been many examples in recent years of equity-focused reform effortsâeven some with fair support among educatorsâthat fell to partisan politics and pushback from a public that didnât understand or agree with the rationale for the changes. Often, public and political support for the status quo is based on deep-seated beliefs about meritocracy, the scarcity of educational goods, and the inability of some children to take advantage of opportunities when offered (Oakes and Lipton 2006). Behind these beliefs sits a power structure that preserves advantages for wealthier and more privileged communities at the expense not only of less privileged communities but also the nation as a whole (Stiglitz 2012). To create and sustain meaningful policies and practices to equalize opportunities for low-income students and students of color requires more than technical solutions and more than an engaged profession. It also requires public constituency and mobilization. We see this mobilization as necessarily occurring on two levels. One is the coordination of efforts at the âgrass topsââthat is through building coalitions among the leaders of the many education stakeholder groupsâeveryone from higher education institutions to employer groups, parent organizations, advocacy and civil rights groups, and health care and community-based organizations that work with children in other capacities. Political figures and public agency representatives may be a part of these coalitions, but they focus primarily on gathering support and involvement of organized constituencies outside the more formal education system and political structure. In the past few years, the social sector has seen increased interest in and use of collective impact strategies that employ such coalition efforts to address particularly intractable and complex social problems. The concept of collective impact seems to have emerged from the Strive Together initiative in Cincinnati, which brought together local leaders to tackle the student achievement crisis in greater Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. Defining system change as community-wide transformation in which various partners (a) productively use data to improve their decision making and (b) constantly weigh the impact of their decisions on both their own institutions and the broader ecosystem that work to improve the lives of children, the leaders of Strive Together posited a four-pillar theory of action for collective impact: establishing a shared community vision, instituting evidence-based decision-making and shared accountability among the partners to improve selected outcomes, using continuous improvement approaches to identify and spread promising practices to improve community-level outcomes, and aligning financial and other resources to support and sustain improvement (Edmondson and Hecht 2014, 6â7). Though Strive Together may have coined the phrase, others have instituted similar collective efforts, sometimes over decades (e.g., El Paso). All are based on the theme that cross-sector, cross-organization coordination is more likely to contribute to large-scale, sustained social change than are the isolated actions of individual organizations and agencies. Within this coordinated approach, the goal of eliminating"

Over the past decade, a demand for greater national ownership from G7+ countries has converged with a similar stance among rising powers in the Global South to lead the UN, the EU and OECD countries to commit to national ownership in virtually all documents and discussions of peacebuilding. The emphasis by emerging powers on sovereignty shapes their understanding of ânational ownership.â It means taking priorities first from the central government, and then also channeling resources through the state. For rising powers, this notion translates largely to accepting the government of the day as the embodiment of national ownership, with less emphasis on local or inclusive ownership. Indiaâs peacebuilding priorities in Afghanistan, for instance, are shaped very heavily by conversations between the Indian ambassador in Kabul and the Afghan president. Turkey reaches out more to local leaders, whose priorities determine how Turkish assistance will be used. Typically, rising powers do not invest in much broader consultations with lower level community leaders, civil society, or critics of the government in formulating priorities. They are concerned more about the capacity than the legitimacy of the partner state. Their vision is to invest in the long-term development of the state, regardless of the government of the day. In implementation, countries like India and Turkey may well then reach out to and meet with local beneficiary communities. Indian officials, for instance, seek warm relations of solidarity with partner countries and care about what local communities think of their programs and their effects. They may adapt their programs in response to dialogue with communities. However, in setting priorities, they principally and initially take their cues from the central governmentâs preferences. This approach contrasts with the growing understanding that Western donors have of ânationalâ and âlocalâ ownership that includes nongovernmental actors, especially civil society organizations representative of salient social groups based on ethnicity, gender, youth, and religion. Rising powersâ views on peacebuilding comport less with the trend among intergovernmental organizations, Western donors and the new SDGs emphasizing âinclusive politics.â"
284,379,0.988,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Social movements opposing mining activities claim that developing mining activities jeopardizes local (and supralocal) livelihoods. Communities in Peru, Guatemala, Colombia and Ecuador signal the risks to their livelihoods, which are dependent on agriculture, cattle and forests. Concerns about health also appear, with high relevance in Esquel (Argentina) regarding cyanide use. Worries about water quality, and availability for local economic activities and household use, are common to all studied cases. While the affected communities signal such concerns as grounds to redraft or even stop a mining project and national mining plans, governments and companies claim that these decisions are not for local communities to make. Central governments argue that mining is an issue of national interest and experts within a national decision-making process should have the last word. Governments and mining companies frame local alarm as an exaggeration that undermines the positive impacts of mining. Moreover, critical communitiesâ and EJMâs views are being labelled by Latin American national governments as irrational, ignorant, anti-development, politically driven, promoted by foreignersâ interests or by a radical, subversive environmentalism (Bebbington, 2012b), hand in hand with criminalization processes (OCMAL, 2011). Ofï¬cial participation arenas become frustrating spaces given the partial information that is shared and the powerless participation modes they offer (Cole and Foster, 2001). As decision-making procedures are unable to address local communitiesâ concerns, disputes form around these procedures and their decisions (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Suryanata and Umemoto, 2005; Walter and MartinezAlier, 2010; Urkidi and Walter, 2011). It is becoming increasingly common for EJMs to prevent or boycott public audiences, as these are seen as an empty requisite for project approval (Jahncke Benavente and Meza, 2010). There were cases of boycotts of public audiences in Tambogrande, Toquepala, TÃ­a MarÃ­a, Esquel and Loncopue. Indigenous communities rejected and misrecognized the alleged consultation processes led by mining companies and governments in Peru, Colombia and Guatemala. In Ecuador and Argentina, indigenous communities claimed that formal consultation never occurred (Urkidi and Walter, 2011; PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). Furthermore, one of the ï¬ndings of this research has been the role played by violence in the fostering of consultations. Human Rights claims have been identiï¬ed as a particular root of Latin American EJMs (Carruthers, 2008). Mining referenda have emerged in contexts of repression and criminalization of activists, where concerns regarding the physical and psychological integrity of activists were rising. In this"

In addition, the authors address the issue of governance of transboundary groundwater resources and the relevant existing international legal frameworks. In conclusion, through a Global Vision for 2030, this chapter presents a way forwards to govern groundwater and a framework for action to achieve good governance, formulated by the Groundwater Governance Project jointly implemented by UNESCO, FAO, World Bank and IAH. To achieve the goals of the Shared Vision 2030, a Framework for Action has been developed. It describes the main steps to be taken, provides guidance on planning and prioritising actions and is an urgent call for action to all who can make a difference: national and local governments, international organisations, the private sector, civil society, media, educational institutions and professional organisations â but also well owners, groundwater users and concerned citizens everywhere. The main steps elaborated in the Framework for Action are understanding the context, creating a basis for governance, building effective institutions, making essential linkages, redirecting finances and establishing a process of planning and management. The Shared Global Vision for Groundwater Governance 2030 and the Global Framework for Action to achieve the vision on Groundwater Governance call for strengthening groundwater governance. This call for action urges countries, districts, communities, companies, organisations and individuals to safeguard the groundwater resource that is essential to meet their common future objectives and Sustainable Development Goals. This Framework for Action is designed to set in place the groundwater governance arrangements that will achieve this vision. Doug Merrey explores the likely trends and outcomes in water governance with a particular focus on cooperation and conflict over the management of water resources in two regions: South Asia and Southern Africa. With its extremely largescale shared river basins inhabited by nearly a billion mostly poor people, South Asia has struggled to find ways to co-manage water resources to benefit everyone equitably in a context where there is much potential benefit to be achieved. Southern Africa is considered an example of relative success in developing ways to cooperate â but implementation is incredibly complex in systems more water scarce than South Asia, though not as large. They examine the prospects for developing governance arrangements in the two regions through three âlensesâ which they characterise as âbeyond disciplinesâ, âbeyond scalesâ and âbeyond âinstitutionalâ hardware to âhumanâ softwareâ. Even those who have advocated for the role of institutions above, individuals have conceded, as noted for South Asia, that the behaviour of individuals within organisations determines the outcomes. More research needs to be conducted on the role of the individual in actively addressing complex waterrelated challenges, in redefining how multiple sectors cooperate around these issues and ultimately influencing socio-economic development at the regional level. At present, governance structures, organised nationally and transnationally on a basin scale in both regions, presume that âstakeholdersâ can adequately represent themselves in formal settings where allocation, use and management decisions are"
218,169,0.988,Sustainable Development in The Jordan Valley : Final Report of The Regional Ngo Master Plan,"Concerning Integrated Water Resources Management the stakeholders representing the agricultural and environmental interests take very divergent opinions and it is hoped that through interactions they start to take more convergent positions. Exclusion or inclusion of stakeholders for the consultations can have far-reaching consequences on the discussions and the compromises reached through the negotiations, but also for the constituency of the plans. For the identiï¬cation of the stakeholders a distinction will be made between public, private and voluntary organizations, keeping in mind that these are the three societal pillars of effective water governance systems. Special attention has been given to the stakeholders that have a positive influence on the consultations through the formulation of compromises based on common needs of stakeholders with perceived antagonistâs interests. Jordan For the water sector in Jordan, the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, the Jordan Valley Authority and the Jordan Water Authority are recommended to represent the public sector. Representatives of the Water Users Associations, the Southern Shouneh Chambers of Commerce represent respectively the agricultural and industrial water users in the consultations. Of the NGOs in Jordan EcoPeace Middle East has developed various water related initiative in the Valley and therefore is representative the voluntary sector. Four WUA representatives in the Forumâs Steering Committee have represented all WUAs in the consultation process during preparation of this Jordan Valley NGO Master Plan. For the agricultural stakeholders in Jordan, the Ministry of Agriculture, NCARE and ACC represent the public sector. The Jordan Farmers Unions, the Irbid and Southern Shouneh Chambers of Commerce and the Fruits and Vegetables Association represented the private sector organizations. Of the environmental NGOs, the Jordan Environmental Society is working on tensions between economic and environmental issues in relation to irrigated agriculture. In the agricultural sector of the Jordan Valley representatives of the three major tribal clans have to be involved to obtain a critical mass among farmers. Unfortunately there is not yet a farmerâs organization for the promotion of LEISA production techniques that could represent the interests of this sub-group of farmers, which the HEIA farmers might not allow the Jordan Farmers Union to do. The Southern Shouneh Chamber of Commerce and the Dead Sea Tourist Board represent the private sector organizations. Of the environmental NGOs, the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature and the Jordan Environmental Society have been both involved in the discussions about sustainable development and natural resources management initiatives."
164,606,0.988,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Thus unless businesses make a dedicated effort to engage them, the extremely poor are unlikely to benefit from corporate activities. A precondition of successful engagement is a deep knowledge of the contextual situation in which the extremely poor and marginalized live and operate. In rural areas this must often include detailed knowledge about local agricultural operations. In many cases businesses cannot rely on governments to facilitate the participation of the poorest, as the marginalized may be actively discriminated against by their national or local governments (e.g., for ethnic or religious reasons), or may simply not have been recognized as needing special attention. As the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF 2010, 5) notes: The poorest and most marginalized communities are not systematically assessed and are often forgotten when national development plans are laid and resources allocated. They are also the least likely to have a voice in global and national decision-making forums. Disaggregating national data to identify these groups and assess the factors that exclude them is fundamental to designing equitable solutions."

Grillo and Riccio (2004, 109) conclude that co-development is âno better nor worse than more conventional forms of developmentâ. An interesting âthree-wayâ integration process is that of some municipal partnerships, whereby countries of origin play a role in supporting the integration process in destination countries. Gilgili & Agimi (2015) refer to examples of direct subnational support for emigrant employment, health care, and political participation. Van Ewijk (2013) reports, for instance, that administrative staff and policy advisors of municipalities in northern Morocco were willing to dedicate time and knowledge to strengthen the integration of Moroccan migrants in the Netherlands, as they felt the Moroccan migrants were trapped between two countries with different cultures. As the former mayor of Al Hoceima (Morocco) put it, âIt was obvious that these people did not have a good relationship with their father or their mother. Itâs not their fault; it is the parentsâ (cited in Van Ewijk 2013, 207). The limited engagement of parents of Moroccan descent with their childrenâs Dutch schooling was one of the key issues discussed, and Moroccan officials were also involved in stimulating migrants to participate in elections. Community-based organizations that have been part of a city-to-city partnership have also been actively involved in exchanging knowledge on issues related to integration. An example is an exchange between womenâs organizations in Meppel (the Netherlands) and Al Hoceima, whereby women of Moroccan descent in Meppel were challenged by women in Al Hoceima to play a stronger role in their own municipality. As discussed elsewhere in this chapter, few examples of these âthree-wayâ integration process are described in the literature, and there is limited knowledge about the role of local authorities in sending countries. These activities are hampered by the limited capacity and mandates of local authorities in origin countries, and obviously they can only contribute to immigration integration in cooperation with local authorities in destination countries (Bilgili and Agimi 2015)."
329,15,0.988,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"to improve eye care in rural China or Indonesia may well be accepted, but one aiming to strengthen citizen legal representation may not. Though the discussion about the role that advocacy groups play in society is a worthwhile one, it is not the point of our study and of this book. We are confining our analysis to social delivery organizations (SDOs), those aiming to provide social benefits within the given political framework of each nation, and even among those, to groups working in areas associated with basic human needs such as education, health, poverty alleviation, and the environment. Advocacy organizations working in areas such as human rights, legal reform, and labor issues do important work, but it is also necessary to clarify the differences between these types of efforts and those that seek to address challenges lower on Maslowâs hierarchy, which places food, shelter, and health among our basic needs. The distinction between SDOs and advocacy organizations can be difficult to ascertain. Many SDOs also advocate for regulatory change around a specific set of issues. As we will see later in the book, a number of the organizations we studied were encouraged to provide input to the government. Bainian Vocational Services, for example, worked with the government to change the scope and availability of vocational training opportunities for children of migrant workers and the rural poor. Eden Social Welfare Foundation pushed government to create greater access for the disabled in Taiwan, and the Magic Bus was instrumental in getting the Indian government to change educational policies and programs around sports and athletic programs. But when we talk about advocacy organizations and those that are encountering resistance in Asia, we are specifically referring to those organizations that combine two elements: (1) they do not have intervention programs and spend 100 percent of their time and financial resources on policy change; and (2) these changes are perceived by government as antagonistic rather than complementary. Throughout Asia, the largest donations to these types of organizations come from outside the region. For this reason, states such as India and China are reassessing the way that foreign funding comes into the country and the types of organizations it supports. Currently, in many countries around the world, the degrees of freedom for foreign-funded advocacy organizations are shrinking. This book does not make a judgment about these changes, but merely attempts to describe the phenomena and the possible ramifications on local philanthropy and SDOs."

The Unit was established in 2012 as a part of a large organizational reform. The main goal of the PPU is to enhance security in the city of Helsinki: early prevention of phenomena that pose a threat to the security of neighborhoods and the building of partnerships with various stakeholders. In practice this means cooperation with a multitude of actors, such as other local and national police units, public agencies, non-governmental organizations, civic associations and citizens of Helsinki. An essential aspect of the PPUâs work is to build and maintain trust among all stakeholders and collectively try to solve possible security challenges. The basic working method is a refined version of problem oriented policing. All teams focus on those security threatening phenomena that require more thorough investigations into the root of the problems, which may not be possible by the more traditional law enforcement methods. By means of local problem solving methods teams try to identify the factors behind crimes and disorder and then move on to influence those circumstances in collaboration with other police units, public agencies, NGOs and residents. The Puhos case involves agents from both public and private sector and civil society. Therefore the case is difficult for the police to manage. A prerequisite for solving the problems is bringing all relevant stakeholders together and engaging them in improving the security and vitality of the area and its surroundings. Due to the large number of participants the arrangement of meetings and agreeing on schedules and agenda is very challenging. Police would also need to carefully identify the best channels to reach different community groups and stakeholders. For the present, police have communicated with phones and emails, as there is no common digital platform that could be used for exchanging information, booking meetings, or archiving documents. Activities and documents are difficult to manage, because there are so many agencies involved and the problems comprise a complex and intertwined totality. Often half of the major stakeholders have been left out from the meetings; a fact that has increased suspicion among the absentees. A fundamental challenge has been that there is a lack of shared strategy and prioritization of issues. It has not been clear which agency is in the best position to lead the problem solving process of each individual case. Shared vision and welldefined, likely solvable security challenges can function as motivators that may help bring various agents together on a more permanent basis. In an ideal situation all agencies could have a voice in identifying and prioritizing security issues, exchanging information and experimenting with alternative solutions. Concrete cooperation would improve communication, trust and commitment to seek more sustainable solutions. The current state of affairs should be improved at least in two respects. First, the problem solving process should be designed to be more systematic, inventive and effective. This requires, for instance, agreed rules for organizing meetings, allocating"
219,90,0.988,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Reforms of the Institutional Environment, or âL2 Actionsâ The level L2 is the institutional environment. It is the level at which the executive, legislative, judicial and bureaucratic functions of the government are organised. This includes the horizontal distribution of power across different agencies (such as different ministries), the vertical distribution across levels (decentralisation), or the set of rules that determine access to and ownership of productive resources (tenure). The L2 provides the infrastructure and the playing ï¬eld in which actors interact and take decisions. The L2 is often shaped by historic events, such as regime changes, crises or major intervention with large political support. While it is mostly the product of historical processes, opportunities for design exist. Horizontal linkages across ministries At the national level, countries responded to natural resource and environmental degradation by forming ministries of environment to address degradation. One of the weaknesses of such ministries was their limited interaction with other ministries and departments (Volkery et al. 2006). Initially, responsibility for the promotion of soil and water conservation measures lay with the forestry ministries. This often led to coordination failure and little outreach to farmers and private land user (De Graaff et al. 2013). Promoting sustainable land management beyond boundaries of ministries might be an important pre-condition to reduce conflicting regulations and harmonise national efforts to ï¬ght land degradation. Decentralisation The lack of involvement of local communities in managing natural resources is often identiï¬ed as one of the major reasons for the failure of centralised governments to effectively manage land resources (Gibson et al. 2005; Robinson et al. 2011). The exclusion of local communities alienates them, which in turn leads to poor cooperation between local communities and natural resource managers. Ostrom and Nagendra (2006) found that locally-managed forests are usually managed more effectively than centrally-managed forests. FAO estimates that around one-quarter of forests in developing countries are in some way managed by local communities (FAO 2011). The share of community-managed forests is increasing, thanks to the promotion of decentralisation and community-based management by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations (FAO 2011)."

With regard to migrant integration, even more complex relations have emerged between local, regional, national, and EU institutions. The superdiverse cities of Europe, such as Barcelona, London, Berlin, and Rotterdam, have taken policy directions very different from their national governments, resulting in a âdecouplingâ of national and local policies. While politicization of migrant integration continues to drive policies in many countries, the EU has developed various soft governance measures aimed at promoting policy learning between local governments. This chapter offers an analysis of how migration and integration policies have evolved at various levels during the past decades, including at the EU, national, and local levels, as well as in some cases at the regional level. This enables us to understand the factors that drive policies at the different levels and the extent to which these lead to convergence or divergence between the levels. We analyse the relationsâor absence of relationsâbetween the levels of government. To make sense of these, we apply a framework that allows for different arrangements of the relations between levels of government. This is where the notion of âmultilevel governanceâ comes in as one possible way of structuring relations between various government levels."

266,173,0.988,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Introduction At the core of engagement, and similarly the idea of âcommunityâ as a whole, is the concept of social capital (Huysman and Wulf 2004). Social capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social interaction is vital, and in which social transactions are marked by cooperation, reciprocity and trust (Flora 1997), and where goods, services and interventions are produced in service of common goals. The concept of community policing is underlined by the exchange of social capital between the Police, other statutory and non-statutory organisations, citizens, communities and interest groups in pursuit of social cohesion and the collective efficacy that enables citizens and groups to participate in shaping the contexts and communities to which they belong and with whom they engage (Sampson and Raudenbush 1999). This exchange relies heavily on community participation, built upon trust and confidence in, and legitimacy of, those participating organisations and individuals. While the concepts of trust, confidence and legitimacy themselves are not inherently complex, they are values which are hard to foster, maintain and measure as the socio-political contexts and interactions that shape them are often multifaceted, fragile and sensitive to change. The concept of community policing itself has been discussed as an extension of the âsocial contractâ that exists between police and citizens (van der Giessen et al. 2017), placing additional requirements and demands on both parties. From a policing perspective, this requires the acceptance of citizens and communities as a partner in local safety and security, and from the perspective of those citizens an acceptance of the policeâs role within their communities.

14,178,0.988,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"In accordance with the Nordic tradition of voluntary organization, ethnic community-based organizations engaged in cultural and social activities can be places where members learn democratic values in practice. The governmentâs rationale for seeing the CBOs as a stepping-stone to wider civic and political engagement is the belief in this Nordic tradition where the voluntary organizations are expected to contribute to democratic education (White Paper No. 6 2012â2013, 123). There is an ambiguity in Norwegian government policy in this ï¬eld: The aim of supporting ethnic community-based organizations is not to strengthen the group as such, but rather to use the organizations as an arena to nudge individual children and youth towards civic and political participation in the Norwegian mainstream society. According to Berkaak (2012) the Norwegian policy is both ambiguous and vague, and when this policy is gradually implemented it might lead to measures that counteract each other in practice."
282,19,0.988,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"Second, some thinkers such as John Ralston Saul have described corporatism as a system in which organised elites get to influence the policy process at the expense of ordinary citizens.10 The same argument has been debated with respect to NGOs.11 For the question whether NGOs are an elite project, one should certainly differentiate between different types of civil society organisations, for example, between large and established institutions operating at an international level such as Amnesty International and small, community-based organisations. But when analysing partnerships between governmental organisations, corporations and civil society groups, one must bear in mind that large NGOs possess far greater visibility and resources for engaging in high-profile partnerships than grassroots organisations.12 Finally, both partnerships and corporatist solutions can have their most positive impact in policy areas rife with conflict. Addressing these conflicts through cooperative approaches does not only mitigate social unrest, it also improves compliance with the decisions taken. This aspect becomes the more important, the weaker the central control mechanisms of the political system in question are. But there are also important differences between these two concepts. First, corporatist political systems normally only include labour and business interests and focus on macroeconomic policy decisions. Partnerships can include these, but are rarely restricted to them. Rather, partnerships can cover the entire spectrum of policy issues. In each case, they will gather those groups that can affect the outcome and contribute to solving the problem addressed. Thus, for example, the World Commission on Dams (WCD) was composed of representatives of governments interested in large dam projects, companies specialised in building these large projects and civil society groups representing those affected by the dams, who were previously often engaged in violent protests against the dam projects.13 Second, the groups included in corporatist governance structures tend to be highly centralised, with business as well as labour organisations representing entire sectors. Partnerships, by contrast, often include small community-based organisations representing one very specific section of society or individual businesses whose operations have an impact on the goals of the partnership. Finally, corporatism is a system that usually operates in the context of a national political system.14 As such, its decision-making structures ultimately depend on the authority of the state. This can, but does not have to, lead to hierarchical decision-making procedures in corporatist institutions. Partnerships also work at the inter- or transnational level. While partnerships thus often operate âin the shadow of hierarchyâ,15 their decision-making processes by definition have to be non-hierarchical. Therefore only those corporatist arrangements with common and non-hierarchical decisionmaking procedures would qualify as partnerships."
284,177,0.988,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Leftwing governments, elite circulation and limitations to environmental governance shifts The ï¬rst such process of change is the shift in control of political resources related to the entering of power of centre-left governments, many of which represented groups that had previously been excluded from political power, including indigenous movements, labour movements, environmental movements and diverse social movements constituted by dispossessed groups. In spite of getting electoral support from these groups, many of the governments have later disqualiï¬ed or consciously attempted to co-opt some of them (Zibechi, 2010; Bowen, 2011), while new elites emerge. Thus we may observe a process of âcirculation of the elitesâ, controlling political resources with a possible impact on environmental governance. One example of that is found in Bolivia, where groups associated with the governing party MAS have started to gain political resources and"
126,386,0.988,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"If the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments continue their present course of violating internationally deï¬ned human rights, particularly those recognized in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Treaty (ICESCR), their actions may well be regarded as criminal. â¢ The crisis unfolding in the Ethiopia-Kenya-South Sudan transboundary region is fundamentally one of policy objectives and accountability. Ethiopian government and international development bank ofï¬cials have consistently described the purpose of the Gibe III dam and its associated developments as âessentialâ to Ethiopiaâs ânational interestâ and its âgrowth and transformationâ program and Ethiopiaâs electriï¬cation needs, including electriï¬cation for the ârural poor.â Yet the on-the-ground effects of this development in the lower Omo basin and Lake Turkana regionâalready in evidence during the early phases of this developmentâsuggest the makings of a humanitarian crisis with massive scale hunger and vulnerability to disease, cross-border inter-ethnic armed conflict, major government expropriation and political repression of citizens, and irreversible environmental destructionâoutcomes that can hardly be regarded as âprogress.â Despite these predictable effects already emerging in the transboundary region, however, both government and bank statements continue to label the development a sure âsuccess,â based on GNP and per capita income, energy and other projections for the nation as a whole.32 Sorting out the differences between such macro level projections and ground level realities for the half million citizens struggling to survive in three-nation transboundary area is key to a rational discourse concerning the economic and political future of the region. At the most general level, the policy choice is an unambiguous one. Either continue along the present road to social and natural resource devastationâa road rife with human rights violationsâor bring a halt to the destruction underway in order to initiate a new pathway for actionâone consistent with internationally recognized human rights and geared to creating a sustainable future for the peoples of the transboundary region as well the three nations involved. Continuing along the present road is an unacceptable option by any measure of project outcomes that includes the transboundary region's indigenous peoples. Even if the alternative pathway deï¬ned above were to be pursued, major questions emerge as to how to proceed. For example, how is it possible to take account of the increasingly desperate survival needs of the pastoral, agropastoral and ï¬shing peoples in the transboundary region that is most impacted by the development, while simultaneously addressing the aspirations of citizens in the region as a whole? Although insufï¬cient as full answers to this question, two matters require immediate attention if a solution to this challenge is to be constructed. First of all, there is legal imperative for action. Based on violations of human rights in the transboundary regionârights recognized by the ICESCR that must be restored. This requires restoring indigenous communities' access to food and the necessary means to produce it as part of their right to an adequate standard of living. Compliance with the ICESCR is not a choiceâit is a legally binding treaty. This action could be accomplished with at least a temporary suspension of the plans for Gibe III hydrodam electricity generation, an end to the withholding of downstream river flow and the reinstatement of Dasanech and Nyangatom communities to their lands and resources along the Omo River. Reinstatement of the Omo Riverâs flow would allow inflow to Lake Turkana, bringing at least temporary reprieve to hundreds of thousands of pastoralists and ï¬shers depending on the lakeâs resources. Such a suspension should trigger at least a pause in temporary suspension of large-scale irrigated plantation construction as well, while an acceptable future scenario is being constructed."
293,219,0.988,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Some municipalities, for instance, have had controversial objectives like encouraging remigration. Questions could also be asked about the way initiatives are set up, executed, and assessed. The economic crisis and resulting budget cuts in Western Europe since 2008 has put co-development programmes under pressure, threatening along with them some migrant organizationsâ funding for translocal activities. Funding constraints have also affected the activities of local governments in origin countries, as all levels of government have had to slash budgets. Nationally funded support programmes have been phased out, which has had an impact at the local level (Van Ewijk 2013). According to Van Ewijk (ibid.), linking to countries of origin remains on the agendas of those local governments that have already established linkages, but financial resources dedicated to these partnerships have been reduced, and government actors are playing a less intensive role, creating more room for civil society to step in. Some local governments have shifted their international cooperation focus to economic objectives and increasingly focus on partnerships with cities in emerging economies like the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). As such, the transnational linkages of local governments and migrant organizations represent a highly dynamic form of relationship between countries of destination and countries of origin.

169,808,0.988,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"lack of expertise that is regionally or locally available for ï¬shermen who need expert consultation. As a result, progress in improving ï¬shing methods is blocked by lack of capacity to learn or to organize. In the face of poor inter-level communication and sporadic or absent monitoring, the use of illegal equipment and ï¬shing practices only mounts. It is hard to imagine how trust in governance can be built to strengthen compliance with laws and policies under such conditions, and evidence of this eroding trust is that in some areas local ï¬shermen have swung their allegiance from republican to traditional authorities. Traditional authorities still constitute legitimate local sources of governance. Traditional institutions play a vital role in reafï¬rming the identity of communities reliant on aquatic ecosystems and thereby broadly inï¬uence water and ï¬sh management. However, the current governance structure has failed to link and harmonize republican and traditional sources. And efforts to decentralize have been poorly implemented, e.g., local management committees lack the funding to even meet regularly, or have been taken over by special economic or political interests, i.e., elite capture. The governmental bodies responsible for the ï¬sheries sector are unaware of womenâs speciï¬c role in the ï¬sheries management. Consequently they did not consider females adequately as crucial actors in their strategic and political programs. SUSFISHs sociological research on ï¬sh as an important income-generating resource shed light on women as important preserving stakeholders (e.g., systempreserving functions) in the economic, nutrition, and health domains. Interdisciplinary work revealed important cross-sectoral activities, interrelated power relations, and hindering factors that play key roles in the value chain issue of the resource ï¬sh in BF. However, notwithstanding their important economic role, since women are excluded from decision-making processes on local levels, the focus of future analysis should be oriented toward the impeding factors emerging from incomplete or misguided education, structures of associations, and power asymmetries. These ï¬ndings resulted in the draft of a strategy for the integration of these aspects in the ï¬sheries management policies, which was developed in SUSFISH. By law there are two kinds of status of ï¬sheries based on management type: concession and PHIE (Perimetre Halieutique dâIntÃ©rÃªt Economique), i.e., a ï¬shery that impacts the national economy. But actually, there are three categories of ï¬sheries management: very large reservoirs that never dry out and ï¬shing continues for much of the year [PHIE; BagrÃ©, Kompienga, Sourou, Ziga, ToÃ©cÃ©, Douna, Yakouta, Sirba (eight reservoirs) and Lake Bam] and concessions and âothersâ that have no legal status. Note: subsistence ï¬sheries exist in all three categories mentioned above. Besides this, by law there are four categories of ï¬sheries deï¬ned according to the use of the catch: commercial, subsistence, sport, and scientiï¬c. According to SUSFISH ï¬ndings, this categorization does not reï¬ect the status quo. Besides subsistence ï¬sheries all other categories are not represented signiï¬cantly. Into what category a ï¬shery falls depends on how national policies are prioritizedâthe PHIE are ânationally importantâ reservoirs, whereas the latter are more âsubsistence levelâ ï¬shing for local markets (Fig. 27.5).

364,454,0.988,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"designated either as Urbanization-Restricted Areas or Agriculture Promotion Areas. However farmlands and forests in the Kanagawa region are rapidly decreasing due to urbanization and industrial development. In the areas closest to the urban districts the encroachment of housing and manufacturing damages the landscape of rural areas. Inside satoyama areas aging farmers give up farming and forestry and their children move away to work in offices. This results in the devastation of rural landscapes. To save satoyama areas from this deterioration the Kanagawa Prefectural Government enacted a bylaw in 2007, and this was followed by the Satoyama Conservation Action Plan in 2009. The Satoyama Conservation Bylaw aims to enrich peopleâs wellbeing by developing the multiple functions of satoyama in Kanagawa. Satoyama have a multifaceted significance, providing seasonal scenery, biodiversity, cultural heritage, fresh air, safe food, disaster relief, etc. The bylaw underscores the role of community and municipal government in the conservation of satoyama landscapes. It is the prefectural government that selects âSatoyama Conservation Areasâ and accredits âSatoyama Conservation Partnership Agreementsâ between landowners and local action groups. The prefectural government provides financial and technical assistance for local action groups, who purchase grass cutters and chainsaws using subsidies. The Agriculture Division of Kanagawa Prefectural Government hosts programs to raise public awareness of satoyama among people of different generations, including farming experience programs for school children, satoyama symposiums, and other initiatives. In the Action Plan the prefectural government set the goal of selecting 16 conservation areas and 20 partnership agreements by 2013. By 2012 13 areas had been designated as Satoyama conservation sites and 14 local action groups had established Satoyama Conservation Partnership Agreements to engage in satoyama conservation activities (see Fig. 20.1). They range from the smallest Ishikawa-Maruyama area (12 ha) to the largest Kuno area (2,800 ha). The larger areas include mountain forests, while farmlands are relatively modest in size and divided into small plots. Some mountain forests are the common property of landowners. Based on the established partnership agreements, action groups borrow the abandoned farmlands and forest from the landowners to rehabilitate them for use (see Fig. 20.2). Besides the rehabilitation of farmlands and forest, local action groups have utilized the resources of satoyama landscapes in different ways as shown in Table 20.1. The most popular activity is environmental education. Local action groups invite school teachers and students to their satoyama areas to provide a âfieldâ for the study of nature and biodiversity. There is a growing interest in a âhands-onâ approach to environmental education among school teachers, and satoyama offer them the ideal opportunity for this. In some areas action groups hold various events with the local neighborhood organizations to teach traditional knowledge and cultural heritage such as traditional cooking, toys, and crafts to small children. In the Kuno area of Odawara City the action group invites children and their parents living in the city center to plant soba (buckwheat) as shown in Fig. 20.3. After planting the soba a member of the action group plays educational nature games with the children to teach them the various species of insects."
246,367,0.988,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The current European policy response to pressures on biodiversity can be either with site protection (e.g. SPAs SACs), or with the regulation of the activities of those exploiting the land, which can also be relying on voluntary actions, i.e. with Agri-Environmental Schemes (EEA 2004). Rewilding abandoned farmland can efficiently contribute to reaching European and global conservation targets. But in order to do so, a policy framework must be designed to include rewilding in the land management options given to practitioners (see Chap. 1). To that extent, European conservation policies must aim toward several goals. In places where people still keep a strong link with nature, a wilderness comeback via natural regeneration should not be excessively problematic (McGrory Klyza 2001). Yet, when the link with traditional landscapes is the strongest, as in many regions of Europe, rewilding might be perceived negatively (Bauer et al. 2009; Hochtl et al. 2005). Communication between scientists, policy-makers, decisionmakers, and the public will be essential to allow the implementation of rewilding, and to promote the values of wilderness in a landscape. Development initiatives are also known to ease the transitions between one form of management and another, for instance by increasing the support of local communities for the protected area (Pinto and PartidÃ¡rio 2012). Giving the opportunities to populations to shift their activities from low-income agriculture to ecotourism in rewilded areas can be an efficient way to meet both ends (see Chaps. 3 and 9). The proposed âgreeningâ reform of the CAP could further compensate stakeholders maintaining low productive practices in order to preserve traditional agricultural habitats (Hochkirch et al. 2013). Another option is to maintain payments for farmers that apply environmentally friendly practices on productive soils, and redirect subsidies on less productive lands towards rewilding (Merckx and Pereira, in press). By doing so, Member States will still be able to meet the demands for agricultural goods, yet promoting responsible and green practices on productive soils, while the lands left abandoned due to their remoteness, their lower productivity, and the difficulty to cultivate them (MacDonald et al. 2000; Rey Benayas et al. 2007, and see Chap. 1) will be rewilded and managed for other activities linked with wilderness. Such approach can be seen as land-sharing at the local scale (with"

Following Pappi and Henning (1999), we focus on direct access, leaving the analysis of indirect brokerage relations for future work (Henning 2009). The densities of the support network are reported in Table 2. As demonstrated in Table 2, donor organizations have good access to the most powerful governmental organizations, especially MoF and MoAFS, but national stakeholders only have access to MoAFS, MoIWD and the president (i.e., OPC). Interestingly, access to legislative parties is dominated by national stakeholder organizations, primarily CSO, and farm organizations; donors have no access to legislative parties. Moreover, political institutions depend on their mutual political support, and most political institutions exhibit relatively high densities above 0.5 (see Table 2). The mutual dependence of the"

The Turkish state tends to run smaller education-orientated programs, such as providing school materials and equipment, funding and renovating buildings, and promoting Turkish language and cultural courses. Education initiatives such as these are not only a method of expanding Turkish soft power, but are also felt to contribute to social peacemaking through intercultural dialogue. Both officials and third state actors believe that education is a key peacebuilding tool that can counter the narrative of extremism and provide opportunities for the future. Finally, Turkeyâs social peacebuilding activities are also characterized by an emphasis on mediation and religiously sensitive programs. Officials have stated the importance of mediation, not only at an inter-state level but also at the local level, through everyday activities and engagement with locals. This may range from consulting with communities to discussions with political authorities on bilateral projects. Turkish officials feel that mediation and consultation are mechanisms that support their own espoused principles of national ownership. These principles can perhaps also be seen to guide the concept of cultural and religiously sensitive programs. These range from sponsoring intercultural activities such as visits to Turkey or football tournaments to providing Qurans or circumcision ceremonies for boys for example, in countries such as Afghanistan and Niger (TIKA 2014a, b; 2016). The building of mosques or events during Islamic festivals such as book fairs or Iftar have been staged from Afghanistan to Mogadishu and Pakistan. Given the scope of these programs globally, religious sensitivity is clearly a central aspect of Turkeyâs activities. Such programs are not only pragmatic but they also add legitimacy to Turkish activities in the eyes of locals. In Afghanistan, reports noted that Turkish projects were more acceptable to communities than others because of their perceived sensitivity to local Afghan culture (Murphy and Sazak 2012)."
174,260,0.988,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"Not all activities conducted in the name of building peace appear to be contributing toward this objective. In the crowded donor environment and the fragile security situation in Somalia, the level of coordination and cooperation required for donors to be conflict sensitive is almost impossible without stifling the efficiency, aptness, and therefore effectiveness of programs. This is one of the main differences in the approach of traditional donors and that of other recent actors in Somalia. As previously mentioned, while traditional actors are said to focus more on systems, checks and balances, new actors such as the UAE and Turkey appear more concerned with the quick delivery of products or services. One interviewee stated that Somalis value tangible projects, and the problem for traditional donors is that systems cannot appear overnight and as a result of their focus on this, less is expected from them.32 Turkeyâs peacebuilding initiatives in Somalia highlight important alternative approaches, while offering vital lessons for all stakeholders to improve upon. The Somalia case study reveals several best practices, implemented by the Turkish state and its agencies that may be applied to other post-conflict reconstruction settings. Deployment of personnel in conflict-affect areas, consulting and responding quickly to stakeholderâs and recipientâs needs, refraining from securitizing and attaching conditions to aid, avoiding middle-men or brokers in order to avert security risks, engaging local partners, and not overcrowding the fragile institutions of the host countryâs vital bureaucracy are some of the approaches that Turkey brings to the spectrum. Some of these modes of engagement are similar to those espoused by traditional donors. However, while traditional donors appear to become stalled in the processes of ensuring principles are followed Turkey shows more flexibility and openness to changing procedures to meet the goal. The Somali case study has also affirmed that there is still room for improvement for Turkeyâs peacebuilding activities in Somalia. The bilateral engagement on the ministerial level with Somali entities, without informing other Turkish state organizations, leads to overcrowding of the theater and waste of resources. Although Turkey has taken concrete steps to address some of these issues by coordinating some of its efforts with the international community and organizations, on a domestic level interagency cooperation still lags. Worse, institutional and legislative remedies to unravel this knot linger. Therefore, Turkey should use the Somalia case to single out some of its coordination issues and devise a solution that can"
350,410,0.988,"Protecting The Rights of People With Autism in The Fields of Education and Employment : international, European and National Perspectives","The protection of the rights of people with autism in the fields of education and employment is far from being uniform within the European Union. Among countries substantial differences exist with regard to the legal regimes in favour of persons with ASD and, currently, only few European countries have developed specific legislation or national plans and strategies on autism. As flexible instruments addressing the needs of people with ASD, national autism plans and strategies set out adapted, life-long support and services to enable them to enjoy full inclusion and participation in relevant social fields. The national autism plans and strategies developed in the United Kingdom are good practices as they take into account the needs of people with autism from childhood to adulthood and are more respondent to the principles and rights enshrined in the CRPD. In particular, the Northern Ireland Autism Strategy (2013â2020) and its Action Plan (2013â2016) are modeled on the CRPD which is expressly recalled as a legal source to which their strategic priorities are conformed in order to reinforce the human rights of persons with autism in the domestic legal order. While specific legislation in favour of people with ASD are generally lacking, some legislative measures in the fields of education, vocational training and lifelong learning, and employment apply to people with autism. In the field of education, the current tendency in EU Member States is to develop a policy towards inclusion of pupils with special educational needs. There are still countries with a selective rather than an inclusive education system, but some advancements have been put in place. On the contrary, some EU Member States, such as Italy or UK, have long been leaders in protecting the right to education of children with disabilities and their legislations have much to offer as implementing practice of Article 24 of the CRPD. However, many challenges remain reflecting"
320,315,0.988,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"10.6.5 Working Step: Stakeholder Involvement, Communication and Participation Many conflicts in protected areas are caused by land-users and other stakeholders not accepting the objectives and measures of nature conservation because they stand contrary to their interests. It is essential to include and integrate those stakeholders and land users in the process of adaptation. This is vital for the increase of acceptance and to find win-win-solutions that help all parties involved to adapt to climate change. To foster stakeholder involvement existing conflicts and problems with land-users and stakeholders have to be analysed and documented, and suitable strategies for participation and communication must be identified. Furthermore, land-users and other stakeholders will also have to adapt to climate change (for example, artificial irrigation to avoid drought, or snow cannons to extend tourist seasons). Such autonomous adaptation activities might not even be directly attributed to climate change. However, they can be in conflict with protection efforts, increase existing problems or even create new threats to conservation goals. Hence, the autonomous adaptation of stakeholders should be monitored and guided by conservation management. Successful adaptation to climate change requires the close cooperation of diverse stakeholders, land-users, administrators, and scientists. Each of the"

Bergh visas, visas tied to particular employers, and no flexibility to switch to other admission categories are all conditions that create incentives for migrants to leave the programs and move into irregular statusâ. They therefore suggest that âincentives for circulation, like pension portability or an âearnedâ right to remain permanently, may be more effective than enforcement measuresâ (2008: 23). It seems that the Spanish government is making progress along these lines, as its Ministry of Labour and Immigration produced the Plan EstratÃ©gico de CiudadanÃ­a e IntegraciÃ³n (Strategic Plan for Citizenship and Integration) for 2007â2010, which was approved by the Spanish Government in 2007. Among other measures, the Plan includes actions to foster the inclusion of seasonal workers and encourage their return with skills and resources enabling them to act as development agents in their places of origin. This is sought through active employment policies in countries of origin and voluntary return programmes.25 The Plan also seeks to encourage the signing of bilateral social security agreements with several countries (as of 2010, not yet with Senegal) for the recognition of pension rights and other benefits, which could be a stimulus for temporary and circular mobility in the medium and long term (EMN 2010: 22â23). Since bilateral treaties still mostly do not take into account the views of the migrants themselves (Wabgou 2008: 148), such policy changes would help migrants to fulfil their life projects. As Riccio (2001: 590) observes, most Senegalese migrants in Europe would prefer to conduct truly transnational lives, living part of the year here and the other part there, and making the best of both worlds. However, âfar from being in a post-national era [â¦], transnational organization still needs to negotiate with nation and local state regulatory and sometimes exclusionary practices as well as with the representations of immigrants held in the migration contextâ (Riccio 2001: 590, citing Grillo/Riccio/Salih 2000).26"
126,390,0.988,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"â¢ It has become commonplace among development specialists and researchers with extensive ï¬eld-based experience in some bilateral aid agencies (particularly in Scandinavia) and non-governmental organizations to regard cooperative investigation with communities as essential to the production of accurate, thorough and useful analysis of a regionâs socioeconomy and environmental status, as well as identiï¬cation of the local residents' most pressing needs. Multiple forms of community/investigator cooperative approaches to considering livelihood systems, natural resource use patterns in relation to possible development (or conservation) policies have transpired in ways that actually assist communities in improving their life circumstances, rather than undermine them. Local communities likely to be most affected by the development in question need to be included as active participants in all phases of impact assessments and related studies, including: âidentifying the socioeconomic and environmental parameters, or âboundingâ of the task at hand, âgathering information and data (ï¬eld derived components, at least), with ongoing interpretation, and âdrawing conclusions and summarizing the key issues derived from the effort, including their signiï¬cance for the future of local communities and their environment. Much has been learned about cooperative processes between external investigators and local communities that increase accurateness of results. In pastoral and agropastoral contexts, for example, it is clear that local participants need to be selected through dialogue with traditional leaders, rather than government appointed ones. Broad-based and community-held discussions are a critical component and these need to be held in all phases of the work and throughout the geographic area being considered. At community gatherings, local participants, including community leaders, male and female elders and both genders of youth need to actively engage in the above dimensions of the collective effort. Those community members involved in core roles of the investigation have a major roles in planning items for open community discussion and community feedback, while working closely on a daily basis with external investigators. The results from open meetings (as well as from âfeedback surveysâ, etc.) need to be incorporated into the ï¬nal assessment, or reportâincluding its summary and conclusions. Results and conclusions need to be made presented to communities prior to releasing them to policymakers and client institutions. Finally, all such documents must be fully transparent and available to the public. Constructive baseline studies and environmental/socioeconomic impact assessments (ESIAs) and the like need to be unrestricted in their ability to question the project or development approach in question, based upon its ï¬ndings. This contrasts sharply with the existing arrangement for the Omo basin projects detailed in Chap. 6, for example, where implementation of the project is presumed to be a result of the ESIAâa situation permitting opportunity only for âsuggestedâ after-the-fact mitigation or monitoring actions, or additional studies, while the project moved to completion. The Gibe III assessment scenario, unfortunately, is indication of the predominant pattern in assessment related study contractingâone involving major âreciprocityâ and ârevolving doorâ relationships. â¢ Changes in both perspective and method of this order obviously necessitate a signiï¬cant shift in accountability relations. Clearly, investigators have some basic accountability to those who contract them. Yet to assure a cooperative outcome, with accuracy of the work produced, they must also have genuine accountability to local communities which have sufï¬cient authority to ensure that the content and outcomes of investigation represent the realities of their lives and their environments, and authority to guarantee that their voice will be heard well beyond their immediate localitiesâin fact in the distant ofï¬ces of policymakers and politicians. It should be clear that global consulting industry corporations and individualsâparties well-equipped and experienced in accepting accountability only to their client institutions in a system that amounts to a âcontract treadmillâ and too often, a âcomplicity treadmillâ involving very large sums of money, are ill-equipped for such an orientation. â¢ A participatory, community-inclusive approach to studies and impact assessments for consideration of development programs is best implemented by non-governmental organizations, academics (research units or groups, individuals), relatively small consulting organizations, rather than by global consulting industry representatives. Lead investigators should be able to demonstrate qualiï¬cations including: âIn-depth familiarity with the geographic region concerned, including with substantive ï¬eld-based experience in the region or one closely paralleling it. âAppropriate professional training credentials in socioeconomic or human ecological (broadly deï¬ned) ï¬elds. âExperience and commitment to studies weighted to ï¬eld-based investigation rather than âdesk studiesâ with utilization of available printed information, etc., and brief ï¬eld âvisitsâ."

Regional collaboration already being promoted in the context of the development of the European Qualifications Framework is proving to be a stimulus for European countries to reflect on how they can place non-formal and informal learning outcomes directly into their national qualifications frameworks (NQFs). In the European Commission, the Cluster on the Recognition of Learning Outcomes â the largest of the eight education and training clusters â supports countries in developing NQFs and systems for VNFIL. The cluster uses peer-learning activities to exchange good practice and channel collective efforts. Several countries in Southeast Asia have called for more opportunities to learn from countries in the sub-region, such as Australia and New Zealand, who have extensive experience in accrediting and assessing non-formal and informal learning. This could be advocated as an agenda in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and in the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO) regional meetings. As cross-border migration grows around the world, recognition across national borders becomes a pressing need. In Mexico, there are calls to support Mexican migrant workers through the recognition of their competences with a view to enhancing integration into the North American labour markets. The recognition of learning gained outside the UK is also a theme in Scotlandâs higher education sector, particularly linked to internationalisation. A scoping study was undertaken by the SCQF Partnership, Glasgow Caledonian University, on behalf of Universities Scotland, Scotlandâs Colleges and Skills Development Scotland. The outcome was the presentation to the Scottish government of three sustainable recognition and support models for refugees and migrant workers, with potential transferability to other groups under-represented in education and employment (Guest and Vecchia 2010, in Whittaker 2011). In Africa, the harmonisation of qualification frameworks is becoming an emerging issue in regional integration and the mutual recognition of qualifications is rapidly becoming a necessity. RVA is an important component in the Transnational Qualifications Framework (TQF) and TQF procedures and policies. In this context, Mauritius recommends that collaboration between all stakeholders be further strengthened not only locally, but also at the regional and international level. Consolidating the network to include countries which have implemented or wish to implement RVA would facilitate the collection of a considerable body of information to render the RVA system more effective. Challenges in the Informal Economy There are challenges specific to developing countries to which RVA policy, legislation and lifelong learning strategies need to respond. The first is skills recognition"

Although urban planning is not a specific European policy, competence, actually economic, social and territorial cohesion all have a strong urban dimension: as the vast majority of Europeans live in or depend on cities, their developments cannot be isolated from a wider European policy framework (European Commission, DG Regional Policy 2011b). The URBACT III Operational Programme 2014â2020 includes among its specific objectives to ensure a participatory approach through the involvement of the relevant stakeholders in the action-planning process (URBACT Study 2015; URBACT II 2015) . Also at international level, the United Nations Agenda (Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development) includes participation among postmillennial Goals. Indeed, one of them (16) aims to âPromote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levelsââtogether with its commitment (16.7) to âresponsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decisionmaking at all levelsâ. Furthermore, it cannot be avoided to consider the arising of platforms, software and applications, often seen as solutions to societal needs: they enable exchange, communication and the creation of a community of citizens and other stakeholders on shared interests and concerns. They are seen as tools to empower citizens, including marginalized groups, improve public services and at the same time ensure equal access to information and promote democracy (European Commission 2015). For this reason, EU bodies began recognizing the role of ICT to foster new forms of civic engagement in urban planning, as a social innovation and to support social innovations. Within the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Digital Agenda recognizes the key role of public administrations in creating the condition to foster social innovation, becoming more and more âopen, flexible and collaborative in their relations with citizensâ and promoting the âeGovernment to increase their efficiency and effectiveness and to constantly improve public services in a way that caters for userâs different needsâ. At a time of highly constrained public resources, ICT is seen as a tool to help the public sector develop innovative ways of delivering its services to citizens while unleashing efficiencies and driving down costs. Within the 2020 Digital Agenda, it has been launched the European eGovernment Action Plan 2011â2015âharnessing ICT to promote smart, sustainable and innovative Government [COM(2010) 743 final].

The above lessons have been derived and documented by working with the communities in the region which brings out a clear need for a robust disaster risk reduction mechanism having a potential to minimize disaster risk for the communities living at the frontlines. The Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)2 promotes such a people-centred approach to early warning as one of the priority areas for communities to avoid risks. The objective of people-centred early warning systems is to empower individuals and communities threatened by hazards to act in sufficient time and in an appropriate manner so as to reduce the possibility of personal injury, loss of life, damage to property and the environment and loss of livelihoods The underpinning assumption is that this requires strong community participation on the ground and enabling environment for greater cooperation across various stakeholders including the government authorities in India and Nepal across levels on knowledge and information sharing. As it is known that the resilience agenda could also move to become a more integral part of ongoing local development processes, so it would be appropriate to look into the above processes and policies in the mainstream development planning."
347,250,0.987,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, regional collaboration was more or less restricted to governmental discussions within the framework of the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) and scientific collaboration at expert levels. The cold war placed strict limits on what was politically possible to achieve. According to some observers, HELCOM was primarily a means for the Soviet Union to find a relatively neutral ground for airing declarations mainly targeted at US audiences (Hjorth 1992). However, the early role of HELCOM as a first institutionalisation of regional collaboration for the protection of the Baltic Sea environment should not be underestimated (Hassler 2003b). During HELCOMâs first two decades of existence, important scientific contacts were developed especially between researchers from Nordic countries and the Soviet Union. These Baltic Sea networks were important building blocks and resulted in several recommendations made by the still rudimentary, epistemic communities on concrete measure that could be taken with regard to ecological threats to the Baltic Sea environment. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the declaration of independence of Baltic states and the democratisation of Poland in the early 1990s, four overarching changes affecting Baltic Sea environmental governance took place in the following two decades. First, the liberation of the Baltic states and democratisation of Poland sparked off extensive bilateral support programmes from primarily Sweden, Finland and Denmark (Hassler 2003a). These programmes often involved governmental actors, such as municipalities and county boards, as well as non-governmental actors, for example, CECAMS (Centre for Environmental Science and Management) and Environmental Consultancy and Monitoring Centre, both from Latvia.2 In order to establish collaborative schemes, twinning agreements were made between donor and recipient countries (Hassler et al. 2011). In these agreements, a public authority or private company in the donor country collaborated with a counterpart in the recipient country in order to stimulate transfer of knowledge and know-how (Hassler et al. 2011). Financing was typically secured through government funds or international financial institutions such as NEFCO (Nordic Environment Finance Corporation), EBRD (the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and IBRD (the World Bank). In addition to these collaborative schemes, transnational initiatives were taken, such as collaboration among political parties, labour unions, NGOs and sector organisations. For example, political parties in Sweden and Finland collaborated with sister organisations in the Baltic states, and labour unions similarly had projects targeting areas such as gender equality and workplace democracy. Typically, these undertakings were partly financed by public sources (Hassler 2003a). Taken together, these new forms of interaction all contributed to"

99,417,0.987,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Labour market policy is largely a function of central government who are responsible for activation strategies in local areas. However, due to Birmingham containing some of the most deprived areas with the highest levels of unemployment in England, various central government initiatives have been implemented locally through the city council since 2000. These initiatives have had addressing unemployment as their sole objective or as part of wider neighbourhood or regeneration strategies. The Working Neighbourhoods Fund (WNF), which came from the national Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Work and Pensions of the previous Labour government, was a key programme for Birmingham. The city was allocated Â£118 million over 3 years from 2008, and almost half of the WNF resources specifically targeted worklessness (worklessness is a wider term than unemployment as it includes everyone of working age who does not work no matter what their circumstances). The funds were allocated as part of a general grant given directly to local authorities. This was not ring-fenced, and so local authorities were able to use it as they saw fit to support the delivery of local, regional and national priorities. Therefore, the remainder of the WNF was allocated to strategic partners to address barriers to worklessness and other key priorities such as supporting business, improving educational attainment and skills, addressing health inequalities, encouraging active involvement in sport and culture, improving energy efficiency, reducing the number of people living in temporary accommodation and making the city a safer place. Significantly, the WNF enabled the development of a targeted approach at a local ward level to select and commission organisations to help people find work (described in the following chapter). It also led to the Worklessness Innovations Fund which provided small grants of up to Â£25,000 for feasibility studies, research and demonstration projects. In 2010, 44 organisations were awarded resources to try new and interesting ways of helping people gain employment, of which TFMP was one. The organisation responsible for YEER, TFMP, is a social enterprise set up in 2009 after identifying a gap in the market for an organisation to support the aims and aspirations of disadvantaged young people in the West Midlands. The organisation works primarily with women and young people, particularly those classed as NEET and from ethnic minority backgrounds. The philosophy of TFMP is to âenable and empower young people to achieve their potential through enterpriseâ. The concept is very much about developing individual ideas and talents, to âopen new gateways to disadvantaged groups who find it hard to engage meaningfully with traditional business networksâ. TFMP focuses on self-employment and enterprise creation and encourages the individuals they work with to develop new social enterprises to benefit local economies. Underpinning their work is that services and opportunities should be those that young people have determined they want themselves, not just with them in mind."

The Chair and Vice-Chair of GEO BON are elected unpaid positions. The GEO BON committees reconstitute themselves in a staggered fashion, striving to keep a disciplinary, regional and other balance while adapting to emerging challenges. GEO BON working groups are established around speciï¬c tasks or themes and are open to membership by any expert or practitioner. Working groups are not permanent features, but last as long as they need to achieve a given objective, or for as long as that objective is a priority, and for as long as they are deemed effective. Biodiversity Observation Networks (BONs) contribute to the collection and analysis of harmonised biodiversity observations, develop interoperable biodiversity monitoring programs, and help make biodiversity data and data products available. BONs can cover a political unit such as a country (National BON), a region (Regional BON), or a speciï¬c theme (Thematic BON) such as a taxonomic group, ecosystem type, or even monitoring approach. Working groups and BONs report to the implementation committee, but are given a great deal of individual freedomâand minimal resourcingâwith respect to how they constitute themselves and achieve their objectives. GEO BON is supported by a small secretariat of employed ofï¬cers, typically funded by a host organisation. GEO BON reports to GEO on its activities and responds to GEO initiatives as appropriate.

181,173,0.987,Global Perspectives On Recognising Non-Formal and informal Learning : Why Recognition Matters (Volume 21.0),"In the USA (Travers 2011), Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) is not governed by legislation. However, some of the six regional accreditation commissions located across the country have issued policies on PLA. These commissions are responsible for monitoring the quality of higher education in the USA through a formal accreditation process. PLA is driven by several stakeholders. RVA is conducted by many colleges and universities as well as employers. Development has been facilitated by the American Council on Education (ACE) and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL). ACE is the national body responsible for coordinating higher education institutions across the country. CAEL is a national, non-profit organisation that works with educational institutions, employers, labour organisations and other stakeholders to promote creative, effective adult learning strategies. Networks and structures like CAEL aim to bring greater coherence to RVA at the level of higher education. In the majority of the developing countries, ministries of education and, in particular, departments of non-formal education are assuming a new role, evolving from mere providers of services into bodies that supervise the coordination of stakeholders. Where this is happening, as is the case in the Philippines and Thailand, public authorities are the main initiators in promoting the issue of recognition. The role of social partnerships with civil society organisations is increasingly being recognised, although governments have approached the topic of decentralisation with caution thus far. This is because many of these countries lack a formal legislative or policy framework for RVA. Skills are assessed and certified on an individual basis by education providers. While this way of conducting validation appears to be quite flexible, it actually exposes the learner to the arbitrariness of the assessing institution. In such cases, we argue, it is important to ensure that individual education and training providers have access to the right tools, content and funding to develop RVA at their level."
302,201,0.987,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Most of African freshwater bodies are transboundary (see Table 1), and therefore their management requires cooperation and effective, coherent regional environmental policies [58]. However, the management of most African transboundary lakes and rivers ecosystems is largely compromised by conflicting political standings among the riparian countries [59]. A good example of this is Lake Victoria which is shared by Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Its management has been challenging due to a lack of good cooperation and harmonized policies mainly following the collapse of East African Community of 1977. Despite its reformation, there are still country-specific political issues hindering the management of the lake. This is also the case for other African Great Lakes like Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi. However, when policies, conventions, and cooperations do occur, the major focus is often on how natural resources can be shared [60], rather than the control of pollutants. Thus, at an international level, the political will to combat issues like MP pollution is not strong and is equally problematic at the local level. In most African countries, MP pollution is not recognized as emergent issue of concern, although the efforts to levy, reduce, and ban the use of plastic bags [26, 27] would suggest that the plastic issue is not entirely ignored. It is perhaps stereotypical to consider, but in many African nations, the challenges faced are greater than MP pollution â war, famine, literacy rate, infrastructure, clean drinking water, poverty, and corruption [61]. Moreover, most African countries have insufficient budgets from which to plan and execute governmental projects including research activities. A number of countries receive financial aid, and under these circumstances, and understandably, the study of MP pollution is not of the highest priority. Based on this, the current financial challenges of working with MPs in African waters may not be solved by local budgets but rather by bringing together different stakeholders (i.e., local community, local and national governments, NGOs, researchers), in order to first collect data, evaluate steps forward, and implement effective measure to halt MP pollution."

Policies have evolved and are now formulated with recognition of the right to the city of slum dwellers. Broadly speaking, the âRight to the Cityâ included in the United Nations Rights to Housing seeks to promote equal access to the potential benefits of the city for all urban dwellers and encourages the democratic participation of all urban dwellers in decision-making processes, notably at the municipal level, so that they may fully realize their fundamental rights and liberties. This has significant implications for both slum upgrading and relocation and redevelopment initiatives, as well as rental and social housing. Brazil, for instance, has rebuilt its whole urban governance policy around the concept of the right to the city. A 2001 federal law, âCity Statute,â which regulates urban policy specifically recognizes the âright to the cityâ and mandates the inclusion of the dwellers in the urban planning process. However, the effective application of the âCity Statuteâ depends on the political will of public officials at the local and state levels. MagalhÃ£es and di Villarosa (2013) provide useful recommendations for the design of public policies for slum upgrading and urban development. They specifically highlight the importance of key factors such as the following: (1) legitimacy based on social demand; (2) political will with involvement of key public actors; (3) a holistic approach with complementary policies addressing urban poverty and sustainability of programs; (4) attention to quality despite cost constraints. They also emphasized the need for flexible design; and proper geographical and social targeting of programs."

This clearly demonstrates the third challenge that prior notiï¬cation and consultation processes often have to cope with. That is that the perceptions of the conclusions from a notiï¬cation and consultation process (often not even ofï¬cially terminated) tend to vary considerably across the countries involved. This is often linked to the fact that the possible outcomes of such processes are not clear to all parties beforehandâespecially since downstream and potentially affected states tend to see such notiï¬cation and consultation mechanisms as means for voicing their veto against a project, while upstream states often tend to be critical toward interference in their water resources development activities. In addition to notiï¬cation-speciï¬c challenges, this example from the Mekong also illustrates that joint river basin management and related activities are crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainable and cooperative development of shared river basins. Solid knowledge of the status of a river basin as well as joint basin planning activities can ensure that riparian states to a shared basin are informed about each countryâs development plans early on in the process and it can, moreover, help countries to choose projects that provide the most beneï¬ts to all riparian states and the basin while producing the least negative effects. And it demonstrates that insufï¬cient processes of river basin management can signiï¬cantly hamper the sustainable development of the basin and the relations between riparian countries more generally."
284,302,0.987,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"practices, such as collective rules in use and trust, are important for promoting social capital. In general terms, communities with the strongest organization are also those where protection and conservation activities are more frequent and diverse. This pattern reveals the relevance high levels of social organization required to support local coordination and collective action addressing forest protection and conservation activities. A small number of communities, however, perform forest-protection activities at high intensity. This pattern is a possible outcome of government subsidies for reforestation. In contrast, a reduced number of highly organized communities showed very few protection and conservation practices. These cases reveal that communities may be organized for different purposes that do not necessarily coincide with forest conservation. In summary, social organization is an important requirement for performing conservation activities but it is not sufï¬cient for creating incentives to engage in forest protection. Protection and conservation activities are closely related to the development of community forestry. The forest economy tends to be low where local institutions are weak. As a result, limited protection and conservation activities lead to increased pressure on forests. Interestingly, pressure on forests drops considerably according to the increasing importance of commercial forest activity in communities. In cases where recent deforestation took place, forest economy in the communities is weak. In general, communities with lower levels of pressure on forests are those with the most consolidated economic forest activities. This information suggests that as the incentives, knowledge and technical skills increase â as a result of a more diversiï¬ed community forest economy â community members are more able and willing to identify and address pressures on forests before their impacts grow out of control. Communities with the highest level of local forest economy34 tend to have lower institutional strength in comparison to communities with only vertical integration of forest production. The former needs stronger and more diversiï¬ed institutions in order to manage industrial and commercial operations, diversify forest production and carry out multiple activities, such as timber extraction and processing. However, as these data reveal, new economic forest activities may lack the institutional support to scale up their commercial activities. If not properly addressed, these âinstitutional gapsâ can undermine common natural resources used in production processes, collective initiatives and community governance itself."
14,132,0.987,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"million people have been displaced internally, and another 480,000 have sought refuge in neighbouring countries (OCHA 2014). New diaspora communities are being formed in neighbouring African countries, while more established ones are again mobilizing to respond to the deteriorating local, regional and global conditions. As a case in point, in early January 2014, a group of South Sudanese diaspora members in Omaha comprising Dinka, Nuer, and other ethnic groups (mainly Equatorians) voiced the need to discuss the on-going conflict in South Sudan. Those assembled denounced the ethnic violence with a uniï¬ed South Sudanese-American voice. Despite their different ethnic afï¬liation and the on-going conflict back home, they re-afï¬rmed their renewed commitment to working together through dialogue and mutual assistance. South Sudanese refugees in Omaha have long been involved in a range of activities aimed at promoting the development of their communities, both in the diaspora and in the homeland. Omaha was one of a handful of American cities that hosted voting sites for the referendum on South-Sudanâs Independence of 9â15 January 2011. It saw the highest turnout in the United States with over three-thousand ballots cast. Prior to the recent resurgence of violence, some diasporas had chosen to return to their newly independent nation in order to launch small-scale philanthropic projects in and around their home villages, using resources and skills they had acquired in exile. Their actions illustrate the premise that, as circumstances become increasingly disjointed, diaspora members can experience a heightened emotional connection with their homeland. This encourages some to mobilize and increase their political involvement or give ï¬nancial assistance to relatives or afï¬liated organizations (Vorrath 2012). Members of the youngest generation, often described as âthe future of the nation,â are at the frontline of these momentous developments (Ensor 2015, 47). As the experiences of Chuol, Biel, Aweng, Nyadhial and Riek have illustrated, South Sudanese children are playing a pivotal role in many of the processes taking place in their societies. As is often the case in immigrant communities from war-torn nations where youngsters constitute the majority of the population, young people have played this role in both in their country of origin and their adopted nation. The diasporic identities of current generations of South Sudanese in Omaha are a product of multiple factors. These include historical memories and narratives, fluid and often contested constructions of childhood, shifting inter-generational and gender dynamics, changes in homeland politics, processes of repatriation, new waves of displacement and other global flows. These determinants should be examined alongside identity processes in the host society, including local vernacular discourses and racialized constructions of the African diaspora. Informed by the recent anti-essentialist shift in childhood studies, this chapter argues that children and youthâs diasporic identities must always be understood as a product of a particular time and place. Identity formation and the behaviours of South Sudanese children and youth in Omaha âconjure an image of a disempowered group facing its way to the centreâ (Abdullah 2007, 25). Often referred to simply as âdiasporas,â regardless of their nationality status, their ascribed and self-identiï¬ed situation of migrancy reflects a"
99,353,0.987,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"14.3 The Development of Neighbourhood Childrenâs Services in Pamplona The group of associations we are analysing in Pamplona carry out social activities aimed at the prevention of social problems amongst children. It is the result of a movement of community associations that developed leisure activities for children and of their integration into the local government structure of social services, while retaining a peculiar way of working. The first of these associations, Umetxea Sanduzelai, was created in 1990. They tried to keep a balance between their traditional âpoliticalâ role of claiming for more and better services in their neighbourhood and a new role as service providers. They tried to create social and cultural projects, mostly aimed at children, pooling the resources of several neighbourhood groups. These projects became quite successful. By 1994, some people in the local social services begin to see that these associations are being more successful in this field than their own public prevention programs, which many people in the neighbourhoods thought quite useless. The neighbourhood associations have been suspect for possible sympathies with radical left wing parties and radical Basque nationalism, which in the context of political violence and of a serious political cleavage between Basque nationalism and Navarrese regionalism certainly did not make relationships easy. Somewhat surprisingly, it was a centre-right regionalist councillor who decided to establish a long-term agreement between the municipality and the associations. Although there was a strong and politicised debate, in the end the councillor said that âthey work fine and they are much less expensive than other providersâ. Since 1995 in one neighbourhood and since 1997 in the other three, these associations are responsible for the so-called Community Preventive Action Service, a part of the local Family and Children Welfare Program. The typical activities of these programmes are leisure activities for different groups of children, including activity groups and playgrounds for the youngest, summer camps, neighbourhood festivals and networking amongst teenagers (2011). In some cases, it has meant not encouraging but supporting and accompanying actions like the squatting of an abandoned factory. The future of the program has been uncertain in several occasions. The agreements established in 1995â1997 ended in 2013. The local council has favoured since the late 1990s private providers that fit better into an entrepreneurial model, with whom they agree specific outcomes and targets in a much more managerial way. The existing TSOs are much more flexible, they are able to mobilise much more local resources, but they do so by being less hierarchic and formal in their relation with the local government. After a complex process, the agreements have been renewed for several years."

The multiple and overlapping forms of identity-based vulnerabilities found in local situations of marginalization have yet to be addressed adequately in their own terms, and in relation to specific public policies. These forms are contingent on the specific character of a given local sphere of migration, producing layers of discrimination and insecurities that cannot be reduced to gender as a single cause. The complexity of migration is clearly expressed in border areas where migratory processes are bearers of particular features of social exchange7 and political histories, and where new flows have become âglobalâ preoccupations (Sassen 2003; Castles 2010; Papademetriou 2011). Concerns over law and order are allowing states to choose specific border crossingpoints and their vicinity, identified as vulnerable to illegal trade and migration and to organized crime, where Hobbesian measures of border policing are adopted. These are legitimized by the need to protect national sovereignty and control crime (Bigo/Tsoukala 2008). In the name of national security, such practices of border control tend to go hand in with processes of âotheringâ (PÃ©coud/Guchteneire 2006) that underpin the fixing of territorial boundaries based on identities and belonging,8 field of access, and the scale of transgressions (Van Houtum/Van Naerssen 2001).

New local leadership figures emerged, and social interaction and cohesion in the barrios increased (see StrÃ¸nen 2006, 2012). Moreover, it also increasingly socialized the popular sectors into the laws, language and procedures of the state, and created networks between the popular sectors and political figures. Local grassroots networks and electoral committees, organized around election time in support of the government, also added to the proximity between the government and popular sector activists. This became an important reference for the next phase of state-supported popular organization: the communal councils. The communal councils were institutionalized in 2006 through the Organic Law for the Communal Councils.3 The law was revised, also through an extensive popular consultation, and reapproved by the National Assembly in November of 2009. Communal councils are local neighborhood groups, organized around 200 to 400 families in urban areas (significantly less in rural and indigenous areas). They are granted the legal right to plan and implement local social and socio-economic projects as well as projects related to community housing and infrastructure. These projects are funded by the government through various agencies. A communal council is composed by three administrative committees4 and various thematic work committees. The citizen assembly is the maxima instancia de autoridad (highest authority) in the communal councils and composed by all members of the community. All members of the community above the age of 15 have the right to vote, and the elected members of the other committees have to abide by the citizen assemblyâs decisions. Thus, the community as a whole does not cede power to the elected members of the community councils. In order to highlight this aspect, elected members are not called representatives, but voceros and voceras (spokespeople). The members of the communal council are elected for an electoral cycle of two years. There is also a permanent electoral committee responsible for elections and revocation of mandates. It is up to the community to decide exactly which working committees they want to form; those suggested by the law are health, education,"

Despite these similarities, Mexico is a unique case in Latin America because powerful social movements brought about extensive landtenure reform when the state tried to resolve popular claims. The governmentâs recognition of collective tenure as the basis for agrarian reform was guaranteed in the 1917 federal constitution. Today, 70% of forestland is under collective tenure, while more than 50% of communities have forest cover (Warman, 2000; Bray and Merino, 2004; Merino, 2004; Bray, Merino and Barry, 2005). Across the entire world, public property of forests (often under concessions to third parties) is the prevailing institutional arrangement. Only from the late 1980s to the early 2000s did communities and local groups obtain rights over forests in other Latin American countries, such as Nicaragua, Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Peru and Colombia. There are two legal types of collective holdings in Mexico: ejidos and comunidades agrarias.7 Ejidos were created when the government granted land to groups who demanded it, including former hacienda workers. Comunidades agrarias resulted from the ofï¬cial recognition of the historical rights of indigenous communities. CONAFOR estimates that today 30,305 communities collectively own 105 million Ha of forest. Legally, comunidades agrarias are able to incorporate young members at their will, while ejido members can only pass on their rights to a single successor. Community forests have to be commonly managed, and their division or sale is legally prohibited.8 In spite of the legal status of communities, their rights are clearly limited: the Mexican state maintains the right to regulate forest use.9 Second, as in most of Latin America, water and underground resources are legally public property, giving governments the right to directly use these resources or to grant them in concession to third parties. Finally, according to Mexican legislation, mining holds a national priority status over conservation and mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions. Forest policies Since the late 1940s, industrial development based on an import substitution model became a national priority in Mexico. As in other large Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina, strong centralized governments assumed the role of directly promoting this model. Small rural producers were given the role of providing staple foods at low cost, thereby enabling low industrial salaries.10 The state did not"

Indeed, the role of sending countries in the integration of their citizens abroad is central to the European Commissionâs âthree way approach to integration of third country nationalsâ (EC 2011, see GarcÃ©s-MascareÃ±as and Penninx in this volume). The actual impact of sending country policies on the scope and direction of migrant transnationality is still an evolving research ï¬eld. There is a growing body of literature on the nexus between migrant transnationality and integration (see MÃ¼gge in this volume). Yet, there is still work to do regarding the impact of sending country policies on both migrant transnationality and migrant processes of settlement. Regarding migrant transnationality, it can be difï¬cult to determine to what extent emigrant state efforts to bond with their non-resident citizens are directly responsible for migrant transnational practices related to their country of origin. These practices are embedded in broader political and economic processes as well. For instance, a recent report on remittances to Latin American emigrant countries explains changes in remittance ï¬ows by labour market conditions in the country of residence and by changing macroeconomic conditions in the sending country, but without mentioning sending country policies aimed at"

In the course of these efforts at global codification, states have tended to privilege and indeed encourage people to migrate for study purposes as well as to take up key jobs in certain employment sectors. International organizations and NGOs have meanwhile sought to promote and protect the rights of refugees as an exceptional category of migrant. Consequently, this category of migrants, together with knowledge migrants, has benefited more from these regimes in terms of their level of legal protection and social acceptance (Handmaker 2011). Labour migrants are, in this sense, the category most likely to benefit from an active role being taken by civil society organizations, and their strategic use of international versus national norms in the promotion of migrantsâ rights and entitlements. 15.2.4"

Also, it will be important to create institutional designs that will allow mainstreaming of low-carbon policy, in an integrated way, of the frameworks that have so far been built on a sector-by-sector basis. And, based on them, it will be important to create efficient administrative management frameworks. Notably, many Asian countries have formulated action plans to become LCSs, but in many cases the plans are not being implemented, or, even if they are being implemented, the effects are limited. In some cases, government fraud or corruption due to inadequate legislation or governance results in a failure to effectively utilize physical, economic, and human resources. Also, due to inadequacies in governmentsâ management philosophy or concepts, it is not uncommon to see redundancy of policies and measures by different government ministries and agencies or inadequate sharing of information. In this context, as a national-level initiative to establish LCSs in Asia, it is necessary to build the foundations of transparent and accountable government and to institute corruption prevention measures in the public sector, including central and local (municipal) governments. Meanwhile, the international community is expected to provide support to accelerate those efforts at the national level. For example, the World Bank and other institutions have developed frameworks for country-specific evaluations of public sector policies and institutions, and attempts are being made to reflect these efforts in their international assistance. Thus, strengthening the role of the international community in encouraging improvements in public sector management in Asian countries could be a major step forward to implement policies and measures proposed under Actions 1 through 9 of this document. Also, as described below, Asian countries are characterized by the diversity of their political systems, and they need to plan and implement policies not only for sustainable development but also other development objectives, such as reducing health problems and poverty. In many cases, the differences between countries are mainly in scale, but they have much in common. Thus, there is a need for intergovernmental policy coordination in the planning and implementation of policies that have some compatibility between development objectives and GHG emission reductions. Regarding the public-private sector relationship, in the past there has been excessive protection of government-related and/or certain private companies. However, it is important to establish healthy public-private partnerships by establishing objective standardization and certifications."
293,302,0.987,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Governments of Origin Countries Sending countries have increasingly developed policies to bond with their citizens abroad. Ãstergaard-Nielsen (Chap. 9) suggests that such policies involve the economic/socio-economic, the political, and the cultural/religious dimensions, often in combination. Motivations of origin-country governments for such activities may vary but the integration of their citizens in the country of settlement can ultimately only be a topic if the interests of the country of origin are served through its migrants. The speciï¬c content of what integration then should mean was well expressed by Turkish Prime Minister ErdoÄan, who during a visit in Germany called for a âbetter integration of Turks in Germanyâ, meaning essentially better economic opportunities âbut not assimilationâ. These workers should, he said, continue to be âambassadors for Turkeyâ, to speak Turkish, to vote for him as the new President of Turkey, to be good Muslims, and to contribute to the economic development of Turkey. While the strengthening of upward social mobility of emigrants in their countries of residence is usually interpreted as a win-win scenario for both sending countries and immigrants, it is still difï¬cult to assess the exact impact of sending country policies on both migrant transnationality and migrant processes of settlement. First, it is difï¬cult to determine to what extent emigrant state efforts to bond with their nonresident citizens are directly responsible for migrant transnational practices related to their country of origin. Second, it is difï¬cult to determine the real impact of these policies on immigrantsâ integration in the societies of settlement. In both respects, Ãstergaard-Nielsen (Chap. 9 in this volume) notes that emigrants and diasporas may not immediately respond to sending countriesâ outreach. Moreover, she observes, it remains to be seen whether and to what extent European governments actually do move away from the zero-sum discourse and securitization optic on migrant transnationality towards the more integrated three-way approach envisioned by the European Commission."

This contrasts with visions of Western states and UN agencies as endowed with the means and resources for assessing the situation and best planning any intervention. In this vision, they are courageous and generous agents ready to self-sacrifice, have great care for human lives, and have the capacity to act (AJ 1-3; TG 1-2). When the international community fails to comply with these standards publicly, its accountability is established through different techniques. First, other responsibilities are identified and often these are not elements within the control of the so-called international community: for example, the weather or the bureaucratic system is seen as hampering rescue efforts in the Mediterranean (TG 2-4). Also, the irrationality of other actors can be used to explain the international communityâs failures: sub-Saharans in desperate situations would be inclined to not exercise clear judgement and to put their lives at risk, as when, trying to capture the attention of a rescue boat, they move to one side of their ship, causing it to capsize (TG 2). Moreover, NATO and EU states are pictured as self-reflexive and prone to take actions that will improve their tactics and strategies of intervention, for instance improving coordination efforts for evacuations and lifesaving missions at sea (NYT 5-7; TG 78:). Finally, media and other actors take the role of powerful watchdog, engaged to show the international community unforeseen problems and to envision possible solutions, as in the case of unanticipated migratory movements towards Europe or racist attacks on black Libyans and migrants in Libya (AJ 2-35-6; NYT 5; TG 5-7-10). In this case, in addition to migrantsâ testimonies employed to confirm the information presented, many references to Western values of liberal democracy serve as guidelines for actions, completely legitimizing the actual organization of the world order and failing to address existing inequalities and imbalances (AJ 2-6-9; NYT 5; TG 7). In a nutshell, media represented the Libyan conflict as a step in the countryâs process towards Western ideals and modernity; they show its migration crises as the result of irrational, cruel, and short-sighted policies by Gaddafi, and this implies that support for the management of migratory movements by Western interventions was necessary to achieve security, freedom, and the democratic principles of the international order. Direct and subtle associations in the articles analysed indicate strongly that media conveyed suggestions that reinforced mainstream international models while play-acting mobilizations for migrantsâ"

The Netherlands is in this active group, as are the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Scandinavian countries.5 While the government orients towards European tobacco control, national tobacco control advocacy organisations often look for wider inspiration, particularly to the English-speaking countries which dominate the global tobacco control epistemic community (the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States), sometimes ignoring the fact that these countries have different tobacco control environments and institutional arrangements and might not share the same cultural values. A second important source for the government is through national knowledge âbrokerâ organisations. These are governmental or semigovernmental expert centres and scientific advisory boards, tasked with producing scientific evidence on which to base policy. It has been shown that the existence of national organisations for scientific knowledge brokering facilitate the uptake of evidence by policymakers (Liverani, Hawkins, & Parkhurst, 2013). In the Netherlands, the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) (RIVM) and the Netherlands Expertise Center for Tobacco Control (NET) at the Trimbos Institute are currently important knowledge brokers for the government on tobacco control policy. The RIVM provides expertise and advice on risks of existing and novel tobacco products, estimates the population impact of measures, and does cost-benefit analyses. The Trimbos Instituteâs NET reviews the effectiveness of tobacco control measures and monitors national smoking prevalence rates. Nowadays the EU is an important driver of tobacco control policy convergence and a source of policy learning (see also Chap. 6). Policy learning between tobacco control advocacy groups within Europe takes place through various European tobacco control organisations. The most important ones are the SFP (Smoke Free Partnership), ENSP (European Network of Smoking Prevention), the EHN (European Heart Network), and the ECL (the Association of European Cancer Leagues). Over the years the three Dutch charities (Cancer Society, Heart Foundation, Lung Foundation) built lasting contacts with these groups and organisations. The absorption of tobacco control policy knowledge is further facilitated through the World Conferences on Tobacco or Health (WCToH) and their European equivalents (ECToH). STIVORO and Dutch civil servants from the Ministry of Health visited these international tobacco control conferences, but it is unusual for high-level Dutch government officials,"

However, fighting not only against the migration regime and racism but also against patriarchy, they are also challenging male activists within the refugee movement in an effort to make their own specific position more visible. The crucial contribution of Women in Exile has been to construct a platform for refugee women and to empower them to become political actors against all odds. This has also been the case with Youth without Borders (JoG), which created a unique social space for young refugees that has encouraged them to connect to each other and become politically active. Their slogan âRight to Stay for Allâ indicates a narrative that is generally open, yet at the same time, their organizing and framing builds on a specific positionality as youth. On the basis of a shared history, Lampedusa in Hamburg, with its slogan âWe are Here to Stay,â mainly focuses on claiming a right to stay and social rights in the city for the group and its members. Nevertheless, the slogan also indicates the legitimate presence of all refugees and migrants. The achievement of the Lampedusa group has been to mobilize thousands of citizens in Hamburg to support and join their struggle, which was not only been visible in large scale demonstrations, but especially in the close-meshed networks built in the neighborhood of St. Pauli. In doing so, Lampedusa in Hamburg stimulated not only new activities around anti-racist politics and the right to the city, but they also laid the groundwork for broad refugee support in 2015. Besides Lampedusa in Hamburg, the other major mobilization of the new refugee protest era, starting in Germany in 2012, is the Refugee Movement Berlin, who has been analyzed by several publications (Ulu 2013; Langa 2015; Wilcke and Lambert 2015; Fadaee 2015; GlÃ¶de and BÃ¶hlo 2015; Schwiertz 2016a). Their claims are part of one of the most inclusive and radical framing examples in the movement. This is captured in their three central demands: against Lagers, residency obligations, and deportations. Nevertheless, their narrative has mainly been applicable to the positionality of asylum seekers. Hence, the arrival of refugees who already had a legal residency status from Italy but no access to social rights in Germany caused conflicts over how to prioritize the three demands. According to their specific positionality, the Berlin Refugee Movement has consequently integrated âthe right to work and studyâ into their demands. In this paper, we analyzed different approaches of refugee self-organization, building on the history and experiences of migratory struggles in Germany. As we have shown above, refugee and migrant protests are by no means new, but the scale and nature of the recent actions in the 2010s are unprecedented. The protestersâ demands go beyond individualistic claims and target not only national but also local and supranational policies. Like at the International Conference of Refugees and Migrants in Hamburg in 2016, they seek to establish translocal and transnational networks and coalitions against these policies. Building on the history and experiences of groups like KÃ¶XÃ¼z, Kanak Attak, or The Voice, which are still active today, self-organized migratory and refugee struggles could develop strategies to further unite their fights within and against the German-European migration regime beyond their specific positionalities."

There was even a proposal to make AMM a model for future cooperation in crisis management between regional actors (Feith 2007, 1â7).

Here, the overlap of political context with evidence describes the process of âstrategic analysis,â drawing ideas and information from both government and the research community, past research, and the experience and knowledge of actors involved. How the two become more closely linked also depends on how well they both overlap with where âthe rubber hits the roadââthe beneficiaries and interest groups of agricultural strategies, such as: development practitioners, farmers and trader groups, media, and civil society in general. On the other hand, the intersection between evidence and links can be viewed as one of discourse and dialogue (e.g. through publications, seminars, and media), while the one between the links and political context is more about advocacy (e.g. the world of campaigning and lobbying among local interest groups, media, and the broader electorate or civil society). Finally, the external environment, including the overall socioeconomic environment, as well as the influence of regional and international actors (e.g. donors), can be quite significant in the African context. Effective linkages between evidence, dialogue, and policymaking are supposed to occur at the intersection of all three spheres, and it is here that evidence is expected to influence a policy change. The assumption is that when such links are established early enough, the evidence generated and discussed at this intersection is likely to be viewed as relevant and salient to the local context (Young 2005; Cash et al. 2003). The big challenge in most African countries is getting all three to intersect, given the poor state of evidence generation (from poor quality data, poor training and incentives, weak peer review systems), poor links (from poor communications, capacities), political context (power play, vested interests, top down bureaucracies, and elitist attitudes among officials), and external environment, especially the exaggerated influence of donors. This is what the âknowledge support systemâ component of a country SAKSS strives to achieve, in setting up an active network of key local actors (individuals and organizations) who intersect from all three spheres. Through extensive consultations and interactions in the network, activities involving strategic analysis, capacity strengthening, and dialogue are laid out.

These networks that are coalitions of actors who share values, interests and practices can be conceptualized as elites insofar as they control key resources: the production and promotion of speciï¬c knowledge or forms to generate knowledge and access to policymaking forums. Ideas, values and resources circulate within networks, and as such the networks may set the limits or boundaries of how reality is to be understood or to set apart what constitutes expert and non-expert knowledge. A range of different private actors and companies support REDD activities, forming alliances and promoting certain models, particularly those that are positive to carbon markets. In this way, REDD is offering a new regime of proï¬t-making possibilities in the trade of carbon offsets, but also in fostering the development of new forms of consultancy and expertise. REDD science-policy networks are inï¬uencing, although not necessarily reorienting, the position of other elite actors. For example, various transnational and national companies, such as mining and energy-producing companies, plantation companies, forestry companies and carbon-market companies, engage in REDD demonstration activities by funding speciï¬c projects. Since dominant REDD science-policy networks have ideological positions that do not conï¬ict with the ideological position of corporations, it has been possible to establish alliances between them. But since resource extraction continues to be central to the economies of most Amazon countries (Bebbington and Bebbington, 2012), often at the expense of forests, the degree to which REDD elites can inï¬uence other elites is limited. Mining, gas and oil extraction are the most important activities to generate economic revenues for most of the countries in the Amazon basin. The development of infrastructure such as hydropower and road-building are also priorities for these countries. All these activities are, in most cases, planned to occur in forest areas. In addition, the agricultural frontier is expanding in many Latin American countries. Therefore we cannot afï¬rm that REDD elites have a strong inï¬uence in the Amazon countriesâ broader development policy-making or in the national visions of development, but REDD elites have indeed been successful in engaging actors from the agricultural and industrial sectors in the funding of demonstration activities. Taken together, the cases of Brazil and of REDD show that a shift in elites sometimes leads to more ambitious environmental goals and"

Exploration sites were located in Afro-descendant and indigenous peoplesâ lands, including their homes and sacred areas, in the departments of Antioquia and ChocÃ³. Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities started to search for information and contacted a national church organization working in the area. A support group was created, bringing information, documentaries (e.g. the Sipakapa case) and activists from other countries and communities to Carmen de DariÃ©n (Jahncke Benavente and Meza, 2010). Communities claimed that the ofï¬cial consultation process was not adequately conducted, excluding affected communities and endangering their livelihoods. As a reaction to local unrest, the national government militarized mining areas, intimidating and limiting community access (Jahncke Benavente and Meza, 2010; Movice, 2012). Communities, inspired by the Sipakapa experience, promoted the organization as an interethnic consultation, following their own procedures (own language, registered, older than 14 years old). Human rights, indigenous, church and anti-mining organization representatives from Colombia, Paraguay, Honduras, Guatemala, Germany and Canada observed the process (CENSAT, 2009). The consultation was grounded on international and national indigenous consultation rights, including the Colombian Constitutionâs special consideration for indigenous consultation rights.

293,141,0.987,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Introduction Migration and migrant integration policies have become increasingly dispersed over various levels of government. Besides the national level, the European Union (EU) level and the regional and local levels have become more involved. In the area of immigration, EU member states have handed over significant power to the EU, particularly in the context of the Common European Asylum System. The EUâs Family Reunification Directive, for instance, significantly limits member statesâ policy discretion in family migration policies. With regard to migrant integration there has been some Europeanization as well, but this has been overshadowed by a sharp âlocal turnâ in policymaking. Local governments, large cities in particular, are becoming increasingly entrepreneurial in developing their own integration philosophies and policies. This has led to cities having markedly different approaches to migrant integration, even within the same countries. This chapter focuses on migration and integration as multilevel policy issues and explores the consequences in terms of multilevel governance. The fact that both migration and integration have become multilevel issues presents both opportunities and challenges. Immigration policymaking has been characterized by a constant struggle between national governments and the EU about the amount of discretion states have in interpreting EU directives. The involvement of local and regional"

Communal property can be an important possibility for favouring sustainability and the governance of complex ecosystems, such as forests. However, despite the relevance of legal recognition of property rights over lands and forests to local communities, it is hardly sufï¬cient for forest communities to achieve their economic, environmental and social potential. The empowerment of local communities by acquiring technical and governance capacities is equally important in contemporary contexts. The results of this survey show the existence of many communities that suffer forest deterioration and limited social capital. In these communities, the contribution of forest activities to local livelihoods is often very limited. The development of a forestry economy is fundamental not only for supporting the social and institutional development of these communities but also for delivering protective measures for sustainable forest use. The experience of forest communities in Mexico shows that the synergy between forest economy and conservation does not happen naturally; it requires favourable public policies as well as access to adequate training and technical advice. The state has undermined community rights and livelihoods, favouring communitiesâ dispossession. This entails a recentralization of land control and resource management, over-regulation of resource use, imposition of high transaction costs on legal forest use, and criminalization of many local uses of natural resources. But if local governance and environmental citizenship are regarded as assets for conservation and governability, the state can play a key role by recognizing communitiesâ rights over natural resources. This would provide favourable legal frameworks for community forest use and governance â by coordinating with local actors to control illegal land use â and would favour markets able to internalize sustainable management costs. Lessons from Mexicoâs community forestry experience are relevant for other Latin American countries, such as Guatemala, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Brazil â where governments recognize local collective rights. In countries where most of the forestlands are owned by governments and are used by private companies, local governance, incentives and recognition of communitiesâ rights can be avenues for reversing environmental injustice and deterioration. In summary, community forestry is not a panacea or a ï¬xed model that can simply be replicated inside or outside Mexico. Nevertheless, it represents an important alternative to combine goals of local empowerment, forest sustainability and rural development. While some communities in Mexico seek to distance themselves from the state and the traditional market (see"
176,45,0.987,Russia'S Turn To The East : Domestic Policymaking and Regional Cooperation,"Seen from Moscow, the Russian Far East is a remote periphery and a strategic area for developing international cooperation, primarily with the Northeast Asian states. However, from the Far Easternersâ viewpoint, Primorye has its own political, economic and social dynamics. For two centuries the local population has been engaged in cross-border relations. Thanks to its location, Primorskii Krai can function as Russiaâs interface with the countries of East Asia. As John Stephan put it: âsimultaneously comprising the northern periphery of East Asia and eastern periphery of the Russian Republic, [the region] has an elasticity inherent in the Russian term Dalnii Vostok, which can refer to anything from a province to half the worldâ (Stephan 1994, p.7). Deteriorating relations with the West in the context of the RussiaâUkraine crisis and Western economic sanctions have made Russiaâs âturn to the Eastâ a vital necessity. However, such a turn to the East is easier said than done. This chapter describes the plansâ and challenging realitiesâfor turning Primorskii Krai and the Far Eastern Federal Okrug more broadly into key players in Moscowâs efforts to expand political and economic ties with the countries of Northeast Asia. I begin by reviewing the key budgetary, administrative, legislative and policy changes accompanying Russiaâs âturn to the Eastâ, as manifested in the region itself, before turning to several specific tools mandated by these changes to see how they have performed in practice. These include the establishment of special economic zones (SEZs) of various stripes, a land giveaway programme, transport infrastructure development and efforts to make Primorye attractive for investors. I conclude by noting that the turn to Asia has indeed resulted in intensified cooperation with China in the Russian Far East, but question whether these initiatives have brought actual substantial change in the socioeconomic conditions of the region."

Regarding the second EU resource deployed in this area, European programmes have sought to establish a strong relation between the EU and the city level. It is in these efforts that, according to our typology, we can distinguish the contours of an emerging multilevel governance framework. With various means, including some of the funding schemes mentioned above, the European Commission in particular has actively promoted various city networks on a European scale. These networks primarily involve cross-national horizontal forms of cooperation between cities, but with strong connections to the Commission. One example is the CLIP Network (Cities for Local Integration Policies), which since 2006 has brought together some 30 European cities in conferences to systematically exchange knowledge and experience regarding local integration policies. Integrating Cities is another network (also established in 2006) organized under the Eurocitiesâ working group on migration and integration, a large network of some 140 major European cities. The Integrating Cities initiative includes a policy dialogue between Eurocities and the European Commission, a conference series, the Eurocities Charter on Integrating Cities, and other EU-funded projects. Another example is Intercultural Cities, which is a joint activity of the Council of Europe and the European Commission. It emerged from the 2008 White Paper on Intercultural Dialogue contributed by the Council of Europe to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue that same year. Intercultural Cities advocates pluralistic city identities that respect diversity. The Intercultural Cities Programme was developed and first applied in 11 European pilot cities and has since evolved. It has developed the Intercultural Cities Index for cities to evaluate and develop their policies, and it organizes international conferences for cities to exchange experiences. Other more specifically horizontal cooperation initiatives have been undertaken as well, such as the European Coalition of Cities against Racism (ECCAR), established in 2004 at the initiative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The aim of this coalition of cities is to share experiences in order to improve policies against racism, discrimination, and xenophobia. Some 104 municipalities from 22 European countries have joined the network and adopted its 10-point plan of action. Besides making a direct connection between the nascent European policy framework on migrant integration and the local level of government, thereby constructing the most distinct multilevel governance structures in this area today, the focus on the local level also feeds into the local turn in migrant integration policy described above. Horizontal exchanges of knowledge and best practices between cities, promoted by the EU, has increased citiesâ entrepreneurship in developing their own integration philosophies. In a number of cases such integration philosophies encompass relations with cities from which migrants originated, as Chap. 10 will show. One might interpret this as the âthree-way processâ proposed by the European Commission in its 2011 European Agenda for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals, but one should be aware that the local policy actors involved might have quite different intentions and motives."
46,169,0.987,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"(7) The economic and political institutions on the international and global level. The local and national economy and labor market, as well as local and national public institutions, are not insular and detached from the international and global level. The global economic and political architecture and the power of transnational companies to avoid taxes, to put pressure on states and to lobby their interests highly influence child poverty and pose challenges for the supporting welfare systems. Especially in poorer countries, poverty alleviation is directly financed and designed by international institutions and NGOs; international treaties and agreements shape such countriesâ economic and social development and their ability to design and control policies in areas from health care to the labor market (Craig and Porter 2006). Hence, particularly in poor countries dominated by such international rules, child poverty is shaped to a large extent by forces external to their own political and social institutions. (8) The global community of humans. Humans share one earth, and through the various forms of globalization, the connections between them have intensified. The global chains of production and trade, which certainly produce winners and losers, mass tourism across the whole world and a globalized aid system in which resources from rich countries are transferred to poorer ones in the name of charity are just three examples of how people living in very distant places can effectively influence each otherâs lives. These connections are typically manifold and interlaced, making it difficult to isolate and specify an individualâs exact position in the overall ânetworkâ. Nevertheless, these relations exist, and their normative dimensions must also be considered in an account of responsibilities. We now have eight different groups of agents that are obviously involved in the well-being and well-becoming of a child in poverty and her being poor in the first place. Each of these groups and the agents within them, such as companies, deserve a close examination so as to scrutinize their responsibilities based on the grounds we distinguished before. Unfortunately, this would go far beyond the scope of this book, and so we present only a first systematization and ranking. After that, we will focus on two agents, the family and the state, since they are crucial to the alleviation of child poverty. (a) High level of responsibilities. The group with the highest level of responsibilities encompasses social and political institutions on the"
293,196,0.987,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","The bulk of the literature on transnational practices focuses on either the macro level, such as the policies of sending countries (see Ãstergaard-Nielsen in this volume; Ãstergaard-Nielsen 2011), or the micro level, for example, the remittance behaviour of individual migrants and the impact of remittances on countries of origin (see MÃ¼gge in this volume). So far, few researchers have looked specifically at the meso level. Those who have done so have mainly focused on the linkages of US-based migrant organizations (e.g., Mexican hometown associations) with Latin America (Fauser 2007; Ãstergaard-Nielsen 2011). This chapter reviews the literature on the linkages of, respectively, local governments and migrant organizations between countries of origin and countries of destination. Three questions are central: (i) What are the main characteristics of these relationships and what kinds of activities can be observed? (ii) What drives local governments and migrant organizations to implement these activities? (iii) How can we assess these activities? In addressing these questions, this chapter touches upon two overarching debates that are central in this publication. The first is the increasing prominence of the migration and development framework (see King and Collyer in this volume). Related to this, several European countries have established co-development programmes aimed at linking immigrants and their organizations to development processes in the region of origin, often with the aim of stimulating integration processes in destination countries as well. The second debate is related to this and centres on whether translocal linkages between migrant source and destination countries and integration in destination countries reinforce each other or are a zero-sum proposition (see also MÃ¼gge in this volume)."

MiljÃ¶verkstan Flaten has created a solid local network as well as a network of significant partners throughout the region. Their well anchored activities both with residents and local authorities have given them legitimacy to represent the Flaten area in the pilot project which will be part of forming how Stockholm municipality will think of, design and maintain their protected areas in the future â potentially activating the replicating mechanism.

Certainly, the recruitment processes that volunteer deployment organisations are involved in will actively valorise resilience. Leadership and management are necessarily linked to team working. The NHS and its training arm (Health Education England) have recently placed signiï¬cant emphasis on the development of multidisciplinary teams and the dissolution of counter-productive professional boundaries (HEE 2016C). Kiernan et al. (2014) suggest that international placements provide unique opportunities to work with people from other professions. This ï¬nding is echoed by professional volunteers who describe the skills they gain through team working with other cadres. This arises in a number of ways. First, deploying organisations may actively mobilise multi-professional teams in complex interventions. This is the case both in systemsfocused capacity-building environments and humanitarian crisis situations. Secondly, volunteers witness the stark absence of team-working in hosting organisations which heightens their awareness of its value.

14,175,0.987,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"LNUâas a body for youth organizationsâ interestsâcan be understood as integrated in the wider Nordic tradition of voluntary organization. As mentioned above, central characteristics of this tradition is that voluntary organizations often have a broad membership base, participation in voluntary work is generally seen as an integral part of being a member of an organization and organizations are democratically structured (TrÃ¤hgÃ¥rdh and Vamstad 2009; WollebÃ¦k and Sivesind 2010). The normative ideal is that organizations should be democratically organized in such a way that their actions reflect their membersâ preferences (Lorentzen 2004, 31). Groups are seen as a collective of individuals, and democratic procedures within groups give all members an opportunity to participate. Participation in organizations socializes each individual member into democratic values and gives them training in practical democracy. The Nordic tradition of voluntary organizations is also characterized as a peopleâs movement model, and in the Norwegian context, peopleâs movements have brought broad groups from all over the country into the public domain since the latter half of the 19th century (Ãsterud et al. 2003). Historically, the aim has been to create political weight and legitimacy through mass membership, built on a broad social mobilization. The Norwegian emphasis on democracy can partly be explained by the fact that civil organizations were established in the same period as national independence. Nineteenth century mainstream popular movements followed the same organizational structure as the political parties. They have been characterized by a hierarchical organization, where local organizations are linked together in regional and national organizations (Ãsterud et al. 2003). Peopleâs movements provided local interest in the political centre, and in many cases acted as counter-cultures to the majority culture. In line with the Nordic tradition, hierarchical and rule-based organizations are established outside the state administration. They function as an alternative political channel, and a form of political influence outside the party system and the election channel (Rokkan 1966). The voluntary organizations function as a parallel bureaucratic structure, but there are also huge overlapping zones between voluntary organizations and state administration. Voluntary organizations are crucial to Norwegian democratic culture and identity (Lorentzen 2004). The idea is that voluntary organizations can be places where members learn democratic values in practiceâboth civic and political. They are socialized in democratic decision-making procedures even when the organizations do not aim to have political influence, but are rather engaged in civic, cultural and social activities. Hence, within the Nordic tradition, the distinction between civic and political engagement often becomes blurred. Both types of engagements imply relations between individuals or groups and public institutions. This can include civic engagement in public institutions and political participation such as voting in elections or running for elected ofï¬ce. Although scholars ï¬nd that there has been a gradual transition in the Norwegian voluntary sector away from the peopleâs movement model towards philanthropy, they simultaneously conclude that as a normative ideal, the membership-based,"

More widely, tacit social constructions of âmasculinitiesâ and âfemininitiesâ affect subjectivities as well as codified practices, and exercise great influence both on how women, men, and young people become involved in migration processes, and on how policies of social protection are designed. The role frequently accorded to women is that of the human shock absorber, the nurturing human environment for the activities of others. Like shock absorbers and the physical environment they are taken for granted. The frameworks of human rights â for women, for migrants, and for all persons â are nowadays elaborate and quite clear; but they are not self-enforcing, and their adoption and implementation is highly discretionary and very frequently absent (see, for example, the reviews by Cholewinski 2010 and Lester 2010 for migrant rights). Application of the frameworks to cases of international migration depends on collaboration between nation-states, and thus also on the perceptions of and pressures from the public in those states. Hierarchical relations between nation-states, economic and political agendas, and rigidity in administration make this collaboration ineffective. Parts of civil society play an important role in the defence of migrant rights, but civic actors too are embedded in the national sphere of politics that is influenced by nationalist sentiments that often do not favour such rights. A large number of studies in this volume have documented social processes of âracializationâ or other types of social construction that present migrant workers as inferior (and dangerous) beings. Countering such processes is an essential task for increasing the likelihood of the implementation of legal declarations of migrantsâ rights. Chapter 20 by Sandoval-Garcia, in particular, describes several relevant avenues for this work. Cholewinski (2010) lists, over very many pages, the years of meetings and reports on migrant rights, but can unfortunately provide little evidence of impact. Oberoi (2010) and Lester (2010) fear that the meetings are another form of theatre, for the more general conventions on human rights, if taken more seriously, would already accord major protection to migrants. Apart from the power of groups that benefit from the invisibility of migrant workers, Oberoi notes another explanation, another type of invisibility which is produced by the absence of migrant representation. The meetings and negotiations are conducted in closed chambers, with migrantsâ own representatives excluded. Thus âin inter-state discussions"
73,45,0.987,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"What role should planners and designers in Australia play to address the loss of food-producing lands? We suggest this problem can be addressed in four distinct ways. First, many peri-urban farms are market gardens developed by migrants in the 1950sâ1960s. The farmers are now elderly and understandably see rezoning their farms for residential development as a retirement income. Respect for this equity issue requires innovative planning for land tenure, related to productive land that allows owners to realise their landâs development value without changing the rural use. This can be achieved through transfer of development rights (TDR) (Armstrong 2005). Parallels exist with built heritage, successfully addressed through TDR which enable owners of heritage buildings to realise similar capital returns to those who own non-heritage buildings by transferring their development rights to other locations. Western Sydneyâs designated Growth Centres are ideally placed for such transfer of development rights to save productive peri-urban land. The second issue relates to reversing âRural Residentialâ zoning. Many local government areas are pressured by the electorate to rezone agricultural land to âRural Residentialâ. This is the least supportable way to use such valuable productive land as it merely satisï¬es the desires of afï¬uent exurbanites seeking so-called âlifestyle livingâ in the rural areas outside cities. Conversion of prime farming land in the Sydney region into rural residential lots has been at the forefront of political and development conï¬ict about appropriate planning for peri-urban lands (Sinclair et al. 2003). European designer/planners offer alternative models for âRural Livingâ that allow for continued productive farming associated with new clustered residential areas. This involves innovative land tenure and inventive forms of governance drawn from the organizational strategies associated with cooperatives. There are interesting examples in the Netherlands, Hamburg and Zurich, such as the"
167,237,0.987,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"In spite of all positive results, the regions are quite restricted by the federal legislation. Both on the federal and regional levels there is a lack of mechanisms to implement the northern indigenous peoplesâ rights, guaranteed by the Constitution and the federal legislation related to land use, self-government, development of traditional occupations and cultures; there is no well-considered system of regional and branch laws and other normative legislation, which has made it impossible to implement the declared rights. As the result, both federal and regional regulations are fragmentary, there is no system of public authorities providing for protection, guarantees, cooperation, and other forms of preservation of territories and traditional activities of the northern indigenous peoples. That is the reason why despite provided legal regulation there is still a high demand to support northern indigenous peoples, to regard the high vulnerability of their traditional activities, culture and ethnic identity under the conditions of globalization and Arctic industrial development. We must admit that not only the Russian Federation is facing such challenges. High unemployment, along with health, social, and economic problems, has become a serious issue in other Arctic states (Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) 2004). Among the greatest problems for many northern indigenous peoplesâ are: permanent settlement, relocation, urbanization, climate change as well as the northward advancement of agriculture, introduction of elaborate infrastructure and migration from the South (e.g. fossil fuels extraction, new jobs in public services and tourism) (Arctic Human Development Report (AHDR) 2004; Nuttall 2000, 2002) Focusing to Russia, the current situation is exacerbated by âlegal stagnationâ and a step back from former positions of the stateâs participation and protection of the territories and traditional activities of the northern indigenous peoples (Kryazhkov 2013). The following examples illustrate the point: â The lack of any new notable legal acts in this area. During the last decade the main positive achievements were the legal settling of the issue regarding registration of persons, pertaining to indigenous peoples, and the maintaining of the nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life (Federal Law 2011). The Federal law âTerritories of Traditional Nature Use of the Indigenous Peoples of the North, Siberia and Far East of the Russian Federationâ adopted in 2001 has not been observed and amended for 8 years (Federal Law 2001). â The repeal in 2004 of the Federal Law âThe Basics of the State Regulation of Social and Economic Development of the North of the Russian Federationâ (Federal Law 1996). This political decision may be characterized as a denial by the state of the special policy considering the specifics of the northern regions and indigenous peoples living there (Kryazhkov 2013). â The withdrawal of several provisions related to indigenous peoples from the federal legislation in the period of 2004â2016.3 As the result, at present, it is no longer possible for indigenous peoples to obtain plots of land for lifetime ownership with hereditary succession and be able to use them free of charge; the allotment of lands for traditional fishing and hunting are provided on the general legal basis. â The main federal law regulating aboriginal land rights â âOn Territories of Traditional Natural Resource Useâ â lacks effective mechanisms of legal protec3"
174,340,0.987,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"These rising powers have all eschewed unilateral military action, openly backing peacekeeping as a multilateral alternative, preferably with the consent of the host government. Their commitment to a less militarized world coheres with their comparative advantage of âsoft powerââof which peacebuilding is one elementârather than traditional âhardâ power of military troop deployments and operations. Civilian-led peacebuilding efforts offer a way to advance security objectives in a deliberately nonunilateral, non-militarized manner. It is no coincidence that these efforts, and the expanded roles in development and peacebuilding, occurred on the heels of the crisis of legitimacy of the UN Security Council following the US invasion of Iraq without its consent in 2003. The elections of Recep Tayyip ErdogÌan as prime minister of Turkey and of Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva as president of Brazil ushered in governments that sought more prominent and active roles in global politics. At times, these countries sought to alter the structure of global order, and at other times they sought to rise within that order (de Coning et al. 2015). South Africa, India, and Brazil campaigned for a revamped UN Security Council in which they would have permanent seats (McDonald and Patrick 2010; Pouliot and Therien 2015). Material interests also drive investment and technical cooperation in risky war-torn environments. Abdenur and De Souza (2014) argue that development and peacebuilding interventions reflect direct economic gains as well as security or principled interests of rising powers. Brazilian diplomats acknowledge that opening markets in sub-Saharan Africa was a goal that converged with that countryâs concern to assist post-conflict Lusophone countries like Guinea-Bissau, Angola, and Mozambique (Charles Call interviews with various diplomats who requested anonymity, Brasilia, August 2015). Chinaâs access to raw materials and markets in Africa is an acknowledged benefit of its increased peacebuilding engagement. Yet, interviews conducted for this book reveal that values and principles underlie choices to carry out peacebuilding in ways that reflect less hierarchy, less conditionality, less security-focus, and a greater commitment to longer-term accompaniment rather than urgent stabilization and exit. These motives and values are not the focus of this piece, but are relevant to the analysis that follows. Our aim here is rather to identify the main characteristics of these selected rising powersâ approaches to peacebuilding, putting into relief their differences from traditional, Western approaches. It is important to note that these rising powers are democratic regimes whose policies may be even closer to Western approaches than nontraditional donors such as China, Russia, and the Gulf states."
293,233,0.986,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","this literature is based on single case or country studies. These studies provide a good contextualized understanding of the perceptions and processes leading to outreach policies, but they fail to test hypotheses systematically across a larger number of cases. Moreover, the ï¬rst wave of studies of migrant transnationalism exhibited a tendency to sample on the dependent variable (Portes 2001). This extends to the analysis of sending country policies as well, since few studies have included emigration countries with little or no political or administrative attention to emigrants (MÃ¼gge 2012a). Finally, studies do not necessarily operate with the same dependent variable. Comparative analyses of sending country policies have tended to focus on only one set of outreach policies, such as political rights, without positioning them within the wider context of policies towards emigrants (Ragazzi 2014). Yet, different sets of policies may derive from different motivations, rendering the ï¬ndings from one policy ï¬eld less applicable to another. A ï¬rst step towards understanding sending country policies is to elaborate a typology of sending countries based on the scope and intensity of a broad range of outreach policies. A basic categorization is between states that do reach out to emigrants, such as Italy, and those that do not, such as Denmark. In addition to this distinction between engaged and disengaged states, there is a category of âstrategically selective statesâ, which encourage emigrants to stay in touch but extend to them only a subset of rights and services (Levitt and Glick Schiller 2004). Some studies have based their classiï¬cation on the motives underlying policies. For instance, Gamlen (2008) builds a classiï¬cation on the distinction between diaspora creating and diaspora integrating policy mechanisms, concluding that those states that employ one set of policies but not the other are emigration states âon paperâ or in an incoherent way (ibid.). In a somewhat similar vein, studies of sending countries have employed notions of governance, or the Foucauldian notion of âgovernmentalityâ, as the dependent variable, identifying types and forms of extraterritorial sending country policies aimed at creating, mobilizing, or controlling emigrant populations from afar (DÃ©lano and Gamlen 2014; Gamlen 2008; Maisonave 2011). Recent analyses base their classiï¬cation of sending country policies on the different conï¬gurations of policies. This results in a classiï¬cation that distinguishes not only between the disinterested and engaged states, but also between the expatriate state (which directs cultural and educational policies at high-income expats who reside temporarily abroad) and the managed labour state (which maintains policies to attract remittances and extend welfare provisions to lower income emigrant workers) (Ragazzi 2014). The distinction between policies directed at migrants perceived as temporarily abroad and those considered permanent expatriates is important and echoes the classiï¬cation of R. C. Smith (2003b) between emigrant policies and global nation policies. There is a key difference between those countries that primarily want to facilitate labour export and those that aim mainly to keep in touch with overseas nationals and their descendants. Both sets of countries may be interested in keeping remittances ï¬owing, but the existence of a broader set of âbondingâ policies is more likely among the latter. When it comes to explaining why states reach out to their emigrant populations, the literature points to a broad range of historical and (geo) political variables that"

Rather than having a rigid template to be brought to the host countries, Indonesia tends to approach them with a âblank sheetâ. Indonesian diplomats and analysts interviewed for this study suggest that Indonesia often takes a longer time to explore the needs of respected countries while opening up genuine communications with different local stakeholders both from government and non-governmental actors. Indonesia believes that each country has its own strengths. Indonesiaâs role is to support each country as it crafts its own peacebuilding process, rather than pushing it from the outside. This approach contributes to the establishment of a sense of national ownership, which is critical to ensure the success of any peacebuilding effort. Furthermore, a persuasive approach is necessary in peace efforts in order not to challenge the governmentâs sovereignty. The demand for learning from Indonesiaâs experiences should come from the host countries, rather than being imposed by the Indonesian government. Indonesia emphasizes a mutual learning process when conducting peacebuilding activities. Rather than the partner countries simply learning from Indonesiaâs experiences, it is always a two-way exercise in which Indonesia also learns from the other side. Since Indonesia, in its encounter with partner countries, is willing to divulge that it is also still struggling with many internal problems that threaten sustainable peace, partner countries are persuaded of the value of Indonesiaâs role, especially to be open in exploring and discussing their problems. This first step is crucial to the process of finding solutions. However, Indonesiaâs peacebuilding role faces many challenges. The first challenge comes from within the government: a lack of coordination among different government institutions. Within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, several directorates handle peacebuilding in Myanmar. Based on geography, Myanmar is handled under the responsibility of the Directorate of ASEAN Political Affairs and Security, as well as the Directorate for East Asia and Pacific. Peacebuilding is also categorized as part of Indonesiaâs public diplomacy, and some activities are coordinated by the Directorate of Technical Cooperation under the DirectorateGeneral of Public Diplomacy. Other activities involve other ministries or agencies such as the police or military institutions. The second challenge is the lack of detailed and centralized databases containing records on peacebuilding programs and activities. Related to"

Steps must be taken to ï¬ll two gaps that prevent such management. First, there are no plans for almost all (more than 1000) minor ï¬sheries, and only a few of the major ones have a management plan. Second, the means (equipment, training, and protocols) must be put in place and applied in as many ï¬sheries as possible. The means to establish monitoring programs for reservoir and river ï¬sheries all over BF have come from SUSFISH projectâs provision of equipment and training for surveying and monitoring as well as ï¬eld data that conï¬rm that ï¬sh and benthic macroinvertebrates can be used as bioindicators of conditions in and around aquatic ecosystems. On this basis, managers can monitor the status of ï¬sheries and surrounding habitats as well as trends in anthropogenic impacts on aquatic fauna. Education programs for students and government agents need to be established and integrated with university research programs. In BF, there are a number of ways to improve the governance of aquatic resources, especially ï¬sheries, and the sectors of society and surrounding landscapes that impact ï¬sheries (Fig. 27.6). At the national level, efforts should be made to forge a vision of sustainable ï¬sheries that is communicated to and made workable at all levels of society and governance. National level policy makers have failed to make a national future perspective of ï¬sheries operative either at the federal, regional, or local levels. A national âvisionâ has been recorded, but it remains theory on paper, not a practical, working vision that informs policy and implementation. Failure to lead and provide a unifying vision means that local as well as regional and national actors have no paradigm of ï¬sheries development to rally around and use as a baseline against which to measure policy performance. While indicators are lacking, evidence of failure accumulates. Infrastructure (ï¬sh ponds, refrigerators, ï¬sh weighing scales, ï¬sh shops) has been installed but either not maintained and allowed to decay or converted for private use. Such patent failures undermine trust in the government institutions that establish and execute programs, projects, and policies to develop infrastructure. National governance of ï¬sheries could be improved by harmonizing policies of different ministries such that their implementation reinforces each other. Fisheries sustainability depends on integration of policies governing a range of diverse activities, e.g., water, agriculture, forests, mining, and tourism. Institutional nomadism,"
27,188,0.986,Limits To The European UnionâS Normative Power in a Post-Conflict Society : Eulex and Peacebuilding in Kosovo,"character as it considers the validity and reliability of interview-based research in post-conflict societies. EULEX as a way for the EU to project its normative power in Kosovoâs customs, police and judiciary This bookâs main theme explores the sort of normative power actor the EU wanted to become in its peacebuilding efforts in Kosovo through one of its most ambitious engagements abroadâthe EULEX rule-of-law missionâas well as what kind of power the EU has actually exercised in this respect as perceived by local residents (a normative power or âsimplyâ a powerful actor that uses any means to achieve its aims?). Drawing from the general research question, the monograph tried to demonstrate the effects of the EUâs attempt to normatively influence developments in this post-conflict society via EULEX, and here the research assessed whether it is prudent for the EU to try to act normatively within the peacebuilding domainâand to thus be eventually perceived by the local community as âa force for goodâ (a normative power actor). Last but not least, the research evaluated EULEXâs direct impact in the three core areas of its engagement: improving the functioning of Kosovoâs police, customs and judiciary. Beginning at the end: the research shows that EULEXâs work has to some extent beneï¬tted the targeted areas. Generally speaking, Kosovoâs police and customs perform better today than they did prior to EULEXâs engagement. While EULEX has helped to strengthen both the police and customs, several management and leadership challenges remain, including a certain level of identiï¬ed political interference. Inter-organisational communication and cooperation, especially in the Kosovo PoliceâKosovo Prosecutorial Ofï¬ce relationship remain challenging, as revealed in several EU reports. Next, the judiciary in Kosovo still struggles to deal with serious cases of corruption and organised crime, a fact that is a big disappointment for the Albanian, Serb and other ethnic communities in Kosovo, EULEX staff (local and international) and external observers alike. Our research also shows that EULEX has positively contributed in several ways to build sustainable peace in Kosovo, particularly in law enforcement training and establishing dialogue between the EU and local authorities (although this might not be considered too great achievement given most local actors in Kosovo, both Albanian and Serb, are keen on cooperating with the EU). EULEXâs contribution has also been observed indirectly, e.g. by facilitating the dialogue between Belgrade and Prishtina, since this EU mission provided a framework for the two sides to cooperate. Further assistance is required in training on the use of sophisticated equipment and ensuring that Kosovo Customs is well equipped to perform its work, especially while the EU continues to provide the necessary means to establish permanent border crossing points between Kosovo and Serbia. Special attention is also needed when addressing the high levels of publicly perceived corruption inside Kosovo Customs. Efforts should be made to investigate what is driving the continuously poor evaluations and to improve the publicâs perception of Kosovo Customs. Finally, because it is highly likely that the stronger influx of irregular migration in"
128,67,0.986,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"IntroductIon During the summer of 2015, an unprecedented wave of solidarity with incoming refugees from Syria and other countries of the Middle East, Africa and Asia swept through Germany. Innumerable initiatives and individual citizens committed to what was called the new German âwelcoming cultureâ. These initiatives not only engaged in the provision of immediate help (e.g., clothing, food, shelter, language courses and assistance with German administration) but also rallied in support of migrant and refugee rights. The inability of German authorities to handle the inflow of migrants and the growing mobilization of populist, right-wing and xenophobic groups, dampened the âwelcoming cultureâ considerably and boosted conflicts on the correct policies for the German administration to pursue. As a consequence, solidarity became a contested issue. While some rallied for solidarity with all people in need of helpârefugees includedâand insisted that âwe can do thisâ (Schiffauer et al. 2017), oth-"
341,409,0.986,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"It has been more than 20 years since the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) became the Southern African Development Community (SADC). With regard to water resource governance and management, SADC member states have been engaged in significant institution building, at national and regional levels, over the past two decades. All member states have or have expressed their intention to revise their water laws, to reform their governance arrangements and to create new water management organisations. Most have attempted to bring their national laws, policies and procedures into line with fellow member states, all of which are informed by the Revised SADC Protocol on Shared Watercourses (referred to as the âSADC Protocolâ from here on), and dominant global discourses concerning integrated water resource management, water integrity and water efficiency, to name only three of the many conceptual influences active in the region. These initiatives are supported by a seemingly never-ending flow of people, finance, technology and ideas from Europe and elsewhere in the world. It is a rather grand experiment with uneven results (Swatuk and Fatch 2013). These mixed results are understandable. This is especially so when one considers the failure to factor into plans, policies and programmes the historical basis and contemporary manifestation of the politics of water resource access and use in postcolonial/post-apartheid Southern Africa. Put differently, Southern Africa comprises a set of unevenly developed states where access to water and land reflects profound socio-economic inequalities. To shy away from these facts is to guarantee poor water governance. Thus, to say that a triple-E (social equity, economic efficiency, environmental sustainability) bottom line is the aim of national/regional water governance is simply not enough (SADC 2011, 2012). The region must move beyond high-minded platitudes to improve practices and achieve better outcomes. This requires asking difficult questions regarding the relationship between existing governance structures and management practices and their role in, and relationship to, abiding conditions of widespread poverty and unequal access to and economically and environmentally unsustainable use of water. As with South Asia, demographic drivers â urban population growth, abiding rural poverty â and extensively shared international waters should concentrate the minds of decision-makers, particularly under the speculative cloud of the negative impacts of climate change. Many good things have happened over the past two decades. The legal basis is mostly in place regarding fair and equitable use of the regionâs resources, both"

Birmingham has a much higher percentage of NEETs than other areas of the West Midlands, and this project directly addressed local authority concerns about this group and their future employment prospects. In addition, the target group focus on those from ethnic minority backgrounds tied in with local political discourse about community cohesion and social inclusion. The project also connected with the national and local neighbourhood and worklessness agendas by supporting young people into self-employment based in their local communities. As part of gaining WNF funding, projects had to demonstrate how they added value to the citywide employment and skills strategy. The funding opportunity combined with Birminghamâs willingness to use the resources to try some different and interesting things also provided the environment for the innovation to be supported. It also linked with the move to working in partnership and a desire to increase involvement of the third sector.

126,368,0.986,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Turkana villagersâ urgent requests that the GOK stop the threat to the lake from the Gibe III have been sidelined or ignored altogether. Even widespread pleas by northern Turkana ï¬shing communities for GOK support of their ï¬shing rights in the face of Ethiopia-based commercial ï¬shing fleets exploiting Kenyaâs northern Lake Turkana waters have gone unheeded. Members of the Beach Management Units (government controlled but locally based ï¬sheries management bodies) at Lake Turkana continually complain about the governmentâs refusal to respond to their extreme fear of their livelihood being destroyed by the Omo basin developmentsâand in immediate terms by the large, Ethiopia based commercial ï¬shing boats taking major catch from the northern reaches of Kenyaâs lake. â¢ The GOK failed entirely to inform its vast population in the lake region regarding the actual impacts of the Gibe III and its associated development on their communities, let alone earn for their âfree and informed consent,â as mandated by the United Nations, the African Union and the GOK itself. Chap. 9 briefly described how âcommunity consultationsâ with the AFDBâs socioeconomic impact assessment consultants were orchestrated events with what were clearly predetermined outcomes. Villagers in two different communities where such âconsultationsâ were held reported to SONT (South Omo/North Turkana Research Project) researchers that the AFDB âvisitorsâ gave them assurances that the Gibe III dam would bring major amounts of food, clothing, health care and schooling to their communities. No mention was made of lake retreat or its effects on their ï¬shing, their livestock raising or their households. To the contrary, the consultants repeatedly stressed that the lake âwould not be harmedâ by the dam. In their written report for the AFDB (in 2009), the socioeconomic consultants stated in their report (AFDB 2009) that their role was to describe the âbeneï¬tsâ of the dam for local communities. By all accounts, Kenyan police, local government ofï¬cials and âtranslatorsâ were highly intimidating in these meetings (one of which SONT researchers attended.) Despite the consultantsâ assurances to communities regarding the Gibe III and âpositiveâ conclusions regarding the socioeconomic impacts of the dam in their report back to the AFDB, the consultants did notate (although inconspicuously in the reportâs main textâsee Chap. 6) extreme anger expressed by village elders over the dam project, which they had learned from other sources would bring destruction to their ï¬shing and livestock raising at the lake. The exceptionally low quality of information gathering and analysis by the AFDB socioeconomic impact consultants for the Lake Turkana region, combined with their obvious bias (even self described) throughout the process, underscore the assessmentâs invalidity. There has been no adequate socioeconomic or environmental comprehensive impact assessment of the Lake Turkana region facing extreme crisis. â¢ A major proportion of Turkana pastoralists and ï¬shers settled in villages along Lake Turkana (see Fig. 9.4 and in nearby lands were either omittedâor in some cases. vastly underestimatedâin the GOKâs 2009 census. These communities are therefore unlikely in the extreme to be accounted with the dismantlement of their ï¬shing and pastoral from the effects of lake retreat. Those households and communities surviving destruction from lake retreat who do manage to relocate to a town with the hope of receiving assistance are likely to be regarded as drought victims rather than development victims. Given the highly aridic conditions of the region and the immense distances required, few would be able to reach Kenyaâs international borders to be counted as ârefugeesâ. When discussing their situation and their fear of changes to come, comments such as, You will just come across our bones on the landâ are commonplace among village elders at the lake. Ironically, these types of comments by the Turkana are also common among their northern neighbors, the Dasanech, with whom they are locked into increasing armed conflict in the face of their equally desperate efforts to survive (Fig. 5.3). â¢ Fear of Kenyaâs security forces prevails throughout the northernmost Turkana territory, as these forces are widely known to operate with impunityâincluding with brutality, in some areas. Although to date, the GOK has not exercised politically repressive measures equal to those of the GOE, the government is intolerant of opposition, whether to the Gibe III development or to the widespread incursion of oil corporations into Turkana lands (see Appendix A). Such threats have caused major curtailment of community voice throughout the area. â¢ In 2012, Kenya and Ethiopia, along with the World Bank and the AFDB, announced their partnership to build a USD 1.2 billion energy transmission line from Ethiopia to Kenya: the Eastern Electricity Highway Project, or"

Between the local government and civil society organisations (CSOs) working in the field of social welfare, a âcompactâ has been formulated and agreed upon. The aim of the compact is to serve as a platform for dialogue and cooperation between the local authorities and CSOs. There are pronounced expectations on the civil society to play an active part in the renewal of social welfare (Segnestam Larsson and Carrigan 2013). There seems thus to be some ambivalence inherent in this interest when, at the same time, the procurement of services from CSOs are very limited compared to private businesses."

However, while globalist in this regard it is like the system centred on nation-states in another way: it has no inherent respect for universal human rights; its calculations concern profitability. Partnerships between the system of market power and the nation-state system have emerged around the exploitative use of migrant labour (Gasper/Truong 2010a). Since womenâs labour too is a space for intensified exploitation, migrant womenâs labour is such a space par excellence. A âmigration regimeâ is a system of regulation of migration that covers far more than formal laws and written regulations. De facto systems of national and international regulation of lower-skilled migrant workers frequently allow additional value to be extracted from these workers through their official rejection as legal migrants. Huijsmans (2011; see also chapter 19), for example, noted that Laos (the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic) prohibits the recruitment of Lao workers for unskilled work in Thailand, and yet all participants know that this is what the largest group of Lao international migrant workers do. Kusakabe and Pearson in chapter 4 demonstrated the impacts of the migration regime for foreign women workers in Thailand and the human costs of a blinkered approach (see also Doneys 2011; Pearson/Kusakabe 2012). Negative impacts are partly deliberately discriminatory and partly unintended in countries where economic expansion induces in-migration, particularly to activities which citizens become unwilling to undertake, and yet where national identity is a product in the making or something that is reviving. Many migration regimes are attempting to control a transnational phenomenon that is unavoidable, but are doing so while an exercise in nation-building is still going on. In such situations Mushakoji (2011) warns against attempts to directly enforce universal humanist values in order to defend migrants, for migrant rights will then be reviled as imperialist imposition. He advises instead seeking creative syntheses of humanist values with compatible strands in the national culture. A migration regime extends across borders, and interfaces with and links to other such regimes, as shown by Irianto and Truong in chapter 2. Many actors are involved in the multi-billion-dollar migration industry, in both its legal and illegal channels, including not only recruitment agents and smugglers and traffickers of persons, but especially the employers and customers who benefit from the low-cost flexible supply of labour power and goods and services.

143,507,0.986,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"According to PrÃ¶pper and Steenbeek (1998), it is imperative to close the gap between government and its citizens, increase commitment to handling challenges, and create support for an interactive and consultative decision-making process. This involves understanding that the basis of the stateâsociety relationship is that citizens and their leaders have the responsibility and commitment to realize goals are in the publicâs best interest. Klijn and Koppenjan (2000) suggested that the closure of the gap between the government and its citizens typically has a positive impact on the legitimacy (in terms of support and acceptance) of the government. Research camed out by Van der Veen (1999) in the Netherlands on local governments that have experimented with interactive and consultative decision-making found that the influence of citizens and interest groups on public policymaking was enhanced. The main motivations for involving stakeholders in interactive decision-making are to diminish the veto power of various societal actors by involving them from the start, thereby improving the quality of decision-making by using the information and solutions of the various actors as well as to bridge the perceived growing cleavage between citizens and elected politicians. These two theories are useful in looking at, and explaining, the level of feedback loops and interactivity that enabled a dynamic policy development process in Kenya, without which much of the success we have seen in the ICT sector would never have happened. To illustrate the policymaking dynamism already alluded to in the foregoing discussion, three cases are discussed below. Two were successfully implemented, and one failed."

It seems that the hostility against migrants and the political polarization of Nicaraguan society has diminished the possibilities of collective action. Additionally, political parties in Nicaragua do not recognize emigration as a challenge for their own agendas and, except in electoral periods, ignore their co-nationals in Costa Rica. What seem to matter are remittances, not those who produce value. The possibility of larger migrant organizations able to produce their own ways of demanding recognition and distribution in different forums (Fraser 2008) seems to depend on the recognition that any collective action project has to be grounded in the communities. Rather than a fixed agenda and rigid ways of working, collective efforts have to be strategic, based on limits and potentialities. Again, translation, rather than a sort of master plan, seems to be the key. However, translation implies actors who are able to be present at different scales. The intellectual division of work between community work and national or international advocacy is without reservation an impediment for translating agendas and the triangulation of efforts. In other words, the challenge not only refers to ideas or proposals but also to the âsituatednessâ of academic, social, and political actors. Migrant communities are impoverished and share a vast number of limitations, but at the same time they are vital to a number of key economic activities. In interviewing women who work in the pineapple industry â Costa Rica is the leading world exporter â they recounted how they stopped a pineapple processing plant because they did not receive a minimum wage. Instead their income was based on the amount of fruit selected, and they received very little money if the number of fruits selected for export declined. So they wrote a letter to justify their refusal to continue working. The managers agreed to change the payment scheme (Sandoval/Brenes/Paniagua 2012). Such experiences have to be channelled into a long-term effort of constituting political subjects, and social science research can contribute to this. The key may reside in the articulation of efforts and mobilizations rather than in mutual disqualification. One step in the linking work may consist of facilitating possibilities for political formation in communities, so that those who participate in community initiatives may also acquire competencies to participate in national or regional networks. In other words, independent of the migratory condition, pedagogical processes need to be facilitated that strengthen what Davis, MartÃ­nez, and Warner (2010: 87) call âsubstan-"
164,33,0.986,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Addressing marginality is not only a matter for central and local governments, but also a task for civil society organizations (see the review of the BRAC experience in Chap. 16 this volume), business, and local communities themselves. In Part V of this book, policies and programs, as well as actors addressing marginality are discussed. Public policy assessments begin with Ahmadâs work (Chap. 18 this volume) on macroeconomic, fiscal, and decentralization options to address marginality. How does one reach the extremely poor and marginal groups in countries where local politicians and officials may have little incentive to provide for them? The instruments that might be involved include a range of options: transfers or assistance from higher levels of government (donors), cash support, the provision of public services (particularly health care and education), forms of employment support, and assistance for small-scale enterprises. The author outlines some of the difficulties attached to making government sourced cash transfers more effective in reaching the marginalized poor, such as the lack of political will, leakage of funds and capture at the local level by vested interests, weak public financial management systems, the lack of information about target groups, and incomplete knowledge about beneficiary needs. Ahmad offers a typology of options that is useful for improving the reach of efforts to provide for the poorest of society and concludes that simple categorical targeting mechanisms, such as through clinics or schools, can improve the effectiveness of reaching the marginalized. Good governance efforts to track and account for funds and their outcomes are among the essential ingredients for policies to successfully provide for the poorest. In the absence of genuine local interest in providing support for the marginalized and extremely poor, direct funding to beneficiaries by central governments and aid agencies appears to be the only feasible option. Social protection programs, especially cash transfer programs, have spread across low-income and middle-income countries over the past two decades and are increasingly part of national poverty reduction and development strategies. Hulme et al. (Chap. 19 this volume) pose the question, âJust Give Money to the Poor?â and discuss insights from long-term research on social protection policies, including both conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs, which have become quite popular around the developing world over the past 20 years. The authors provide a brief history of the development of social protection and cash transfer programs, which can fill gaps where markets fail, especially with regards to the labor market and the environmentâtwo crucial sources of livelihood for the marginalized poor. The authors give examples of the specific goals, targets, and conditions of various social protection and particularly cash transfer programs from a broad cross-section of countries, and how they have been perceived by both their"

One persistent question, however, concerns the sustainability of these initiatives. Will there be a resurgence in Brazilian peacebuilding? Within the UN, it is likely that Brazilâs political commitment to the PBA, which has been deeply entrenched both in Brasilia and at the mission in New York, will continue. Outside of the UN, the possibility of another surge in Brazilian peacebuilding is constrained not only by the dual political and economic crisis, but also by the âspread too thinâ character of Brazilâs engagement during the 2000s. This overextension is particularly evident in the countryâs South-South development cooperation portfolio, with many projects indefinitely suspended in 2016 due to budget cuts. Combined with low institutionalization, as reflected in the lack of a dedicated legal framework and career path specializing in development cooperation within the MRE, the funding gap leads to lapses in institutional learning and feedback mechanisms that would enable improvements, such as in project planning and accountability. Although Brazilâs expanded peacekeeping role has been highly visible, thanks to its participation in MINUSTAH and MONUSCO, the way that Brazil links peacekeeping and peacebuilding initiatives differs from the approaches of the other rising powers. For instance, whereas India sees development and peacebuilding as deeply intertwined, and whereas Turkey links peacebuilding with humanitarian and peacemaking efforts, for Brazil there is a clearer (but by no means absolute) distinction between peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Brazil does embrace the distinction between those two spheres made in UN circles, but these two dimensions are more closely linked in Brazilian practice than in Western efforts. This is because Brazil views peacebuilding as a key corrective to conventional approaches to peacekeeping, especially the heavy focus on security and military-dominated initiatives. By linking civilian peacebuilding alongside peacekeeping operations, as was done in Haiti through the partnership with Viva Rio, Brazil hopes to ensure that peacekeeping missions not only meet the everyday security needs of the local population, but also helps to ensure its economic and social well-being. Brazilâs main contribution, therefore, is not to enhance the Western approach to peacebuilding, but rather to use peacebuilding in order to help rebalance Western approaches in a less securitized direction. However, in order to push for deeper transformation, Brazil needs to make its own peacebuilding more sustainable, coherent, and accountable."

This chapter concludes with policy guidance to decision-makers and practitioners in the form of overarching principles on how to set up the appropriate framework conditions for inclusive water governance. Evidence presented in this chapter demonstrates that decision-makers who adopt a systemic, inclusive approach to water governance are likely to get a better return on the time and resources they invest. They will also be better equipped to handle stakeholder issues and risks more effectively. For engagement processes to be relevant, a careful balance is required between what they try to achieve, the resources they require and whether they succeed in reaching the intended objectives. Decision-makers at all levels have a critical role to play in establishing the enabling environment for result-oriented, effective and impactful stakeholder engagement. Although engagement processes cannot be easily replicated from one context to another, the OECD proposes six principles for creating the necessary conditions for inclusive water governance. Anton Earle defines transboundary watercourses, including rivers, lakes and aquifers (confined and unconfined), shared between two or more countries that are home to over 70 % of the worldâs population and supply water for roughly 60 % of the global food production. It is no surprise that the management of these watercourses has been entrusted to national states, which have the power to make sovereign decisions over their management, use and conservation. State sovereignty is mitigated through the existence of a global institutional framework comprised of customary international water law (the norms dictating how states behave), global and regional conventions, basin-level agreements and basin management organisations. The good news is that there is a large body of joint institutions between countries with transboundary watercourses, the UN estimating that around 3 600 exist. This in part explains the relative lack of military interstate conflicts. Less good news is that despite the existence of international and basin-level agreements and basin organisations, the benefits to be expected from international cooperation around transboundary watercourses have in most cases not materialised. Acute, persistent and seemingly intractable problems persist, with ecosystem degradation not being reversed, joint investments in water infrastructure not materialising and joint management organisations failing to attract significant long-term support from the respective basin states. Despite at least two decades of concerted support by the international development community, the impacts of enhanced interstate cooperation are noticeable through their absence. This chapter investigates why this may be so and introduces a starting point which moves beyond the state-centric approach to transboundary water management. In doing so it does not challenge the sovereign right of states to manage their watercourses; instead it shows how a range of non-state actors do in fact influence state practice through a variety of mechanisms. As these mechanisms are frequently covert, it becomes difficult to assess the integrity of the relationships between actors, in turn making public engagement and participation difficult. Needed is a governance paradigm which opens the decision-making arena to non-state actors all in support of the national governments and their respective mandates. This chapter ends with an indication of what such a governance arrangement might look like"

If multilevel governance is normatively deï¬ned as the process through which policymaking and policy implementation is coordinated vertically between levels of government and attuned horizontally across governmental and nongovernmental actors (see Scholten et al. 2015), we can then conclude that we have only just started out, and that much more multilevel governance is needed in practice in the ï¬eld of integration. Finally, our examination of the development of integration policies and deï¬nitions of integration at the EU level enable us to place in context the shift from the original deï¬nition of integration as a two-way process to the EUâs new deï¬nition of integration as a three-way process.

In the DIAMINT project we found numerous examples of public intellectuals who seek media attention in order to influence policymakers in this domain. Finally, what can be observed in many countries, as well as at the EU level, is the growth of dialogue structures for purposes of policy monitoring. The German BAMF and the Dutch SCP can be considered as the most institutionalised versions of this type of dialogue structure. This also applies to MIPEX, though it monitors policy compliance rather than policy performance. A key rationale for dialogue structures of this type, which we will discuss further in the next section, is that they help identify areas for policy action and provide coordinating ministries with tools to mobilise policy intervention by other ministries and institutional bodies that possess âhard governanceâ tools that enable them to act more directly in a specific policy area where such intervention is deemed necessary."

174,341,0.986,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"dIvergent worldvIews and theorIes of change? The different approaches of rising powers may best captured in the context of broader understandings about development, and especially what was once known as âpolitical developmentââthat is, how developmental states emerge over time and through what historical processes, and how stable polities and regional arrangements emerge and are sustained. In concrete terms, these are distinct âtheories of changeâ in peace processes, peacebuilding, and institutional development. The peacebuilding approach of traditional donorsâembodied by the OECDâis focused on preventing lapses or relapses into violent conflict. While it recognizes that there may be deeper root causes at work that need longer-term attention, it tends to focus on addressing more immediate tensions that, if left unaddressed, can become triggers for violent conflict. Recent best practice in the âtraditional donorâ approach in any given setting is that peacebuilding interventions need to be informed by a conflict analysis that seeks to map the conflict by identifying the main actors, the conflict drivers, the political economy of the conflict, and the political history of the conflict.2 This kind of technical analysis usually finds that conflicts are driven by political, social, and economic inequalities between groups. These groups are usually organized along ethnic, religious, or language identities, and the conflict is typically linked to one or more groups feeling marginalized, for instance, due to centerâperiphery inequalities. Economic actors and factors are not ignored, but are placed in the context of these group dynamics. They generally manifest an emphasis on the free flow of goods and services, especially capital. The traditional donor approach to peacebuilding in this context is typically aimed at trying to change the behavior of the political system that causes marginalization and inequality by introducing incentives that encourage greater political pluralism and political freedoms. It tends to focus on trying to address such inequalities in political processes and institutions, the civil service, the judicial and security sector, both by making these state institutions more representative of the population of a given country and by spreading state services to the periphery. The theory of change is that greater political access and participation will lead to greater social stability, which will be conducive to development and economic prosperity. The rising powers seem to have a different theory of political, social, and economic change. Politics, development, and stability are seen as closely interlinked, with political complexity emerging in step with advances in"

This process is documented by international human rights organizations for the traditional lands of the Mursi and their neighbors (Fig. 1.3). To the extent possible, SONT researchers have documented the expropriation process in the less accessible Dasanech (and Nyangatom) lands in the lowermost Omo basin (see Chaps. 7 and 8). Most of the Dasanech communities that have been expropriated from their traditional lands along the lowermost Omo have no option but to take refuge within (or nearby) the modern Omo delta. This involuntary movement into the delta region greatly worsens the already crowded conditions there for agropastoralists and ï¬shing communities already settled there.14 â¢ The Ethiopian government forces respond with repressive measuresâoften, with brutalityâwhen Dasanech or Nyangatom communities resist expropriation from their riverine lands. Fear among villagers throughout the region is intensifying. Such political repression and the GOEâs denial of residentsâ access to river waters essential to their survival constitute human rights violations, as deï¬ned by the United Nations and other international bodies. A culture of fear pervades villages throughout the region where communities are already desperately searching for a means of survival. The response of the Kenyan government (GOK) to the survival plight of indigenous pastoralists and ï¬shers around Lake Turkana indicates a predominant attitude of indifference. This view is reflected in World Bank statements in internal documents, for example, citing the high likelihood of the GOK âoverlookingâ impacts of lake retreat on its indigenous population in favor of Gibe III dam electricity generated that is contracted for export to that âpower deï¬citâ nation."
181,180,0.986,Global Perspectives On Recognising Non-Formal and informal Learning : Why Recognition Matters (Volume 21.0),"5.3.1 The Role of Industry Bodies and Training Organisations in Designing RVA Processes in the Workplace One key factor in the implementation of RVA in Australia and New Zealand is the role of industry bodies and registered training organisations (RTOs) in designing and driving the RVA process. In Australia, RVA is offered by registered training organisations (RTOs) and state training authorities in accordance with the standards laid out in the Australian Quality Training Framework (Bowman et al. 2003). The RTOs are also responsible for assessments that lead to qualifications (DEEWR 2008). RVA processes for workers are tailored to their needs and to the needs of the enterprises, and while partnerships with educational institutions are not excluded from these RVA processes, they are not central to it. Nevertheless, the Australian government takes the lead role in ensuring that the system of recognition functions reliably and transparently; the Australian system relies on the active participation of the state and territory governments and other stakeholders. In South Africa, the industry Sector Education and Training Authorities have designed RVA processes for workers. In Canada, the certification bodies for regulated professions have developed RVA practices for their jurisdictions and the Canadian Sector Councils have sponsored a range of initiatives to promote RVA at the workplace."
221,349,0.986,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"villages within forest area reach 19,420 villages (Dephut and BPS 2009 in Kartodihardjo et al. 2011). The cost of developing forest boundary is quite expensive. Following the regulation from the MoF, cost for changing forest functions that include developing forest boundary is 3.4 billion IDR per 12,000 ha. To reduce the cost, the process of the development of the forest boundary could be integrated with the development of FMU and conducted through participatory mapping process. In line with recommendation from Kartodihardjo et al. (2011), in addressing this boundary issue in connection with FMU establishment, there are several strategic directives that should be adopted depending on conditions in the FMU. These directives include: 1. Localization of all areas that have serious tenurial conflict into areas of noneffective production as a transitional policy and gradually building a collaboration to optimize achievement of sustainable forest management objectives. 2. Development of micro-spatial arrangements together with the community in order to reach mutual agreement with the community on the utilization norms for each spatial function. 3. Recommendation of legal settlement through the mechanism of revising the spatial arrangements in areas with serious tenurial conflict that is unlikely to be retained as forest areas. 4. Accommodation of community access to forest resources by rearranging the norms for utilizing such resources in accordance with sustainability principles. 5. Development of a mechanism for recognizing community management rights in areas of serious/minor tenurial conflict in the context of sustainable forest management. This mechanism serves as the basis for FMU managers to prepare licensing recommendations for communities. 6. Engagement of law enforcement for all issues relating to illegal activities. Another important key factor for achieving SFM is availability and accessibility of funds for supporting SFM practices, particularly for engagement of communities in CFM. With the current system, the available fund to support CFM managed by the BLU-P3H as discussed above is not easily accessed by community due to the administration procedure. Policy allowing for transferring the funds to a financing system relatively easy to be accessed by community is required. Two types of financing systems that can be generated at regional level and may meet this need are âblending financingâ and âhybrid micro-financing systemsâ (CER Indonesia and CCAP 2010). Blending financing system is a financing system that synergizes all financial sources such as CSR funding, government funding such as state budget (APBN), and local government budget (APBD) funds, banking, and international funding. This system can help leverage private funding and supports regional development by supporting community activities in urban agriculture and agroforestry including building human resource capacity through assistance and training activities. Unlike the blending financing model, the hybrid micro-financing system will utilize more government funds than private funds. Funding to support CFM (HTR, HKm, HD/HAd), which is currently managed by BLU-P3H, would be part of this"
334,147,0.986,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"members of left-wing parties are responsible for implementing anti-immigrant policies for instance, which puts them at odds with their political base. In fact, the political agreement between the Socialist Party and left-wing citizens is challenged when the socialists head either the cantonal governments or the SEM (federal administration). Indeed, both positions are executive and require from the political elites that they implement popular initiatives approved by the Swiss people. The consequent shift of status from opposition party to government party results in a delicate compromise for socialist elites to consent to and adopt political positions that their constituents oppose (Goto 2013). Consequently, left-wing activists hold the ambivalent position of being careful not to delegitimize their own elites while simultaneously challenging migration policies such as the Dublin agreement. As early as the 1980s, civil society actors were organizing resistance against the side-effects of Swiss asylum policy. For instance, several churchesâmostly in the Latin part of Switzerlandâoffered shelter to rejected asylum seekers who had been awaiting a decision regarding their asylum application for 6 years and in the meantime had integrated into Swiss society (Parini 1997a, 144). Likewise, several protest actions were conducted in different regions of Switzerland to express the overall disapproval to Swiss asylum and deportation policies. As Parini (ibid., 147) states, âthe peak of the resistance activities occurred in the period from 1985 to 1988, which also witnessed the creation of several resistance movements against the restrictive policy that was gradually being implementedâ. Passy and Giugni (2005, 903) stress that the defense of migrants in Switzerland is often organized by protest groups âwhose political goals are not directly and specifically related to migrationâ. This includes for instance NGOs, human rights activists and, to a lesser extent, trade unions and churches (ibid.). According to the two scholars however, protest activities in the field of migration face difficulties succeeding in Switzerland: Switzerland is structured on an ethno-cultural and monistic design of the nation which makes access to the national community difficult. The imagined conception of Swiss citizenship thus poses a double-bind, both in the individual and collective access to the nation. This double-bind shapes a relationship to otherness where exclusion prevails and where it will be difficult for the actors who defend migrants and fight against racism to intervene in the political debate of this country. (Ibid., 899)"
334,473,0.986,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Migration and asylum issues are an important and contested policy field (van der Brug et al. 2015; Cinalli 2016). Migratory movements affect the issue of state sovereignty as much as they change societies. The modes of contestation and politicization, however, vary and change through cycles of attention and within different national and local contexts. This book brings together new empirical research on a set of three protest types: first, solidarity protests, second, refugee self-organized protests and third, mobilizations against newly arrived refugees in three countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. By looking at supportive, self-organized, and counter movements, we expect to provide a nuanced portrait of contemporary bottom-up mobilizations and contestations in the field of refugee and migration policies. In line with social movement studies, this study on political protest takes as its starting point the assumption that grassroots activism, civil disobedience, resistance, lobbying efforts, and more traditional forms of claims-making and politics together constitute an important policy field and are co-constitutive for an adequate understanding of modern democratic governance. However, it is not easy to decipher how such co-constitutive processes work and whether and how bottom-up mobilizations have an impact (Giugni et al. 1999) on societal debates, the governance in the field of asylum, migrant and refugee reception, and their inclusion.

174,289,0.986,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"for example, as one of the largest religious based NGO in Indonesia has collaborated with other NGOs in the region, including one local NGO in Myanmar, to explore possible areas of peacebuilding where it can participate in dealing with the Rohingya issue.13 Achievements/Measuring Results Despite Indonesiaâs active engagement in peacebuilding in Myanmar, so far the government has not developed any standard monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in order to measure achievements as well as to evaluate past mistakes/failures from the projects. It is indeed a challenging task to measure of what has been achieved so far from Indonesiaâs engagement in peacebuilding in Myanmar for two reasons. First, there is simply no standard mechanism created by the government to monitor and evaluate projects of this nature. What normally exists is internal project evaluation applied by the donor/funding institutions or agencies, which cannot be shared for public consumption. For projects implemented by government agencies/ministries, each implementing body or ministry usually does not have any obligation to conduct any monitoring and evaluation processes. Even if such monitoring does take place, the data collected is usually not shared with the public. Second, and more importantly, Indonesia has been focusing its engagement more on the political aspects of the Myanmar reform process and long-term projects more than working on short-term and specific or clearly defined areas. The âsharingâ approach basically emphasizes the sharing of ideas, knowledge and experiences and it is almost impossible to measure it quickly to what extent such ideas or experiences have been taken and influenced the policies of the Myanmar stakeholders. The best indicator to measure results or achievements, as suggested by Myanmar and Indonesian stakeholders, would be to see the level of trust and confidence shown by the elites in Myanmar towards Indonesiaâs active engagement in the country. For example, the interest expressed from high-ranking military officers, high-level public officials, and also recently from the representatives of ethnic groups from Myanmar to participate in various events that involved Indonesian institutions as resources have shown a considerable success. Based on the interviews with different Indonesian stakeholders, they have been urged to continue the projects or even to come up with new projects.14 But have we seen any changed behaviour? Interestingly, the request for more exchanges in the educational"
183,341,0.986,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"18.1 Introduction The poor face different levels of impact when exposed to natural hazards than the nonpoor (Hallegatte et al. 2016). In addition, data on the risks poor and vulnerable face and the actual impact they experience is often lacking. The digital divide plays an important role in this as developing countries and within these developing countries, the poor and vulnerable have less access to digital technologies (Leidig and Teeuw 2015). Apart from technological reasons, there are also political and social reasons. For example, the poor often get their income through the informal economy, and their land and resource rights are usually not registered. This lack of data affects the actions of different actors in the preparedness and response phase. Three main actors can be distinguished in the response and preparedness phase (van den Homberg and Neef 2015). The affected community are the people directly and indirectly adversely affected and in need of urgent (humanitarian) assistance. The responding community consists of local or outside community members that support in relief or recovery but are not trained in crisis response. The responding professionals are part of the professional community in the field of disaster management, such as national and local governments, NGOs, and national crisis coordination centers. All these three groups have to decide based on the data and information available to themâin the period just before the disaster hitsâwhich"

This is demonstrated by the policies they implement with respect to CI at sectorial and cross-sectorial levels. In parallel, these policies are frequently followed by funding to universities, national laboratories, and private companies involved in the modelling, simulation and analysis (MS&A) of CI dependencies (e.g. see [13]), which have further led to much innovative and diverse work [14]. Overall, several nations have put in place a policy for critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and also for critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP).

334,384,0.986,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"It has been the aim of this chapter to analyze the refugee protest movement in Vienna from different theoretical perspectives. It was argued that the beginning of the movement should be understood as an event in the sense of Badiou (2005) since no specific POS could be discerned for the protest, neither in the form of favorable political conditions nor in the form of deteriorating conditions for refugees. With regard to the strategies of the movement, the chapter took as its starting point the assumption that migrantsâ interests are weak for two reasons: (1) migrants have multiple and diverse interests, and (2) they are a marginalized group. In line with Judith Butler, this marginalization was described as the ânon-recognitionâ of migrantsâ lives. Within the group of migrants, refugees have a special position: recognized refugees are relatively privileged migrants while the resources of asylum seekers are very limited. The Refugee Protest Camp Vienna, consisting mainly of asylum seekers, defended its weak interests by combining universalist and group claims, as well as individual claims. While this diverse strategy can be understood as a means to strengthen representation, it obviously also led to problematic contradictions and exclusion. At the same time, the movement was unified by the subjectivization of asylum seekers as citizens (in the sense of Isin 2009). This political subjectivization, however, remained precarious due to the lack of a legal foundationâthis marked the essential difference in status and opportunity between refugees and supporters in the movement. The relations between the two groups involved in the protest were described according to quantitative and qualitative mobilization, strong and weak ties, and as a mixture of individual support and collective political action. Again, several contradictions in the movementâs actions and relations were identified. These were, however, largely inevitable due to external conditions, as well as to the specific structures of movements of refugees and supporters. Obviously, this analysis of the movement through various theoretical lenses does not imply that the activists developed consistent strategies based on various and"
299,248,0.986,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"coercive means to maintain social order (Wrong 1994). In short, the liberal polity assumes a communitarian societyâthe kind of society nationalists champion. True, communities can be overpowering and oppressive. Historically, most communities were indeed too thick and many are still found in parts of the world as different as Singapore and Saudi Arabia. And national communities are prone to conflict with each other because there is only a limited sense of obligation toward the other. However, communities in democratic societies tend to be much âthinner,â because people can leave communities that they find too âthickâ (Walzer 1994) and often are members of more than one community (e.g. work and residence) and hence are less psychologically dependent on any one community. A sounder globalist philosophy will seek modes of social design that foster thin communities rather than promote individualism to the extent that it entails attacking communities, especially nations, as troublesome relics of the past. This is accomplished by combining globalist (universalistic, liberal) principles with nationalist (particularistic communitarian) ones. In other words, if one places at one end of the normative spectrum globalist liberalism and at the other end authoritarian communitarianism, the middle ground of the spectrum is liberal communitarianism. It provides both the antidote to populism (by undergirding communities) and to authoritarianism (by incorporating liberal principles). The challenge is to find ways to develop a normative framework that will incorporate the values of globalization with those of nationalism, and find ways that their contradictions can be limited, while recognizing that a measure of conflict and tension between these two core elements of liberal communitarianism is inevitable. This approach is outlined next. Yuval Levin (2016) dedicated a book to the subject that he calls communitarian liberalism. M. Daly (1994) writes: âMost liberals and a good many communitarians would like the liberal ideals of equality and freedom to be integrated with community commitments in all aspects of American society & families, educational institutions, businesses, health care institutions, religions, and political institutions. Such integration would realize the communitarian ideal of a democratic communityâ (p. xix). This philosophy has been summarized in popular terms by David Brooks (2016), who wrote: âI suspect the coming political movements will be identified on two axes: open and closed and individual and socialâ¦Donald Trump is probably going to make the G.O.P. the party of individual/closedâ¦The Democrats are probably going to be the party of social/closedâ¦Iâve been thinking we need a third party that is social/open.â Such a party, according to Brooks, would âsupport the free trade and skilled immigration that fuel growth. But it would also flood the zone for those challenged in the high-skill global economyâoffering programs to rebuild community, foster economic security and boost mobilityâ (Brooks 2016). An important counter to the line of argumentation laid out so far is that the mass society thesis is mistaken, that communities have far from disappeared. Residential communities abound and there are a large number of non-residential communities, such as the gay community and various ethnic and racial ones. In response, I note that (a) some segments of the population have lost communal bonds. Freer trade and automation force people to relocate to where the new jobs are, leaving their communal bonds and institutions behind. As often, if they develop new communal"
334,197,0.986,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"In all three countries mobilization takes place primarily on a local level, with smallscale protest events and a low protest volume. The prevailing protest focusing on a specific deportation is mostly local. By contrast, national protest events may be less frequent, but they are predominantly change-oriented. The importance of the local level is strongly demonstrated by organizational aspects: protests are mostly mobilized by local actors, local communities with personal ties and local grass-roots without personal ties. National actors, on the other hand, such as NGOs or national politicians, are less involved as main actors. While protest is mostly mobilized and organized on a local and national level, transnational actors and global justice organizations occasionally participate in antideportation protest. Their participation indicates that transnational elements and actors are part of anti-deportation protest, but the protests are not (necessarily) part of such movements. Put differently, while we know that global justice organizations like No Borders are active in all three countries, this has not led to transnationalization. Protests are mostly small-scale and local, trying to prevent a specific deportation rather than changing the asylum system as such. Although protest activities mostly take place at a local level, some protests are mobilized beyond the local. At a national level, different kinds of protest are organized. On the one hand, protest regarding a specific deportation may be organized in several places or in the national capital. On the other hand, there are large-scale events, mobilizing many people. With the level of organization, the kind of actors change too: At the national level organized groups, such as NGOs and church- and party-related organizations, are increasingly found (Rosenberger and Winkler 2014)."
318,72,0.986,"Working, Housing: Urbanizing: The International Year of Global Understanding - IYGU","Some of the earliest forms of âsocialâ housing for the poor in Western cities were rental properties developed as philanthropic investments, where a guaranteed but low return to the investor was proposed, and where tenants received often quite intrusive supervision and support in organizing their ï¬nances and their lifestyles in the new homes. Many planned 19th century factory towns such as Saltaire in the UK and Pullman in the USA also displayed analogous forms of paternalism. But as housing issues came to the fore in local and national politics through the 20th century, states themselves became increasingly involved in regulating housing conditions through laws and standards. Concerns grew about how to solve the health and social problems associated with poor housing, and a category of âslumâ housing developed during the 19th century, deï¬ned by overcrowding, poverty, and the poor physical state of buildings. Such areas have often been targeted for demolition, and their populations removed to new housingâor simply displaced and left to ï¬nd alternative places to live. More generally, areas which are home to poorer residents are vulnerable to removal if they are on land which powerful actors such as states, businesses and wealthy residents would like to see redeveloped, often leading to gentriï¬cation and displacement. States also began taking responsibility for implementing ideas about what makes for a good city, notably how different activities and buildings should be arranged in the city. Urban planning addresses issues such as which land uses should be located close to one another, or should be kept apart through zoning rules. Urban spatial planning can be very helpful in cities, where so many often incompatible activities jostle for space, but it has also been used to place restrictions on where different groups can live or to remove people from areas that contravene the âplan.â For example, housing for the poor can often be effectively excluded from wealthy areas of the city by zoning limitations on building multi-family properties; or the existence of formal Masterplans has been used in litigation by middle classes in some Indian cities, such as Delhi, to enforce the removal of longstanding informal settlements. The development of planning interventions which support and work with the aspirations of the poor and the solutions which they themselves devise is an urgent element of ï¬nding more effective and inclusive solutions to shelter needs in cities. Planning visions of how neighbourhoods and cities should be organized and designed have influenced city development around the world. One prominent example of this is the idea of the âGarden Cityâ, initially associated with British urban planners, Ebenezer Howard and Patrick Geddes. This and allied ideas circulated widely, proposing that ânewâ cities or suburbs be built with houses arranged around communal facilities in healthy, greenï¬eld sites with socially mixed populations and selected restrictions on socially undesirable activities (such as frequenting bars). Housing following these principles was developed through the middle decades of the 20th century in many cities around the worldâfrom Tel"

Several transition initiatives aim to change nature perceptions, reinforce human-nature relationships or promote eco-friendly lifestyles and practices. Below we highlight a couple of initiatives that are active in promoting or supporting naturebased solutions: The Heempark The Heemparkis a unique example of a Public â Civic Partnership as it combines city supported (Environment and Nature Centre) and volunteer activities (Heempark vzw) in a collaborative and mutually beneficial way. The Heempark was initiated in 1985 by a group of local volunteers who aimed to safeguard the local agricultural heritage through the Heempark model â a combination of demo sites of local agricultural practice with a clear focus on environmental sustainability. When the number of visitors increased and the entire initiative grew over the heads of the volunteers, the City supported with personnel, infrastructure and an educational program for schools and associations. At the moment the Heempark has about 90 members and approximately 35 active volunteers that maintain the gardens and organise a wide variety of activities to promote reconnection of people to nature and increase environmental awareness and engagement. Activities include cooking classes of organic food with autistic children, sessions about herbs, bees and vegetables, making honey, building eco-friendly gardens and so on. Our findings show that the Heempark is a hotspot when it comes to connecting initiatives and reconnecting people to nature. It houses 350 educational groups while attracting approximately 10.000 visitors a year (Photo 5.5). The Bee Plan The Bee plan is a multi-stakeholder initiative to turn the city of Genk into a bee friendly city. It originated in 2013 when two concerned citizens organised an open environmental council meeting showcasing the documentary âMore than honeyâ. Afterwards, the 60 people present brainstormed about what they could do in the city to improve conditions for bees and all ideas were gathered. To take this further, a working group was set up involving beekeepers, city services, environmental organisations and engaged civilians who developed a âBee planâ for the city of Genk that was approved by the bench of aldermen in February 2014. The plan aims to strengthen the bee populations in the city region by (1) improving the"

The common history of colonisation and emphasis on economic growth bound these countries together. Anti-colonialism meant that egalitarianism and partnership, not aid, should be the focus. What further made India adopt its own path was the Cold War that threatened to divide the world into two, opposing camps. Loath to lose their independence and freedom of action that they interpreted joining either camp meant, India and the others sought their space. The adoption of Panchsheel, or five points, at the Bandung Afro-Asian summit in 1955 was the result, to be followed in 1961 with the launch of the nonaligned movement. Panchsheel committed these countries to respect each othersâ sovereignty and not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. While recognising the political cause of their under-development (colonialism), in the circumstances India felt it necessary to work with its partners on addressing the economic cause of such under-development through technical cooperation and the sharing of experiences. The driving principles of Indiaâs development partnership with other developing countries were expanded to include egalitarianism, country ownership, demand-driven and lack of conditionalities (even where there was tied financing). The latter is significant as mutual respect for sovereignty ruled out imposing any conditions as lenders do. However, the lack of hard currency and desire for self-sufficiency meant that tying aid to purchases from lending country was accepted. Separately this refusal to join either camp enabled India and others to access financial and technical assistance from both camps and from multilaterals. India did not set up a dedicated agency for external development partnership; instead it was run and coordinated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) which drew on expertise of the relevant line ministries. India formalised its technical assistance efforts by establishing the India Technical and Economic Cooperation programme (ITEC), again located in MEA. ITEC has six main channels: 1. Training of workers from state-owned enterprises, bureaucrats and policy makers nominated by the partner countries; 2. Feasibility and consultancy services related to specific development projects; 3. The sending of Indian experts to the requesting country; 4. Study tours in India for individuals and groups suggested by partner countries;"
106,17,0.986,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"The Future of Law Enforcement Community policing has evolved into the preeminent reform goal in modern policing, which differs from traditional policing via a shift towards more citizen involvement, geographic focus, more opportunities for interaction with citizens, and an emphasis on prevention (Cordner 2014; TRILLION: TRusted, CItizen â LEA coILaboratIon over social Networks 2017). Naturally, this approach puts pressure at organizational level, for moving from a top-down approach of police management to a bottom-up approach, where citizens have a more active role. Another challenge relates to trust within and between the law enforcement agencies and the citizens. Motivation for engaging citizens in this community driven policing framework is also crucial. Community policing has been used successfully in crime reduction (Gill et al. 2014), extremism prevention (Schanzer et al. 2016), and even in counter terrorism (Dunn et al. 2016). In all cases, it was based on direct face-to-face or over-the-phone interaction between the community and LEAs. There is a growing realization that technology has the potential to accelerate the evolution towards more effective community policing (Lewis and Lewis 2012). TRILLION takes the concept of technology-assisted community policing further and is currently developing a community policing platform, which aims to contribute to a safer society, encouraging interactive partnerships between law enforcement officers and the people they serve, implemented over an open, flexible, secure and resilient socio-technical set of tools. Using the TRILLION applications, citizens will be able to report crimes, suspicious behavior and incidents, identify hazards and assist law enforcement agents through active participation for achieving better urban security management. At the same time, LEAs will be able to detect incidents in a more efficient, content and context aware manner, and locate onsite"

However, the water boards differ in terms of the practicality and costs of transferring water from other regions. For instance, WGS, the regional water authority of Salland, has abundant water that could be transferred to its region, whereas it is more difï¬cult for Vechtstromen to bring water from other regions. The positions regarding the responsibility of water authorities in providing water to farmers differs between the water boards that have sloping areas and those have mostly flat areas. The displacement chain is also implemented at the national level to balance the water supply and demand in cases of extreme water shortages by transferring water from abundant areas and sectors to scarce areas and sectors. The decisions are taken by a national committee that involves representatives from all provinces and the functioning of the whole system is controlled by the Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch national water authority. In the Vilaine catchment, there is little evidence on the interaction of national and subnational levels regarding agricultural measures on drought resilience. However, the implementation of CAP influences the agricultural production and water consumptions at the farm level. As explained in Sect. 10.3, measures that result from the CAP are fragmented from the other water- and agriculture-related measures, since there is no regional agricultural water planning and management. Regional water management plans however address drought and water scarcity through enforcing limitations and bans on irrigation, especially during the summer and in the sensitive areas. The different actors and levels in the Somerset region build up a strong relationship and culture of cooperation. But the vulnerability of such relationships can be seen after the flood events in 2013/2014. Discussions about the nature of the floods and possible solutions eroded the conï¬dence between the different stakeholders and actors pulled out of the circle. On the community level, especially relevant for the implementation of agri-environmental measures, the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group was seen. They are seen as an in-between agent between environmental groups and farmers. But they are dependent on project funding and therefore exists the risk of reduced activities in case of a reduction of funding. Positive interlinkages between farmers and Internal Drainage Boards (IDB) exist. IDBs are risk management authorities responsible for maintaining rivers, drainage channels, pumping stations, etc. IDB was noticed as a group that is very responsive to farmersâ needs. A good relationship was also built up between the local National Farmers Union (NFU) and the farming community. Room for improvement is seen for the relationship between farmers and statutory bodies. Their relationship is not characterized by an open discussion culture but rather by punishment. A diversity of governance levels and their interactions is observed in the North-west Europe region. In Flanders and Somerset, subnational stakeholders such as farmer organizations and regional water authorities closely collaborate. In other cases, the relevant EU policies explicitly drive cross-level interactions, while there is little evidence that these directly influence the adaptation of the agricultural sector to drought and water scarcity conditions. In the Eifel-Rur, Salland and Twente cases, the WFD requirements create multilevel interactions, such as the"

They also helped to ensure that research results were acceptable and directly beneficial to the target community. A key project output was the development of a participatory tool, âMpangâameâ, a simulation game that helps stakeholders identify and reflect on appropriate actions for better NRM practices. At the local level, the game was disseminated to schools, vocational institutions, local government leaders and policymakers within various fora. At regional and international levels, the game was disseminated at meetings for AFROMAISON partners and NRM stakeholders in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mali, South Africa, Tunisia, as well as to graduate students in France, on special request from university administrators. Other dissemination channels included articles published in the International Journal of Innovation Sciences, book chapters, brochures, leaflets and the project website. According to Arseni Semana, principal investigator of AFROMAISON in Uganda, the main challenges that the project encountered were related to the attitudes of the communities (CAAST-Net Plus 2014, p. 32). There was slow adoption of integrated NRM practices mainly because of the commercial culture that has emerged within the beneficiary communities. NGOs facilitate communitiesâ participation in NRM planning and implementation. As a result, it is almost impossible to engage the communities without attaching a monetary incentive. Private sector involvement is still minimal and participating private sector players are mainly informal and micro. Nonetheless, the project held a consultative meeting between the ministries of agriculture, animal industry and fisheries, and water and environment to enhance policy level integration of NRM using tools from the research. This constitutes a more valuable, critically reflective account of the relationship between the projectâs outputs and outcomes, and one which integrates key contextual factors to explain the barriers and constraints to achieving the intended impacts. Overall, we a found that statements of âintended impactâ are often more akin to aspirations expressed by project designers and managers. In most cases, these aspirations do little more than offer rhetorical support to wider climate and development targets, such as the MDGs. As such, there is generally no explicit explanation of how these impacts canâeven theoreticallyâbe achieved. Instead, there is a significant level of assumed attribution; that is, broad statements about how the research projectâs focus relates to the wider issues and how it contributes knowledge necessary to tackle these challenges vis-Ã -vis the stated aims and objectives."

Migrants arriving within post-war recruitment schemes were seen as âguest workersâ and therefore ideas about integrating them into society hardly surfaced. When they did, national reactions differed considerably. States varied in their basic conception of citizenship, which shapes the rules of belonging to the community. In Germany and other countries where membership to the nation is defined by descent (ius sanguinis), permanent settlement of non-Germans was politically daunting and, on the part of the migrant, required many years of patience and almost complete assimilation into society. Countries having a political definition of the nation provided easier admission of new members to the polity, as long as newcomers adhered to the constitution, laws, and political rules. Among the countries that applied such an approach to integration, some, including France, required more cultural adaptation, while others, such as Sweden, the UK, and the Netherlands, tolerated or even promoted a higher degree of cultural and ethnic diversity. Newcomers in France were considered âindividuals who had to disappear into the pre-defined political model by renouncing their own attributesâcultural, religious or otherwiseâin the public sphereâ (Wihtol de Wenden 2011, 67). In the UK, on the contrary, integration was officially defined as ânot a flattening process of uniformity but as cultural diversity coupled with equal opportunity in an atmosphere of mutual toleranceâ (Home Secretary Roy Jenkins, cited in Rex 1995, 248). According to different ways of understanding citizenship and nationhood, European countries developed integration policies that have been coined âdifferential exclusionistâ, âassimilationistâ, or âpluralistâ.8"

The theme emerges strongly from the case studies in this volume, for example those on China, the Gulf, the Philippines, and Thailand. They reveal the central tension between the mobility of labour and the non-mobility of entitlements for most migrants. For migrants whose movements are temporary, circular, or transient, social protection schemes that can be made portable are vital. For example, Indonesian migrant domestic workers pay for their health and social insurance before departure, but they cannot access this support when in need because of institutional rigidity in the administration of labour migration policy in Indonesia, as well as in the receiving country. Special attention needs to be paid to the particular situations and needs of various categories of women migrants, and to the role of organization of and by migrant workers themselves to engage in campaigns for portable protection and for acquisition and then implementation of accorded rights. The experience of the MGSJ project and the character of these concluding suggestions underscore the need for the cross-fertilization of ideas between regional research networks, SouthâSouthâNorth. Promoting cooperation, in order to reduce duplication and to avoid research driven by purely theoretical or purely national policy interests without due consideration for gender transformation as an ongoing process integral to migration itself, can help to support a bottom-up strategy of rights-claiming that responds more directly to migrantsâ needs and aspirations."

To ensure this efï¬ciency and effectiveness, governments build complicated instruments to control the universities. For many centuries, the autonomy and internal energy of universities were the main sources of higher education development. The excellence initiatives represent different approaches where the push for the excellence comes from outside, from above the universities. The challenge for the governments is to ï¬nd the right push instruments to ensure flexibility and internal motivation of participating universities. The following questions were considered to elaborate on the governments approaches to develop speciï¬c implementation instruments: â¢ Who is in charge? What is the role of the government or the Ministry of Higher Education/Education on the implementation of excellence-driven policies and initiatives? â¢ How do governments allocate money? What is the degree of freedom? â¢ How do central authorities monitor results? How do they measure the effectiveness of policy implementation? How do they evaluate the progress? â¢ Do the authorities intervene and how? In all the cases, the Ministries of Education (and Science or Higher Education) are in charge of the implementation process. Mainly, they partner with a national higher education or research funding agency. They usually delegate the function of day-to-day operation support to designated a program implementation agency (PIA). The role of such agency is to interpret the Ministryâs policies, collect data, provide logistical support for the expert evaluation, and ensure the communication among the universities and between the Ministry and universities. In all the cases, these agencies were involved (even through the monitoring) into internal business of universities. It consequently manifests new modality of the relationships between the universities and the government. In most cases, such agencies adopt business approaches when the program is being implemented. They use key performance indicators (KPI) to evaluate universitiesâ progress, and encourage universities to hire consultancy companies to build effective management structure. The Russian agency hired a consulting company to teach universities how to use project management in their operation. These details conï¬rm that the excellence initiatives are linked with the economic mobilization of the higher education systems under New Public Management frameworks (Bleiklie 1988; Stech 2011). In some cases, such agency reports not to the Ministry unit that is responsible for higher education policy, but to some special project units. It means that the implementation of the excellence initiative is becoming a separate stream within the higher education policy implementation. In a number of countries such as Germany or Russia, program implementation agencies serve as technical support organizations carrying out selection or monitoring procedures. Furthermore, PIA exerts signiï¬cant impact on resource allocation. Relying on decisions made by agency experts, Ministries grant, extend or cut off funding."
329,14,0.986,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"government might no longer be best suited to delivering all services and goods deemed necessary for the social contract. In the wake of the Asian and global financial crises, governments might also not be ideally positioned to promote all programs for the general good. Public and private outreach can work in tandem to keep a stronger social contract. The second reason is that, in Asia, there is not widespread consensus on the value proposition of civil society and the role of private citizens. For a Western reader, this question may seem surprising as the establishment of nonprofit organizations, of think tanks, of private philanthropy does not, in the overwhelming majority of cases, pose any existential risk to the government. In a robust democratic society, multiple opinions, analyses, activities, and outcomes are not only tolerated but also lauded. In the West, a paramount role of civil society is to check the power of the government and of the private sector. Civil society is an integral component of a pluralist system. Even the term civil society is often used to mean the collective voices of the people as opposed to government and business. In Asia, many see democracy as a messy process with unclear benefits. In fact, democratic participation isnât as widely valued as economic growth, stability, and other measures of societal progress. In Asia, the term civic engagement might be more accurate than civil society. If this sounds like modern China, such values are indeed in place. But questions about the costs of democracy come up in many places, with many people. Even in countries with strong democratic histories such as India and the Philippines, there is more than a little frustration expressed about the difficult nature of democratic decision-making processes and the role of civic actors further complicating the process. This frustration can help to explain why in both countries, âstrong menâ Narendra Modi and Rodrigo Duterte were recently elected as the heads of state. In countries with more authoritarian regimes, the question of what role private actors play in delivering a social good becomes a front-burner issue. In fact, in many Asian countries today, including India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, new laws and regulations for the creation and conduct of philanthropic and social delivery organizations are being proposed and enacted, some promoting the practice and others restricting it. When governments implement restrictions, they are frequently aimed at advocacy groups. When Westerners read about governments limiting the reach of non-governmental organizations in Asia, they are typically reading about groups endeavoring to change the status quo in ways broader than addressing the specific societal challenge.

Moreover, the economic situation differs widely between the countries in the Baltic Sea region and consequently the impact of their industrial and agricultural sectors on the marine environment. Furthermore, transport policies are caught between demands for improved mobility on the one hand and the concern for environmental protection on the other. The EU IAS policy must be seen in the context of commitments at global, EU and regional levels. It was suggested that a dedicated IAS directive was the most effective way to provide a flexible framework with minimum standards for IAS action in the EU (Shine et al. 2009). Finally, a new dedicated legislative instrument for IAS management was adopted by the Council and entered into force at the beginning of 2015.17 Different Member States have been developing different approaches. The lack of a coherent and coordinated approach has hampered the effectiveness of these initiatives, and hence, IAS-related problems continue to increase. Currently, there is a lot of preparation being done at EU and HELCOM levels to help effectively implement the BWM convention. Some EU regulations together with HELCOM guidelines could be used as examples of coordination and consideration of regional requirements for the implementation of BWMC. EU Member States are obliged to cooperate regionally according to Articles 5 and 6 of the MSFD. Furthermore, they must ensure that marine strategies are coherent and coordinated across marine regions or subregions. A new strategy will be based on planned cooperation at EU and MS levels, and for that purpose, Member States must use, where practical and appropriate, existing regional cooperation structures. They are therefore obliged to follow a common approach to initial assessment, determination of good environmental status, management targets, indicators, monitoring and measures (EC 2011). Regarding shipping, ratification of the BWM Convention is a prerequisite, since it is difficult for the EU to take decisions outside of the IMO framework. One of the advantages of the IMO framework is that it is coherent. It also provides for the control of vessels not registered in the EU, but transiting EU waters (Farmer et al. 2012). The EUâs objective is to provide a flexible framework with minimum standards based on the precautionary principle and IAS policy so as to ensure coherence with upcoming instruments and emerging solutions (Shine et al. 2010). Preventive measures are also necessary, as well as taking into account interactions with other environmental risks such as eutrophication and overfishing occurring in the Baltic Sea. Preventive measures are diverse and range from education (e.g. public environmental campaigns, workshops, staff training in the maritime industry) to ballast water exchange regulations. Apart from being addressed within maritime transportation and the BWM Convention, the IAS issue should also be considered in other policies dealing with eutrophication, climate change and overfishing since these threats can undermine the conditions under which current IAS policies are developed (especially those where risk assessment is based on species range and invasion pathways). Before preparing any management strategies, effective policies dealing with"

All interviewed actors agreed that having a single interlocutor, IAV, works well and facilitates dialogue. However, as far as the drought management issue is concerned, coherence between levels and scales has not been fully achieved: some actions are implemented coherently (e.g. interconnection between drinking water networks), but the integration of the climate change perspective lies mainly in the hands of the State services and remains inside the IAV through the coordination of the SAGE Vilaine. Since the reform and decentralization of the role of the State in the 1990s, the State has had little decision-making power over water management issues. The decentralized services are managing water resources and making decisions within the catchment scale.

In practice, what smugglers and traffickers do is to offer a transportation service to hundreds of thousands of persons who crossed many borders already, mainly in African and Middle Eastern countries, and take advantage of the fact that the only concern of these persons is to flee from their countries of origin by whatever means possible, accepting the risk of sinking, and, indeed, many do sink.9 In light of this complex and tragic scenario, this chapter aims to explore the ambiguity of Operation Sophia, focusing on two sensitive and interrelated aspects: the use of coercive powers against suspected smugglers and traffickers and the rescue of migrants carried out by naval forces at sea.

While new initiatives like the EU Water Framework Directive do try to reduce the ecological impacts, many damages are still to be addressed. Because of the resistance and tensions at various scales, international institutions advocated a new water management approach in order to better integrate various national, regional, local stakeholders, as well as users from the agricultural, industrial, and drinking water sectors. The division and competition between these sectors led to conflicts and to the depletion of the resources as the water supply has been raised to solve or anticipate the conflicts between users.

Newcomers from Southern Europe, however, no longer benefit from the positive image associated with their predecessors. In policy terms, this change of attitude has materialized in new measures aiming at keeping undesirable EU migrants out. The most controversial of these measures consists of the removal of residence permits from unemployed EU citizens considered to represent an unreasonable burden on the Belgian public finances. Although migrants from Central and Eastern EU countries have been the most affected, a considerable number of nationals from North-Western and Southern EU countries have also been expelled. The overall objective of this chapter is therefore to analyse how social policies have progressively become instruments of migration control in Belgium within the context of the economic crisis. First, we briefly discuss the recent economic and social situation, and explore the impacts of the economic downturn on the Belgian welfare system. We then describe past and recent migration flows to the country and discuss the main socio-demographic features of foreign residents from Southern Europe and other EU regions. We also highlight the socio-economic situation of Southern European migrants in terms of activity and unemployment rates, and of access to selected welfare benefits. In the second part of the chapter, we demonstrate how the process of idealization of Southern European immigration has taken place in Belgium. This process has resulted in an implicit classification between undesirable and desirable migrants. Accordingly, stricter immigration and integration policies are designed to keep the former out while still appearing attractive to the latter. We then focus on the specific policy of removing residence permits, targeting EU jobseekers during the economic crisis. We analyse the effects of this policy and, in the process, show that Belgiumâs strict welfare provisions not only limit the free mobility of workers in times of crisis but also stigmatize new EU migrants as âwelfare shoppersâ. On examining the mobilization of different organizations, we conclude by showing thatâwhile they are numerically fewerânew Southern European immigrants are in a better position than other new immigrants to challenge policies that affect their freedom of circulation."
128,270,0.986,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"(Sotiropoulos 2004; Karamichas 2007; Rozakou 2011). We can assume that the main trend of volunteering for refugees/asylum seekers, as it has happened in the past in Greece (Sotiropoulos 2004; Karamichas 2007; Rozakou 2011), has primarily followed the informal path, which is more common among individuals with lower human capital. With respect to the lack of association between religiosity as an indicator of cultural capital and volunteering, the finding might reflect specific shortcomings of the proxy applied. Scholars reporting strong correlations between religiosity and volunteering usually apply as proxies religious practices such as frequency of church attendance and of religious prayer rather than subjective measures of religiosity and intensity of beliefs (Wilson and Musick 1997a; Musick and Wilson 2008; van Tienen et al. 2011; Paxton et al. 2014). These practices are more likely to proffer values (such as self-sacrifice and compassion), which reinforce the decision to volunteer (Son and Wilson 2011). In the studyâs questionnaire, there are no available measures of such religious practices that would allow the refined measurement of religiosity. Additional limitations of the study involve its cross-sectional design where causal imputation is difficult. Hence, we are unable to determine the direction of specific causal relationships examined, for example, between cultural capital, social capital and/or political engagement measures and volunteering. It should be noted that concerns over selection bias have consistently plagued the volunteering empirical research (Wilson 2000). Nevertheless, the study enriches the scarce empirical research on volunteering specifically for refugees/asylum seekers, by portraying the profiles of volunteers providing solidarity to thousands of refugees/ asylum seekers arriving in Greece. Undoubtedly, volunteers have been key actors in welcoming and helping refugees/asylum seekers contributing to the first step towards newcomersâ integration into the new host countries. However, volunteersâ contribution should not be treated as substitute to core state obligations towards refugees/asylum seekers. Policy interventions at the Greek and EU level are urgently necessary to manage the refugee crisis effectively and allow the resettlement of refugees/asylum seekers in safe countries where they can have the opportunity to rebuild their lives."

This will also be the case for water use and regulation where budgets need to be transferred in the same way. The issue with this is that the functions of these units are linked to the type of account and moving the units will have human resource implications. For instance, service-level agreements need to be in place between the CMA and the regional and national offices so that the services to be supplied by the DWS and/or CMA need to be well defined and stipulated.14 Effective management of stakeholder relations is another important component of CMAs, and this is the fifth practice identified by the authors. We also observed this practice when interviewing the representatives of the FGG Elbe. For the FGG Elbe, stakeholder relations are not only an important communication endeavour (e.g. keeping stakeholders abreast of what is happening in the river basin and flood warning) but also necessary in the daily functions like river health monitoring.15 We argue that without good stakeholder relations, decentralisation cannot be adequately achieved since decentralisation involves the interface (e.g. communication) between authorities and stakeholders at grassroots level. In this regard, both established CMAs have relatively close and remarkably good relationships with stakeholders. These relationships, as with any relationship, had to be built from the onset. For instance, initially, stakeholders were reluctant to engage with the Breede-Gouritz CMA owing largely to challenging experiences with the regional/national DWS offices. For instance, some individuals in stakeholder groupings have been waiting on DWS for numerous years with regard to licencing applications.16 Because of this matter, stakeholders wanted to know whether the CMA would be any different from the way in which DWS carries out water-related activities and tasks. In other words, there is an expectation from stakeholders that the CMA will, in certain instances, do a âbetter jobâ than the DWS. The onus was on CMA staff attending the meetings to persuade the stakeholders firstly to participate in stakeholder meetings and explain the benefits of these meetings and secondly to give members the assurance that the past is the past and that the CMA would have other options at hand to assist stakeholders with their needs.17"

They have argued for continued role in capacity building, implementation support, economic development, and information sharing programs, which can strengthen African statesâ recovery from crisis (Hendricks and Lucey 2013a, b). Some analysts have made the case for South Africaâs involvement in promoting civil society engagement and the Livingstone Formula, which states that âCivil Society Organizations (CSOs) may provide technical support to the AU by undertaking early warning reporting, and situation analysis, which feeds information into the decision making processes of the PSCâ (Lucey and Gida 2014). Central to all this is the contested understanding of the concept of peacebuilding.

Using the examples of Burundi and the DRC, this sub-section does not just identify the nature of South African interventions with the view of appraising the distinction between such interventions and those previously undertaken or concurrently undertaken by traditional peacebuilding actors. This distinction is further critical in relation to various platforms and instruments used by South Africa to implement their peacebuilding engagements, and is presented in two main sections with the first focusing on what peacebuilding is conceived to be in South African policy circles and the motivation for intervention and the second identifying the tangibles of peacebuilding."

Encourage Green Skills Through Generic Content in All Forms of Education Curricula: School, Technical, and University Generic skills in training can contribute a progressive path to speciï¬c skills and courses. Content related to sustainable practices and climate change issues can be introduced into existing curricula, not just in TVET institutions but also in school and higher education institutions. Research in higher education becomes critical to helping provide direct guidance toward newer practices and technologies that are environmentally sustainable. Higher education institutions may also take the lead in the professional development of trainers through in-service training. While institutional-level initiatives are quicker to implement, large-scale reforms may also be initiated simultaneously. For example, the National Skills Standard Developing Committee under MOLISA can not only develop and establish green standards but also dovetail these with existing National Skills Qualiï¬cation Certiï¬cation levels and National Occupational Standards. The key responsibility is with the National Skills Standard Developing Committee along with MOLISA and MOET. Coordinate and Rationalize Private and Government Training Systems Training by the private sector is potentially important and should not be ignored. While reforms in government TVET providers are championed by the line ministries, reforms in the private sector can be pushed through by industry and employers. Parity in the quality of training, incentives, governance, and industry relevance is required between the two systems. In addition, the state should create a framework to accredit and recognize the various forms of vocational training undertaken by different enterprises. The key responsibility lies with MOLISA and MOET together with large private sector corporations. Promote Greening as a Social Issue In addition to formal TVET, sensitivity toward the environment is often developed through social interaction and public communications. Green skills development should be understood not only as a matter of curriculum, and in terms of content limited to TVET institutions, but as something that should be built into the larger ecosystem of education, workplaces, social interactions, and political debates."
284,353,0.986,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"political processes that construct environmental inequities. Anti-mining groups in Latin America frequently argue that the approval of mining projects involves the misrecognition of the material and cultural dependence on water and land of the affected populations and that it ignores the concerns expressed in local participatory stages, or that it lacks such spaces altogether (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Haarstad and Floysand, 2007; Urkidi and Walter, 2011). The main features of the procedures that govern mining activities are shared by most Latin American countries. Indeed, Latin American mining laws were developed under similar guidelines drafted by international ï¬nancial institutions (e.g. the World Bank) (Chaparro, 2002; Bridge, 2004). The approval of mining projects is centralized in the national (or provincial, in the case of Argentina) government, and is based on the assessment of an environmental impact report. Participation arenas are set in relation to this technical document and are non-binding. Civil society actors can usually present allegations (e.g. online or on paper) and, sometimes, can express their views in front of a public audience where the technical document is presented. Usually, law requires that these concerns be addressed by the mining company when providing the ï¬nal environmental impact assessment that has to be approved by the national government (usually by the mining or environmental departments). However, EJMs claim that participation in mining decisions is mainly âinformativeâ and insufï¬cient, when not secretive (Janhcke Benavente and Meza, 2010). Projects affecting indigenous communities are under speciï¬c regulations. Most Latin American countries (all those studied in this chapter) have subscribed to the 169 ILO Convention, which requires the prior and informed consent of communities before decisions about activities that could affect them are made, a process that should follow customary procedures. This right is usually ignored or misapplied (Janhcke Benavente and Meza, 2010). However, even if put in practice, the way the 169 ILO Convention and other international documents (e.g. the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People) frame âconsentâ is ambiguous and does not necessarily imply a binding power to community views (McGee, 2009; Janhcke Benavente and Meza, 2010). As the cases presented in this chapter illustrate, and as pointed out by other studies (e.g. Janhcke Benavente and Meza, 2010), the way decisions regarding mining activities exclude or mistreat local actors, their values, concerns and institutions is fuelling unrest and frustration among the affected communities."

Businesses in these sectors that are identiï¬ed by the Member States as operators of essential services will have to take appropriate security measures and to notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority. Also key digital service providers (search engines, cloud computing services and online marketplaces) will have to comply with the security and notiï¬cation requirements under the NIS-Directive. The European Commission is also examining how to strengthen and streamline cyber security cooperation across different sectors of the economy, including in cyber security training and education. While there are similarities, the European Commission has not formally converged essential service operators and CI operators alike in [26]. Consequently, the EU Member States can adopt legislative solutions that allow a substantial coincidence of the two sets, or consider them as different set (with eventually some overlap). In terms of research, the European Commission has funded over 100 diverse projects under the Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism and other Security-related Risks programme (CIPS), during the 2007â 2012 period. The programme was designed to protect citizens and CI from terrorist attacks and other security incidents by fostering prevention and preparedness, namely by improving the protection of CI and addressing crisis management. The key objective is to support CIP policy priorities by providing expert knowledge and a scientiï¬c basis for a better understanding of criticalities and dependencies at all levels. A list of the EU co-funded projects can be found online [27]. Such projects integrate the more than 300 R&D projects co-funded by the EU Commission under the Security umbrella in the FP7 (i.e. the EU research funding agenda in the period 2007â2013). The programme covers all the aspects related with innovative technology for security, with a strong focus on security of CI. Amongst other projects co-funded under this framework is the Network of Excellence âCritical Infrastructure Preparedness and Resilience Research Network (CIPRNet)â project [28]. The interest for EU Commission about the security issues is witnessed by the inclusion of the topic security also in the H2020 programme (i.e. the Horizon 2020 programme is the EU research funding agenda for the period 2014â2020) and by the more than 150 R&D projects already granted. To be more effective, H2020 shifted the focus from technology driven perspective to a problem solving orientation with a strong requirements of active involving of security stakeholders, starting from CI operators, in order to develop solution able to concretely increase the resilience, the robustness and/or the preparedness of EU society. Finally, a European Reference Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection (ERNCIP) has been created by the European Commission to âfoster the emergence of innovative, qualiï¬ed, efï¬cient and competitive security solutions, through"
10,294,0.986,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Our overall conclusion is that the Salland Region is characterized by a vivid governance context. The emphasis of national and EU policies on river basin management encourages the regional water authorities to coordinate their actions. One of the regional initiatives has been the development and implementation of a common irrigation policy, which aims to balance the use of water by farmers close to natural areas. The investigation on the governance context revealed that all stakeholders involved discuss the issue of irrigation in terms of (a lack of) water supply, an approach culturally and historically ï¬rmly rooted in this region. As such, the focus of the policy shifted towards zoning, a solution that aims to reserve scarce water for nature, during periods of drought. However, the governance assessment also revealed some evidence that stakeholders on the regional level learn to treat the issue of drought as a phenomenon in itself through participating in a regional initiative, which aims to preserve and increase the freshwater reserves in the region, whereby stakeholders are willing to address drought as an issue in itself that influences the vulnerability and adaptability of their activities."
277,246,0.986,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"8.5 Transparency and Access to Documents EU and national officials and the governments of the member states have thus defined the parameters of migration policy and legislation and the terms of debate in this field. The biggest obstacle faced by civil society in attempting to influence migration and asylum policy has been to discover which measures are being proposed. During the years of inter-governmental cooperation, the only voices heard from outside the institutions were those of international organisations such as the UNHCR. As described above, during the inter-governmental phase of EU JHA policies, which established the framework and core basis of JHA common policies, decision-making and policy development took place in the EU institutionâs committees, principally in the Council of Ministers. This process was largely ignored by the media and did not come to general public attention, meaning that there was no general public discussion of the proposed measures. Many national parliaments remained ill-informed about proposals or had no opportunity to debate them. Statewatch â an organisation that identified Justice and Home Affairs as a key defining policy area in the emergence of an EU state â has monitored EU activities and the consequences for civil liberties since 1992 (Statewatch 2012). For more than 20 years it has attempted, with some success, to gain access to the documents produced in this policymaking process and to make them publicly available. It has found that lack of transparency and access to documents has resulted in having to devote substantial resources to inform civil society about the development of Justice and Home Affairs policies, including those on migration and asylum. In the absence of âan EU public access cultureâ (Bonner 2006: 149), this has been an uphill struggle. The story of this long and continuing attempt to open up information on EU policymaking has been documented elsewhere (Statewatch 2014). Backed by successful complaints from the European Ombudsman, Statewatch has persevered in applications for documents, finding that the path has been blocked by officialdom within the institutions. The EU has been critical of these attempts, claiming at times they are âvexatiousâ, that the Commission needs the âspace to thinkâ outside public scrutiny and finally, in an Orwellian move, proposing changes to the definition of a âdocumentâ, so as to remove the right of access, effectively until measures have been adopted. There is, in the absence of open access to policy documents, no trilogue or nexus of any meaning or accountability between academics, the rest of civil society and policymakers. When the voices of civil society groups are heard, it is merely through consultation processes, whilst the Commission is drafting the proposal. There is no requirement for policymakers to take any action in response to civil society, whereas there are increasing concerns about the EUâs migration activities in general, in particular the externalisation of migration control beyond its geographical and legal borders (Migreurop 2012). Major issues, in addition to the unaccountability of Frontex, are the militarisation of migration control, EU detention camps in nonEU countries, inadequate scrutiny of the implementation of the Returns Program"

Birmingham was seen as good at creating jobs but not necessarily for people in those wards where unemployment sat at a higher level. The new Labour administration still has a focus on job creation, promising to create thousands of jobs and tackle ingrained unemployment and poverty on a journey to make Birmingham the âenterprise capital of Britainâ. The leader of the council has said that his priorities are jobs and enterprise, helping to get 52,000 unemployed Birmingham residents into work. New economic growth zones are to be created, which are likely to benefit from incremental tax funding schemes (Birmingham City Council 2013). In terms of labour activation strategies, these are largely a function of national government. Delivering labour market integration in a âdifferent wayâ is not seen as possible without central government support financially. Employment strategies are a web of interlinked programmes and funding streams, and this complexity is due to the national agenda governed by more than one government department. In Birmingham, local activity has been co-ordinated by JobCentrePlus and the Learning and Skills Council, national organisations with local delivery arms. The council has a small budget in comparison to the other organisations, but has been the accountable body for a number of funding streams and therefore decisions as to how money is spent locally (usually through Be Birmingham). All three have been brought together through partnership arrangements. Various central government initiatives aimed at the most deprived areas have been implemented through the city council in Birmingham since 2000, with either employment as their sole objective or one amongst others. For example, the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (2001â2008) did lead to strategies for local employer engagement and access to employment and training but comparatively little of the locally determined spend was directed at employment targets. The most common approach was support for local voluntary organisations helping people who were out of work. The Single Regeneration Budget (2000â2007) included a number of innovative job creation and employment and skills projects focused on particular areas of the city. Unemployment did fall in the areas covered by the Single Regeneration Budget but also the number of jobs available fell with the continued decline of the manufacturing sector. The Working Neighbourhoods Fund (WNF 2008â2011) resulted in the local coalition using the resources available to set up a cross-agency Integrated Employment and Skills model as the basis for employment support across the city and to fund projects targeting different groups and needs. The council, Learning and Skills Council and JobCentrePlus all signed up to this new way of commissioning and delivering services for the unemployed at a neighbourhood level. This was seen as a risky and radical strategy as it involved a major change to existing practice taking the focus away from a city-wide approach to contracting services locally. The projects funded through the WNF covered a wide range of activities to support people to work. The Worklessness Innovation Fund set up through the WNF provided small grants for feasibility studies, demonstration projects and innovative actions. Projects had to contribute to the outcome of increasing employment"

It can be calculated risk as the product of hazard and vulnerability. Within the landslide risk management framework, vulnerability is regarded as potential for damage and loss caused by a hazard and would depend on a random mix of physical, social, economic, and environmental factors, which interact in space and time. 3. Development of a Policy Framework to promote and enrich the landslide risk awareness The landslide hazard map is another important entity in developing a policy framework to enrich landslide risk awareness. It is essential that the policy context be ï¬eld validated, reliability certiï¬ed and user-friendly. It should be effectively utilized, ensuring timely mitigation and expedited response. A special policy context should be outlined for the use of architects, planners, engineers and contractors to certify the safety of structures they plan, design and build. It will be useful to provide these hazard maps and policies to foreign visitors to educate them about the hazards they might face. If an area has been identiï¬ed as vulnerable to landslides and categorized under the landslide-prone areas, awareness programmes should be immediately conducted for the local community. This should be handled with utmost care, since the local community has been established in these areas making use of the local resources and involved in regional occupations. Thus it is important to build an amicable and lasting relationship with them. The state authorities and intervening organizations should consult these communities on proposing alternative job opportunities and highlighting the beneï¬t of resettling in a safer environment to minimize the impact in catastrophic situations. It is of vital importance to build a strong rapport with these citizens and thereby counteract or avoid misconceptions and negative attitudes towards the policies and action plans proposed by the government (Rupasinghe et al. 2014). 4. Development of a Policy Framework to promote a multi-disciplinary culture of landslide studies and management The major factor that governs promoting the multi-disciplinary culture of landslide studies is none other than the landslide professionals. It is essential to create a gradational structure, spreading from a large well branched network which acts as a tremendous supportive system of sharing information and services among individuals and groups until it reaches the grass-roots level. This network can be utilized in conducting effective awareness"
277,6,0.986,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"1.1 Introduction Europe has become âa continent of immigrationâ in the course of the last half century, and European societies have experienced growing ethnic and cultural diversity (Okolski 2012). Recognition of the necessity to devise migrant integration policies in light of these facts has been uneven in time and place (Penninx 2013). For example, in a number of cases integration policies were first formulated at the city level rather than the national level. Since the turn of the century, however, most European states have developed some form of integration policy; after 2003, the European Union (EU) also entered this increasingly multi-level field of policy. These local, national and EU governmental actors have often made great efforts to collect and develop the knowledge and expertise required to understand integration processes and to control and steer these. Such knowledge may be collected from existing sources or, if the required knowledge is not available, it may be solicited from the research world. It may be used for different purposes: to give policies a sound conceptual basis, to develop policy instruments and measures, or to monitor and evaluate policies."
245,133,0.985,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"patterns can increase the asymmetries of mobility flows, too, within the social dimension of the mobile students (Cerdeira and Patrocinio 2009). The balance between mobility flows is seen as very diverse. Countries with a high outbound rate and a low inbound rate are faced with âBrain Drainâ discussions and target to raise incoming mobility. Other countries are faced with a high number of incomings, and are faced with funding and admission issues. Those countries have differing reactions. While some countries developed policies based on solidarity and agreements between the main involved countries, other countries target to solve the problem by exclusion of international students in some areas. While these policies are mostly related to national or even nationalist discussions, others aim for a European discourse. Following from that, the share of principles in admission and funding of HE can be seen as prerequisites for meaningful mobility. Common agreements and negotiations based on democratization and quality should be favoured. The main ï¬ndings of the CoSMiCE project show the high diversity between European Countries and their regulations. Access criteria, ï¬nancial and social support and language policies are not only contrastive, they are regulated by various bodies and are highly complex. Moreover, regulations lack transparency and international comparability. Students barely get the information they need to decide on their individual mobility due to diverse information policies and complex bureaucratic systems. Additionally, the complexity is not only related to educational policies, but also to migration and labour market policies. Another main ï¬nding is related to the public discussion on student mobility. The Public and media perception is very ambivalent among all countries. On the one hand, mobility is seen as attractive and even necessary, on the other hand, discussions on brain drain and imbalanced student mobility flows led to negative perceptions of mobility. To overcome the barriers towards student mobility, not only broad system reforms in the areas of students support or migration policy are required. Measures are also needed to enhance the information towards students by more transparency, social support, but also creating trust between educational systems and solidarity among European countries. Mobility remains a challenge in the space of a Cosmopolitan Europe, over and above special attention should be given to degree mobility and profound cooperation models within the EHEA and Non-EHEA, to ï¬nally overcome a higher education area of contrasting contexts and interplays of protectionist behaviour, rather than solidarity based cooperation. As this survey has shown, national policies regarding student mobility are influenced by national debates and thus provide ambivalent opportunities for incoming and outgoing studentsâin terms of ï¬nancial support, social support, but also migration policies and societal prejudices are factors that enable or hinder mobility. These ambivalent national policies lead to a situation, where students can barely overview and compare the different approaches and are often overwhelmed by the complexity of national systems, even if there are support measures. Degree-seeking students are not only confronted with ï¬nancial and socio-economic barriers, but are also left alone in preparing, organising and funding their mobility."

However, the migration of young people from the villages to the cities increased instead of decreased as planned by the authorities. For example, young men from rural areas often never returned to their villages after military service. Equally ineffective was the restriction of residence permits in big cities. People refused to leave urban areas, as they knew it might be impossible to return, which resulted in disproportional urban growth. Suburbs were not formally part of the city but commuting distances increased, adding to the burden on infrastructures. Indirect migration flow instruments that proved more efficient included incentives relating to working or living conditions, improved community services and the introduction of regular salary increases as well as significant pension benefits and other bonuses related to specific regions (Yankovska 1980). âEthical meansâ or rather, ideological pressures that influenced migration in the socialist system, are a special area of migration policy. Various resolutions of the Communist Party and its youth organization, Komsomol, affected resettlement regulations; for instance, in 1974 the Trans-Siberia railroad was announced as a Komsomol-sponsored construction project. The XVIIth Congress of the Youth Communist League appealed to young people to participate in the construction of the road. The regional Committee of the Komsomol mobilized young people for resettlement using so-called âKomsomol trip sheetsâ, which assigned them to the construction area in Siberia. In previous years, the same scheme had been used to provide labour for the development of the Siberian oil and gas fields. Researchers established the following migration policy objectives: increased job satisfaction through improved matching of workersâ qualifications with type of work; ironing out regional differences in living standards; reducing discrepancies between working and living conditions in urban and rural areas; growth of production; development of social infrastructure; and sanctions on employers failing to provide appropriate conditions for new settlers (Onikiyenko et al. 1975)."

Also, the practice of invisibility is the result of their own search for personal locations where they can feel safe and autonomous. Ironically, this strategy of invisibility can be counterproductive for them, because in a context of lack of information, it prevents them from access to the benefits of the new migration law that could ensure more long-term conditions for a better quality of life. Dignity for migrants has a public dimension derived initially from their legal existence in Mexican society, but many migrants remain ignorant of and out of reach of civil organizations advocating their rights. So far, given the discourses and local spheres of power, Guatemalan women migrants, mostly with irregular status, must face multiple dimensions of insecurity derived from recent discourses and practices that focus on the link between âirregularityâ and national insecurity. As a result, there is an impediment to their achieving dignity and rights, especially for those living in remote rural areas and in marginal urban zones where information and formal procedures are not accessible. In such instances, it is important to pay attention to the interface between the normative framework of im/migrantsâ rights and the dynamics of the local sphere of migration that obstruct the enabling conditions for women im/migrants to achieve a legal existence on their own account and which respects their autonomy. In this sense, information is an important instrument for creating the conditions needed to break down the dominant relationships of subordination, where women can adopt in/visible strategies through processes of informed decision. Enabling conditions should be built through the dissemination of more information about their rights as guaranteed by the new Migration Law, which can help migrant women to construct better long-term conditions for their future and that of their children. The construction of these enabling conditions remains a big challenge for society, a challenge which should be addressed by the joint efforts of social institutions and civil organizations, the media, and even the academic world, as well as by strengthening the practices of public officials, policymakers, and those involved in the migrantsâ networks."
144,54,0.985,25 Years of Transformations of Higher Education Systems in Post-Soviet Countries : Reform and Continuity,"the role of governments One might expect that there should or could have been a significant role of the governments in shaping the higher education landscapes. Indeed the governments lead the development of the legislation that made possible the implementation of the reforms discussed above. One could agree with Carnoy et al. (2013) that the governments in most post-Soviet countries (except more authoritarian) were driven by global and national legitimacy agendas. It drove them to borrow some policies, to open access to higher education. However, most case studies report that there was limited action from the government directly aimed at changes in the landscape. There is no country of the former Soviet Union that came with its own master plan to restructure the higher education system, to create a new differentiation of higher education institutions. Furthermore, many of the policies that were implemented were more reactive than deliberately proactive. However, the governments of independent states did consider higher education to be an important tool of building new states. They established new (often specialized) universities to meet new human resources needs. Almost all states established their own military, police and public administration academies and higher education institutions to train cadres for diplomatic fields. Some governments established high prestige and quality higher education institutions in economics and finance. The governments also closed or transformed Soviet institutions that were useless for the independent countries like the Communist party schools and technical institutes that served the Union as a whole. The need to strengthen the new national (ethnic) identity of young countries required language and culture policies in higher education. In 14 countries, the Russian language (that used to be the dominant language of instruction in higher education) was gradually replaced by local languages. It affected the vertical differentiation of universities. It also led in some cases to the establishment of new universities specialized in national culture and language. During the last years some countries added a new dimension into the vertical differentiation by establishing new or converting old institutions into world-class universities. Another set of the"

Meetings with various local stakeholders were organized to discuss the problems and possible alternatives for regional development and nature conservation. Among stakeholders were: the NGOs responsible for the local nature reserves and Rewilding Europe; mayors of Portuguese and Spanish villages; the president of a hunting association, local entrepreneurs such as producers and retailers of cheese, jam, almonds, wine, and Iberian pig meat products; and the owners of a bar and a bed & breakfast. The main assignment for the IP students was to explore economic dynamics that could contribute to the ecological restoration and future wilderness in the region. In groups of three to four, they articulated a vision for the region, together with a business model that would give both the ecological system and the local community new perspectives. Many of the business models that students produced were in the tourism sector, which is in line with what Rewilding Europe promotes in this region (see Chap. 9). Some student groups perceived the lack of publicity for the area as its main problem. Therefore, they came up with a web portal for local (tourism) enterprises and a marketing brand for the whole region. They also came up with models to expand the local variety of tourist activities. One group proposed to diversify the local economy by introducing a snail farm from which part of the profits would go to nature conservation and education. Two groups proposed ideas to stimulate the use of land, which would perhaps only fit with Rewilding Europeâs vision for the area if these activities were outside of a core wilderness area. One of these groups launched the idea for an organization that could bring conservation volunteers from all over the world to Western Iberia to help maintain the agricultural production on some of the terraces. Another group proposed a company that mediates between local communities and businesses new to the area to smoothen the purchase of land. A final business model introduced the concept of small self-sustaining office units in the landscape to rent to people who would like work in a sustainable office with a great view for inspiration. During a âmarket presentationâ, which was open to the public, students shared their visions and business models with local stakeholders and interested community members (Fig. 10.3). One of the IP students arranged during the IP her return to the region to conduct a MSc thesis research project on the use of social learning to increase levels of local involvement (Leuvenink 2013). Another MSc student helped organize the IP as an internship assignment and stayed in the region after the IP to conduct an analysis of the relation between Rewilding Europe, the Portuguese conservation partner ATN, and the local population (Walet 2014)."
99,210,0.985,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"correspond to city policy: Citizens are âencouragedâ by the city to organise73 and express themselves. Since 2008, the City of Geneva has for example set up some âdistrictâ or âneighbourhood contractsâ that enable people from the area to express themselves in working groups or neighbourhood assemblies.74 Or social innovation is linked to citizensâ everyday lives, to their active involvement, which is part of the design of the local welfare state and has to be included in the analysis of the governance (Evers 2005). It is not surprising that Geneva has the lowest rate of formal and informal volunteering in Switzerland (Gundelach et al. 2010; Kettenacker and Cattacin 2008; Office fÃ©dÃ©ral de la statistique (OFS) 2011, pp. 7â10).75 Or active citizen involvement is also part of bottom-up initiatives, which are a key component of innovative social policies (Oosterlynck et al. 2013, p. 4). An interesting hypothesis for this low degree of citizen engagement is the lack of an established city identity, or in other words, âthe identity of not having oneâ (Cattacin and Kettenacker 2011). This could explain why the city tries so hard to provide a link between the citizens and the âinternationalâ city. These considerations lead us to conclude that Genevaâs social innovations tend to be incremental and happen above all within state services, and that, because of attempts to control spending, new services are rarely created. Therefore, social innovations tend to be initiated from the top or are quickly regulated and standardised by the state. This state orientation is in line with the key core values of the welfare state as outlined in this chapter. Indeed, we think that the strong state orientation in Geneva, preoccupied by rising inequality over the past two decades (Beer 2013, pp. 35â44), results from its desire to safeguard equality and solidarity among citizens, values that are shared by the stakeholders and political parties. But we also witness state control over social and urban policies and the wish to remain the legitimate source of them."

In addition, in the course of â even recent â history, a plethora of institutions have been in charge to deal with the âItalians abroadâ. In this section, we provide a first review of the measures undertaken since 2008.

Accordingly, civil society (including social organizations) is often expected to take a position during the drafting process of laws (Art. 45, paragraph 1, letter c ParlA12) in order to avoid further optional referenda. Switzerland offers an âopen institutional contextâ to social movements âdue to its federal structure, proportional representation, multiparty government coalitions with rather undisciplined parties, weak public administration, and the presence of direct-democratic instrumentsâ (Hutter/Giugni 2009, 430). However, direct democracy encourages âinstitutionalized protest strategiesâ (ibid.). Well-organized protest movements which have forged political alliances and moderate action repertoires are indeed more likely to succeed in Switzerland (ibid.; Wisler 1993). Conversely, spontaneous protest movements and radical action repertoires (such as illegal occupation) are discouraged and frowned upon, considering the availability of directdemocratic instruments (Hutter/Giugni 2009, 430; Wisler 1993) and their greater legitimacy (Balsiger 2016, 288). However, direct-democratic instruments require financial resources and considerable commitment from protesters as they need to collect a significant number of signatures within a given timeframe (Giugni 1995). As a result, the Swiss context is selective towards social movements: being open for some and closed for others (Wisler 1993, 7â8). Protest mobilizations were more numerous in Switzerland in the 1980s than they are today (Hutter/Giugni 2009). By comparison to other European countries, Switzerland had a high level of âoverall mass mobilizationâ (Kriesi et al. 1992, 226). Despite the primacy of direct-democratic means of participation, Kriesi et al. (ibid.) observe that the number of petitions in Switzerland was higher than in Germany and France, where moderate forms of protest are less popular. Nevertheless, Kriesi and Wisler note heterogeneous protest behaviors among the linguistic regions in Switzerland: [D]irect-democratic institutions are more frequently used in the German-speaking regions. The difference is small for the referenda, but very strong for popular initiatives. As a consequence, the action repertory of the social movements in the Latin regions turns out to be more radical than that of their counterparts in German-speaking Switzerland. (1996, 24)"

Inversely, the lower the level of government, the more difficult it is to effectively address water governance problems, in particular those that are not strictly local, without having the big picture. Stakeholder engagement can provide platforms to address the mismatch between administrative and hydrological scales. Water-related projects and policies can be driven by local livelihoods tied to local ecosystems or by energy producers making long-term production and investment choices at the national level. Thus, some stakeholders promote hydrological scales that correspond to manageable units in which they operate (e.g. river basin organisations). Others promote conventional administrative levels, arguing that this is where capacity, accountability and legitimacy already exist. In the Great Lakes region of North America, multilevel engagement processes on water resource management between the province of Ontario, municipalities, local NGOs and First Nation communities led to the formulation of common policy directions and long-term strategies for water protection. Fitting stakeholder engagement to place-based needs can help reconcile decisions within and across spatial scales."

Convergence between countries within the same family has been shown to occur for tobacco control, with similar countries choosing similar policies and adopting policies at roughly the same tempo (Studlar, 2007). The Netherlands is considered part of the continental (Western European) family, consisting of countries like Belgium, Germany, and Austria (Castles & Obinger, 2008; Obinger & Wagschal, 2001). Other families are an Anglo-Saxon (English-speaking) group (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States), a cluster of Scandinavian countries, and a peripheral group of European countries (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece). The continental family, to which the Netherlands belongs, is characterised by the central position of Christian Democrats, a âpolitics of the middle wayâ (combining social democratic and liberal principles), and political cultures that are oriented towards bargaining and compromise seeking. This chapter describes this system. It starts with a discussion of the two most important aspects of Dutch policymaking: corporatism (pressure groups incorporated into the policymaking process) and the continuous need to seek consensus in a multi-party political system. The readerâs attention is directed to the tension between party ideology and tobacco control policymaking. Separate sections deal with the process of drafting new legislation and the opportunities available for advocates to influence this process through lobbying, either directly (targeting civil servants of the ministry), or through parliament. Finally, our attention turns to two long-term processes that gradually undermined the position of the central government as the main producer of tobacco control: deregulation and decentralisation."
99,323,0.985,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In transitional countries, civil society is a space for the self-organisation and mobilisation of citizens to protect and to promote their interests. Civic norms, values and networks produce a necessary level of social capital to build trust among local stakeholders and to strengthen social cohesion. In this case, there existed a fertile soil for social innovations and, after a certain period of time, social entrepreneurship. RODA was established as a successful social innovation because it was in possession of certain social capital mostly from middle class citizens that were its key actors. Also, they were among the first organisations that actively worked in family policy area counting on engagement of families. They became recognised and branded themselves so they are now the organisation that almost every mother has heard about, which contributes to their success as social innovation. It is obvious that developmental capacity of this innovation, being owned by a civic organisation, increases on a steady basis. Empirical evidence says that civil society is a space for self-organisation and selfpromotion of the middle class, which is the core of âurban citizenshipâ. It brings the issue of fragmentation of the space of civil society as a relevant topic for further research. Important question is the one of capacities and inequalities. What are the differences in possibilities of organisations with developed social connections and social capital derived from their middle class status as opposed to the organisations founded by lower class citizens? Also, what are the differences between urban and rural based organisation? The case made impact on the local and national welfare systems in terms of policy making process and governance producing new welfare culture in this field. Besides such promising development of the analysed social innovation in the space of civil society, the social welfare system, which is in the hands of government and the city, has still not become the space of viable social innovations. Overregulation and paternalistic style of government, where the authorities own public policy, remains the major obstacle for developing social innovations (BeÅ¾ovan et al. 2013). Some earlier research (BeÅ¾ovan 2010) identifies the problems of a lack of coordination and poor cooperation between different local stakeholders. Mobilisation of local stakeholders and facilitation of social change appears to be a demanding and"

Whilst there are additional supporting roles, the NPTs are the primary implementers of Neighbourhood Policing (NP) tactics and strategies within urban and rural areas throughout Dorset. When questioned about their operational procedures, over 77% (n14) of NPT sergeants stated that there was no adherence to organisational policies when dealing with problems in local communities, which allowed them to develop individualistic solutions. NP Constables were following the same approach and of the 94 PCs participating in the e-survey, 80% (n62) said that they developed their own bespoke and personalised solutions instead. A similar trend appeared with PCSOs, where 75% (n60) stated they adopted a similar approach in their roles. Whilst the utilisation of officer discretion is crucial within NP strategies, it is equally important to ensure that a corporate structure and framework exists within which that discretion may be utilised, to ensure that a strategic âfootprintâ can clearly be seen in the application of policing responses to public concerns. This view is supported by Her Majestyâs Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) (College of Policing 2015), who stated that to effectively tackle public concerns and improve the quality of life in communities, police priorities, using their tasking and coordinating (TCG) process and supported by systems that monitor effectiveness and impact, must reflect the communitiesâ concerns."

First, the âspaceâ for regional water management must be redefined. Discussions and agreements on river water (or benefit) sharing must move from being bilateral to being multilateral: to date, most of the diplomatic initiatives on river water sharing have been bilateral in nature. Multilateral discussions, including recognition of local competition for equitable access to water, could reduce the dominance of any single state leading to more equitable and legitimate agreements. Second, South Asian governance arrangements need to adopt a âco-managementâ and âbenefitsharingâ perspective, rather than only sharing water. There is a dire need for comanagement of transboundary rivers for mutual benefit, especially as climate change and human interventions affect water flows. This will require a more diverse range of expertise and inclusion of a wider set of actors to succeed. Third, hydropower and the creation of an integrated South Asian power grid offer a gamechanging opportunity for regional prosperity and peaceful coexistence. The cooperation between Bhutan and India demonstrates the potential for such an integrated approach. Achieving such regional win-win partnerships by 2030 will be difficult but is not impossible. Achieving this game-changing state of affairs will require mobilising diverse types of expertise and facilitating the active engagement of multiple actors (âbeyond disciplinesâ); changing mindsets from a hydrological to a problemshed paradigm (âbeyond scalesâ); and implementing effective institutional arrangements while â most important â strengthening capacities for negotiation, dialogue and communication as well as technical skills and identifying effective champions with a regional vision (âbeyond institutional hardware to human softwareâ). Organisations operate in the manner they do as a result the behaviour of people who work within them (Senge et al. 2008). These steps will need to be accompanied by a process to create the institutional frameworks critical for long-term success."

First, todayâs FODWs are not singularly glued to a certain âsocial locationâ by national regimes. Rather, they are triply fixed in their social and legal cage by the two additional layers of regional and global regimes. At a superficial glance, the emergent regional and global regimes in the field of migration offer a glimmer of hope in that they seem concerned with the plights of FODWs and appear to offer a remedy for them. In reality, they are favorable only to a small group of women who are willing to accept the current âpower geometry.â FODWs remain, as always, powerless and invisible. Worse, their âinsecurityâ is triply fixed. Second, emergent regional and global regimes do not aim to challenge the current âpower geometryâ and FODWsâ resulting âsocial locationâ at the very bottom in any host country.

266,39,0.985,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Unity as a Community Policing Research and Innovation Project The fundamental vision of the Unity project was to strengthen the connection between the police and stakeholders to improve the safety and security of communities and citizens. Unity wanted to develop CP concept that is flexible and adaptable to local contexts around Europe. The general idea of CP had to be adjusted to multiple conditions where Unity project conducted pilot testing of its products.2 This adaptation required strategic analysis of the current conditions, the needs of the police forces and the communities, and the resources available for the common journey to the desired future. This exercise can utilize widely tested instruments, such as SWOT or PESTEL analysis. The same analytic tools can also be applied on a smaller scale for solving particular security problems undermining the livelihood of communities and the well-being of citizens. Based on a large survey among the LEAs and stakeholders in eight European countries the Unity project set its goal to improve CP in six outcome areas: (1) trust and confidence, (2) accountability, (3) information sharing and communication, (4) addressing local needs, (5) collaborative problem solving, and (6) crime prevention (proactive policing). Unity project aimed to improve CP in these outcome areas in each pilot context. Important aspect of piloting was also the testing of how Unity technology would help CP processes to create value in the above-mentioned outcome areas."
161,66,0.985,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"Africa. Signiï¬cant variations exist in policies and regulations around mHealth even in countries belonging to the same geographical region, which may negatively affect mHealth scale across borders (World Health Organization, 2016). Moreover, few standards exist for data conï¬dentiality and sharing among countries within geographical regions, which further hinders mHealth scale across borders (ibid.). In an ideal scenario, all relevant mHealth-related policies are well-established and institutionalized by the time an mHealth initiative is ready to scale. However, the current reality is that many LMICs are still in the process of developing or reï¬ning such policies, and the speed of maturity of mHealth initiatives and supporting public policies do not match. Even if the framework legislation has been established, the regulatory environment that must accompany laws on mHealth is simply not present in many LMICs. Given this, mHealth systems must also, for the time being, address such gaps. Aligning an mHealth tool to ï¬t within the conï¬nes of a nascent regulatory structure means that the tool must also be flexible enough to change and adapt to new regulations as they emerge. At times this may mean establishing the capacity for ongoing design evaluation during or after a successful small-scale pilot of the tool. Deploying within a country where the regulatory framework around mHealth may not be fully developed will also demand more time dedicated to building and maintaining relationships with the Ministry of Health and other ministries involved in the governance of digital health. Failure to actively engage government ministries may result in projects being delayed, abandoned, or outright banned (Eckman, Gorski & Mehta, 2016). mHealth scale cannot be achieved in the absence of an effective policy and regulatory environment and there are some immediate steps that can be taken to achieve this. LMIC governments must adopt appropriate legislation and establish a regulatory authority to create a framework within which mHealth initiatives can flourish. Simultaneouslyâat the global community levelâinternational efforts must focus on identifying best policy practices that enable and promote mHealth adoption and innovation particularly in low-resource settings (World Health Organization, 2016)."
164,558,0.985,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were being set in 2000â2001 social protection was barely mentioned. Ten years later in 2010 at the United Nations âMDGs + 10 Summit,â sessions on every one of the eight goals referenced social protection programs as a means of achieving poverty reduction targets.2 In the short term, well-designed social protection programs reduce poverty levels and ameliorate related suffering, particularly among the poorest (Barrientos and Hulme 2008). In the mid-term they allow many poor people to exercise their agency and pursue micro-level plans to increase their productivity and income. In the longer term, they create a generation of healthier and better educated people who can seize economic opportunities and contribute to broad-based economic growth. Additionally, when sudden crises spread across the worldâas with the 2008 triple whammy of global food, fuel and financial crisesâthese programs help poor families cope with the unpredicted consequences of globalization. Expanding across the Global South is a heterodox analysis that sees welldesigned social protection schemes as contributing to several goals at the same time. Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, Indonesia, and China are paving the way, but the idea is spreading via a genuinely southern revolution.3 The focus is on trusting the poor to use money wisely and to pursue objectives that poor people already want to doâsend their children to school, improve their diet, and make small investments to increase their income. Cash transfers work especially well when money is targeted at a relatively large group of people and is perceived as social assistance. Aid donors from developed nations, now calling themselves development partners, have responded after seeing that cash transfers have become an important part of social protection and increasingly recognize them as a legitimate development strategy. Aid donors and some elites in developing countries (especially ministers of finance and business elites), however, have much less trust in the poor. They tend to use terms like âsafety nets,â âhandouts,â and âdolesâ derogatorily, and to view transfers as temporary or short-term solutions, rather than strategic elements that can help raise agricultural productivity, support micro-enterprise, and foster economic activity in marginalized regions. From the USA, where the poor are often blamed for their poverty, the tendency is to emphasize the centrality of conditionsâsuch as school attendance for recipientsâ children or engaging in public serviceârather than to recognize conditionality as one design element of a program. Some programs work better with conditionality while others do not. Schady, one of the authors of the World Bank report Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) is a strong advocate of conditions because he is convinced that the problem is the âpersistently misguided beliefsâ of the poor (Fizbein and Schady 2009, 9).4 Indeed in the USA, many specialists are not aware that unconditional cash transfers are a major element of social Hulme attended the MDGs + 10 Summit and witnessed this by agencies keen to incorporate social protection, social floors, and conditional cash transfers into future strategies.

164,640,0.985,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","This CSV approach to poverty reduction is obviously a community-based approach and doesnât begin by exclusively targeting the marginalized poor. To make this development approach work, various levels of the community have to be involved and those who are helped economically arenât just the marginalized poor, but a broad spectrum of the population that makes up the community. The overall impacts on rural development include the construction of factories, the training of farmers, and the creation of new clusters of collaborating sectors that benefit the community as a whole, as does the local tax revenue and urban growth associated with this approach to business and development. Helping the marginalized poor is possible because of massive investments to produce products that are distributed to large urban markets through the distribution system of the company involved. There are certainly other instances where the rural poor are too segregated for this approach to work, such as in refugee camps or areas where the geographic and climatic prerequisites for increased food production do not exist. The CSV approach does require preconditions that provide the potential for business creation. In the case of dairy products this potential requires adequate conditions for cattle raising such as water and grazing lands."
284,321,0.985,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"What will happen with IIRSA is that local governments will be forced to be more disciplined because they will be brought in line with global markets. There are 500 transnational companies that produce half of global gross domestic product; when one looks at IIRSAâs design and these companiesâ projects, they complement one another: The groundwork is being laid for the circulation of communication, merchandise, raw materials and energy . . . Capital needs a reordering of territory â considering this as a type of historical-social construction â in order to continue reproducing itself, as much in terms of materials as in power relations, of accumulation of capital and profits. The ordering enables access on a large scale to certain types of material from the earth. In characterizing this latest form of neoliberal development, Gustavo Esteva (in Bessi and Navarro, 2014) observed: âIndigenous people are on the front lines of a battle, ï¬ghting a war that is on behalf of all of us, because it is there that the capitalist system looks to relaunch a new form of accumulation.â Indigenous peoples are increasingly insistent on demanding the recognition and integrity of their territories, many of which are threatened by the grandiose proposals of global capital; their actions are confronting directly these schemes, and changing the maps of the Americas in the process. They have strengthened their resolve to prosecute their historical claims as they become increasingly skilled in achieving the enforcement of the agreement ratiï¬ed by the ILO to guarantee prior consent of native peoples with territorial claims for outsiders to undertake activities or exploit natural resources in their regions.7 Accompanying the changing map is a new consciousness of the signiï¬cant differences in understandings of even the most elemental concepts in their exchanges with their interlocutors in the states of which they are a part: although a signiï¬cant discrepancy occurs throughout the Americas, as different social groups and peoples question governmental procedures to charge a single agency with implementing uniï¬ed policies for the myriad ethnic groups in their countries,8 an even more serious source of conï¬ict involves the very notion of property and the apparent freedom with which outsiders (government agents) can discuss the possibility of alienating peopleâs claims to land or natural resources. This problem arises because of the profound differences between the historical signiï¬cance attached to the different concepts of property and territory; for many groups, territory is an all-encompassing term with complex implications that are not easily incorporated into prevailing"

Despite the virtues of SEZs, there are some potential side effects that African governments can avoid in pursuit of the agricultural transformation agenda through SEZs. Zeng (2015: 7) highlights that SEZs may result in environmental degradation, for example, in China, the GDP performance used to be the top priority for the government officials without looking at the effects of SEZsâ implantation process to the environment. The WB estimates that the environmental costs are about 8% of GDP and, to address this, China has since implemented tougher environmental standards and tried to use fiscal policies to force firms to adopt âgreen technologiesâ and conduct innovations (ibid.). ILO (2012) cautions that in some countries, SEZs have been castigated for deleterious socio-economic results especially to the women, youth, and working environments. Some of the SEZs probable pitfalls include labor exploitation especially among women and youth coupled with low wages, inadequate training and skill upgrading, use of trainees to lower wage costs, subdual of labor rights, and lax environmental standards (ibid.). Singh (2009) observes that if SEZs are set up on agricultural land, they create obstacles for the social and economic development of the country, especially if fertile land area under agriculture is acquired. A notable case is Indiaâs Singur and Nandigram where the government acquired land forcibly from the farmers at lower prices and gave SEZ developers at a subsidized rate, thus resulting in farmer agitations against the government (ibid.)."
282,100,0.985,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"aim at achieving widespread compliance. In this sense, they exercise a quasilegislative function and assume the corresponding authority. One example for a rule-setting partnership is the WCD. When conflicts relating to the construction of large dams escalated, the commission was convened to develop generally accepted standards for the construction and running of large dams, based on a common assessment of their effectiveness for development. While not considered binding, the standards are now used as a reference point by different stakeholder groups affected by dams. Another example is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).15 ICANN is the coordination body for the domain name system of the Internet. It regulates the technical elements of the Internetâs name and numbering systems in order to preserve the operational stability of the system and promote competition. While it lacks the backing and status of a world government, its regulations are considered authoritative by the concerned communities. Not all partnerships operating with rules and standards, though, are genuine rule-setting or regulation partnerships. Rather than creating new norms and codes, some simply advocate and create incentives for compliance with broadly accepted existing standards. The 4C initiative, for example, is an advocacy partnership that may be confused with a rule-setting partnership. It encourages coffee producers and traders to comply with a set of norms that are derived from major conventions, resolutions or guidelines of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), or from conservation legislation. 4.1.3 Policy implementation partnerships Yet other partnerships have formed around pressing development issues and seek to address them directly. Real implementation partnerships mobilise significant resources and allocate them for implementing policies. By contributing funds or other resources, other organisations or individuals explicitly authorise the partnership to manage and allocate these resources. The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a joint initiative of international organisations, bilateral donors, industry representatives, NGOs and private foundations to reduce malnutrition of populations at risk, for example, has over 60 million US$ at its disposal for grants, technical assistance and start-up investments.16 The GAVI Alliance, launched in 2000 as the âGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisationâ by a group of governments, donors, health organisations, NGOs, companies and research institutions to increase the rate of vaccinations among children, has an annual budget of 600 to 800 million US$ to support the development of new vaccines and the immunisation of populations in need.17 Other partnerships can only spend resources at a much lower level.

Also, the group initiated tree-planting activities in degraded mangrove areas. Over time, some stands have begun to regenerate naturally. Since 1993, the Pred Nai initiative has focused on the sustainable management of marine resources and ecological monitoring within the mangrove forests. In 1997, the group introduced some regulations on crab harvesting. These rules specified the suspension of harvesting during the crab breeding period in October (UNDP 2012). In parallel with the conservation activities, the PNCFG also initiated a village community fund with the help of a local monk, primarily with the objective of introducing the concept of financial sustainability of community initiatives. Under this initiative, the villagers were encouraged to save part of their income and earn some interest, while at the same time keeping the savings within the village so that the funds could be loaned to other needy households. Later, this initiative won the support of government agencies and NGOs, obtaining donations from international agencies and local institutions such as the Social Investment Fund (SIF), the Thailand Research Fund, the Education Institute, and even from political parties. The village common fund has total savings of more than THB 3 million at present, and regularly receives contributions from crab catchers, local traders, and also from agroâtourism activities, and thus it is sustained year after year (Silori et al. 2009). Over nearly three decades the capacity of the PNCFG has been strengthened through various training programs provided by many organizations. RECOFTC has been one of the key organizations among these. It has been associated with the PNCFG since 1999 and helped to promote the PNCFGâs outreach to communities both within and outside of Thailand. It has also encouraged the exchange of ideas about sustainable utilization of natural resources among the villagers. As a result, the PNCFG has taken the lead in building a network of more than 20 villageâlevel community forestry groups along the four provinces at the eastern seaboard of Thailand to manage mangrove resources. Not only this, but Pred Nai has also received international attention for its contributions in the community forestry sector. Besides attracting a number of study tours from many countries, the PNCFG received the Green Globe Award in 2001 and was nominated for the Equator Initiative award in 2004 (Senyk 2005). According to the villagers, the capacity of the PNCFG to manage the resources, regulate their access and use, and resolve conflicts has increased. At the same time, the relationship with the key government departments, such as the Department of Fisheries, the Tambon (Sub district) Administrative Office (TAO), and the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) has improved. Villagers interact regularly during monthly village meetings. Awareness of the importance of mangrove forests and their conservation has been raised. Also, key government officials are involved in formal and informal village meetings and capacity building activities, and help in conflict negotiations, if any. There can be no doubt that the conservation efforts of the Pred Nai villagers and the PNCFG have had a direct impact on restoring biodiversity, alleviating poverty, and facilitating local economic development. The chief biodiversity impact has been the restoration and protection of 1,920 ha of coastal mangrove forest (UNDP 2012). This substantial regeneration of mangrove forest cover has enabled the return"

In recent years the global campaign for the right to health as a fundamental human right has opened the way for civil society organizations and scholars to develop and establish an approach to the health needs of labour migrants which enables their voices to be heard and properly addressed (WHO 2010). The plight of labour migrants who occupy the range of occupations in the global economy defined as low-skilled or unskilled (often with temporary contractual arrangements, or in sectors not covered by labour protection laws in either the sending or destination countries, or both) has become a major concern from the standpoint of social justice in health (Dwyer 2004). The fragmented understanding of sexuality in health matters calls for more creative cooperation between health research and migration research to steer policy agendas towards providing more appropriate responses to the SRH needs of labour migrants."
242,749,0.985,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","As an emerging issue in global migration, SRH research in the Philippines still has a long way to go to come up with policy messages useful for setting up services to groups of migrants whose health has been affected by the ways their migration is organized. Findings on overseas domestic workers from the Philippines in this study show how power relations can be articulated in ways that shape their structural vulnerability to SRH problems. The articulation depends greatly on context and place irrespective of the fact that the three countries share the common denominator of an excellent health system. Most significantly, the link between the SRH problems experienced by a migrant domestic worker as an individual and the mechanisms of exclusion from, or inclusion in, SRH services operates simultaneously at ideational and material levels. Ensuring affordable services is not enough; gaining awareness and knowledge about the right to exercise the right to SHR health seems crucial, particularly among migrant domestic workers whose health-seeking behaviour is constrained by conventional norms of sexuality and a range of choices that are far from risk-free. International migration connects countries of origin, transit, and destination, and it is important for governments to recognize the complex intersection between migration systems and health systems. A purely national approach to migration and health is too limited to respond to the health needs of migrant workers. Bilateral, multi-country, and multi-sectoral dialogues would help foster collaboration and partnership to harmonize the responses to these needs. Various regional and subregional forums addressing transnational health challenges such as HIV and AIDS, SARS, avian influenza, and the H1N1 virus are already in place. Efforts to address migrantsâ health, and in particular SRH, must take note of the specific structural vulnerability they are subject to and recog-"

Fourth, most interaction is happening between similar kinds of actors, i.e. scientists most frequently interact with university actors, NGOs with NGOs and governmental actors with other governmental and semi-governmental actors. The exceptions to this are few in number, and pertain to the interaction between scientists and âminorâ NGOs. However, all types of actors, i.e. scientists, NGOs and governmental actors, are in contact with the social partners, confirming both the de-facto centrality and continuity of the social partners as an influential group of actors in integration policymaking. Topics discussed with the social partners are mainly concentrated on labour market integration and labour rights, but they are also involved in other political issues such as mosque constructions and religious teachersâ education. Unlike the (primarily self-referential) government and nonprofit organisations, the social partners are in contact with a diverse range of actors. These dialogues structures have a huge impact on the question of how knowledge is produced, consumed and utilised. As the MoI promoted the recent institutionalisation process, dialogue structures are certainly marked by this government department. In the area of naturalisation, as could be shown, the dominance of the MoI is such that it successfully claimed knowledge authority and established itself as a knowledge producer. When confronted with Austriaâs low score on naturalisation policy in the MIPEX survey, the MoI not only ignored the scientific critique but re-interpreted it successfully as a vindication of its restrictive policy model. Only in the area of school education, in which the Ministry of Education has competence, does some sort of national dialogue exist. One may thus conclude that the MoI seems to promote the institutionalisation of dialogue structures between science and politics as a means to consolidate and reinforce its primacy in Austrian migrant integration policies. Overall, three different types of knowledge use in the area of migrant integration could be identified in Austrian integration policymaking: legitimising use (to bolster an actorâs political role or authority), substantiating use (to justify decisions and orientations) and knowledge shelving, i.e. when the results of government-funded research are consumed and archived and, eventually, used for decision-making at a later stage. Indications of legitimising knowledge use were most often referred to by interviewees in the field of naturalisation, but ranked high in general. However, the MoI itself stated that it does not have an in-house competence in all issues related to integration and therefore has established the Expert Council to increase its âauthenticityâ. Interviewed experts instead see the set-up of the Expert Council as a justification strategy used by other ministers to gain competence in an area of responsibility. While most interviewees referred to a legitimising use of scientific and expert knowledge, differences between the three topic areas could be identified: in naturalisation, where continued national research is absent and the MoI established itself as a knowledge producer, little need is felt by policymakers for scientific knowledge. The area of education, in contrast, is marked by the active role of boundary actors"
266,116,0.985,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"ICTs and Policing In policing contexts, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have many different applications and uses. In many cases, police may utilize the standard privately-owned social media platforms and their services, such as Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube. These can be employed to foster a good relationship between the community and the police but also to make police work more relatable and transparent by communicating about everyday activities. For instance, the American Civil Liberties Union has released the freeware app Police Tape, which allows civilians to record law enforcement encounters. Many of the âstandardâ social platforms and their functionalities are often employed not only in emergencies and daily police work, but also by (para)policing initiatives that originate from civil society itself. Examples of such initiatives are so-called neighbourhood watch (NW) initiatives, which may have different degrees of authorization and official recognition, varying from country to country. They describe civil initiatives in which citizens organize and take action to help each other and foster community relations, but also to prevent crime and increase safety in their neighbourhoods. In the US, Los Angelesâ so-called Large Emergency Event Digital Information Repository, or short LEEDIR,1 is an âeyewitness platformâ,"

We further wish to understand whether such traditional notions of an inclusive, service-oriented welfare state can be combined with an awareness of global solidarity challenges and possible solutions. This includes an analysis of the extent to which citizens themselves are involved in such transnational and local networks or individual forms of solidarity action. We organize our analysis of reported solidarity practices around an alternative set of hypotheses: the first concerns support of the traditional belief systems and the notion of universal welfare, and the second concerns the conditionality of solidarity based on the notion of deservingness. In the first case, reported solidarity practices and attitudes would uphold the founding principles and distinctive traits of the Danish (Scandinavian) welfare regime. In line with the existing literature (Christoffersen et al. 2013; JÃ¶hncke 2011), we would expect high levels of support for the welfare state and involvement in solidarity practices to be distributed equally among the population encompassing all age groups, gender, regions and ideological and political affiliations. Such a uniform pattern of solidarity would reflect the homogeneity of Danish society represented by centralized state structures. We would further expect that a centralized, strong and omnipresent welfare regime releases citizens from the need to invest in substantive support action. Danes would trust that the universal welfare state takes care of the basic needs of vulnerable groups like the unemployed, people with disabilities or refugees. Mutual support would be voluntary and not required for the subsistence of these persons in need. We would therefore expect Danish civil society to assume a subsidiary function vis-Ã -vis state-centered welfare: solidarity action would often supplement existing services and not be substitutive for the well-being or survival of vulnerable groups (in contrast to countries where state solidarity is lacking or inefficient). Citizens would rather opt for indirect instead of direct support actions and their solidarity would encompass several levels: trust and mutual assistance at the local and national level and a European and global problem awareness. We would ultimately expect that the universal welfare state releases forces for the mobilization of transnational solidarity, which becomes especially a target of private, individual support action and charity. In the second case, we would be able to identify patterns of conditionality in the reported solidarity practices. We would be able to describe how Danes distinguish between different recipients of solidarity along criteria of deservingness that justify an unequal distribution of services"

In addition, in voluntary organisations, that own a major part of the nonproï¬t providers, member-based democracy has been identiï¬ed as a mechanism that provides autonomy from public and market forces (EikÃ¥s and Selle 2002, 52).

73,180,0.985,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Peri-urban areas encompass both characteristics of the urban and rural world and they are located somewhere in-between the urban core and the rural landscape. They have been traditionally approached from an urban planning perspective as ground for urban sprawl and location of regional and trans-regional infrastructures. Several European key policy documents (e.g., Lisbon Strategy, European Spatial Development Perspective, Territorial Agenda, Leipzig Charter, and European Landscape Convention) have been fostering the understanding of sustainable urban development as an increased integration of economic prosperity, social equity and cohesion, and environmental protection, as well as the strengthening of rural-urban relationships. The strategic role of peri-urban areas must be understood within the current societal challenges like, for instance, climatic changes and food security concerns. Unlike urban areas, which were the object of in-depth research for a long time and from multiple disciplinary perspectives, peri-urban areas have not deserved much attention until more recently. Nevertheless, research and policy initiatives, as FP6 PLUREL Project or the PURPLE network, have put forward the case that periurban areas in Europe might occupy nowadays the same amount of land as consolidated urban areas, concluding that these have become a ânewâ kind of space that needs more targeted policies and it should be treated as a âspatial system in its own rightâ.

334,152,0.985,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"In the 1990s, a tightening of the migration and border system was adopted across Western Europe and deportation started to become a central element of immigration control, particularly of rejected asylum seekers (Wong 2015). While deportations signal and maintain national sovereignty over borders, they also often contravene the spirit of human rights legislation and impose danger and high costs on individuals. As a consequence, deportations are met with feelings of injustice, unease, and moral outrage in an increasingly wide part of society (Nyers 2003; Ellermann 2009; Freedman 2009, 2011; Tazreiter 2010; Anderson et al. 2011). In the three countries under investigation, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, mobilization and protest against this forceful measure appeared both at the local and national level, often spontaneously and diffusely organized. Civil society, friends, neighbors and political groups alike, took action to prevent the implementation of deportations of individuals, or to engage in movements that challenge the deportation system. Several campaigns and protest incidents in the field of deportation are well documented (Nyers 2003; Ellermann 2009; Freedman 2009, 2011; Patler and Gonzales 2015), but little research has examined how this particular type of protestâtargeting both individual human rights issues and core aspects of nation statesâmanifests itself across time and space.

For example, the Statute of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area (Ustav (Osnovnoi Zakon) Yamalo-Nenetskogo Avtonomnogo Okruga 1998) guarantees the right of indigenous peoples to participate in the work of regional authorities, local governments according to their national traditions and customs.

The legislation on the indigenous peoples in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area -Yugra is recognized the most developed in the country in the related issues. Thus, the regional authorities provide the guarantees of the indigenous rights and interests by the following means: â assist for self-government development in accordance with national traditions and customs of indigenous peoples; â involve the indigenous communities into decision-making process; â support and finance traditional indigenous activities; â support indigenous arts, culture and languages; â preserve and give the priorities for using traditional lands and territories (Ð£ÑÑÐ°Ð² (ÐÑÐ½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð¾Ð¹ Ð·Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð½) Ð¥Ð°Ð½ÑÑ-ÐÐ°Ð½ÑÐ¸Ð¹ÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð°Ð²ÑÐ¾Ð½Ð¾Ð¼Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¾ÐºÑÑÐ³Ð° â Ð®Ð³ÑÑ [Charter of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area - Yugra] 1995).

341,169,0.985,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"especially, different political positions on the role of the local and central states in brokering water services development. With respect to urban water governance, the key preoccupation of this volume, there are also some clear historical patterns. First, cities tend to experience an initial public health driver for the extension and expansion of urban water services. Whether in the mid-nineteenth (Bristol), early twentieth (Osaka) or late twentieth (Kampala) centuries, increasing the density of cities also brings with it a clear need for centralised command and control over public health with some level of public sector involvement in water services an inevitable corollary. This involvement can entail either regulatory oversight or direct provision or both. In British cities public health-oriented âMetropolitan Water Boardsâ were in place by the late nineteenth century, and similar institutions appeared later in Japanese and still later in East African cities. Sometimes these Water Boards provided water services themselves (a public provision model), and sometimes they merely acted to license and regulate private service providers. Either way, the state retained a significant role in policy formation and regulation, if not direct provision. In England and Wales these functions are now exercised by government agencies charged with regulation of drinking water quality (DWI), water business planning (Ofwat) and impact on the natural environment (Environment Agency). Since the Flooding and Water Management Act of 2010, urban authorities in England and Wales have had new statutory duties for flood planning and surface water management. In Osaka, these functions are all still largely managed within the OWB, though privatisation pressures may break up this vertically integrated system from 2015 forwards in accordance with Prime Minister Shinzo Abeâs neo-liberal programme. Clearly, in Kampala, Uganda, the water services system is relatively poorly developed, particularly with respect to both wastewater and surface water management. Lack of clear government policy, political instability and economic weakness has meant that these sectors have developed primarily through programmes managed and funded by bilateral and multilateral aid organisations. Put another way, the Ugandan government has still to work out a clear hydrosocial contract with civil society, whereas in both Bristol and Osaka the basis of the hydrosocial contract has in recent years been shifted from mass service delivery towards biocentrism and resilience â alongside a shifting balance between public and private providers. Simultaneously the geographical scale of water services regulation has increasingly shifted towards the river basin or catchment, a transition that risks pitting strictly urban interests, whether bureaucratic or private, against the broader claims to manage river basinsâ resources in a more holistic way for the greater good (Molle and Hoanh 2011). Yet, shifting the gaze of urban water management from cities to urban regions or river basins also allows the possibility of thinking more equitably about the distribution of water services costs and benefits from the usually more rural upper catchments to the usually more urban lower catchments. Such ârescalingâ of urban water governance has, for example, opened the way for considering how up-catchment land managers (e.g. farmers) can benefit from producing cleaner source waters for down-catchment cities through âpayment for ecosystems servicesâ mechanisms. Yet ârescalingâ is also unavoidably contentious as different tiers of"

From an economic viewpoint, TSOs provide both goods and services, but also organize expressive activities in the domains of sport, culture, arts and so on. They mobilize voluntary resourcesâvoluntary work and donationsâthat are more difficult to mobilize, if not impossible, for other organizational forms. Additionally, they are most often oriented toward other ends than economic ends, even if in the pursuit of these ends they develop economic activities. From the political and communicative1 perspectives, TSOs have the potential to constitute a counterpower to the state and economic powers, to act as schools of democracy and also constitute a communicative space where value contention is made possible. Being a space of associational life, TSOs have the capacity to promote and sustain norms and values of public interests and practices of civic engagement. They also have the potential to organize different types of identities and interests and to play a mediating and representative role in interacting with other societal spheres such as the state, the market or the family, influencing policies and attitudes. Being a communicative space, they have the capacity to enable debates, confrontations and contentions among individuals and organized actors animated by different values, interests and identities. By the play of these political and communicative functions, they contribute to the democratic infrastructure and might instigate social, axiological (valuebased) and political transformations impacting other societal spheres. From the social point of view, TSOs constitute a space of value pluralism and freedom and contribute to the maintenance of norms and values. From this viewpoint, the third sector is fundamental for enhancing and protecting the diversity of particular values, cultural practices and citizensâ initiatives in all domains of social life. TSOs are also instrumental to the maintenance of norms and value that are more universal, such as those of solidarity, inclusion, trust and public interest. For this reason, they potentially have the capacity to contribute to the social integration of individuals and groups and to foster solidarity across differences."

Starting with the flow of Rohingya people stranded in Indonesiaâs territories, mostly in the northern tip of Sumatera island in 2012, the Indonesian government has been domestically pressured to help the group, which faces repression and discrimination in Myanmar. The local people, such as the Acehnese, have helped the Rohingya to get food, medication, and shelter after traveling through the Indian Ocean for months. In September 2012, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) through its Chairman Jusuf Kalla, who was actively involved in the Aceh peace process while he served as Vice President, visited Myanmar and shared some best practices and suggestions based on the Indonesian experience in dealing with peace in Aceh, in a forum to discuss peaceful solutions to the civil conflict in Myanmar (Taufiqurrahman 2012b). He also signed an agreement with the Myanmar Red Cross to provide financial and technical assistance for short- and long-term programs that address the refugee crisis in the Rakhine state. Kalla stated that PMI would like to stay in the Rakhine state for the post-conflict reconstruction program (Taufiqurrahman 2012a). While PMI has received permission to conduct its activities in the country, unfortunately other humanitarian agencies, such as MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res-Holland (MSF-H), have been denied access since February 2014 to continue humanitarian activities in the country (Fan and Krebs 2014, 9â10).

These communities form connected systems and networks, creating a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). During its ï¬rst ten-year implementation period, 2005â2015, GEO identiï¬ed biodiversity as a key âSocietal Beneï¬t Areaâ, resulting in the formation of the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network, GEO BON.

100,256,0.985,Migration in The Southern Balkans : From Ottoman Territory To Globalized Nation States,"Two key factors that improved their situation were the regularization of their status and the extended duration of their migration. That latter, especially, facilitated relationships of mutual trust. Thus, as Rogaly (2008) argues, it is important to emphasize the dynamism of labour relations and migration in time and space, and to acknowledge migrantsâ agency in shaping these relations even when the space for doing so is constrained by structural factors. Relationships and trust are particularly important for those on seasonal work visas as the permits can be obtained only after a Greek employer submits a request for a named individual through the Greek Organization of Employment and Labour (OAED) to a Greek consulate in Albania. The permits are valid only for work in the agricultural sector and are tied to a particular employer, that is, migrants are not allowed to work for anyone other than the sponsoring farmer, although many do and with the latterâs permission.11 Labrianidis and Sykas (2009b) argue that unlike in other high-income countries where such seasonal work schemes are used, the interpersonal labour relations between migrants and farmers still prevalent in the Greek countryside, facilitate migrantsâ strategies for continued employment during low peaks of agricultural demand. During such periods, migrants may take up jobs in the agricultural sector in other parts of Greece, or in other better-paid sectors in urban areas such as construction and small-scale manufacturing. As the jobs are carried out informally, migrants crucially depend on strong social capitalâa network of friends and relatives who are already settled in Greece with long-term permits and who are able to introduce the migrant to potential employers, as well as being able to help them with accommodation. For first-time migrants who lack ties to Greek employers, Albanian friends and relatives act as intermediaries. At the same time, these migrants often need to place an informal bond of â¬ 500 with their prospective employer for protection of the latterâs âinvestmentâ against the migrantâs absconding before the seasonâs work is over. This sum is roughly equivalent to a workerâs monthly wage, which the employer For a more detailed account of this process, see Maroukis (2008) and the discussion in Gemi et al. (2010). The European Commission recently issued a proposal for a directive regulating the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of seasonal employment (2010). It aims to bring closer the member statesâ provisions on this issue and goes some way to addressing the vulnerability of seasonal labour migrants, a condition which results primarily from tying the migrant worker to his or her employer, not allowing them to work in more than one sector of the economy, and not being granted a multiple-entry visa. For a critical review of this proposal, see Triandafyllidou (2010)."

Freshwater conservation has therefore been a priority among environmental NGOs for decades. In fact, many local or national NGOs and initiatives were formed as a direct consequence of too little to no governmental action toward sustainable management of freshwater resources. Many international NGOs, such as WWF, also started to act because of the crucial role water resources play in the context of human development globally. They function as advocates for integration of local, regional, and international water policies, for a proper scienceâpolicy interface, and for adequate stakeholder involvement in decision-making in order to ensure that the needs of both nature and local communities are being met.

169,807,0.985,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"27.5.2 Socioeconomic Factors Inï¬uencing Fishery Sustainability As previously noted, SUSFISH was founded in recognition of the history of failure of development projects grounded only on technical and/or scientiï¬c advances. In BF alone we found examples of failure to adopt modernizing technology in the form of abandoned equipment and infrastructure (ï¬sh ponds, refrigerators, ï¬sh weighing scales, ï¬sh shops). For that reason SUSFISH sponsored research into the social, economic, and political barriers and bridges the gap to sustainable ï¬sheries. Our research indicates that, while some encouraging examples exist, there are abundant barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries provided by challenges of governance at multiple levels in BF. Our results conï¬rm that ï¬sh size and ï¬sh community diversity are associated with the degree and quality of management, both of ï¬sheries directly and of the habitat surrounding the ï¬shery. For example, the Nazinga site has relatively unimpacted habitat (land management) and has a closed ï¬shing season that is well-regulated (ï¬sheries management), and it has signiï¬cantly larger ï¬sh and a higher share in adult ï¬sh than any other sampling site. Furthermore, both ï¬sh and BMI diversity are higher in protected areas, e.g., Nazinga, Mare aux Hippo than in others. Just as important to biodiversity conservation as the legal content of policy is its execution at the appropriate level (subsidiarity) by well-organized and led local actors. For example, in Moussodougou the ï¬sheries are directly controlled by a local association that effectively enforces rules. Situations with effective management are associated with an increased biomasses and abundance with large ï¬sh specimens. A prominent overarching challenge is that it appears that ï¬sheries management is not equally applied all over BF but is concentrated in a few large reservoirs of ânational economic interest,â e.g., Ziga, Bagre, Kompienga, and Sourou. Fishing in these large water bodies is dominated by commercial ï¬shermen, who are regulated and in good communication with government ofï¬cers. However, elsewhere in BF communication is not so good for management organs devoted to smaller reservoirs, except for four ï¬shing concessions given to the associations of the local ï¬shermen (Bapla, Moussodougou, Tandjari, and Lera). Aside from these few examples of successful organization of local management capacity, for the most part, there are gaps between national and lower levels of governance. Brieï¬y, a governance system that effectively functions from the central, national level out to the regional and local levels has yet to be established. Often the link between law and practices to monitor ï¬sheries is missing (law is not adopted in practice). Therefore there is little effective police monitoring or enforcement of ï¬shing practices at the lower levels, e.g., smaller-scale ï¬sheries. While efforts to decentralize management authority have been underway for years, the failure to comprehensively bridge institutions from national to local levels is hampered by the frequency of shifts of governance responsibilities (institutional nomadism) for ï¬sheries management at the national level. One salient example of the poor communication that results from such âadministrative ï¬uxâ is the general"
72,223,0.985,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"and ideas from users and citizens when designing new and innovative solutions (FTF, 2013). Horizontal leadership is sometimes referred to as collaborative leadership. The task of collaborative leadership is to design appropriate institutional arenas for collaborative governance and facilitate collaborative processes by emphasising the mutual interdependence of public and private actors, building trust, developing a shared understanding of the overall mission and encouraging the production of intermediate outcomes (Ansell and Gash, 2008; Archer and Cameron, 2008). A crucial challenge for collaborative leadership is to drive the process onwards from problem definition, direction setting and policy development to decision-making and implementation. Making bold decisions and implementing them in practice is the sine qua non for innovation but often presents a challenge to leaders of collaboration since the choice of one solution over another may give rise to conflicts and antagonism. This makes conflict mediation a key part of collaborative leadership (Gray, 1989; Ansell and Gash, 2008). Integrative leadership also focuses on collaboration in horizontal arenas. As such, the key ambition of integrative public leadership is to bring diverse groups and organisations together in semi-permanent ways, and typically across sector boundaries, to solve complex problems by developing a new set of solutions that help to achieve common goals (Crosby and Bryson, 2010). According to Crosby and Bryson (2010), the research on integrative public leadership has shown that leaders are most likely to have success with creating cross-sector collaboration in turbulent environments and when separate efforts by several actors from different sectors have failed. Their research indicated that successful leaders aimed to form an initial agreement about a problem and sought to design the collaborative process in ways that involved the creation of boundary objects, experiences and groups. They drew on the competences of the collaborators, were responsive to key stakeholders and made a point of avoiding imposed solutions. Integrative leaders ensured that trust-building activities were continuous and that the structure of collaboration was flexible and open to new actors, as well as for leader succession. Integrative leaders were prepared to commit time and energy to mitigate power imbalances and deal with shocks, and they managed to reframe conflicts and disputes in ways that had appeal across sectors. Finally, such leaders focused on building accountability systems that track inputs, processes and outcomes and on developing methods for gathering, interpreting and using data in processes of creative problem solving.

Under the new post-2015 framework, respective governments in Asia should promptly develop long-term, low-carbon development plans and put them in effect. In order for Asia to develop its own policies with full ownership, the region must possess an autonomous regional research community. And, at the policy implementation stage, it is necessary for science (research) to be reflected in policies. Moreover, knowledge held in the scientific community must be leveraged to make relevant stakeholders, especially in business, and move towards low-carbon development. Under the LoCARNet scheme, several research institutes and organisations exist in this region, which are already working closely with policymakers and involved in the policymaking process in their respective specialised fields as centres of excellence (CoE). However, in the future, synergy effects amongst these institutes, as a CoE coalition or CoE alliance, must be maximised to drive progress in policies and in the business sector in this region. In this transitional stage that includes 2015, it will be imperative to make policy proposals, in parallel, to each government, to the Asian region, to the global international community and to relevant stakeholders. This project will take the form of action research that develops the organisation through these kinds of onthe-job activities. As regards future network activities, LoCARNet will focus on promoting priority research in fields common to the Asian region; facilitating financial and institutional support for fostering and strengthening research capacity in the region, in collaboration with donors, other institutions and organisations concerned; securing routes to reflect research results in policymaking; and activating networking and information dissemination with and to other like-minded stakeholders towards realising low-carbon societies and low-carbon development.

Traditional grazing managers and water managers for the Boran have customarily overseen the integrated use of these strata; creativity and flexibility are needed to effectively balance forage supply and demand every year. In the past 20 years, however, the traditional system has been augmented by pastoral associations (PAs) which are governmental administrative and political units; PAs have become involved in resource-use decision making, and contestation of authority between traditional and PA institutions has led to problems (Homann et al. 2008). Resource fragmentation problems now occur at all spatial levels, while another challenge at the most local level is ultimately an inability to control stocking rate, and hence forage utilization (Tezera et al., unpublished data). Annual rates of forage utilization among four PAs have been estimated to vary from 70 to 90 %â one outcome of such heavy use is soil erosion and bush encroachment, as previously noted. Coping with such challenges has largely been left up to the traditional leadership of the Borana pastoralists in concert with decision makers from government agencies, but it is evident that population pressure, emergence of very wealthy pastoralists, and reduced adherence to traditional pasture-use norms have undermined grazing regulation in recent decades. Progress, however, is being made on several fronts. This includes (1) finalization of a land-use plan by government that should limit cultivation on grazing lands; (2) efforts to restore traditional grazing access beginning at the dedha scale of resolution; and (3) workshops to address the need to reduce stocking rates and limit forage utilization at the local level to help arrest rangeland degradation. Thus, there are opportunities to assist pastoralists to update traditional grazing rules and regulations to better accommodate the new reality of higher demand on natural resources. Increasing scarcity of surface water and forage is recognized by pastoralists as a critical problem that merits new, collaborative approaches for problem solving (Coppock et al. 2014). Sahel. In the Sahel, pastoralists exploit the high variability of rainfall across space and time via highly mobile livestock.27 Population growth, land-use change and resulting land fragmentation, and unfavorable policies, however, have contributed obstacles for herd mobility at local and regional scales. Traditional pastoral institutions facilitated access to constantly shifting patches of natural resources (de Bruijn and van Djik 1995; Niamir-Fuller 1999). Colonial and postcolonial land policies, however, ignored pastoral rights and this, coupled with socially malleable rights to pastoral resources among pastoral groups, has made pastoral resources vulnerable to competing land uses, especially with the rapid growth of human populations since the 1950s (Guengant et al. 2002). Since the 1990s, programs to decentralize natural-resource management authority, as well as recurrent attempts to privatize land, have contributed to the enclosure of key pastoral resources (Marty 1993). While these changes have generally not caused widespread sedentarization of pastoralists and their livestock, they have reduced mobility, altered movement patterns, reduced livestock access to grazing,"
293,235,0.985,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Transnational Relations as an Outcome of the Balance of Interests and Power between Sending Countries and Diasporas A dominant trend in research has been to view sending state policies as an outcome of the balance of interests and power between sending countries and diasporas. From this perspective, sending states reach out to their diasporas in recognition of the economic and political contributions that emigrants might make via remittances, foreign direct investment, or political support (Sheffer 1986; BaubÃ¶ck 2003; Ãstergaard-Nielsen 2003a; Guarnizo 1998). Consequently, sending country outreach policies constitute a particularly attractive strategy for states that occupy a marginal position in the global economic and political system (Guarnizo 1998). For these countries, diaspora engagement policies are, so to speak, a foot in the door to the economic beneï¬ts of globalization. Other analyses emphasize the political signiï¬cance of diasporas, in particular, when a sizeable proportion of the sending countryâs population resides in a receiving country or region important for its foreign policy or when a dissident voice is unwanted by the homeland. Thus, one overall hypothesis of why countries reach out to their diasporas is based on a rational cost-beneï¬t analysis by the political elite of the sending country; that is, the more important the diaspora is for the economy and domestic and foreign policy of the country of origin, the more likely that country is to seek to âtap intoâ diaspora resources through outreach policies. This might be with policies aimed directly at maximizing remittance ï¬ows or via broader policy reforms to encourage"

REDD projects can be seen as a means to understand how REDD will unfold on the ground; REDD demonstration activities are seen as means to learn lessons for future REDD implementation. These early implementation projects inï¬uence debates about REDD, the ways in which so-called co-beneï¬ts are being addressed, and who is involved and who beneï¬ts from REDD. In principle, REDD country strategies to be deï¬ned in Phase 1 are the ï¬rst step in the implementation of REDD national policies. National REDD strategies would deï¬ne the current situation in each country and the direction in which the country is going to move in terms of reduced carbon emissions from deforestation, addressing so-called co-beneï¬ts and deï¬ning who would beneï¬t from economic payments. In practice, however, numerous REDD projects are taking place before the design of a countryâs REDD strategy is ï¬nished or in parallel with its development. Early implementation projects are informing the policy-making process in each country and at the global level. Proponents of REDD projects stand in a better position than other actors, who do not have any experience with such projects, to inï¬uence REDD debates because not having knowledge about REDD is a barrier for being included in the ofï¬cial debates. We have identiï¬ed three approaches employed by actors involved in early REDD planning, implementation and readiness projects, and the consequences of such approaches. The ï¬rst one is knowledge production and dissemination. Second is the creation of technologies or standards to legitimize or validate projects. The third approach is enrolment in new, emerging or alternative networks. In what follows we analyse these three approaches by highlighting who is involved, the resources mobilized to employ each approach, and the outcome. It is worth saying that these approaches are not mutually exclusive, and different actors within each country put distinct emphasis on each of these approaches. Creation of knowledge and dissemination of information Our ï¬ndings indicate that, to a great degree, networks involving NGOs and international research institutions with support from development cooperation agencies and private actors are creating and disseminating knowledge about REDD in the region. These networks systematize information about REDD in Latin America and at the global level. They are having a great inï¬uence in deï¬ning what a REDD project is, who the legitimate implementers are, who will beneï¬t from it and how.

It contributes to encouraging and supporting such new market actors via actions such as the 2014 conference on âEmpowering social entrepreneurs for innovation, inclusive growth and jobsâ. At that event, workshops focused on the âpotential of social enterprises for job creation and green economyâ as well as on the ways that the European Union could use its structural funds to support and foster social enterprises.16 Leverage for jobs, social inclusion and green initiatives were all identified as necessary because they are inadequately addressed by traditional firms. Nor is it only international or supranational organisations that engage in behaviour meant to structure labour markets, both on the supply and demand sides. The major cross-national study of social cohesion and innovation reported in Evers et al. (2014) documented that âwork integration enterprisesâ were the most common innovation in local welfare systems. These kinds of businesses exist at the blurry boundary between market and community, often difficult to distinguish from the kinds of community groups, third-sector providers and associations that engage in social development projects, frequently at the local level (Moulaert et al., 2010). Social policy communitiesâ enthusiasm for the market participation of social entrepreneurs and the social economy has had to go beyond cheer-leading and publicising best practices, of course. The reconfiguration of the welfare diamond has necessitated attention to how social innovations will be financed. This need has resulted in blurring of boundaries between public and private governance as public funds flow into the market corner of the welfare diamond to finance, in whole or in part, services that are no longer public services in the classic meaning of the term, that is provided by public employees at no cost (or little cost) to users. âMany if not most of the SIs [social innovations] we dealt with rely on a multiplicity of resources and their combination; the mix may vary and state financing may often be the most important component, but in most cases there is a degree of (financial) co-responsibility of other organizations from the civil society or the business sectorâ (Evers et al., 2014, p. 22). In other words, local, regional, national or European public authorities were actively using their available funds to foster local innovations in labour markets and for services. They were engaged in market-making and in blurring traditional boundaries between public and other forms of services. Developments in childcare services provide another good example of this blurring, which has intensified as the âsocial investment"

Giving a voice in the public domain to new concerns and groups Innovation also means addressing issues, concerns and related forms of self-organisation in a way that is more up-to-date in terms of emerging challenges and pressures. Conventional methods of presenting and organising concerns are often no longer effective (Westall, 2011). When it came to womenâs concerns, both the âMaMa Foundationâ in Warsaw, Poland, and the âRODAâ initiative, Zagreb (Evers et al., 2014, p. 246; p. 37) had overcome the traditional restrictions placed on women in a labour market designed for men. They highlighted other concerns that had previously been seen simply as private issues, exposing local systems that, both under socialism and post-socialism, displayed little interest in the manifold challenges of childcare, and then raising awareness of new ways of working and family life on the public policy agenda. These, and other, innovative projects and initiatives had been eager to discover new ways of organising debates, deliberation processes and publicity in order to set agendas and establish a new consensus on priorities. A related project from the Western context was the âMaggio 12 Initiativeâ in Milan, Italy (Evers et al., 2014, p. 187). This project aimed to bring together concerned citizens, experts, politicians, professionals and administrators as part of an organised consultation process on a new agenda in the field of children and childhood. Building issue-related coalitions and partnerships Coalitions, partnerships and alliances can be seen as denser forms of networking that are often concerned with raising awareness of a particular issue. Establishing these kinds of partnerships, which are both unified and plural, can be seen as an important and innovative aspect of policy making, fostering participating in governance. As well as examples from the field of urban housing and neighbourhood regeneration, the âFoundation Ambrosianoâ in Milan, Italy (Evers et al., 2014, p. 182), provided a good example of bringing together stakeholders from quite diverse social and political arenas and binding them into a coherent alliance."
10,331,0.985,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Following Contextual Interaction Theory such a generally supportive governance context is expected to have positive consequences for the motivation, cognitions and resources of the actors involved in the process of implementing drought resilience measures. What we did observe is a varying and on average moderate, but also growing degree of draught awareness among the actors. This also positively influenced their motivation. Of course there is here a strong pre-selection effect: while all measures are taken voluntarily it is no surprise to see predominantly positive motivations. On the other hand: also with previously sceptic actors like the agricultural organization positive developments are observable. The resources of the actors made available for drought resilience measures and to push and pull to get them accepted are generally sufï¬cient, with the exception of the withdrawal of the national government from the support for nature development and the national landscape park that has made things more difï¬cult. On the positive side, the provincial government has compensated this loss to a large degree, indicating its preparedness to contribute. All in all this has led to an implementation process with a remarkable degree of collaboration. When we look more speciï¬cally into the three actor characteristics of Contextual Interaction Theory we see the following. The motivation of the stakeholders working to act on drought is triggered to large extent by their own goals and values. In a dense country such as the Netherlands, the last remnants of nature are seen as especially precious. In addition, desiccation is considered one of the major environmental policy themes in the Dutch government for several decades now. The local water authority views cultivating drought resilience for the area as its own responsibility. Also nature organizations and more and more farmers are aware of the implications of drought and water scarcity, including loss of flora and fauna in creeks and crop losses. For the province also the external pressure of European policies is very relevant. Low self-effectiveness assessment on top-down regulation of preparatory measures limits the scope of instruments to voluntary ones. The cognitions of actors are mainly driven by observations on the changes of the regional water balance. The visibility of drought issues has increased in the region, with creeks running dry as well as dry vegetation. Damages from droughts are affecting agricultural yields in rural areas. Cities and their urban infrastructure are also affected by drought, which in leads to a change in awareness and perception. In contrast to the strong legal requirements behind nature conservation in the Netherlands there are limited resources for the nature organizations to combat drought issues themselves. Their key competencies are rather limited. Other actors,"
314,417,0.985,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Adequate institution and support to agriculture have not been provided in sub-Saharan Africa. Generally, the lack of good governance and low public investment in agriculture have reduced incentives to private sector participation in agriculture. sub-Saharan African governments have spent on average less than 1% of national budgets on agriculture even if they pledged to spend 10% in 2003 under the terms of the New Partnership for Africaâs Development (NEPAD)-CAADP (see introductory chapter). Building institutions to support the institutional development of rural Africa is of utmost importance. This section reviews more particularly the need for land reforms, gender-sensitive policies and farmersâ organizations in agriculture. Even though land reforms should be country-specific, Moyo et al. (2015) recommends that they clearly define property rights, ensure the security of land tenure and enable land to be used as collateral. For Kanu et al. (2014), the promotion of more equitable land access and rights requires both land registration and legal recognition of customary rights and administrative issues. If they cause land expropriation for smallholder farmers, pastoralists, indigenous communities and other vulnerable groups, land reforms will contribute to food insecurity and increase in poverty and inequality. For instance, land rights and administration have attracted attention in the context of biofuel production and land grabbing by large corporates. In Ghana, Lauretta S. Kemeze, Akwasi Mensah-Bonsu, Irene S. Egyir, D. P. K. Amegashie and Jean Hugues Nlom (Chap. 6) affirm that proper regulation would have avoided the massive conversion of fertile land to biofuel crops, at the expense of food crops. Jatropha cultivation (biofuel sector) could have been promoted on marginal lands so as to not compromise food security. Also, the lack of market for Jatropha seeds highlighted the need to properly regulate the sector in order to protect rural people. Farmer support organizations are essential in acquiring, applying and continuously disseminating knowledge and skills to farmers (Kanu et al. 2014). Such organizations can help in mitigating risks and increasing"

These organizations are highly diverse. Some have a religious function (e.g., the Ghanaian migrant churches in the UK and the Netherlands), while others focus on sports and leisure. Specific groups may also be targeted, such as youth, women, and particular ethnic groups. Moreover, migrant organizations perform multiple roles. They may facilitate the integration of their members in the destination country by providing information, for example, about housing, daycare, and health services, as well language and integration courses (they sometimes also deliver such courses). By connecting migrants with one another in destination countries, they help to build the migrant network."
2,150,0.985,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"long-standing tradition of independent nonproï¬t schools, which influences the current political discourse. This tradition dates back to the middle of the 1800s, building on the work and philosophy of N.F.S Grundtvig. Today, there is a wide ideological range of nonproï¬t alternatives in Denmarkâfrom left-wing alternative movements to Christians and liberals. Each of these groups has political allies, and this leads to cross-party consensus on the importance of the nonproï¬t sector. Although the nonproï¬t sector is much smaller in Norway than in Denmark, elements of this situation are found in Norway as well. In the Norwegian case, the pivotal position of the Christian Peopleâs Party and the Liberal Party appears to be important. These parties have traditionally been sceptical of the marketisation of education and elderly care; their priority has been to protect nonproï¬t institutions from the effects of marketisation. In Sweden, in contrast, such barriers to the development of for-proï¬t alternatives appear to be absent. In short, there is a strong element of path dependency which limits the options that have been discussed and thereby also alternative developmental trajectories. This observation is in accordance with the predominant literature on welfare states, in which one main argument has been that âhistory and politics matterâ (Arts and Gelissen 2010, 570). The historical developmentâdescribed by Sivesind in Chapter 2âcan to some extent explain the policies today. Where nonproï¬t alternatives were weak initially, the discourse on alternatives, user choice, etc., now tends to focus on state versus marketâas we have seen in Sweden. When a nonproï¬t sector of some size exists, it tends to mobilise its political supporters and thereby displace the leftâright discourse, as we have seen in Denmark."
277,249,0.985,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"Transparency was presented as the EUâs answer to the democratic deficit. The struggle of NGOs, notably Statewatch, for access to documents suggests however that the EU institutions have a long way to go before reaching the stated aim of transparency, let alone full participation of civil society in democratic decisionmaking on immigration policy. The absence of full participation by civil society in EU policymaking is a matter of concern to all who wish to see evidence-based policymaking in a true sense, as well as democratic decision-making and scrutiny of policy implementation. It cannot be addressed happen without accountability of the EU institutions to the public, particularly those who are subject to the effects of its policies. Where the policies have an impact on non-EU citizens, on or off the territory of the EU, EU citizens must also accept them as legitimate. Without informed public debate on migration, this cannot happen. The EUâs border agency, Frontex, epitomises the most negative of EU action on migration, which is least accountable to the citizens of the EU. The agency is characterised by a lack of transparency in its activities, which also reflect the primacy of security over observance of international obligations on the human rights of migrants and asylum seekers. The creation of a consultative committee has not led to independent oversight of Frontex activities. In summary, there is inadequate scrutiny of the effects of policies or the experiences of migrants within and outside the EU. The media generally fail to investigate the full picture, including the impact of policies. Many or most experiences of migrants within detention and in transit remain hidden from the public. Academic and medical research on the health effects suffered by children and adults in detention has not resulted in the end of such detention. There are chinks and contradictions in the overall picture. It is possible occasionally to advance and develop policy discussions beyond immediate policy objectives. Arguably, this has happened in relation to the understanding of gender and migration, undocumented migration and integration. Many officials of the EU institutions are well informed on the realities. However, no matter how high the quality of their discussions with academics, or how much innovative research methodologies can bring the voices of migrants to the debate, this better understanding of the issues is unlikely to have significant or measurable impact on the policy priorities of the member states and in the Council of Ministers.

When economic and political initiatives are set up outside the region, at crossborder, national or international level, it is easier and more efficient to build up fact-finding task forces comprising academics, business and policy-makers with one university rather than four. A pool of regional academic stakeholders has begun to emerge with UL as an aggregator. In this way the Campus Region, a single university, distributed throughout the region, has become a reality. Its membership in UniGR (Greater Region University) extends the notion of Region to a larger cross-border dimension, which, hopefully, is in line with the future of Europe. The prospects for the future forced the former universities in Lorraine to find ways to be able to defend themselves against possible threats and it may now be reasonably assumed that they are stronger as a single university. However, the future also calls for the development of new capacities of initiative, innovation and development. The potential is there for the political leadership to harness these capacities, but only time will tell if the new UL will be successful in steering its future.

242,719,0.985,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","The structural vulnerability of domestic workers to SRH problems may be conceptualized as an outcome of a process which hinges upon the following: 1) the normative discourse about the body and sexuality which frames SRH and its application to the situation of domestic workers as a group; 2) cultural, social, and legal definitions of a domestic worker in the host country that define their social location and the corresponding consciousness and sense of accountability for their right to health care; and 3) the ways in which individual SRH problems are connected with practices at the workplace, which in turn, define their inclusion or exclusion from available and affordable health programmes and services. Advocating for the SRH rights of migrant domestic workers faces major challenges. Given the wide definition of SRH, few countries can afford a comprehensive strategy. SRH services are mainly organized through a piecemeal approach, with the exception of education. Much depends on socio-demographic factors and the actual SRH problems which surface, and on budgetary constraints and the level of cooperation between health departments and civil society organizations. Attentiveness to social groups whose identities are invisible within the public realm does help influence the provision of services. As a labour-sending country the Philippines has one of most rigorous policies and programmes in the world for protecting the rights of its citizens who work overseas. It has recently identified domestic workers as one of the main groups to be protected from violation of rights, along with entertainers and seafarers.8 Action in the SRH domain has been hampered by the position of the Catholic Church, which has conflated fertility management and use of contraception with abortion, leading to its vigorous opposition to the passage of the Reproductive Health Bill in the Congress of the Philippines.

346,326,0.985,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","Although this chapter mainly deals with history education, it is worthwhile to also look at civic education in order to better evaluate strategies of the IC vis-Ã -vis local interests. The citizenship education projects run by the international organization Civitas have produced a welldocumented impact on curriculum change and teaching methods. This organization tries to reach local educational authoritiesâ agreement for conducting projects. It has been able to integrate teaching material and curricular guidelines into official curricula (Batarilo 2008) and could disseminate its approach to a considerably wider range of pupils than many other organizations. The programs include social community work, the improvement in school facilities and training of students on how to efficiently participate in school councils. Civitas reaches a great number of students in all political units of the countryâthe report of 2015 mentions 35,000 addressees every year for the program âProject Citizenâ (News from the Center for Civic Education 2015). from time to time, projects are evaluated (Summary of Research 2000). Nevertheless, the Executive Director of Civitas BaH reported about problems to establish positive working relations with the educational authorities contending in an evaluation seminar that official âinstitutions are often unable or unwilling to engage citizen participation in local processes, and citizens, in turn, are hesitant to trust and engage in those very institutionsâ (frouzesh 2005; see also Soule, n.y.). Moreover, Civitas is one of the few organizations which work on the same program and follow a coherent agenda over a long-time span. Providing continuity, coherence, involvement of authorities and studentsâ participation in practical school and communal activities, Civitas has probably found the most effective way to train students and teachers and brought about a curricular change towards democracy and civic education replacing the Yugoslav pre-military education. Civitas had to approach all the cantonal and entity ministers. One can say that Civitas was successful in establishing a common core for the diverse civic curricula in BaH. Most of the NGOs and international organizations are not able to apply such a concerted bundle of coordinated processing capacity, content-oriented curricular elaboration and social engagement of students and teachers. The Greek NGO Center for Democracy and Reconciliation in South-Eastern Europe, for example, still has problems to disseminate its Joint History Project teaching material in BaH because of unwilling local authorities and teachers sceptical to innovations coming from outside of the country and not yet approved by the education ministries."
99,144,0.985,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"government (1997â2010) maintained the focus on community involvement and promoted a âjoined upâ approach to urban regeneration, and central government funds were allocated on the basis of need. Birmingham has had a wide range of these regeneration and renewal programmes and initiatives over the years targeting both the city centre and neighbourhood areas. The Coalition government (2010â present) greatly reduced the funding available for existing programmes from 2010 and phased out the initiatives of the previous national government which impacted significantly on the cityâs ability to continue welfare projects. Devolved Decision-Making In 2003, the Labour group took a decision to devolve some services and governance; devolved decision-making at a local level or âlocalisationâ was and is seen as the most effective way of defining social problems and coming up with appropriate solutions. Localisation in this context means giving local areas more freedom to design services according to local needs and priorities, services such as leisure, housing, neighbourhood advice, libraries and youth and adult services. In the following year, the political party in control of the council changed and the governing coalition did attempt to introduce a version of devolution at various points in their administration. Alongside this, in 2005 disturbances occurred in certain areas of Birmingham partly as a result of racial tensions which resulted in the council focusing on efforts to engage certain communities with the democratic process. There was a process of capability-building to help the dialogue between the council and the affected communities to lead and shape local programmes to address social issues. It was not until 2008 though that responsibility and budgets for a number of services were devolved to district committees across the city (11 then 10). However, locally there was a view that the policy âlost its wayâ as no real decisions were made about changing the way services were delivered such as using the third sector or basing provision on established local priorities. The loss of funding from central government for neighbourhood management was seen as one of the reasons for this as these council employees based in local areas had initially supported the process. In 2010, there was a consultation about continuing with local decision-making and retaining executive powers with district committees, and all parties were keen to pursue the existing model. The Labour Party since their return to power in Birmingham has set out their intention to âreinvigorateâ localisation, and restructuring of the council included a return to having a local services directorate with a framework to deliver localisation. The aim is for 80 % of council services to sit out with the district committees. This is taking place in the context of a national government localism agenda which as one council officer stated is about âcommunity-led interventions and the state not being so necessaryâ. Social Inclusion In 2010 and 2011, a number of factors came together which led to issues of social inclusion being brought to the fore in a way they had not before.

In light of this general framework, we have demonstrated that integration is a situated and lived experience, the product of the balance between different factors. Within the same area there are places where people live together apart and places in which people conflict. These conflicts are not always between natives and immigrants, but often between groups of people with different ages. Conflict resolutions depend on the presence of individuals who are able to mediate, as was the case with the Via Montanaro gardens in Barriera di Milano or with Giardini SPA in San Paolo. Mediation works well when there is a bottom-up approach, which is implemented by people living in the territory, such as the elderly members of the Peruvian Community or mentally ill persons employed by the local association. In order to produce an enduring change in the neighbourhoods, the initiatives spontaneously generated from below need to be supported by local institutions, as was the case with the public baths. This is a place where the diversification of the differences is not a threat but a value for the area and it can become a replicable practice elsewhere. Despite these differences, both neighbourhoods seem to benefit from the strong identity and social cohesion that flourished during the industrial development, so that conflictual inter-group relations have thus far been channelled into organized solutions promoted by local institutions or citizens. Nevertheless, the leeway for managing antagonistic dynamics through formal and informal mediation seems to be decreasing due to the economic transition, the current crisis, and social changes."

By âmicrocreditâ we refer here to âmicrocredit for businesses/entrepreneursâ, although the term is normally used to designate two types of financial activities: the so-called social microcredit (mainly aimed at social inclusion of excluded subjects through the provision of financial support to their current expenditure as well as social services, training courses, etc.) and microcredit for businesses (supporting start-ups and self-employment initiatives), which obviously has different goals. The traditional microcredit target groups are highly risky and cost-intensive; as a result, commercial banks are not interested in catering to some customer segments, which thus end up being non-bankable. This means that the microcredit business is quite different from traditional banking. It includes innovative and customised elements such as different collateral requirements or no collaterals at all, as well as alternative methods for creditworthiness assessment. In many cases, microcredit is granted not only for economic reasons and/or to make a profit but also to serve a broader purpose of social cohesion by trying to reintegrate disadvantaged people into their communities (Leone and Porretta, 2014). In fact, different kinds of credit guarantee schemes, usually created with EU structural fund, support microcredit initiatives in several EU countries. As is known, under the programming period 2014â2020 of the EU structural funds, the role of the European Social Fund (ESF) is further enhanced, in the attempt to promote social inclusion and prevent and fight poverty, through the mobilisation of a number of policies dedicated to economically and socially disadvantaged individuals. Among the latter, there are longterm unemployed, people affected by disabilities, migrants, ethnic minorities â as well as new sectors of the society, such as women, young couples, single-parent families â who, until a few years ago, enjoyed conditions far from what today are perceived as severe social risks. The current economic crisis has severely hit the Italian economy and prompted policymakers to implement public policies focusing on the increasing risk of social disintegration, which is leading large sectors of the population towards a deterioration of the conditions to access fundamental citizenship rights, such as employment, housing, a satisfactory social life, territorial mobility and new technology. The need to prevent further social inequalities strongly calls for improved public policies able to identify the needs of the European population, especially those segments at risk of social exclusion, and thus implement instruments and programmes to meet such needs, starting from a solid and shared idea of European social citizenship.

Human rights also inspire citizens and states, as in Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and Zimbabwe, to adopt new rights-based constitutions to shed the legal legacy of their colonial predecessors. As also reflected in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a global consensus is emerging on human values embodied in human and constitutional rights. This is undoubtedly the worldâs most influential normative value system and yardstick to steer global and national state interventions. These trends also provide fertile ground for rightsbased freshwater governance in the broad sense, including, but not limited to, a priority for water for drinking, personal and other domestic uses and sanitation alone. In the water sector, a growing number of human rights institutions, civil society organisations and researchers have conceptualised rights-based freshwater governance and have invoked human rights frameworks in action and litigation. For example, a call for wastewater management supported the realisation of the right to sanitation. Various national and global human rights institutions, especially in Latin America, exposed major water pollution and damage by mines and exclusion from any voluntary, informed and prior consent as violation of the human right to a clean environment (WaterLex 2014). In other cases, rights to a clean environment are invoked to justify a quantitative reservation of âenvironmental flowsâ. New issues have been raised pertaining to the duty of the state to ensure flood protection and prevent soil erosion (WaterLex 2014). The past two decades have also seen a strong global move towards participation, transparency, accountability and access to information or âfree, prior and informed consentâ. In some cases of large-scale investments in dams, for example, in Latin America, human rights to participation are invoked. However, others, such as the global Water Integrity Network, aim at transparency, accountability and participation in the water sector and combating corruption as values on their own, and reference to human rights is rare. A case that is raised as a human rights issue with far-reaching implications regards the nature of private water services providersâ obligations relating to disclosure of environmental information (WaterLex 2014). Duties of the state to realise constitutional rights and international human rights that it ratified also hold for two other core mandates of the state in freshwater governance. One is public infrastructure-based service provision for productive water uses, including agriculture, mining and industries. Water volumes used for productive purposes are much higher than for domestic uses; the latter represent at the most two to three percent of total water volumes used. The state is also the primary regulatory authority, not only with responsibilities to safeguard water quality as mentioned, but also responsible for the allocation of water quantities, often as the statutory custodian of the nationâs water resources. The importance of rights-based approaches in these two core tasks of states is increasingly recognised. The Water Governance Facility of the United Nations Development Programme at Stockholm International Water Institute (WGF 2012) emphasised precisely these domains: âHuman Rights Based Approaches can be"

This is a fundamental feature of the Scandinavian citizenship model, where moving power as close as possible to the citizen is considered ideal (Hernes 1988; Andersen and Hoff 2001). Expectations of citizens, however, have been continuously growing over recent decades (Rothstein 1994, 232; Hvinden and Johansson 2007b). In the face of the documented changes in governance tools and the welfare mix, it is vital to identify how Scandinavian users of public, for-proï¬t and nonproï¬t providers differentially control their lives when they use public services. In developed welfare states, citizens have extensive interactions with welfare providers. Their ability to control their own lives in these meetings is, therefore, an important part of their citizenship (Andersen and Rossteutscher 2007). This aspect of service quality is a high priority in political documents on welfare policy in all Scandinavian countries (Rostgaard 2015, 4). The concept of active citizenship can be used to analyse the consequences of welfare policy for individuals or groups in society (Hoskins 2014; Jensen and Pfau-Efï¬nger 2005). The concept goes beyond a traditional understanding of citizenship that primarily emphasised social rights and entitlements (Marshall 1950). It emphasises possibilities for active participation through representative democracy, civil society and freedom of choice (Hvinden and Johansson 2007a). Analytically, I use the concept of active citizenship as a way of looking at the opportunities citizens have to use choice before they become users, empowerment as users at institutions and participation as users in local policy processes that frame operations at the institutions. Based on this analytic approach, the central questions of this chapter are: Do citizens exercise active citizenship differently in public, for-proï¬t and nonproï¬t service providers? if so, what can explain it? In this chapter, active citizenship is examined at institutions at the local level. Municipalities are instrumental in providing welfare services to citizens in Scandinavia to the extent that the welfare model has been said to be based on âwelfare municipalitiesâ (KrÃ¶ger 1997; KjÃ¸lsrÃ¸d 2005). I compare the experiences of users of municipal primary and"

Such policy responses were required towards the presence of de facto guest workers from (predominantly) Vietnam who had arrived during the Communist era. These were typically granted leave to remain. There was also regional migration to regulate from the Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, and the Russian Federation (ibid.), but few attempts at restriction were made. This changed once accession to the EU came into view, as Kicinger and KoryÅ (2011) show for the Polish case. Regarding third-country nationals, directives such as those on family reunification, long-term residents, and refugees had to be turned into national law. Existing migration patterns (often of a temporary nature) from eastern neighbours were not easily reconciled with the EU logic of border management, especially the Schengen Agreement. But finally border commuting could be exempted from a strict implementation of the Schengen regime (ibid.). For labour migrants from eastern neighbouring states, simplified rules were introduced in 2006 (exempting them from labour market testing) (OECD 2013, 284). Most of these workers were employed in construction and agriculture (ibid.). According to ÄanÄk and ÄiÅ¾insky (2011), reporting on the Czech experience, this happened somewhat naively and in the expectation that adopting the EU acquis would automatically mean the introduction of a comprehensive migration regime. However, the fact that this was not the case has not attracted much political attention. Since migration issues are not a salient political priority, and political parties lack distinctive positions and clear views about migration, migration policymaking has remained in the hands of specialized civil servants. Among the Central European countries, first and foremost the Czech Republic became an attractive destination for economic migration from Russia, Ukraine, and Slovakia (Drbohlav 2012, 185). In the Czech case, increasing demand for migrant labour has been documented, especially in booming areas like Prague and MladÃ¡ Bolesvav, where some authors report that the social welfare system offers insufficient motivation for unemployed Czechs to seek work (JÃ­chovÃ¡ 2005 in ÄanÄk and ÄiÅ¾insky 2011). Like most countries in the region, the Czech government has aspired to attract highly skilled migrant workers by means of a special scheme (Doomernik et al. 2009). Success, however, seems to have been limited (Drbohlav n.d.). In 2011, 244 migrants made use of the Czech scheme; 80 % of these were Ukrainian nationals (OECD 2013, 244)."

The âstudents asâ¦â formulation signals an opposition to the perceived neoliberal paradigm in higher education that constructs the relationship between students and their institutions as one of consumer and provider. In opposition to notions of consumer power are positioned ideas of democratic engagement and âempowermentâ, as in increased independence, autonomy and critical thinking on the part of students (Bovill et al. 2011a, b). This idea of student engagement in the formation of communities as partnership also can be seen in KlemenÄiÄâs (2012b) notion of national student associations as âinterest groupsâ. Within this, student associations are seen as supplying important resources in the relationship with the state, including legitimizing policies and supporting policy implementation. Student charters, the documents that set out expectations of students, institutional staff and the studentsâ union within a given institution, and that are signed by the head of the institution and the studentsâ union President, are an example of this kind of community formation work.

The participation in the process and the implementation of the DPPs and DM helped in raising awareness, identifying the gaps and building a strong foundation for stronger institutions. It required partners to look for and organize information that, until then, had never been assembled and interpreted together. The internalization of the new knowledge and the incorporation of new routines started immediately as the process commenced. These new routines and tools, information, and plans are intended to be used by the organizations beyond the scope of the DPPs/DM. The contradiction between institutional fragility (pointed to by interviewees as a challenge, as seen above) and the institutional strengthening as a benefit (as indicated by the outcomes) is in fact, two sides of the same coin. Institutional fragility has been identified as a general constraint to development in Brazil, particularly in the same regions of the country as this program (i.e., the Northeast). In the case of the DM, while the key-partners of the process, FUNCEME, INEMA, APAC, ANA, MI, and INMET are more developed and capable of acquiring knowledge from international processes, training professionals in their institutions, adapting the technology and processes to the Brazilian reality, and even advancing it much more than expected and planned, many partners in the Northeast remain in much earlier stages of development. For example, some did not have permanent personnel or appropriate equipment. Institutional fragilities are, therefore, a challenge in the process of developing a shared and voluntary permanent cooperation process that needs periodic and reliable feeding of data. Thus, the institutional strengthening appears as an absolutely critical benefit of the Drought NLTA process. Stakeholders report, in these early stages, awareness about their institutional fragilities and also a gradual shift in their perspectives, followed by changes in their practices and the institution with respect to new rules and procedures. The Drought NLTA process has also provided these professionals with concrete evidence for justifying requests to their superiors for technical and informational improvements to support the improved management of drought. Integration of Sectors States and Institutions Institutions that did not initially have much dialogue with one another were brought together, or have further tightened already existing institutional relationships through the participation in the Drought NLTA process. This integration is happening across-sectors (meteorological, agricultural and water sectors), within sectors, and between institutions (hydro-meteorological institutes, water and sanitation companies, etc.), across states, and finally, across state and federal institutions. The integrated vision of the drought and its management, along with the associated improvement of institutional capacities to deliver services were reported, as highlighted below:"
381,617,0.985,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"building professional capacity may seem high, but the cost for not doing so is far higher. States are in a critical position to ensure all students have access to high quality and effective school personnel. A first step is to support the recruitment of talented and interested people to enter the profession. Currently many young people do not see teaching as a desirable option because of a political atmosphere that seems to target teachers, relatively low pay, perceived job insecurity due to uncertain budgets and high-stakes accountability, and the poor reputation of teacher training programs.58 State political leaders can join with university presidents and others to use the bully pulpit and incentives to upgrade the quality of pre-service training and increase the attractiveness of teaching. A second step is to create the conditions for teachers and principals to grow in their jobs. High-quality mentoring in the first two years shows solid effects, and we have learned much in the past two decades about designing effective ongoing professional learning. A substantial new body of evidence, for example, indicates that both human and social capital are critical to the development of high-quality teachers and schools (Hargreaves and Fullan 2012). States can provide support to build a strong statewide infrastructure for professional development, including the creation of networks among teachers, schools, and districts. This is particularly important for low capacity and isolated regions of the state to ensure equity. Finally, a critical role for the state is to ensure equitable access for all children to high-quality teachers. Specific tenure and seniority provisions in some state laws may exacerbate the low quality and ongoing churn of educators in schools and districts serving high needs students. The recent Vergara lawsuit in California was predicated on the idea that there is a set of laws and practices that systematically ensure that poor children, on average, have the least qualified and experienced teachers.59 Whatever oneâs position is on the lawsuit per se, that the state has a role in ensuring equitable distribution of high-quality teachers should be undeniable. A first step would be to review potential disparate impact of policies currently in place and to improve working conditions in high-poverty schools. The implications of not meeting these challenges will fall most heavily on the students most in need. The well-to-do communities of the nation will not suffer from the failures to meet these human capital challenges; they will get the first choices in a tight teacher market. It is the children in the central cities, the small, poor rural communities, and in other places where there are large populations of the lowincome families that will suffer."
72,186,0.985,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"bridging the gap between welfare politics and social innovation, four points are of particular importance. First of all, it should be taken into account that many social policy textbooks have a narrow focus on just state policies, debates and decisions on reforms within state institutions, whereby societal actors are brought in through their role within social movements and pressure groups that try to influence the nature of state decisions on welfare â in other words by protest, negotiation and deliberation. However, when it comes to welfare provision (i.e., socio-economic contributions), organised societal actors often get little attention in mainstream textbooks. It is usual to find the state, the market and the family cited as the three pillars of welfare provision (e.g., Esping-Andersen, 2002). Civil society and the third sector, which contribute to new and innovative welfare arrangements not only through participation in the decision-making process but also by creating and preserving all kind of social services, are typically not mentioned. There is, therefore, a need to learn more about the history of welfare as a history of social innovations â a feature of a civil society. There has always been an important role for many social movements and organisations in inventing and creating welfare arrangements of their own â mutual organisations in the field of social security, co-operatives as early social enterprises and voluntary associations that have run all kind of services. This rich history of a social economy of invention, innovation and creation throughout Europe (Evers and Laville, 2004) was not simply a forerunner of the âreal thingâ in the form of state-based social security and service system; rather, it entailed a voluntary, not-for-profit and community sector that has, right up until the present day, included an important role for social innovation. Therefore, when discussing potential links between social innovation and welfare, welfare systems and welfare mixes (Evers and Wintersberger, 1990; Evers and Guillemard, 2012; Jenson, 2012 and in this volume) that encompass this third sector should be seen as the framework of reference and not just state action alone. Second, strategies that want to give more space for social innovation have to rethink the balance between equality and diversity. In various ways, historical welfare policies have sought to ensure greater equality in society. It is generally agreed that all people should have access to the same institutions and facilities, whether in health, social support services or education. Standards should be guaranteed in both urban and rural areas, and the same quality and procedural standards should ensure that this is always the case. This idea of equal provision was primarily linked with hierarchical systems of decision-making and administration."
99,200,0.985,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"There is a fundamental agreement about the need to increase the number of childcare places, the legitimacy of childcare outside the family and the idea of the social investment state.64 But the strategies the parties advocate to attain this aim differ, the left advocating public childcare places, funded by public taxes and standardised by public regulations and norms, including qualification criteria for its personnel, the far-right and conservative parties demanding more of a welfare mix with publicâprivate partnerships, enterprise nurseries, nannies, etc., and less state regulation. Regarding unemployment, coalitions are moving regarding secondary aspects. Traditionally, right-wing parties advocate individual responsibility and claim that it is up to the individual to adapt to structural changes in the labour market and make the main effort to (re)integrate. By contrast, left-wing parties stress structural problems, the inadequacy of the jobs on offer, and the need to reform the labour market itself, for instance by adapting it to help resolve long-term unemployment by creating a subsidised labour market for some employment areas, as was the case with the Solidarity jobs. So while the core legitimacy of the Solidarity jobs was not really questioned, the concrete application caused lively debates and disagreements inside the leftist coalition itself, mostly regarding the type of contracts and the pay. Finally the far left (including the trade unions) was and continues to be opposed to the Solidarity jobs, criticising their tendency to reduce wages and their poor working conditions. Surprisingly, the conservative and far-right parties (and the employersâ association) accepted the idea, not without difficulty, of creating this secondary labour market for long-term unemployment, but only under certain circumstances (salary below the market prices, no competition with the private sector). These two examples show us that political parties agree on the fundamental deep core of the existence of a local welfare state, which guarantees protection and help in case of need. Conflicts therefore revolve around the amount of financial assistance, for instance, or who the provider of the services should be. But we may assume that the shared deep core values are relatively stable65 and that discussions and consensus or compromise occur with respect to the policy core and especially secondary aspects. As stated above, debates take often place in pre-parliamentary arenas, as a result of which coalitions also include non-state actors. According to the previously quoted head of the Solidarity jobs, the creation of these jobs was a real partnership. Before the law was passed, we had people around the table who were in favour or against. We reflected together on what the legislation should look like. It was a first in terms of partnership (iIII/p. 8). This partnership between different stakeholders seems to indicate that political parties and civil servants in the public administration have to take associations (for"

Another reason for consensus is economic growth, important for all cities and enhancing the quality of life of residents, usually linked to social inclusion. Although social policy coordination in Birmingham is characterised by partnerships, decisions are not usually implemented without the involvement of local government. The chapter about Geneva by Patricia Naegeli shows that Genevaâs governance arrangements are built on a strong local and cantonal state that uses the support of subsidised non-profit organisations in order to implement local welfare decisions. In the Swiss context, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, this is quite an exception. It can be explained by a strong public administration that influences all local welfare decisions in a conservative way and the presence of a relative consensus among political forces to have âgenerousâ social policies. Yet since the 2000s, newcomer parties have challenged political stability and long-lasting conflicting debates within the city council and the cantonal parliament. Both the influence of neighbouring France, where social policies are centralised and state-oriented and the strong economy of Geneva that can finance âgenerousâ social measures are part of the explanation. However, in the governance of social challenges, social innovation tends to be incremental, and seems to happen within the public sector or at least, under the guidance of the local or cantonal state. Milan, the focus of the chapter by Giuliana Costa, Roberta Cucca and Rossana Torri, can be described as a city lost in transition. For more than two decades, Milan has been ruled by a strongly market-oriented system of governance, following the rhetoric that creating a âgood business climateâ is not only an effective way to foster growth and innovation, but also to eradicate poverty and to deliver higher standards of living. This approach has led to (a) a disinvestment in welfare services directly provided by the municipality, in favour of a more residual welfare system based on non-profit and private involvement and (b) a huge investment in neo-liberal tools of government for the economic development of the city, such as the promotion of international events (Expo2015) and large real estate investments through publicâprivate partnerships. After some scandals as well as a huge increase of social inequalities, municipal elections rewarded a new coalition following a style of governance oriented to a social innovation approach. However, the difficult financial situation of the municipality has reduced ambitions of the current government. The chapter by Benjamin Ewert on Berlin shows that for a long time the city benefitted immensely from the myth to be âpoor but sexyâ. The popular slogan, referring to the coexistence of impoverishment and creativity in the city, expressed very well the Berlin Zeitgeist promising âa good life for little moneyâ. Hence the city has been a home for creative workers, artists, cosmopolitans and young people from all over the world, literally speaking âchange agentsâ that sustainably co-designed Berlin as a place for unconventional life styles and innovative solutions for everyday challenges. This chapter argues, however, that Berlinâs sources for innovative capital may dry up in the near future due to the re-emergence of social challenges that tend to eclipse the improvements emanating from social innovations. There are very different ways of giving innovatory practices and organisations a preliminary place in the architecture of public policies and forms of governance. A new system"

2,29,0.985,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"Outline of the Book and Its Chapters To answer the question about the importance of the use of market-emulating governance tools and changes in the mix of welfare service providers, we compare between countries; between nonproï¬t, for-proï¬t and public sectors; and between schools and elderly care as different service and policy areas, each with different governance models. We focus on how different ways of organising services on different levels of the Scandinavian welfare system affect the users in order to reveal which factors may promote active citizenship. We have selected cases that will allow for comparison across the three analytic dimensions: 1. Country: Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Traditionally, within the Scandinavian model, Sweden and Norway have focused on strengthening the legal rights of citizens as users, while Denmark has in addition actively used nonproï¬t actors to enhance user choice as a tool for citizen empowerment (Andersen and Hoff 2001). Lately, there has been some convergence, as all countries have prioritised more user choice (Segaard 2015, and Chap. 3) despite more divergence in the composition of the welfare mix (Sivesind, this volume). Since 2000, Sweden has moved towards empowerment through marketisation, with a rapidly growing for-proï¬t share in the welfare mix. In this way, one could say that the three Scandinavian countries currently have three different strategies when it comes to the promotion of active citizenship (Sivesind 2013, and Chap. 2). The three Scandinavian countries thus represent some interesting institutional differences regardless of similar welfare ideals. Methodologically, comparisons between the countries are useful for assessing under what circumstances the conclusions may have relevance. 2. Institutional sector: public, nonproï¬t and for-proï¬t providers. Does it make a difference which of them provides services? It is still an open question whether traditional coordination by municipalities, reforms promoting user choice or marketisation is the best-suited means to achieve active citizenship."

However, as noted previously, national border barriers still exist, and are particularly evident in developing nations such as China and India. Global businesses must understand differences in business environment that are significantly different from their home countries, and overcome them or use local environments to their benefit to capture attractive markets that exist on the other side of these barriers, as is the case with offshore software development. With that in mind, we review strategy designing theories. Finally, we examine corporate management strategy in case of global expansion. Specifically, we focus on the headquartersâ level of control in overseas operations. Corporate activities integrated on a global level require a certain level of control of overseas entities. However, the presence of national barriers indicates that there are management methods appropriate to business environments in which overseas entities operate. Thus, it is often more effective to delegate everyday operations to local entities. This chapter minutely analyzes the balance between headquarter control and local autonomy. Japanese corporations exert a stronger level of headquartersâ control compared with their western counterparts. In addition to international comparisons, I-R grid framework and current state of affairs are examined."

Existing alternative modes of accumulation and accommodating formal and informal distribution (sometimes corruption) must be legalised. With regard to enhancing (social) security, typical female solidarity can be formalised as an alternative to individual interest, which often leads to a lack of accumulation or hiding wealth. Women are addressed by economic policy either as groups, doing work âcollectivelyâ, such as on fields of the second best quality without permanent title deeds. Or they are seen as independent entrepreneurs, sometimes considered to be rich by illegal means (like Mama Benz in West Africa), but often discriminated against because of a lack of formal credentials and forced to enter the shadow economy of corruption and even sexual dependency. There are already transnational networks developing approaches to social economy/Ã©conomie solidaire that elaborate new forms of saving and credit, new forms of collective social security, and new formalised group/collective forms of women engaging economic activities, thereby regularising institutions of access to land, irrigation and the production of handicrafts. Regarding engendering social and economic policies, appropriate forms of formal solidarity are to be negotiated in the public sphere at the state level, the third sector, or the family/individual. As a result, the common good will be newly negotiated and defined in a gendered manner, including public policies and social services. Responsibility and burden sharing (cost recovery) must be reformed. Not only should state or private suppliers of services be considered, but the third sector (NGO) should also be consolidated. Engendering economic and social dynamic transformation means supporting new creative approaches that may already exist, including the pluralism of solutions and intermediary structures. The question is whether we want to formalise all fields or if we can safeguard a strong communal and translocal care economy, which would be based on gender relations and justice.

Communities with the most valuable forest assets and good organization showed remarkable achievements. They reinvested most of their proï¬ts from forest businesses in improved forest-management systems, building and providing for the maintenance of forest roads. They also acquired industrial equipment, and organized their own technical and administrative teams. Not only did forestry provide employment and income to local residents but its proï¬ts were invested in local public goods: schools, clinics, community celebrations, roads and transport. Some communities adopted environmental agendas to promote sustainable harvests, minimize environmental impacts and diversify forest use. Since the 1990s a group of communities were granted forest certiï¬cation under the Forest Stewardship Council scheme. There are currently 39 certiï¬ed community forests in Mexico, amounting to 655,206 Ha.13 These successful forms of community forest management created local incentives for conservation, improved quality of life in marginalized regions, and favoured democratic governance of forest commons. Some certiï¬ed communities have even gained international recognition.14 The experience of the ejidos of southern Quintana Roo was replicated in the neighbouring tropical forests of PetÃ©n-Guatemala, where Mexicans trained local user groups and thus supported the establishment of community forestry operations. Sustainable forest management and production â one of the strategies proposed to halt deforestation â require coherent and continuous long-term support to local users. However, government support for community forestry faded during the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the implementation of NAFTA, the national market was abruptly opened and community producers were unable to compete with US and Canadian forest producers. At the same time, the over-regulation of forest activities by the Mexican state led to high transaction costs. Finally, subsidies for tropical agricultural, cattle holding15 and the extension of illegal logging led to the disruption of some community forestry initiatives during that period.16 NAFTA therefore put pressure on the productive initiatives of forest communities. While some exportoriented subsectors in agriculture, manufacturing and services beneï¬ted, many small and medium-sized (urban and rural) businesses failed in the absence of policies to protect and promote their productivity and competitiveness."

They have turned to social entrepreneurs to alter patterns of demand and supply in labour markets. The hope is to improve labour supply by funding and promoting social enterprises engaged in training and retraining the hard-to-employ, those excluded from the labour market or those without the necessary skills. Social policy communities have also sought to increase demand for workers by supporting the creation of many types of social enterprises that provide, often in the welfare and environmental sectors, for needs that go unmet or services that are not equally accessible when only commercial firms are active in their provision. They have also turned to social entrepreneurs to provide the key services identified by the social investment perspective for modern social policy. These are not only employment services but also childcare that serves the double function of enabling parental labour market participation and, even more importantly from this perspective, adequate investments in human capital from the pre-school years onwards via accessible and high-quality early education and care. Social innovations, especially social entrepreneurship and quasimarkets, are now and increasingly presented as positive ways to do social interventions, avoiding the limits of both âbig businessâ driven by profitseeking and âbig governmentâ driven by the practices and controls of Weberian-style public administrations. Thus, as the claims increasingly go, effective social investments will be more likely, at least to be identified and first implemented, if they are left to these market-making and market-modelled innovators. A range of mechanisms and policy instruments have been deployed across different jurisdictions, but many share the characteristic that they allow the market corner of the welfare diamond to expand by becoming more active in the provision of services. One key way that this move has been undertaken â usually at the local level â is by providing public funds for provision of what might have been or used to be public services. Thus, community-based social entrepreneurs have increasingly provided employment integration services or immigration integration services which in the past â if provided â were usually public. Similarly, as childcare services have increased significantly in number and the amount of public spending on them has risen concomitantly, the dominant position of public provision has given way to a multitude of market-based actors often operating as social enterprises in many countries. Such changes constitute significant change in the relations between state and civil society and within civil society itself."
293,103,0.985,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","The timing of the development of integration policies has also been influenced by such conceptions of citizenship. For states in North-Western Europe that relied on exclusive notions of nationhood, it took a very long time to acknowledge the permanent character of migration. In Germany, for instance, the presence of nonGerman immigrants remained ignored until 2001, when a government-appointed committee concluded that migration henceforth should be actively promoted. Other countries in the region recognized relatively early on that what had seemed to be temporary migration had turned into long-term settlement. They, hence, developed integration policies and sought to limit discriminatory effects of immigration law by offering ways towards rapid naturalization. Two countries that had formulated early responses towards the settlement of non-nationals were the Netherlands and Sweden. In the Dutch case, from 1980 onward the government pursued an active integration policy whereby the precise definition of who was targeted by the policy evolved in sync with overall societal evolution. Elsewhere, realization of the permanent character of migrant settlement did not lead to formal integration policy; rather, integration was addressed under general welfare policies or shaped by less formalized arrangements and implemented by non-state actors. Even in states that adopted explicit integration policies, the general institutional framework shaped the socio-economic integration of immigrants. Particularly, the welfare regime (and the corresponding economic-industrial configuration and type of labour market) together with immigration law have proven crucial for the position of immigrants. While the residential and legal status of immigrants determines, directly and indirectly, their access to public welfare and to the labour market as long as they remain foreigners, the distinct welfare regime in place shapes both the opportunity of access and the form and extent of benefits (Dorr and Faist 1997; Morissens and Sainsbury 2005). The systems that provide more extensive coverage for immigrants are the universal ones that include the whole residential population, like those in Scandinavian countries and, in some policy areas, in other countries (such as old-age pensions in the Netherlands and health care in Spain and the UK). Insurance systems based on contributions during times of regular employment, typical of conservative-corporatist welfare states like Germany, France, and the Benelux, tend to exclude some migrant categories from benefits. Among the selective security systems typical of liberal welfare states, such as the UK and Ireland, coverage for immigrants very much depends on the degree of governmental regulation of the market. With time, some states that had previously excluded migrants from formal (i.e., legal) participation opened up by offering ius soli and relaxed conditions for naturalization, whereas others that were previously relatively open, started to become less inclusive in legal terms, matched by more assimilationist conceptions of âintegrationâ. Obtaining permanent residency status has in some cases been made conditional on fulfilling such integration requirements. The Dutch pioneered testing of language skills before a visa is granted to spouses seeking to join their husband or wife in the Netherlands. Upon arrival, substantial language proficiency must be demonstrated.

Finally, we examine local government partnerships. As discussed in Chap. 5, overseas infrastructure development operations often take the form of Publicâ Private Partnerships (PPPs), in which a government and a private industry jointly manage operations that have been the domain of local governments in the past. In emerging countries, many Western companies aggressively participate in infrastructure operations such as water distribution, railways, and roadways. Moreover, there has been a lag in Japanese companiesâ participation; however, the Japanese government has recently taken measures to encourage âinfrastructure exports.â Currently, these infrastructure operations in emerging markets have gained momentum from both public and private sectors. As an example of an alliance with government or public institutions, we discuss infrastructure operations and deepen our understanding of management issues specific to PPPs which are different from alliances between private corporations."
38,570,0.985,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.3.1 Pan-Arctic Arctic ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are experiencing growing pressure from various stressors (e.g., development, climate change, contaminants). However, established research and monitoring programs have remained largely uncoordinated, and therefore lack the ability to effectively monitor, understand and report on biodiversity trends at the pan-Arctic or regional scale (MA 2005). The maintenance of healthy arctic ecosystems is a global imperative, as the Arctic plays a critical role in the Earthâs physical, chemical and biological balance. A coordinated and comprehensive effort for monitoring Arctic ecosystems is needed to facilitate effective and timely conservation and adaptation actions. While all Arctic states, as well as a number of non-Arctic states and organisations, conduct monitoring of various elements of Arctic biodiversity, the lack of coordination has limited their geographic, thematic, and temporal scope and are not evenly spread across the Arctic. In particular, northern areas of Canada, Greenland and Russia have very limited biodiversity monitoring, whereas areas in northern Scandinavia, the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands and Iceland have relatively intense, on-going biodiversity monitoring (Fig. 13.4) and in many cases, long-term datasets. Given that the area in question is 32 million km2 (three times the size of Europe) and is comprised of largely remote and extreme ecosystems, it is not surprising that current biodiversity monitoring efforts are seen as inadequate. Indeed, recent issues regarding state ï¬nances and priorities have made it more difï¬cult to sustain even existing efforts. The current situation facing the Arctic demands a well-designed, scaled, pan-arctic, ecosystem-based approach that not only identiï¬es trends in biodiversity, but also identiï¬es underlying causes of these trends. It is critical that this information be made available, as plans for adaptation and mitigation need development, which ultimately depend on rigorous, integrated and efï¬cient monitoring programs that have the power to detect change within a âmanagementâ time frame. To meet these challenges, the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Working Group of the Arctic Council launched the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program (CBMP) in 2005. The CBMP is working with over 80 global partners in building the capacity to expand, integrate and enhance existing Arctic biodiversity monitoring efforts, thus facilitating more rapid detection, communication and response to signiï¬cant trends and pressures. It is strategically linked to a"

Participants are supposed to become more job-ready by actively taking part in courses or educational programmes and by getting used to a work rhythm. Furthermore, they sell products or offer services together with other participants in order to raise money that is invested in the programme itself. This means that a highly active role of participants is expected. For the municipality of Nijmegen, the new policy of work corporations represents a radical shift: from providing subsidised jobs towards co-produced activation. This chapter investigates the origins of this shift and the current organisation and functioning of work corporations. YEER (Youth Enterprise and Employment Rehearsal) in Birmingham, which Nadia Brookes, Jeremy Kendall and Lavinia Mitton have analysed, was set up by The Future Melting Pot, a community interest company, to provide business support to black and minority ethnic young people who were not in employment, education or training. The main aim was to enable participants to set up their own enterprises. The project included training, support and access to accredited advisors. The approach was innovative in that it offered young people an alternative to the conventional focus on getting a job by providing the opportunity to explore the option of self-employment in an environment that was needs-led. The approach could be described as intensive, personalised support to stimulate entrepreneurialism and an example of integrating economic and social domains. Nadia Brookes, Jeremy Kendall and Lavinia Mitton also discuss the locality approach to worklessness in Birmingham, an approach to tackling worklessness developed by the city. It was locality driven and focused on areas where worklessness was high. Detailed consultation took place to agree on neighbourhood employment and skills plans and services commissioned on that basis. It also had a strong client focus adopting an Integrated Employment and Skills model. The aim of the model was to offer a continuous service, incorporating the provision of targeted action and support that each individual required no matter which provider they accessed. It enabled an in-depth understanding of issues for local residents where worklessness was high, provided the opportunity for provider organisations to work together for the first time and the development of small-scale innovative projects. Key was agreement of the major players in the local welfare system and their signing up to the model. Andrea Walter and Danielle Gluns discuss innovations in childcare in MÃ¼nster. The general orientation in MÃ¼nster is collaborative. As such, local elites utilise networks and resources in order to put their ideas into practice. The chapter outlines the implementation of prevention visits as an example for the use of expertise, political connections and negotiating skills. The head of the Youth Officeâwho initiated the visitsâis very well connected in the city and used these networks in order to improve local child protection. The chapter shows how structures and individual agents act in synchronism with regards to childcare policy as to obtain the observed outcomes.

Moreover, the loss of power on behalf of Western developed countries through such regionalization and fragmentation of the old international economic order has equally reinforced their anxieties in respect of the norms that shall govern economic and political life in those new constellations and within regional settings. An erosion of environmental and social standards by Chinaâs new ï¬nancial vehicles may further open the door for defeatism and a human rights fatigue within the minds of Western policy-makers. Nonetheless, through its relational governance China has sought to maintain the interconnectivity between Asia and other regionsâin spite of the multipolar rather than fragmented world order. From its point of view, the world is still and should stay globalized. Its political discourse of mutual beneï¬t and common development aims to give it the legitimacy to shape the international economic order and gradually give content to the right to development that constitutes the latterâs legal basis at the same time. While its operationalization leans more towards a collective dimension, over the course of time and in space, close collaborationâin accordance with the principle of sovereign equalityâbetween the members of developed and developing nations within the AIIB could increase trust and conï¬dence in the very processes that are aimed at negotiating socio-economic arrangements that will not only determine the nature of the right to development but also to the scope of their relationship and vis-Ã -vis outsiders too, such as other international and regional development banksâincluding the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. It is within such set of complex relationships and exchange between share- and stakeholders that cooperation will be indispensable to the discharge of mandates of the respective development banks to ï¬nance development projects in Asia and beyond. A genuine dialogue on the operational and ï¬nancial policies that should guide the implementation of environmental and social standards must equally accept ânew cultural and political perspectivesâ as Kishore Mahbubani would argue.52 The normativity of international human and environmental rights depends on the evolution of the relationship between the mixed membership of the AIIB that underpins their creation, development and interpretation and application in the ï¬rst place within a regional setting at a given moment in time. Therefore, according to TORNIL, the universalist v. relativist debate on human rights protection regarding Chinaâs new development banks in Asia can be transcended when taking the development of the relationship of the members of the banks rather than their competing interests as the starting point of the discussionâwithout a dialogue between them there can be no room to ï¬nd a common understanding on human rights protection in the ï¬rst place."
380,215,0.985,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"The gradual process of creating the framework for the communal councils in the 2006 law can be read as a radicalization on the governmentâs part of the expansion of popular power as well as a pragmatic assimilation of past experiences. In 2002, the government had passed the Law for Local Councils for Public Planning (Consejos Locales de PlanificaciÃ³n Publica or CLPP). The law promoted popular participation in the planning, allocation and execution of public local budgets at the municipality and parish level. In 2005, the government passed the Organic Law for Municipal Public Power (Ley OrgÃ¡nica del Poder PÃºblico Municipal). None of these reforms proved successful in promoting popular participation and mobilization at the grassroots level (Wilpert 2011). People recall that participatory attempts were co-opted or stalled by political figures and brokers at the municipal- and parish level, at the same time as people were getting more experienced in organizing and identifying needs in their immediate communities. This required a new political and legal mechanism that channeled resources directly into what people themselves considered a socio-spatial organizational forum."

NGOs are, broadly speaking, not a network capable of safeguarding the human rights of peoples (Ong 2006). However, their unquestioned acceptance of such a limited definition of citizenship has resulted in NGOsâ intensifying their position as service-providers to migrants, rather than as representatives of migrants in legal and social processes that define social belonging and economic distribution (Fraser 2003). This has consequently restricted the scope of their activities and their potential as advocates. Furthermore, this positioning of NGOs as service-providers rather than critical advocates has confirmed the Chilean stateâs approach to individual responsibility and autonomy in the resolution of migrantsâ needs and demands. This becomes particularly relevant in the case of Peruvian migration to Chile, which involves a great number of women. Women migrants are mostly segregated into care work, a low-status position in the occupational hierarchy, which tends to reproduce their social and economic marginalization in Chile. In addition, Peruvian migrantsâ life conditions and trajectories are shaped by their limited access to social resources on the grounds that they âlack citizenshipâ and experience liminal legality (Mora 2008, 2009). Our critique of traditional notions of citizenship espoused by Chilean NGOs is intended to shed light on alternative models of representation that would broaden the service approach of NGOs to one of informed advocacy for the rights of migrants. In reaching these findings, we draw on research carried out in Santiago de Chile between 2008 and 2009 and on interviews with thirty-five key informants from organizations which provide at least one service to immigrants, in order to explore the constraints placed on NGOs should they ultimately fulfil a more prominent advocacy role."
277,252,0.985,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"9.1 Introduction Despite Austriaâs long standing history as a multi-ethnic and pluri-religious country, Austrian policymakers and the public tend to experience migration and integration as a novel phenomenon. Discourse on the âintegrationâ1 of migrants ranks high on the political agenda and is fiercely disputed in society, with a particular focus on perceptions of migrants as âunintegratedâ. Thus, to understand migrant integration in Austria, three contextual aspects appear to be crucial: first, there is a âlack of integrationâ widely attributed to migrants and their offspring. About two thirds of Austrian citizens are dissatisfied with the integration of migrants who, in contrast, feel integrated in Austria and support âAustrianâ values and life style (Statistik Austria 2011). Second, attention is directed both in the public imagination and in political measures at migrants from Turkey and the former Yugoslavia, while the major immigrant group by far is constituted by Germans (Statistik Austria 2012). Third, one may observe a tendency in data collection to follow â and therefore reinforce â the dominant perception of migrant integration in Austria. Indeed, the Austrian Statistical Yearbook on Migration and Integration, which measures integration achievements for several key indicators such as education and"
181,158,0.985,Global Perspectives On Recognising Non-Formal and informal Learning : Why Recognition Matters (Volume 21.0),"4.3.4 Targeting Socio-cultural and Educational Inequalities as well as Poverty Directly The potential contribution of RVA in closing the gap that exists between the education opportunities of a diverse range of groups in society is another theme that occurs in policy and practice in both developing and developed countries. In many developing countries, where qualifications and certificates are highly valued, tackling educational disparity is an important element in seeking to redress broader structural and economic inequality. In developed countries, too, recognition plays an important role in closing the gap between different sections of the community, particularly immigrant groups, indigenous populations, rural groups and those trapped in the poverty cycle. In the context of post-conflict societies, the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR (Kirk 2009) sees RVA as an essential tool for displaced persons and refugees â children, young people and adults â to record what they have learned or their prior learning and results obtained. UNHCR calls for the right of access to examination or assessment processes that are validated by the relevant authority or educational institution, for displaced persons and refugees to continue, resume and complete schooling, as well as to attain access to further learning opportunities and employment opportunities (Kirk 2009). In South Africa, one of the purposes of RVA specifically promoted by trade unions is redress for past and present discriminatory practices. This policy objective is reflected in the countryâs skills development agenda, which aims to contribute to a better educated, more skilled and more efficient workforce, and development for workers (SAQA 2012a). RVA helps to identify skills gaps that may be compensated for by education and training (Samuels 2013). In the Philippines, clients of the non-formal/informal education programme are mostly illiterates and school leavers from elementary and secondary schools. They come from marginalised and depressed communities in both rural and urban areas, penal and rehabilitation institutions, remote and otherwise inaccessible regions, areas of armed conflict, and indigenous communities, etc. This group represents 45 % of the Philippine population, or some 40 million persons. Some ALS clients are of school-age (6â15 years) but most are older (15C). They generally want to participate in the programmes and consider ALS as a âsecond chanceâ education. The support for learners in the above programmes includes: recognition/certification of learning by NGOs and community centres; CD modules and workbooks; a tracking system (for NFE A&E learners); livelihood projects and microfinance; leadership training; and a referral system for graduates/completers operated by NGOs. Mexico is a culturally and linguistically diverse nation (the country has 62 ethnic Mesoamerican language groups). It is a country with low completion rates at the basic education level as well as low literacy levels. In Mexico there are over 34 million people over the age of fifteen years who have not completed their basic education (Castro Mussot and de Anda 2007). Demographic features such as a"

In most cases, mayors enjoy great closeness to their citizens and occupy an important position in communicating with the local community. Moreover, their close ties with the electorate result in a comparatively high confidence of the population in local government (Steininger 2006). Considering this framework of competences, we deduce that the disparity in the decision-making process on the one hand and the local responsibility for integration tasks on the other motivates municipal protest activities. Moreover, this gap provides incentives for institutional actors to express resistance against decisions of the upper levels of government in order to demonstrate solidarity with the local constituency."

106,237,0.985,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Conclusions This paper provides an update on the results of the PREDICATE project of DG ECHO and focuses to the possible extension of the use of UAS for improving public safety based on the strengthening of community policing capabilities. As described in the above sections, one of the major outcomes of the project is a mission and path planning utility, which can be uploaded by community policing control centers to a variety of UAS and allow them to perform mission specific flights over specific sites of interest. Using the developments of PREDICATE and the appropriate payloads the UAS can be used for scanning the region for search and rescue purposes, aiming to detect, recognize and identify missing persons and abandoned objects, persons in trouble due to criminal activity or entrapped people. Such tools (as of PREDICATE) and UAS (especially small ones such as quadcopters) can be a great asset either for civil protection or law enforcement agencies, while serving the community. The aforementioned capabilities can provide improved operational preparedness, reduced response time and increased information and data flow from the incident scene, combined also with the ability of automatic mission deployment. The burst of the UAS market and their use by volunteers and hobbyists can be exploited in context of community policing for strengthening the efficiency of law enforcement in a continuously threatened European society. It must be considered though by the operating authorities, that procedural justice, transparency, and accountability should be maintained, and that they are responsible of balancing the benefits of such technologies with the preservation of community privacy, safety, and other concerns. Acknowledgments This work has been partially funded from the European Unionâs Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection project âPREDICATEâ under grant agreement ECHO/SUB/2015/713851/PREV29."

The administrator of Debub Omo Zone, in an interview for Fortune magazine, stated: We granted the land to the company along the Omo valley, which is the most suitable area for the plantation of palm oil, to encourage investors to come to the region with the prospect of exploiting this huge potential. Dasanech village settlements and lands listed in Table 7.4 were among those expropriated by the GOE, according to local resident reporting to SONT researchers, mostly during late 2012 and early 2013. â¢ The GOEâs planning and impact assessment documents describe agricultural development plans as part of âcommunity development and âsocial servicesâ provisionâa clear misrepresentation of the reality of the lowermost Omo region as well as GOE policies. The following false statements in the GOEâs downstream impact assessment (GOE 2009) reflect this misrepresentation. The following examples of such statements by EEPCO ofï¬cials illustrates GOE fabrication of its development plans for the âbeneï¬tâ of the Dasanech. â¢ The South Omo project area is âhardly inhabited at all except at a widely scattered pattern,â and that the population density âat the South Omo project site is below ï¬ve persons per square kilometer.â12 To the contrary, SONT researchers documented thousands of Dasanech living in major village complexes along the west shore of the Omo River riverine zone in proximity to one another, as indicated in Fig. 7.14. This condition is manifest, even to the casual observer visiting the riverside zone. â¢ The government âwill not displace a single person involuntarily in Gambella, or elsewhere within the country.â Firsthand accounts by Dasanech elders, describing their evictions from settlements and lands (Table 6.4), directly contradict the governmentâs assertions. â¢ An irrigated land of 0.75 ha of land each is prepared for 2050 households. There will not be any land scarcity for any family with a capacity to produce more. Training on improved agronomy practices, technology inputs and livestock management including rangeland will be provided. This statement is also false. The communities listed in Table 7.4 are among those whose riverside farming areas or settlement areas have been expropriated. While thousands of villagers are expropriated with nowhere to go, the GOE frequently speaks of âproviding employmentâ for the local population. A very few Dasanech are incorporated into selected commercial farms, they are in essence wage labor, not âparticipantsâ in local cooperative or community based development. SONT investigation of two major expropriation/farm establishments on the west bank, for example, revealed that only 20 to 30 young men were hired while hundreds of villagers were sent away. â¢ The Ethiopian government consistently describes its âconsultationâ with local communities participatory. Dasanech elders, however, consistently report that, the Ethiopian government has forcefully ordered them to vacate many of their different their village locales, as well as major grazing and recession agriculture lands. â¢ Development bank documents refer to the consultations carried out by the GOE, but these rely entirely on the GOEâs description of its actions, not that of local residents. â¢ A culture of fear prevails among Dasanech villages. Omorate based GOE militia and security personnel take repressive, even violent measures against individuals and groups protesting their eviction and expropriation. â¢ Villagersâ acts of resistanceâeven questioning, have been met with swift and sometimes violent action by police or militia."

Following numerous failed attempts to create a common energy policy framework prior to 2007, the Commission has ensured that energy poverty forms an important strand of the now wide-ranging EU action in energy. As in all areas of EU policy, the Commission acts as the primary agenda-setter in energy policy, initiating and drafting legislation but restrained in its financial and administrative resources, as well as its legal mandate (Birchfield, 2011). The individual DGs are also important for expanding and developing energy poverty policy and have been relatively effective in framing and defining it as a problem which should be dealt with by the DGs for environment, health, consumers and, to some extent, foreign relations, in addition to DG Energy. Implementation of the various instruments and legislation has also been supported by DG Competition, which has stepped in when Member States have not fully transposed IEM rules or implemented other energy regulations. Support with enforcement has also been received from the Court of Justice in its role as adjudicator on infringement proceedings brought against national governments. While the Commission has carefully balanced its energy policy goals with its constitutional asymmetry and need to achieve sufficient member state support, other EU institutions have been outspoken about the necessity of a coherent EU energy poverty policy. Both the European Parliament and the EESC have made bold statements about the social dimension of energy poverty, the pan-European nature of the problem, the lack of sufficient action on the part of Member States and the need for the EU to exercise its indirect influence in spite of its competence weakness. This impetus for greater EU involvement is supported by the research and resources gathered by the various platforms and stakeholder groups at the EU level. Bodies such as the CEF and the VCWG have been instrumental in making available the kind of background research on existing practice and areas for improvement called for in early energy"
277,507,0.985,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"units in other integration policy fields are sidetracked â as the discussion on the radicalisation strategy illustrated â researchers in this particular field are kept in the dialogue. Until 2011 there was no ministry for housing or housing policies in Denmark and the policies were therefore made through cooperation between different ministries, with the Ministry of Integration holding a central role. In 2011 the new government established the Ministry of Housing, Urban and Rural Affairs, which now holds responsibility for segregated urban areas. In October 2010 the government launched a new action plan, which led both to political discussions and also to an increasing discrepancy between the policy and research communities (Regeringen 2010b). Framing ghettos more as a cultural problem than a social problem situated the ghetto-problem in a value-based policy area as distinct from evidence-based or research-informed policymaking. The action plan provides the first actual definition of the problem based on three criteria: a high proportion of residents without labour market attachment (<40 %); a high proportion of immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries (<50 %); a high proportion of residents with criminal records (<270 convicted out of 10,000 residents) (Regeringen 2010b). If an area was characterised by two out of three markers it was by definition a ghetto. Making ethnicity and culture the basis for ghetto problems implied that the traditional sociopolitical measures couldnât be of any use here. Moreover the solutions mentioned focused mainly on control, law enforcement and demolition of parts of the ghettoes, dismantling the physical space, and less on changing the composition or social space. John Andersen contends that two minor proposals followed the recommendations of the SLIB group; a proposal for preventative removal of families with serious social problems and a proposal on employment initiatives in the segregated areas. Both suggestions were framed differently from SLIBs suggestions however, and overall the policy instruments and solutions outlined in the action plan were not aligned with previous suggestions and recommendations. More problematic, however, is the ghetto definition itself as it is difficult to see the valid causality between unemployment, ethnic composition and crime rates. John Andersen describes the action plan as driven by ideological reasons rather than research findings.7 It overemphasised the explanatory power of ethnicity and thereby stood in stark contrast to SBiâs findings. Generally most experts in the field are critical of the new strategy (Lehmann and MÃ¸ller 2010) and their recommendations on how to deal with the problem of segregation are very different from the governmentsâ strategy (MÃ¸ller 2010). The former chairman for the Program Committee JÃ¸rgen Nue MÃ¸ller tried to rearticulate the old policy-frame on integration and criticised the government for being too passive and not following the recommendations of the Committee (JyllandsPosten 11 February 2010; Programstyrelsen 2008).

As elsewhere in the world, HEIs in Kyrgyzstan are poised between âdifferentiation and complianceâ in the âsearch for legitimacyâ that will âmake themselves different to elude competitionâ (Fumasoli and Huisman 2013, 160). Yet for individual institutions, within this general context, differentiation, diversification, and market-led specialization are primarily a strategy for survival. As the public budget for higher education has been reduced and HEIs are forced to recruit greater numbers of fee-paying students in order to survive and thrive, they are under pressure to diversify and commodify the form and substance of their activities often regardless of whether such quantitative expansion enhances or damages the quality of educational activities and relationships. In this sense, they follow a familiar cross-national pattern in which universities are âcompelledâ¦to start positioning themselves, by constructing portfolios through setting priorities and a more explicit focus on specific competenciesâ (Fumasoli and Huisman 2013, 157, ADB 2004). However, as illustrated by the ballooning of student applications for and programs dedicated to âmarket-oriented disciplinesâ promising (often elusive) individual return and the simultaneous difficulty of recruiting and retaining students to government scholarship-funded programs in core fields such as teacher training, this process in Kyrgyzstan may be more akin to âtraditional positioning in for-profit sectorsâ (ibid., 160; Amsler 2011). In a competitive context where the most marketable niche to occupy is the capacity to occupy a range of marketable niches, the institutions with the greatest resources to do soâaccumulated historically, by association with governmental and international power, or through reputation and prestigeâhave the most capacity for differentiating themselves strategically. This, in addition to the traditional forces of state and market, may have a significant impact on the further development of Kyrgyzstanâs higher education landscape for the foreseeable future."
334,14,0.985,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"of the academic literature has concentrated on individual country studies and has mostly considered one type of protest (della Porta and Diani 2006). Moreover, as Accornero and Fillieule (2016, 9) have highlighted, the main focus is on progressive or left-wing mobilization, which is being examined using the instruments of protest and social movement research. Only recently has scholarship also started to employ these tools to investigate conservative or right-wing mobilization. To date, restrictionist mobilization has predominantly been investigated using lines of thought borrowed from the study of right-wing and populist political parties (Caiani et al. 2012). Hence, broader comparisons which take into account the role of different political environments, different national and local contexts, as well as observations of different types of resistance are considered a research lacuna. This is the point at which this book steps in. The volume deals with contestation and demands around asylum and deportation through the âunconventional toolâ of protest. The main research questions the chapters attempt to answer are how and why protest occurs in these fields, how actors engage with and resist the forceful removal of non-citizens on the one hand, and how actors resist the reception of asylum seekers on the other. Based on comparative approaches across time, political space, and various types of protests, as well as on in-depth case studies, the individual chapters provide insights into ongoing mobilization and resistance within civil society. They cover struggles for and by, but also against, the rights and needs of asylum seekers. Special attention is given, first, to organizational aspects and constellations of actors within diverse networks and, second, to the interactions between protesters and state actors. In more theoretical terms, the book deals, on the one hand, with the power of civil society and individuals, citizens and non-citizens, as well as with various cycles of policymaking in asylum and deportation; on the other hand, it covers the limitations of a liberal stateâs coercive capacity to control borders and to make decisions about non-citizens who may stay within its territory. Classical studies of deportation regimes frame resistance against forced removals as a âcontentious relationship between sovereignty, space, and the freedom of movement.â (Peutz and De Genova 2010, 2)."
61,60,0.985,Mergers and Alliances in Higher Education : international Practice and Emerging Opportunities,"The shift towards concentrating resources and supporting a few pockets of excellence should also be seen in the context of a shift of power from the central to the regional governments in France. The gradual devolution of power toward regional governments meant that these became increasingly sensitive to the need to have a regional knowledge strategy. Those regional governments with a good tax base and strong universities (that produced the regional political elite) were well placed to provide funding instruments to their knowledge institutions, thus also contributing to diversification and rivalry from a national perspective. Increasingly, the regional governments learnt how to support their universities to the point that some wanted to go so far as defining the universitiesâ strategy. This prompted the then minister for higher education and research (Laurent Wauquiez) and the then director for higher education (Patrick Hetzel) to warn the university presidents during their 2012 annual colloquium about the danger of âglisser dâune tutelle a lâautreâ, i.e. the risk of losing the hard-earned autonomy that had been bestowed by the central government in exchange for less autonomy vis-a-vis the regional governments. The tension between the central and regional governments was exacerbated during the Sarkozy era because the vast majority of regional governments were in the hands of the Socialist Party. This also had consequences for higher education, particularly in the Paris region, where some projects became hostage to fortune. For example, the new Condorcet campus in Paris and nearby Aubervilliers, specialised in the social sciences, has been in the planning stage since 2007. It brings together four universities, several research organisations, several institutes, about 200,000 m2 of new buildings, the Paris City Hall, the regional authorities and the ministry. So far, no building has risen from the ground. Tensions between the socialist regional government and the Sarkozy government over how to co-finance the Condorcet development seemed to have slowed down the start of the project. The Sarkozy"

83,221,0.985,Housing Market Dynamics in Africa,"Land readjustment is another method governments can use to assemble and increase the availability of land for housing and infrastructure. This mechanism basically involves the exchange of plots or property rights between private and public entities in a way that is mutually beneficial to the parties involved. Land readjustment has the potential to be useful in Africa as it addresses the major impediment of assembling fragmented land sites for housing redevelopment programs and projects. In cities with a high degree of private landownership, local governments might apply a land readjustment policy to access land for the development of infrastructure, particularly in the urban periphery. Typically, a municipality, local government, or a professional organization works on behalf of the state with local landowners to obtain a right of way for the proposed infrastructure networks in order to get them to agree to a land readjustment or assembly process. The landowners are compensated for the loss of part of their properties through land value gains. In return, the government builds roads, public amenities, utilities, and social spaces within the area and may reserve some land for sales to recover its infrastructure costs. Some land can also be set aside for development of affordable housing. Many forms of land readjustment or pooling are possible, depending on the capacity of the local administration and the willingness of the landowners to participate in the process."
395,41,0.985,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"Another way in which the vigilance and prevention agencies back up an artifactâs ability to exert control at a distance consists in their efforts to neutralize a further, very elementary but extremely effective, strategy of resistance: simply ignoring the artifact or the intermediary (for example, by not carrying out one of the tests prescribed). This disregard may be deliberateâclaiming economic reasons for not purchasing new technologies which âmeet the legal standardââor non-deliberate and due to simple ignorance. In both cases the shared goal of âtechnology safety expertsâ and the control agencies is to enforce the use of items which in turn produce a âcontrolâ effect. The deliberate ignoring strategy is usually dealt with by inspections and controls. Such an enforcement strategy however preï¬gures new alliances and new manoeuvers in the process of engineering heterogeneous elements and communities of practice. The representatives of the users of the machinery may come together and employ lobbyists who argue that adopting the technology is economically damaging to companies, so that the law must be watered down or postponed. Enforcement therefore is often backed up with other motivation discourses such as that of âprogressâ or âworkforce well-beingâ. The manoeuver constitutes an effort to enrol other actors in the dispute, who will use the issue for their own purpose: the workersâ unions to reafï¬rm their role as defenders of the rights of workers, and entrepreneurs to gain legitimacy as âmodern and progressiveâ. In this scenario, other actors also come into play, who have been âmobilizedâ to enforce the use of safe equipment. For example, the ï¬rms manufacturing the technology are pressed into service. It is obviously in their interest to argue that safety levels should be improved, since this provides them with opportunities to sell a new generation of products, thereby increasing proï¬ts. Their commercial representatives thus become the brokers of the normative discourse, which they assert in order to generate sales. Simultaneously, however, they also act unknowingly as the intermediaries of the knowledge and culture embodied in the artifact."
10,215,0.985,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"success supports the coherence of actions relevant to water management at the catchment scale. Regarding the common perception of problems and goals ambitions, the very positive consensus on water management can be assessed by the fact of general acceptance, i.e. the acceptance, by all stakeholders representing the various water uses, of the priority given to drinking water. The availability of water provided by the dam supports this priority. However, the perception of the risk of drought and the potential impacts on freshwater availability is almost absent for the majority of stakeholders. This can be explained by the more frequent flooding issues in the area, which was, in particular, observed during the period of interviews in connection with the floods that occurred in Brittany early in 2014. As there is no comprehensive information about the quantity of water withdrawn by all water users, water managers are not really able to implement a truly coherent policy by soliciting coherent strategy and instruments. Moreover, the SAGE is a compromise between stakeholders, and some of them are more organized than others. As a result, some interests are taken into account more than others, especially those related to the drinking water supply. Furthermore, despite the work being conducted to integrate agricultural regulation in the WFD, agricultural policy is still declared by local stakeholders to be too thoroughly disconnected from the other instruments in the catchment due to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy), which is decided at the European level and is not linked directly with water policy at the local level. A coherent implementation of strategy and instruments is, thus, hard to ï¬nd for water management as a whole in the area and even harder for drought management. The responsibilities of each actor with regard to the WFD are not obvious. Most actors think that the responsibility lies mainly in the hands of the State services as represented by the Water Agency. Most water users are not considering the link between their activities and water resource management. In fact, the LWCâs responsibility is to be a decision-making authority, but it has neither the ï¬nancial nor the technical means to implement decisions, so it has no resources to implement the plan of actions proposed. At the scale of the Arzal dam and its reservoir, the ï¬nancial and technical aspects are provided by the IAV. At a more local level, we observe that some municipalities do not have the means to ï¬nance 20 % of the budget for the implementation of local projects related to water even if the subsidies, as those coming from the Water Agency, cover the remaining 80 %."

The impact of that contribution emerged with particular evidence in the responses to the conflict around the Intercultural Garden. A large number of associations and institutions joined together in that conflict led and coordinated by the district coordinator, in rejecting the involvement of right-wing groups and the ethnicization of the conflict, and at the same time supported the project of the Intercultural Garden as a valuable means for fostering inter-group contact and connections in Langwasser."
303,204,0.985,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"As a result of globalization, labor migration and migrant integration are inevitable yet uncomfortable bedfellows. From the point of view of the host society, the entry of workers from another nationality or culture might solve a domestic labor shortage, but at the same time it will raise serious questions regarding how migrants can be integrated in the society. In what aspects of the community and to what extent will they be allowed to participate in the host society? Multiculturalism policies have been established as frameworks for integration; some have earned praise for their success in some migrant-receiving countries and endured criticisms in many other countries. This chapter presents the case of stepwise migrant nurses from the Philippines to provide one perspective on how multiculturalism policies becomes important predictor of the pattern of international labor migration. The objectives of this chapter are three-fold: (1) to examine the stepwise migration behavior of Filipino nurses, especially how and why it happens; (2) to determine how multiculturalism policies impact the choice of transit and final destinations in the process of stepwise migration; and (3) to look at the links between stepwise migration and multiculturalism policies, specifically in Japan, which has begun accepting Filipino nurses under a government-to-government arrangement called the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement (JPEPA). Given the tendency toward stepwise migration among Filipino nurses, the weakness of the JPEPA scheme as a source of a stable longterm nursing workforce, and the limited capability of the Japanese government to effectively and immediately implement âtop-downâ"
258,236,0.985,New Horizons for Asian Museums and Museology,"As is discussed above, our efforts to arrive at a mutual agreement on, or understanding of, a âbetter relationship of coexistence between humans and lakesâ is at a rather primitive stage. Nevertheless, some consensus among most regional actors has surely been found. For instance, a public opinion poll in Shiga Prefecture found that the local political topics ranked as the top three in terms of satisfaction level are âenvironmental arrangements that enable experiences of nature in our own backyard,â âfood security,â and âmaintenance of beautiful rural landscapes and green forestsâ (Shiga Prefecture 2014). This indicates that many residents regard the satisfaction with these as âgoodâ and the related political measures as having been successfully worked out. Interestingly, they are all deeply associated with sustainable relationships between humans and nature in the Lake Biwa watershed. Therefore, it seems that the concept of sustainability can be accepted as a common âgoodâ by most residents in Shiga Prefecture. Aspirations for sustainability usually come from the recognition that it has been impaired. Many of us may feel that nature has retreated from our living areas, food security has been threatened, and the landscapes around farming and mountain villages have deteriorated, at least that such was the case in the past. Such experiences direct us to regenerating a sustainable relationship between humans and nature. Because such regeneration cannot be a simple restoration to the original state, it requires exploratory trials and social innovations, i.e., new strategies, concepts, ideas, and organizations that meet social needs. With this in mind, I will now introduce and analyze a case in which the Lake Biwa Museum contributed to a social activity aimed at regenerating a sustainable relationship with Lake Biwa. In 2001, Shiga Prefecture started its âSakana-no-yurikago-suidenâ project, that is, âRestoration of Fish Breeding in Paddy Fields,â around Lake Biwa. This project aims at rural environmental improvement by encouraging the resumption of ï¬sh migration between rice paddies and Lake Biwa. Land consolidation programs executed between the 1960s and 1980s raised the level of the rice paddies, and therefore generated considerable vertical drops (usually more than a meter) between the rice paddies and the water surface of the drainage canals. As a consequence, it became impossible for ï¬sh to enter the paddies for spawning. To remedy this situation, participating rural communities usually set ï¬sh-ladder cascades that work by elevating the water level of the upper reaches of a drainage canal through the installation of a series of successively higher ï¬ashboards; this sort of installation enables ï¬sh to enter the paddies adjacent to the canal by way of their drains (Fig. 2). By 2011, this program had expanded to about 1.2 km2 of paddy ï¬elds (Ohtsuka 2014)."

At the federal level, the task will be even harder, given the current level of political polarization.

In fact, even where external intervention was planned to guarantee civilian safety, NATO forces did not act consistently to protect sub-Saharan migrants and refugees within and outside Libya. Minimal evacuations and actions were organized to address the particular dimensions of risks and threats to the sub-Saharan population. On the contrary, European countries saw any movements towards their territories as an âincoming invasionâ14 and failed to act in favour of migrantsâ security, something particularly needed for this group. Emblematic of this attitude has been the Atlantic Allianceâs refusal to help migrantsâ drifting boats at the end of March and at the beginning of August, which caused dozens of deaths (Del Grande 2012b). Even as substantial resources were allocated for humanitarian aid and some emergency evacuations were organized by UN agencies later in the war, the protection of sub-Saharansâ lives was not a clear priority. Instead, precedence seemed to be given to the control of migratory movements. Indicative of this is a proposition by the Italian government in June 2011 that solicited NATO to block migrantsâ ships and return them to the southern shore of the Mediterranean, which clashed with Italian and European discourses and practices concerning humanitarian aid and support (Migreurop 2011). In short, the EU understanding of sub-Saharans as a potential threat increased migrant vulnerability to violence and life-threatening circumstances."

The Danish Peopleâs Party defends an exclusive notion of national solidarity as a community of belonging based on strong ethnic ties. It is opposed to strong and centralized welfare regimes emphasizing instead individual responsibility, subsidiarity and the need to cut down the high-tax burden in Denmark. In the European Parliament, the Party joined the Eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group opposing EU sovereignty transfers, EU redistributive policies and European and global solidarity engagement. On the other hand, solidarity contestations are pushed by the political left, in particular by the Red-Green Alliance (Enhedslisten) gaining 7.8% of the vote in the 2015 elections. The left opposition emphasizes the fight against social inequality and poverty as one of their main priorities and is in favor of strengthening and expanding the welfare state. This includes solidarity toward marginalized groups, including foreigners and refugees. As such, Enhedslisten combines a perspective of national and global solidarity but is explicitly anti-EU and campaigns for a withdrawal of Denmark from its European commitments.1 Civil society associations have reacted to the new conditionality of the welfare state by shifting orientations and providing new services for the increasing number of those who are falling through the security net. As we are able to show in our survey of Danish civil society activism, solidarity actions by civil society organizations is shifting from being supplementary of state-based services to becoming more substantial and also more confrontational. Instead of assisting the state in implementing welfare, civil society is found to increasingly replace the state and to fight in opposition to state imposed restrictions and financial cuts (Duru et al. forthcoming; Spejlborg Sejersen and Trenz 2017). The economic and financial crisis that was triggered in 2008 marks some further modest changes but not a radical rethinking of the Danish welfare regime. In general terms, Denmark has turned more restrictive toward vulnerable groups in society cutting welfare state expenditures and putting stronger emphasis on the obligation to work. As a result of the most recent policy changes, social benefits for the unemployed, refugees and people with disabilities persons have been cut or have become more conditional with preference given to measures that seek to reintegrate welfare recipients into the labor market.2 This is however in line with the tradition of the Danish welfare state, which has always combined a generous social safety net and free education with the obligations to pay high"

The Jagera participants stated that they had difï¬culty in receiving funding from the Indigenous Land Corporation as they âwere people still without countryâ. Without land, the Jagera community experiences difï¬culties in determining what training young people required. With access to land, a future business plan could include their involvement in âgreen industriesâ, such as carbon farming. In terms of cultural heritage management, senior members of Aboriginal communities are often involved with local heritage assessments, although it was stated that Indigenous consultations generally took place at the end of the process, which was not ideal. Proactively, cultural heritage management plans, incorporating CCA considerations, need to be used to protect sites containing stone artefacts, midden material and burials. There was universal agreement that an Indigenous perspective in holistically managed country is required for CCA. It was also noted that by not recognising the long held traditions of Aboriginal caring for country, European practices of land development were putting people at risk to natural hazards such as cataclysmic ï¬res, ï¬oods etc. which in turn was putting their cultural assets at greater risk. Participants of all ï¬ve communities wanted greater recognition of Dreaming sites as cultural places to conserve. An example of sites at risk from climate change was the Tjilbruke sites, which are linked by a Dreaming Track that runs along the coast on the Gulf St Vincent side of Fleurieu Peninsula from the vicinity of Adelaide to Cape Jervis and inland to Brukunga near Mount Barker (Clarke 1996; Tindale 1987). In local Aboriginal society, Tjilbruke created many topographical features, particularly freshwater springs along the coast, before ï¬nally turning into a Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus). The Dreaming Track was important for redistributing goods and the transference of knowledge through trade. Climate change concerns extend to the Tjilbruke sites (many of them coastal springs â âtears ï¬owing from Tjilbrukeâ) disappearing through a combination of the sea level rising and urban development. The Wathaurong Aboriginal Co-Operative on the other hand believe that as the Wurdi Youang stone arrangement on their Wurdi Youang property appears to be based on the local Aboriginal calendar, it maybe a useful tool to explore the impacts of past climate change. Since climate change affects country, Indigenous participants considered it important that they develop a voice in the future debates concerning CCA. The Kaurna community have long held aspirations of establishing the Warriparinga Living Kaurna Cultural Centre, located on land within the Tjilbruke site in suburban Marion, as a means of communicating Indigenous environmental issues to the general public. They further argued that the Centre should become the public face of CCA for the whole state and that it should be framed using Indigenous ecological knowledge. Similar aspirations were expressed by Boon Wurrung participants who saw opportunities potentially stemming from the close partnership that the Boon Wurrung Foundation Limited has formed with the Port Philip EcoCentre at St Kilda. There was general recognition of the importance of exhibitions in museums, interpretation centres and keeping places as a means of developing the awareness of"
83,230,0.985,Housing Market Dynamics in Africa,"rights and tenure security owing to the multiplicity of land tenure regimes, and the growing low-density urban expansion, which raise the cost of service provision. Our analysis suggests that there is a need for African governments to play a decisive role in land markets. Examples of land governance reforms across Africa and in other regions highlight effective ways of dealing with issues of land access and management. Rwanda provides a good example of how to improve land rights and security. However, it is important to note that a copy-and-paste solution is not recommended. The uncertainties in land tenure regime and enforcement of property rights have significant implications related to the land formalization debate and land delivery. Even though it is clear that individual property rights are needed for the land tenure security required for a well-functioning formal land market, mortgage financing, and private investment in housing, it remains that land formalization should not be seen as a panacea and should be customized depending on the country context and market dynamics. The importance of community engagement and participation in land reforms cannot be overemphasized. In some areas, such as informal settlements, civil society can play a vital role in ensuring equity and efficiency in land market access and distribution. In many countries, civil society is becoming better organized and more powerful politically. As such, governments need to involve local residents in major land transactions and to sensitize residents to the law and the importance of collective interests. Delivering large-scale housing developments and urban infrastructure is very demanding in terms of long-term finance. The discussion in this chapter has shown that the resources needed goes beyond what African governmentsâ budgets can afford. It is therefore imperative, for those concerned with delivering large affordable housing developments, to put in place innovative financing mechanisms to help raise sufficient resources for land and infrastructure. These include financing schemes geared toward crowding in private capital through PPPs, putting in place necessary conditions to attract investments from the contractual savings industry and ensuring that the prerequisites are in place for increased domestic resource mobilization, through land value capture in particular. The success of such financing mechanisms would heavily depend on the exis-"

In July of 2016, the American Chemistry Council published âPlastics and Sustainability: A valuation of environmental benefits, costs and opportunities for continuous improvement,â largely a comparison of life cycle analyses putting plastic in a positive light against alternative materials (glass, metal, paper). At the same time, the Plastic Pollution Policy Project convened 18 organizations focused on zero waste initiatives to align on policy and campaigns and to create common messaging to counter industry-dominated narratives. A movement has emerged, while stakeholder positions have dug in their heels. Here we have discussed solutions to microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, which largely form in terrestrial environments from primary or secondary microplastics. We know that microplastics are global, increasingly toxic over time, and impacts to wildlife are pervasive, leading to the collective conclusion that plastic in the environment causes harm. We also know that capturing microplastic downstream is extremely difficult and requires upstream intervention."

Still the majority in need keep trying to fulfill their aspiration for a decent housing of their own. Yet if they are not cautious, many households or individuals may lose their meager resources and savings while trying to acquire a piece of land from impostors operating within a customary land regime. Besides, such discontent and frustration could also incite violence. In Mali, for instance, weak land delivery systems and poor land governance have contributed to social unrest and political instability, which precipitated the ousting of President Amadou Toumani TourÃ© in 2012 (Durand-Lasserve et al. 2015). Besides failing to take appropriate measures to resolve frustrations and discontents through a profound overhaul of the land governance systems, politically connected individuals usually leverage their personal relationships and networks to secure protection from some politicians, bureaucrats, or power brokers (such as traditional authorities, politicians, bureaucrats, and the police) to occupy land in the public domain and manage to acquire a degree of tenure security. This also explains the proliferation of informal settlements (see Chap. 6). These individuals could also become rent seekers or informal land brokers and speculate on the basis of fake land titles and still be protected by those to whom they offer bribes, political support, or some sort of obligation in return for protection against legal action. These informal land brokersâcalled âcoxersâ in Maliâare defined by DurandLasserve et al. (2015: 46) as individuals involved in customary land sales âto whom many buyers and sellers resort to transact land. They have informers in peri-urban villages to identify land that can be transacted and negotiate with village authorities; therefore, they are key players in the rural to urban conversion process. They are also aware of the âtricksâ that can be used to circumvent regular procedures and deal with the administration to make sales effective. They are often found in publicly visible places, including on the side of roads not far from plots that are for sale.â Box 2.1 provides an analysis of the role that politics and social connections play in the allocation of public land in Mali.2"

As a result, foreign purchases of foodstuffs increased (Warman, 2001).11 Nevertheless, political discourse has continued to defend the importance of developing autonomous and efï¬cient agrifood systems. In a country where only 6% of farmers are classiï¬ed as âmodernâ,12 the Mexican Government has had to propose various programmes and measures to mitigate the impacts of rising food prices for the poorest strata of the population (Gravel, 2009). The main measures aimed at the poorest farmers were a distribution of grants according to cultivated acreage (such as the so-called Procampo Programme) and aid to the poorest women (Progresa/Oportunidad). The less marginalized categories were urged to adopt the Green Revolution technology package (hybrids, fertilizers, pesticides and mechanization) in programmes such as Object Income and Masagro. Thus in 2007 the state designed a new national policy for rural development as a whole. With the programme Nuevo Programa Especial Concurrente (PEC), the government began to take an interest in the integration of the native and peasant population into national development. This PEC was launched in areas of great and very great marginalization, the population itself taking part, thanks to the organization of a forum (Foro de Consulta Popular), to which all stakeholders in the rural sector were invited.13 However, only 15.7% of all ï¬nancial resources considered in the PEC were directed towards the support of agricultural food production (Gomez-Oliver, 2008). Furthermore, programmes that targeted small farmers â either by distributing a technology package or by granting subsidies â encouraged deforestation, and this gave rise to further intensiï¬cation of farming. This seems to be at odds with the aim of developing a national environmental policy. Yet ratiï¬cation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and recognition of native struggles (in the San AndrÃ©s agreements of 1994) ï¬nally led to the creation of the Environment Ministry (the Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources/Secretaria de Medio Ambinete y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT)) in 1994. An environmental policy that attempts to integrate the international standards of Agenda 2114 was established. In 2000 a National Plan for Sustainable Development was adopted. To top it off, in 2000 the Mexican Constitution was changed so as to acknowledge the cultural and ethnic diversity of Mexican society. This particular interest has been reinforced since 2007 in the sustainable development programmes in which ecological viability is treated as one of the ï¬ve cornerstones of federal action.

After all, water is materially and socially a highly emotive subjectâwhether through its overabundance, its lack, or when polluted (Sultana 2011). As can be seen in the Somerset case, the use, control and conflicts around water shape peoples everyday experiences with water (Sultana 2011). Water in complex landscapes such as Somerset have substantial emotive aspects, as discussion of its control and use intersects with experiences of place, livelihoods, and social, economic, political and environmental futures. It is these futures that are directly being intervened with in both longer term planning (such as water resource management plans, drought plans), and emergency management and policies that emerge during and after periods of crisis. Whittle et al. (2012) have captured strongly the emotional work that occurs simultaneously to the practical work in restoring built and natural environments after a flooding event. Clearly then the discussion of the future of water scarcity for an area such as Somerset at a time when the whole region is concentrating on recovering from a period of water abundance is an emotive and contested conversation. Nonetheless, it is a fundamentally important one. Despite these restrictions in this broader governance system, the pilot measures initiated by a number of stakeholders in the Somerset region (cp. Sect. 5.3) demonstrate a positive example of the sorts of water management activities that can bridge across the policy silos of flood and drought even in a period of âdisaster recoveryâ. Far from just satisfying certain WFD requirements for participation and catchment management, these initiatives reflect concrete attempts to change the experiences of stakeholders and engagements with the breadth of water management issues facing their region now and into the future. These are highly politicised and emotive processesâthey tap into conversations about âwhat the Somerset Levels and Moors are forâ; highlighting conflicts between protection of people, agriculture and nature; and arguably reflect the ongoing entrenchment of neoliberal and meta-governance failures in relations to drought and water scarcity across England (Walker 2014). As Clout (2014) reflects, such conversations about the purpose of the Levelsâwhether to maintain agriculture or support nature conservationâare not new and they have probably been happening since the middle ages, when the area was ï¬rst drained and developed. Within this project and chapter, we can neither prescribe what the future of the Levels should be or what activities need to take place in order to continue opening up conversations about ways to bridge silos within water management activities within the region. However, we do call on leaders and stakeholders in the Somerset region to continue collaborative processes of water governance across the widest possible range of stakeholders. This will ensure that a diversity of views from these stakeholders are catalogued, when adaptation policies are developed across water policy domains. Hopefully, in this way broader meta-governance failuresâwhich often entrench siloed"
92,27,0.984,Global Health Collaboration : Challenges and Lessons,"Lived Experiences The challenges of realising good health in an urban context affect both internal and cross-border migrants. These challenges include poor mental health; mediated by education level, marital status and socio-economic situation, as well as country or province of origin. The urban environment contributes to growing inequity in wellbeing; in the case of peripheral urban spaces, economic, social and physical changes over the past few decades have reinforced marginalisation. Pathways that affect the health of migrants living on the periphery relate to unemployment and crime; inadequate shelter, infrastructure and services; a complex food environment in which it is difficult to achieve food security; a built environment that is not conducive to safe physical activity; and high levels of depression and stress â linked to, poverty, crime and fear of crime and deportation. Improving the understanding of lived experiences requires engagement with differing understandings of health and ill health, and alternative health and help-seeking strategies, such as churches and community support â including from others from their country of origin, and from those back home. Role of Governance and Policy A key focus of many researchers at the symposium was on how cross-border migrants navigate and negotiate healthcare in public facilities and in turn how migrants are perceived as a public health threat or a liability by the state, by healthcare professionals and by local citizens. Securitisation with regard to migration is not limited to border control but extends to the (increasing) securitisation of healthcare and communicable diseases surveillance in SA. This is despite the fact that, often, rather than bringing communicable diseases, it is the marginalisation that cross-border and internal migrants face in SA cities that can put them at risk of contracting communicable diseases after arriving in the city. Migrantsâ well-being in host societies is partly informed by the extent to which they can access healthcare and other social services, safe housing, and secure livelihoods. One important dimension of speaking to policy involved the explicit definition and consideration of contested terms. For example, it was vital to engage in a discussion of what is meant by human mobility. In SADC, this was determined to encompasses travel that is circular and involves cycles of return that can be rapid (daily, weekly, monthly), as well as more permanent movement (annual trips home, or even less frequently). Mobility in the region is still dominated by working-aged individuals and families, meaning that issues related to maternal and child health remain important focal areas for consideration. Furthermore, the legal experience of those who migrate relates to health. For example, the category of refugee has (unevenly) invoked legal protection, and also specific health responses on the part of the state."

The research methodology also varies according to the discipline with which the contributors are familiar and their focus on more empirical or theoretical discussion. However, what permeates these diverse chapters is the firm conviction that dialog and negotiation are the key to providing a reconciliation process for the conflicts and confrontations resulting from co-mingling of those with various cultural and historical backgrounds. In order to provide a space in which the dialog and negotiation take place, mere tolerance towards other peoples with diverse cultures is not enough. Critical insight directed toward the concept of culture itself, which is often mistakenly assumed to be rigid and inflexible, is additionally required. It is questioning the assumption of stable cultural bases that enables us to propose what multiculturalism in the 21st century might mean not only to those who formulate migration and language policies, but also to those who reside in the Asia-Pacific region negotiating between conflict and coexistence in the circumstances of an increasingly globalizing world."
266,157,0.984,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Introduction The use of technology to improve community policing effectiveness has gained attention over the last decade, primarily due to the rise in the use of social media, however, it is far from new; back in 1996, at a time when the Web was still just a few years old, Google.com did not exist yet and there were only about 100,000 websites (in comparison to over a billion in 2014 (Lafrance 2015), the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) organized a series of five regional conferences that focused on how technology can enhance community policing (NIJ 1996). The conferences were held in Colorado Springs, Colorado; Rochester, New York; San Diego, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and Louisville, Kentucky. The overarching goal of the conferences was to search for and, eventually, identify ways in which technology could further enhance the relationship between lawenforcement and the community on a win-win basis. The attendees represented a diverse array of law enforcement professionals, including chiefs of various police departments across the country, government officials, consultants, managers, judges etc. and the vast majority of the presentations focused on how to identify meaningful ways to improve community policing through the use of technology. The thematic areas of the conferences included the following topics:"
2,363,0.984,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"This dimension exhibits fewer differences between service areas. All municipalities conduct user surveys, and these are administered in all institutions except nonproï¬t schools. User surveys are the only opportunity for direct communication between users and local policymakers. In addition, municipalities have arenas for representatives of institutions to participate. For nursing homes, there is no difference between public, for-proï¬t and nonproï¬t institutions when it comes to their participation in these arenas. For schools, the more detached nonproï¬t schools are more isolated when it comes to participation. This is partly because local policymakers have less influence over what happens at nonproï¬t schools. It is a curious situation, since issues discussed in these arenas often include more than municipal school policies and are thus of interest also to the parents of children in nonproï¬t schools. The implication here is that a trade-off exists between empowerment at institutions and participation and influence in local policy process. The institutions where users have more local influence get less attention and less room for influence from the municipal level. This gives them more room to manoeuvre locally but also gives them less administrative support. Albeit to varying degrees, municipalities are important for all these institutions, and so to be excluded from the municipal decision-making structure undermines the opportunities citizens have to influence decision making in their communities. For policymakers, the exclusion of citizens from platforms for communication with them can present a skewed view of the opinions of citizens, especially those who by deï¬nition have taken an active stance on particular welfare issues. There is some variance between countries. In Denmark, user boards at nursing homes can report about successes in changing municipal policy, and interactions with local policymakers are a natural part of their tasks. This also happens in Norway, but to a lesser extent, while in Sweden it is all but absent. For schools, divisions between the strong influence of public schools and the lack of influence of nonpublic schools are evident across countries. The greater presence of participation in Denmark can be seen in the light of Scandinavian countriesâ respective âpower studiesâ, where the Danish research team drew more optimistic conclusions about the state of democracy on the basis of investigations into the implementation of policies (Andersen 2006)."
99,76,0.984,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"As outlined in the previous chapter (Cattacin and Zimmer 2015), governance of cooperation is characterized by the continuous search for synergies between economic and social policies. Although the search for investments constitutes the driving force of city politics, actors in MÃ¼nster are sensible not to lose contact with the social domain. The underlying rational of action is pragmatism combined with efficiency. Actors in the city search for practical solutions for todayâs problems without giving up an investment-focused policy orientation. As outlined in the following section on âinnovationsâ in the areas of housing and labour market policies, there seems to be a division of labour with regard to economic and social policies. Social policy is by and large considered to be the prime responsibility of public and hence the cityâs administration, while business issues are primarily taken care of by the business community. Moreover, MÃ¼nsterâs governance of cooperation is inclined to empower citizens in order to make them fit for the market and hence to be able to help themselves.

The situation for migrant workers in terms of support for childcare and other reproductive responsibilities is generally worse than for other workers. In most situations neither the state of origin nor the destination state takes any responsibility for the childcare needs of women migrant workers, who are usually excluded from any entitlements available to national citizens. Destination states consider migrant workers as only temporary residents in the country, so see no reason to invest in the reproduction of the next generation; and sending states, even those which sponsor the outmigration of women workers, are more interested in the repatriation of remittances from migrant earnings than in contributing to their childcare costs, particularly when the children are raised in another country. So most migrant workers are left to organize and finance the costs of bearing and raising their own children from their own resources without state or other support. In the face of this situation, which is coupled with low bargaining power as workers, and often indifference or even hostility from the receiving state, migrant workers actively mobilize their family and other networks in order to juggle their care responsibilities with the demands of their paid employment, in spite of the harsh environment they find themselves in. This is the situation for Burmese migrant women in our study who are employed in the garment and textile factories in the border areas of northern Thailand, and are involved simultaneously in reproductive as well as productive work. The micro-level analysis of their experience enables an understanding of the ways in which migrant womenâs reproductive (domestic) labour is linked to the global economy. An important focus of recent research has been on âglobal care chainsâ, which describe the transborder commoditization of care work resulting from the migration of domestic and other care workers, mainly from low-wage developing economies of the global South to the industrialized economies of the North (Hochschild 2001; Yeates 2005; Sassen 2008). Our research extends this analysis by demonstrating how care work and global production are also linked by the reproductive work of women migrant factory workers who are employed in other sectors of the economy, but who still retain the responsibility to resource, organize, and often deliver care work for their own families, including their parents and siblings as well as their own children.5"

Furthermore, when we talk of the Black Sea basin, we are in fact referring to an area that extends beyond the immediate environment of its waters: in addition to a respectable total of six riparian countries (Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Russia and Ukraine), Greece, Armenia and Azerbaijan can also be considered to fall within its bounds. There are obviously wide-ranging differences between the above-mentioned countries, according to a variety of indicators: economic development; governance, democracy and human rights protection; the pace at which reform is taking place in these aspects; access to energy resources (whilst one riparian country can be considered a veritable energy superpower, others are energy deficient and highly dependent on imports; some countries are energy producers, and others are simply countries through which energy passes); and their relationship with the EU. In the latter regard, some are EU Member States, and others are not: one is an EU candidate country (Turkey), others are European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) partners and another (Russia) is a strategic partner for the EU. Amongst the ENP partner countries, three have shown willingness to achieve closer ties with the EU (Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), whilst others evidence a certain degree of reticence and appear to favour partnerships with other interlocutors (Armenia, Azerbaijan).2 Additionally, there are a number of frozen conflicts within the area, such as those in the Republic of Moldova (Transnistria) and Georgia (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) or that between Armenia and Azerbaijan (the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave). To this we must add the serious conflict provoked by Russiaâs illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, which has brought about a substantial modification in the strategic landscape not only of the Black Sea Basin itself but also of the outlying area, seen as an example of a broader systemic challenge to the European security architecture.3 In addition to the complex political situation described above, it must also be noted that the Black Sea ecosystem is suffering from substantial environmental degradation: as a virtually enclosed inland sea, it is particularly fragile from a physical standpoint, and its vulnerability has regrettably not been sufficiently compensated for by the introduction of appropriate policies to prevent its deterioration. The enormous pressure resulting from numerous human activities such as industrialisation, urbanisation, overfishing or transport (not only of hydrocarbons since the arrival of invasive species in shipsâ ballast water has also been proved to represent a serious environmental threat) has led to serious problems of pollution, loss of biodiversity, extinction of species and eutrophication, amongst others.4"

The network of civil society organisations that underpin this work then provide the context for national debates that bring together Communities of Practice at national level, but expose them to a wider European debate. The impact of MIPEX is then very carefully monitored with credible evidence that changes in law and policy have arisen as a result of poor performance in the MIPEX rankings. The MPG is a highly credible actor at EU level, MIPEX is without doubt a much-used tool, and there is evidence of changes in law and policy as a result of MIPEX findings. Where MIPEX has been more effective is in relation to more conditional forms of learning where actors encounter know-how and other ways of doing things. However, MIPEX is also an âoutsiderâ (civil society) intervention in a policy area where national governments are strong and, in particular, where the executive branches of these national governments have been key players."
386,141,0.984,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"4.4 Concluding Thoughts on Cooperation Institutional economists often emphasise that âold rules are good rulesâ (e.g. Kasper 2013). While this might be true for hierarchies and markets, the realm of cooperation may be particularly reliant on the firm establishment of cooperative structures. The long-term success of agricultural cooperatives and Alpine grassland corporations are two cases in point, while the many failed attempts to institutionalise cooperation in new ways are others. However, new needs constantly emerge and, in the case of Western consumers, these needs often suggest interlinking more strongly with many of the poor persons responsible for growing the ingredients for food and drinks. A feeling of shared responsibility fosters the establishment of new and lasting organisational settings. Some consumers choose to link with farmers in their region through communitysupported agriculture, while others buy fair trade items to help farmers in the global south. In any case, the need to buy sustainably is growing, and it is accompanied by both opportunities and threats. The key opportunity is to establish broadly accepted guidelines for the fairer organisation of production, which may become legal requirements one day. The main threat is the loss of credibility caused by freeloaders that use labels and symbols without actually delivering what they promise."
97,84,0.984,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","NbS, EbA, GI and ESS are four concepts that have been introduced in the past two decades to strengthen the role of nature in its widest meaning in policy-making â from the global to the site level. Table 3.4 provides a comparative overview of these concepts. They have co-evolved and are widely overlapping in terms of their scope and definition of nature. On the one hand, they are motivated by the concern to better protect nature, and specifically biodiversity, in a human-dominated world. On the other hand, the use of nature is considered as an option to complement, improve or even replace traditional engineering approaches, for example, for stormwater management. Therefore, all four concepts are clearly focusing on human interests, aiming to assert the environmental, social and economic benefits that people gain from nature. Moreover, they are problem-focused and they require inter- and transdisciplinary approaches. For instance, EbA is considered to tackle the challenge of climate change adaptation from multiple academic fields and concepts, e.g.,"

Different typologies of stakeholders were identiï¬ed (decision makers, governmental institutions, NGOs and UN agencies, professionals/researchers, site business beneï¬ciaries, tour guides, children, local community) and a set of targeted activities was selected for each of them (Table 1). Overall, the strategy aims at: (a) achieving best practices on preservation and management of the site supported and endorsed by the national authorities; (b) making local communities, site beneï¬ciaries, and other stakeholders engaged in the site with different capacities, aware of the activities undertaken in the Siq for the prevention of natural hazards; (c) ensuring that best practices are adopted by tourists when visiting the Siq in regards to the impact of natural hazards that might occur on site; (d) making the international community and the national authorities aware of the work that UNESCO is conducting in the Siq.

Also worth mentioning is the existence and activity of clandestine groups, most notably the series of murders committed by the National-Socialist Underground (Nationalsozialistischer Untergrund, NSU) between 2000 and 2006. While this group appeared to be small, one should also consider that, according to official data from March 2016, 372 right-wing activists (of which 342 had been previously sentenced) were living underground. Another component of the right-wing infrastructure, and one that partly transcends national borders, are the relatively small numbers of intellectuals, scientists, journalists and artists who directly or indirectly support the right. They serve as reference points and allegedly credible sources for right-wing claims. Sometimes these people have a long history of involvement in right-wing politics, sometimes there are also defectors who have moved from the far left to the far right. In the context of Pegida, several people of this kind gave speeches or were cited by others in the movement. To sum up, over the last few decades right-wing groups have created loosely connected and flexible structures that allow for effective communication and mobilization. The nodes in this structure vary in their concrete ideological orientation and organizational forms. While many of these groups were explicitly created to pursue political aims, there were also right-wing individuals or small groups who, nominally private, are active in non-political pockets of civil society. In organizational terms, these groups range from formal and hierarchical nationwide organizations (including political parties) to completely informal and local friendship circles. Some groups and organizations have existed for decades; others split and unite, change labels, or remain completely informal. In some cases, the link to the political right is unobtrusive, as exemplified by some music bands or web-based stores. The density of right-wing infrastructure varies considerably within Germany. In some places, it is almost absent, especially where a leftist culture prevails. In other places, most notably in some rural areas in East Germany, right-wing groups have acquired a hegemonic status so that it has become risky to express a dissenting view, let alone to live there as an apparent non-German recognizable by, for example, being nonwhite (SchrÃ¶der 1997; DÃ¶ring 2007). This anchorage and embedding in local and regional communities not only increases the self-confidence of right-wing activists but may also encourage them to engage in criminal acts such as arson attacks on asylum shelters: Acts that are sometimes publicly applauded by local bystanders, as occurred in the city of Freital (Saxony) in 2015 alongside other cities in 2015/16."

Instead, state sponsored/approved forcible encroachment by private interests into communal lands predominates. â¢ Genuinely inform and consult populations prior to the inception of developmentârather than âmanufactureâ âconsentâ from orchestrated and government (or donor) controlled gatherings. â¢ Implement a valid assessment of the efï¬cacy of âcompensationâ or âmitigationâ for the hundreds of thousands of indigenous residents, even if such were a genuine GOE intention. â¢ Implement its own deï¬ned Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)âafter such is shaped with community consultations.11 Repeated assertions by the Ethiopian government, particularly EEPCO, that the âbeneï¬tsâ of Gibe III generated electricity would serve the needs of Ethiopians so far without access to power contradicted by two realities. Firstly, a high proportion of Gibe III generated electricity is slated for export, as outlined in prior chapters and in the section below. Secondly, since electricity costs in Ethiopia are predicted to rise by a minimum of 200 % in the near term, according to the World Bank, the overwhelming proportion of Ethiopian citizens would have no means to purchase available electricity. This is true even with the unlikely scenario that the GOE subsidizes energy costs for large numbers of the poor. The major consumers of electricityâin Ethiopia, Kenya and elsewhere in eastern Africaâare projected to be industry, agroindustry, commerce and government entities, along with relatively better well-off domestic consumers. â¢ Systematic actions taken by Ethiopiaâs institutional nexus of river basin development policy (see description in Chap. 2) over more than ï¬ve decades for more than ï¬ve decades reveal a clear pattern of ignoring the human and environmental consequences of major hydrodam developmentâthe Gibe III being the worst case, to date. The close coordination and overlapping objectives among GOE Executive ofï¬ces, international development banks (playing the key role among aid agencies in large capital projects) and global consulting industry membersâboth ï¬rms and individualsâform the functional core of bringing about such massive dam and infrastructural projects as the Gibe megadam. The GOEâs dismissive approach to the survival and well being of its own indigenous population within the lower Omo basin residents is evident from these two statements by Meles Zenawi, the late Prime Minister of Ethiopia, at Ethiopiaâs Annual Pastoralistsâ Day in 2011. âOn this occasion, I assure the people of South Omo, especially the pastoralists, that the time of losing your cattle or life because of the Omo flood is over. In the coming ï¬ve years, there will be a very big irrigation project and related agricultural development in this zone.

242,963,0.984,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract For decades, Thailand has experienced an influx of a large number of migrants from Myanmar who have come in search of better economic opportunities. This influx has led to a sizeable migrant population residing in Thailand, of which children make up a significant percentage. Providing education for large numbers of migrant children has become a matter of national concern, both because of Thailandâs international human rights obligations and as a matter of national security. Responding to these concerns, the government of Thailand has adopted a policy of providing free and compulsory education for every child within its territory, including migrant children. However, despite the efforts of the Thai government to provide education for all, many migrant children are still unable to benefit from this policy. In this chapter, the challenges of realizing the right to education for migrant children in Samut Sakhon, a coastal province in central Thailand, are studied. Schools are regarded as institutional duty bearers that are obliged, on behalf of the state, to fulfil their legal obligation in terms of Thai government policy. These obligations emanate from the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Thailand is a state party. In addition, the research analyses the precarious status of migrant children. The concept of âliminal legalityâ is used to conceptualize the in-between status of migrant children and families, and to illustrate how this liminal status shapes the opportunity structure of migrant children in education by influencing household decision-making. In this chapter, it is argued that addressing the liminal status of migrants is essential in addressing not only the issue of migrant childrenâs education, but also that of their incorporation into Thai society in general. Keywords: Burmese migrants, migrant children, right to education, liminal legality, Thailand."
318,80,0.984,"Working, Housing: Urbanizing: The International Year of Global Understanding - IYGU","Government involvement in the expansion and consolidation of informal housing can be signiï¬cant. In some situations, tacit or even quite explicit support from governments can see the large-scale development of informal housing as a way to solve problems of very rapid urbanization. In Istanbul, as new migrants from the countryside arrived through the 1980s, the Islamic parties in the city fostered informal settlements known as gecekondus, which both met housing needs and provided a base for building a political base amongst the more religious new immigrants. Perhaps the most famous example of this phenomenon is to be found in China, where âurban villagesâ have made a major contribution to housing the massive flows of new migrants to these cities (See Box 4.1 above). Former villagers now own and manage often very dense, high-rise housing developments in and close to major cities. While these have a de facto acceptance by the authorities, they are very vulnerable to redevelopment pressures from diverse state and municipal agencies. In Istanbul, too, the huge opportunities for proï¬ting from alternative land uses for informal areas have more recently seen major urban renewal initiatives by the state, removing gecekondu residents (and increasingly residents of older, more run-down and lower rise areas of the city) to very distant new housing estates where, following the Chilean model, mortgages are made available to very poor households to acquire tiny apartments. These strategies have freed up large areas of land for controversial and proï¬table developments in central areas, which have been linked to corruption in the government. In theory this releases some proï¬ts for cross-subsidization of housing for the poor, but the housing remains largely unaffordable, and, being removed to the outskirts of the city, has had devastating"
334,350,0.984,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"can be traced back to the early 2000s, when youth with a status of toleration or other precarious legal statuses began to organize themselves. They sought to overcome the limited position designated to them by the state and civil society by developing their own political positionality as well as corresponding narratives and protest forms. This initiative first focused on fighting for access to higher and professional education in Berlin. However, as some successfully gained access to universities and job training, they realized âthat education and labor rights did not grant any durable solution, as long as the fear of deportation was omnipresent and long-term opportunities as well as social security were still deniedâ (Kanalan 2015, 5, translated from German by the authors). Therefore, the migrant youth extended their focus to beyond their specific situation of being young people excluded from education. This was, however, used in conjunction with a framing strategy that highlighted their disenfranchisement and vulnerable position relative to their peers with citizenship status. Inspired by the movement of Sans Papiers in France and other countries, refugee youth, some of whom later became involved in JoG, fought for a comprehensive right to stay. After fighting for the specific case of a 14-year old schoolgirl, the refugee youth organized an anti-deportation campaign called Stay Here (Hier Geblieben) in cooperation with a local counseling center, the refugee council, Pro Asyl (a non-profit organization), the Grips Theater, and the Education and Science Workersâ Union GEW (Hier Geblieben 2005). Out of this organizing structure, JoG was formalized in 2005 at a conference with 70 refugee youth from all over Germany. These conferences, which they have held every year since 2005 in the same city as the Conference of the Ministers of the Interior, became their main political space to organize and voice political demands. The refugee youth were empowered by self-organizing workshops, demonstrations, and gala nights, by representing themselves at press conferences and by personally meeting politicians to discuss and confront them with their demands. Similar to the political practices of Kanak Attak, JoG not only uses conventional protest forms such as demonstrations and speeches, but also political art and theater to reach out to mainstream society and politicians (Jouni and Ziese 2016). Causing some tensions, the framing and claims of JoG were at times perceived as less radical than those of other groups in the refugee movement, as they also had short-term and mid-term goals to improve the precarious situation of at least some refugee youth (Kanalan 2015, 9). Particular claims based on their positionality as youth were crucial for the selforganizing of JoG, which led to a specific framing around youthfulness and several campaigns demanding an equal right to education and schools for all. However, despite these youth-specific claims, the âright to stay for allâ has become a main slogan of JoG, reflecting the oscillation between particular and more general claims that we already described regarding the struggle of refugee women."

The Competence Centre is also the link between the different territorial levels: the Confederation, the cantons and the other communes. Widely publicised by the Swiss administration, the document is available on paper as well as on the Internet, foremost addressing the administration and the civil servants of the city of Bern. The principles and aims presented in the document should lead their everyday work and orientate the action of their services. However, it cannot be assimilated to a work duty since no enforcement is planned to ensure the implementation of the guiding principles. Moreover, the document also addresses private and third sector actors, highlighting their potential impact on integration and suggesting ways of considering and dealing with people of foreign origin. Finally, it is meant to inform the population about the integration policy of their city. In 2010, the updated version of the guidelines became more concretised, encompassing a catalogue of measures. In this respect, the guidelines function as a basis for the proposal to existing structures of how they could participate, in real terms, in the cityâs integration policy."
284,174,0.984,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"structural relations of domination, and their privileges to be derived from their positions in the structures that conï¬gure Latin America as a subaltern region open to exploitation according to the needs of a globally integrated capitalism. The double exploitation of people and nature also forms the basis of the construction of the modern states, dominated by national elites, but it is also often based on the control of natural resources and local groups in different parts of the territory (Alimonda, 2011). Against the backdrop presented above, we should not only ask under what conditions we can expect elite objectives to be aligned with national development goals. We also have to discuss how to make those goals aligned with the interests, needs and aspirations of all population groups across social classes and territories, as well as with those of future generations. A common answer to the question of how to achieve that has been to emphasize pluralism and democracy; in other words, to ensure that there are good mechanisms of representation, participation and accountability, which can lead to the establishment of institutions of environmental governance with the potential of less elitist and more sustainable development outcomes. This has been what many hoped would occur in Latin America in recent decades after the return to formal democracies and the historical rise of previously marginalized groups to power in the government. Elite theory has nevertheless never been convinced of the merits of pluralist democracies to make societies more egalitarian. To the contrary, elite theories of all kinds have had a quite dismal view of the potential of democracy to transform society, a matter that is partially rooted in their view of the state. Marxist elite theory, which deï¬nes elites based on their relationship to capital and means of production, is generally sceptical of the possibility for changes in the state without underlying changes in the mode of production upholding it (see e.g. Jessop, 1990). As a democratic government depends on public support, it will suffer if it presides over a serious drop in the level of economic activity as a result of conï¬icts with capitalists (Block, 1977). Therefore, in spite of the establishment of pluralist institutions, the state cannot really be democratized within a capitalist economy. The other major classical political-economy theory of elites and democracy, developed by Schumpeter, was highly critical of the Marxist equation of true democracy with socialism, although not discharging the possibility that they could coexist.2 He does not have much more faith in pluralism either. Schumpeterâs main point is that democracy is inherently elitist: âdemocracy does not mean and cannot mean that"
242,77,0.984,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract3 This chapter provides a perspective on the chain of social injustice faced by Indonesian migrant domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). By using the lens of gender to connect practices within the Indonesian management system for labour migration with those guided by regulations governing the management of foreign labour in the UAE, the chapter reveals the consequences of the absence of a specific law governing the presence of domestic workers in both countries. Labour migration management systems are bounded by the nation state, whereas domestic workers must rely on transnational coordination between two systems. Where their work is not legally defined, they can become subject to arbitrary treatment at different points in their migration along a transnational chain of relations of structural dependency. They tend to bear the weight of institutional dysfunctions, often with dire consequences for their private lives. Learning from their experiences can help us draw lessons for future action towards achieving standards of decent work within a territory and standards of basic human security applicable to their transnational movement. Just as research into transnational migration has moved beyond methodological nationalism, so also labour migration policy needs to find frames of reference appropriate to context to ensure that workersâ rights are protected in different places.

Then, a peace agreement was reached between the GPH and the MNLF in September 1996 (Sastrohandoyo 2008, 15â30). While it is understood that peace is a process, Indonesia has continued its role as part of the IMT since 2012. Until 2014, at least four teams were sent to monitor peace in this area. Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also played crucial facilitation roles. Muhammadiyah, an international nongovernmental organization (INGO) based in Indonesia, has participated in the International Contact Group, a hybrid mediation support initiative asked to provide support to the parties.6 Indonesia also attempted to act as a mediator in Southern Thailand between the Thai government and the Muslim groups residing in the southern part of the country. The Indonesian government, led by Vice President Jusuf Kalla (who now also serves as the Indonesian Vice President for the second time), managed to host a peace talk in Bogor in 2008 attended by Thai officials and representatives of insurgent groups. The effort did not produce an agreement and was later rejected by the Thai government since it insisted that the talks should be kept strictly domestic (The Jakarta Post 2010). Humanitarian Action While humanitarian action, including disaster relief, is normally separated from peacebuilding efforts, in the context of Indonesia, humanitarian assistance has been utilized to pave the way to conduct peacebuilding. This distinct feature has been created as a strategy to ensure that state sovereignty is respected, since humanitarian action is often considered less threatening than peacebuilding activities that can be perceived as challenging a governmentâs capacity to deal with post-conflict situations. Furthermore, humanitarian assistance can be crucial to gaining trust from the host countries, since such efforts are often viewed as a gesture of good will. Humanitarian assistance can also be utilized to share experiences with disaster and crisis management. Cyclone Nargis provides a good example of the usefulness of humanitarian assistance. In this context, Indonesia played a leading role in approaching the military junta in Myanmar and challenging it to open access to outside humanitarian aid to help the victims. Indonesia drew upon the experience of handling the impact of the tsunami disaster that hit Aceh in"
99,501,0.984,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"4. Innovations in modes of working and financing consolidate forms of multiprofessional teamwork including volunteers and civic commitment of supporters; produce new professionalism, combining formerly fragmented knowledge through dialogue with and involvement of users; operate on mixed funding, merging resources from stakeholders across sectors. 5. Innovations in how to conceive of (local) welfare systems focus on welfare mixes, reaching out to all sectors of local welfare systems and upgrading its community component; less standardised, more diverse and localised welfare arrangements; a welfare beyond established demarcation lines, that opens up to environmental and lifestyle politics, bridging economic and social policy concerns, welfare and urban politics, focusing less on groups and more on situations and territories. The key words and issues as they are recollected here can be viewed and taken up both as promising solutions to local problems and as messages to all those who are interested in changing the cultural orientations and policy frameworks of local welfare, services and urban governance. This leads to a third argument: social innovations offer good chances for promoting change since they can be quite easily spilled over to similar milieus and settings in other spots and localities. As argued above, it takes specific constellations of factors for local social innovations to emergeânot only pressures and needs but also aspirations and openness of actors in the local context (see Chap. 2). In the academic debate on enabling conditions for social innovations, it is common to point out factors that seem to be specifically local, such as social and cultural movements, traditions of solidarity within the local community, an urban texture where unconventional attitudes merge with entrepreneurial readiness and local elites that open up to new ideas and attempts. This is however slightly misleading, as discussed in Chap. 3 of this book. None of these factors are exclusively local. Movements and projects in a city are usually related to social trends and strands of thinking, values and assumptions present at different points of society. Local experts taking part in innovative processes are usually members of networks that operate on (inter)national levels. Programmes with funding possibilities and their local nudges are often the result of initiatives by state experts at national level that encourage new approaches. Social innovation is multilevelled by nature. Altogether, this points towards a process of social innovation that relies on interplay and contagion across domains, logics and multiple levels."

Foreign capital and expertise is not in itself bad, but it is vital to ensure that foreign-led and financed economic activities in the Arctic serve the needs of Arctic peoples as well in order to prevent becoming caught up in neocolonial processes. From mining companies and fishing interests to government authorities based in distant seats of power, we must seek to simultaneously be open to the world and avoid becoming a passive cog in the great machine of global capital and realpolitik. The globalisation of corporate power is accompanied by a globalisation of risk and of concern for Indigenous peoples and the future of the Arctic.

72,244,0.984,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"SMG regarded citizen engagement as one of the core strategies driving social innovation across Seoul. Citizen engagement was used as a mechanism that empowered Seoul citizens to express what they needed, explore how these needs could be met and decide what could be done in response. In this way, SMG was able to understand citizensâ needs better, collect unexpected but working solutions, and create opportunities to resolve conflicting issues among different stakeholders (Y. Kim, 2013; T. Kim, 2013). One way of conceptualising citizen engagement is to use the Spectrum of Public Participation developed by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2, 2014). This sets out different public participation goals (from the perspective of the state) in order of increasing level of public impact, from âinformâ to âconsultâ, âinvolveâ, âcollaborateâ and finally, âempowerâ. Prior to Mayor Parkâs administration, SMG used citizen engagement activities such as public hearings and citizen surveys to implement new city policies. However, these programmes were limited to the âinformingâ and âconsultingâ types of engagement. In contrast, many new tools and programmes developed and operated by SMG under Mayor Parkâs leadership specifically centred around âinvolvingâ, âcollaborating withâ and âempoweringâ citizens in decision-making activities. The next section will explore these tools and programmes together with the principles underpinning SMGâs citizen engagement strategy."
293,271,0.984,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","USA, such as a greater respect for social justice and a more open and informal mentality, the developmental effects of this kind of return remain limited. This is termed the return of conservatism. For those who remain abroad yet longer, the integration process becomes more advanced and migrants become increasingly attuned to US society and its ways of life and values. This also diminishes the likelihood of return, but for those who do go back, the potential for real developmental impact is greater. This third phase, the return of innovation, brings new ideas, energies, and business practices which, provided there is fertile terrain for their application in the homeland context, can indeed stimulate development. Such returnees are, however, a minority in the overall return-migrant population, and their desire and potential for change are often stifled by the entrenched power of local non-migrant elites. The final stage of return is that of retirement, when well-integrated migrants feel the pull of nostalgia at the end of their working lives; but, being economically inactive, their developmental impact is limited. Although the Cerase model is intuitively attractive and logical, and has been much cited, its limitations are obvious. Its interpretation of development is largely âeconomic modernizationâ, and it reduces integration to a one-dimensional linear process. A more robust and nuanced conceptualization of integration is developed in studies that statistically model various dimensions of integration according to a variety of transnational orientations towards the home country including remittancesending, paying regular visits, and attitudes towards return migration (see Cela et al. 2013; De Haas and Fokkema 2011; Fokkema et al. 2013). What these studies tend to demonstrate is that migrants who are economically well integrated in the host country are more likely to have meaningful transnational engagement with their origin-country society, including sending remittances and other actions with positive developmental outcomes, such as business investment. On the other hand, migrants who are socio-culturally well integrated are more likely to become detached from their home country and therefore less actively involved in transnational activities that might lead to development. This contrasting correlationâpositive between economic integration, transnationalism, and development and negative for socio-cultural integrationâs impactâseems to hold for both first- and secondgeneration migrants, according to the studies cited above, which are based on a variety of migrant groups in different countries.6 Alongside these quantitative analyses are studies that take a more intuitive approach. Erdal and Oeppen (2013) describe the relationship between integration and transnationalism as a âbalancing actâ whereby the migrant straddles two societies. Reviewing the literature, Erdal and Oeppen (2013, 875) find that outcomes are highly context-specific, depending on place, type of migration, and within the same migration system, also varying over time (see also Snel et al. 2006). One issue with Erdal and Oeppenâs analysis, To be specific, Cela et al. (2013) look at Eastern Europeans (Poles, Ukrainians, Moldovans, Romanians, and Albanians) in Italy; De Haas and Fokkema (2011) study African migrants in Southern Europe (Moroccans and Senegalese in Spain, Egyptians and Ghanaians in Italy); whilst Fokkema et al. (2013) examine the remittance behaviour of second-generation Turks, Moroccans, and people of Yugoslav heritage in several European cities."

In terms of the CAâs direct impact on social welfare policies, there have been two networks in particular that have achieved significant results: the first one is the Network of Centres for Children and Teens, which has agreed on one model for all the cityâs centres, both public and private, providing assistance for children and teens at risk. The other one is the Network for Assistance to the Homeless, which has created a solid network for the exchange of resources and information. Network of Centres for Children and Teens This network is formed by 17 organisations and was established in April 2006. Its aim is to improve the cityâs responsiveness to children and adolescents in situations of social risk. It was an initiative of the organisations that manage or run centres for children and teens (outside school hours), the aim of which was to gain greater recognition for the work they were doing. Through the network, the member organisations would work on developing a common model of care for young people for all the centres in the city, even though managed by different entities. Today there is one model for the centres agreed upon by all. During the work carried out, new centres have been established, and today there are centres that depend on the city and centres that depend on the social organisations, all of them with the same programme for teens and children. Network for Assistance to the Homeless This network was created in November 2005 and consists of 26 organisations and federations. The social organisations participating in the network are committed to working together to help homeless persons regain autonomy and social relations. Various working groups were established and together they have carried out diverse actions, such as the following: a count of the number of homeless persons in Barcelona; preparation of a document with proposals on how to improve healthcare for the mentally ill; coming to agreement on proposals for action; sharing information and data and creating an open online catalogue of all the resources and services available through government and other entities. The network has representation and dialogue with officials of local and regional government. The administration, politicians and professionals with responsibility in this area have embraced this new way of working horizontally with third sector organisations. This network has made it possible to create a new form of governance in this area."

This has been caused at times by nationalism, concerns over potential âcontainmentâ policies by the West, and internal differences over the future direction of Chinaâs international relations. As such, one of the most visible ways by which Beijing is attempting to satisfy the dueling demands of building both military and soft power internationally, while under considerable global scrutiny, is through its commitments to UN peacekeeping. Chinaâs increased engagement with international peacekeeping missions has been acknowledged as a necessary building block for the development of Chinese soft power, as well as promoting the idea of China as an âinternationally socialized countryâ (Guo 2007; Wuthnow 2008) and a âresponsible powerâ. The latter concept, facilitates the development of Chinese peacekeeping policy by allowing Beijing to define its own peacekeeping role, to further integrate into the international system without necessarily adhering to Western foreign policy models, to critique the international system, and to underscore that China is developing into an atypical great power which respects international sovereignty (Richardson 2011). Moreover, Chinaâs peacekeeping commitments since the 1990s have allowed that countryâs military to operate far away from Chinese soil without triggering anxieties from its neighbors or the United States in the wake of Beijingâs expanded military budgets and capabilities. By the beginning of this century, China was openly supportive of the peacekeeping idea both as a way of prompting peaceful multilateral settlement of disputes and as a means to include its armed forces in âMilitary Operations other than War,â or Mootw, including humanitarian missions, disaster relief and increasingly peacekeeping missions. The concept was borrowed from American postâCold War military terminology to refer to noncombat military operations (Gill and Huang 2009; Fravel 2011). Southeast Asia had been a major beneficiary of Beijingâs changed views on peacekeeping, as Beijing was supportive of the development of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) in 1992â1993 despite Chinaâs difficult history with that conflict. China was also willing to send civilian policy to assist with the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), despite the fact that the major element of that deployment was to prepare for the independence of Timor-Leste (Lanteigne 2014). China has been traditionally wary of international intervention in separatist crises out of concern for precedent,"
72,263,0.984,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion This chapter has examined the link between citizen engagement and social innovation in the context of Seoul City. SMG was going through a rapid change in the way it worked with citizens under the leadership of Mayor Wonsoon Park. The motto âcitizens are mayorsâ was embedded in the new models of communication and citizen engagement was seen as one of the core elements that could catalyse social innovation. SMG was starting to understand that citizens were âexperts in their own livesâ (The Young Foundation, 2012) and that citizen involvement in the policy-making process helped to draw out social needs and identify potential solutions (Bason, 2010). In particular, the EunPyeoung Mobile Mayoral Office showed that bringing together key decision-makers with residents brought about deeper insights into the problem at hand. Furthermore, this type of engagement forged new collaborations and interactions between citizens, civil servants and policy makers, going beyond usual working partners, âcreating new roles and relationships, developing assets and capabilitiesâ and âbetter using assets and resourcesâ (The Young Foundation, 2012), thereby enhancing societyâs resilience and capacity to act. There were challenges to SMGâs citizen engagement and communication strategies. Due to the nature of the tools, there may have been limited representation of diverse voices. These tools may have been adequate for only a limited range of problems and were resource-intensive to administer. There was a need to ensure that long-term sustainability of these engagement approaches did not depend on one leader. Perhaps the biggest challenge lay in encouraging trust between citizens, public officers, civic groups and experts to work together and co-create new solutions. Past experiences led many South Koreans to think that citizen engagement processes were a waste of time and this created a sense of apathy towards citizen engagement activities."

Consequently, the EU reflects and compounds the largely negative stance of the member states towards migration. In fact, much of EU migration policymaking could be described as âreactive and piecemealâ, as has been observed of Greek policymaking (Triandafyllidou 2009). The focus is on the control of immigration, particularly that defined as âillegalâ immigration, rather than on the development of a comprehensive common migration policy. As control of borders is prioritised, Frontex acts as coordinator of the member statesâ frontline in a war against âillegalâ migration.

The effects of this conflict are devastating for all concerned. â¢ Stock mortality with radical herd decline initiated a major exit of northern villagers toward Lake Turkana. Most household heads in the upland plains region knew of at least one or two nearby villages whose residents had already departed for the lake. A few said that they too were considering moving in that direction, as well. (Some village heads indicated that they might instead move to a town in order to increase their chances of receiving food aid.) â¢ Food and other essentials available in local markets are priced beyond the reach of most householdsâeven those fortunate enough to generate income from household/village based commodity production. â¢ Internal social problems accompanying such economic stress are also on the increase. Many elders flatly state that they no longer have authority over the actions of their young men and that such problems are a radical departure from earlier times. The decline of customary traditional authority relations most likely results from a combination of influences including government administrative systems imposed on the Turkana, economic disenfranchisement and displacement of communities, access to weapons (providing young Turkana men with a new sense of power and independence), and privatization of Turkana lands and resource âcommonsâ."

Here, it is important to make lessons learned and data gathered from existing cases more widely available. New pilot or demonstration projects should also be promoted and invested in which are collaborative in nature and strengthen the links between researchers, practitioners and relevant community stakeholders. Finally, the targeted involvement of groups that are perhaps not traditionally interested in drainage matters, such as those in the health or transport sectors, and encouragement of exchanges between companies having implemented SUDS and those pursuing purely grey solutions can also benefit the mainstreaming of SUDS. These efforts can in turn strengthen the âbusiness caseâ for SUDS by instilling more confidence in and drawing attention to their wider benefits produced, low comparative associated costs, and climate change compatible nature. Such evidence will help to refute public and political hesitation as compares to traditional grey infrastructure approaches to water management. Highlighting the delivery of the multiple benefits produced in addition to flood protection which traditional engineered flood protection schemes cannot deliver is a central element. New businessmodels for public-private partnerships are a further aspect of this process, combining blue/green spaces, human well-being, water management and climate change adaptation interests (see Box 8.2 for an example). Establishing such âbusiness caseâ arguments will serve as the foundation for increased investment, public and political support and ultimately SUDS deployment. Once confidence exists that SUDS are effective and affordable as a nature-based solution technology, governments can increasingly support wider implementation. Means to do so include establishing an adequate legal framework that builds upon the evidence gathered and â alongside financial agreements/investment banks â helping to bridge the gap between short-term thinking and long-term investments via intentional regulatory design. At the EU level and in other industrialized countries, potential actions could experiment with and adjust institutional settings, considering alternative local capacities and site-specific cultural aspects. By requiring use of the technology and establishing duties for adoption and maintenance, governments can ensure the implementation of SUDS and facilitate a transition to becoming a âbusiness as usualâ option and highlight the importance of such an approach as a national priority. More specifically, national regulators can use their authority to more actively accelerate and improve SUDS development by adopting standardized monitoring and reporting protocols and guidance and by incentivising and highlighting the importance of voluntary monitoring. A strong evidence base exists which demonstrates the effectiveness of SUDS and highlights their promise as a sustainable solution to reduce urban flooding. Yet, the significant potential for more widespread uptake remains largely untapped. Further targeted actions are necessary for increasing the acceptance and application of this nature-based solution and realizing its full potential."

These costs tend to crystallize in the political organization of Latin American societies, which aims to preserve and enhance social inequality and to keep the rural poor and indigenous populations out of political decisions. The Latin American literature is very closely related to the arguments advanced by European and Anglo-Saxon ecological economists and ecological sociologists. The ï¬rst have shown that the economic growth experienced by Latin American countries during natural resource booms has only been achieved on the basis of an unequal exchange of material ï¬ow (Vallejo, 2009; MartÃ­nez-Alier et al., 2010; Muradian et al., 2012). Similarly, Muradian et al. (2012) have noted that recent technological innovations in the extractive industries have made the exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon deposits â located in remote areas inhabited by indigenous peoples (the Ecuadorian and Bolivian Amazon, for example) â economically proï¬table. The expansion of the âextractive frontierâ implies the accelerated destruction of ecosystems that are essential for planetary survival, along with an increase in socioenvironmental conï¬icts that put the cohesion of Latin American, and especially Andean, societies at risk. Environmentalist literature has made visible two innate elements of the rentier basis of the Bolivian and Ecuadorian states. First, the construction of rentier states represents a set of enormous environmental and social costs that are not only ignored by the literature of political economy and development economics but are also actively kept out of public discussion by academics, international ï¬nancial institutions and the governments that have controlled these states. Second, the set of rules that govern the extractive industries in the rentier states is insufï¬cient to achieve the objective of an environmental governance that ensures the sustainability of societies. The set of debates that I have outlined allows me to present the central argument of this chapter in order to display and analyse in the next section the evidence offered by Bolivia and Ecuador on what I have called âpost-neoliberal environmental governanceâ. Analytically, post-neoliberal environmental governance in Bolivia and Ecuador â and possibly in other Latin American rentier states â can be understood as a system of three layers. In the centre would be the rules of natural resources governance. These are the rules that govern the extraction of resources and the production of revenues for the states. At this level the number of actors is minimal since it only includes governmental elites, certain state agencies and the companies (public and/or private) that conduct mining activities."

This can be countered, however, by observations in several places that pastoral women are gaining more opportunities, livestock marketing is more prevalent, communications have improved, and access of some populations to public services and political processes is better. And, although conflict persists, some case-study sites have seen peaceful transitions to more democratic systems of government where pastoralists are freer to make their own choices when compared to their lives under dictatorial, totalitarian regimes. It is probably most accurate to say that there has been a mix of failure and progressâperhaps with the former dominating. The process of development and change will always yield winners and losers. And some may logically argue that the proposition as to whether research and development have led to meaningful changes in developing-country rangelands is unfair. There are many arenas in the world where the progress of humanity, or lack thereof, cannot be attributed to the incremental contributions of researchers or change agents. Academics and others charged with a research mandate rarely also have a mandate to achieve real-world impact on the human subjects they study. Similarly, development agents at the forefront of change are often ill equipped or unmotivated to document impacts they observe. Much that happens therefore goes unrecorded, whether positive or negative. Achieving impact, in any case, is doubly difficult in places such as developing-country rangelands where the residents are often voiceless in their national political discourse, and the natural resources they depend upon have been regarded as having little economic value. It is difficult to promote positive change for marginalized people living on marginalized lands under the best of conditions. Despite all this, it remains quite reasonable that we can celebrate even the small steps in positive directions that have been achieved. The contributors to this chapter were polled and asked whether they felt that their work had any demonstrable impact on the people or resources in the six case-study sites. The poll results were understandably mixed. There are three instances, however, where there is clear evidence of impact from combined research and development activities. As previously noted, systemic change has also occurred in both the Altiplano and northern Mexico, but such change is very broad scaled and cannot be directly attributable to contributions from our coauthors; thus it will not be detailed further. For Afghanistan, Schloeder and Jacobs describe their conflict mitigation program that was undertaken from 2008 to 2012.44 They trained 560 leaders from 31 provinces in conflict mediation/mitigation methods; these trainees then have proceeded to resolve 3450 conflicts in both farming and herding communities along 5 major migration routes. Over half of these conflicts dealt with access and user rights to land, forage, and water; the remainder was comprised of social conflicts. About 204,600 households were positively impacted by these efforts. The ripple effect continues as of this writing, despite that the project ended in 2012."

Such organizations played active roles in anti-state efforts to bring down the military dictator, until Chun eventually stepped down in the face of ongoing public demonstrations and protests.66 Those 40 years of authoritarianism shaped the advocacy-focused, antistate nature of Korean civil society. Even today, the most influential and prominent organizations are advocacy groups concerned with issues such as the environment, womenâs rights, and social justice.67 Now there are 7600 such organizations, the majority of which were founded in the 1990s. And, in the words of Bidet, authoritarian governmentsâ âinstrumentalizationâ of non-governmental organizations and civil society groups whose activities and projects were well in line with their policy objectives also laid the foundation for various SDOs and the overall nonprofit sector. That legacy also presents Korea with particular challenges. Donors recognize Korean civil societyâs heavy sway toward advocacy groups, and that makes some wary; many philanthropists (usually chaebol, the Korean term for family dominated conglomerates) are reluctant to donate their money to charity and partner with local NGOs, alternatively seeking to work by themselves via private foundations or to work together with the government.68 This distrust is not one-sided. Because Koreaâs wealthy elite traditionally maintained close ties with military regimes, their lack of civic participation against authoritarianism makes them remnants of authoritarianism. The recent scandal of Korean conglomeratesâ shady donations to former President Park Geun-hye has reaffirmed this suspicion of Korean society against the wealthy, exacerbating distrust between the people and potential philanthropists."

However, they operate in the safe areas in the north. WB and ADB support projects selected, and designed by the government. Both institutions fund such mutually agreed projects but monitor them rigorously. In the case of KFW, the government proposes but they have own priority; procurement is by them, but there is close coordination with the government. The government proposes projects to India, which then implements it. Afghanistan has seen high, if fluctuating, growth rates since 2001. This has created jobs in the service sector. However, necessary skills are at a premium, so there are limitations to growth being driven by it. This is particularly so since external agencies and external financial support is being retrenched. Since literacy rates are still very low, only agriculture and related activities like food processing, dairy and so on can drive growth. A number of respondents suggested that India should step up its support for this sector. With Chinaâs recent decision to gift Afghanistan a few hundred tractors, one respondent wanted joint IndiaâChina support for agricultural development. Many specifically referred to India as Afghanistanâs âbest friendâ and the general expectation of respondents that it should do more, specifically âjust keep helping us in every possible way.â Besides the general comments were some specific examples and suggestions that could be used both to influence Indiaâs approach to development assistance specifically as well help evolve global consensus on facilitating peacebuilding and State-building. Indiaâs record in executing big projects, other than NEPS, was seen as something that needs improvement, even accounting for the insecure areas where Indian projects were (eastern Herat, Farah, etc.) and problems of transit through Pakistan. The reliance on Indian state-owned enterprises was identified as the reason for this unsatisfactory state of affairs. Lack of supervision and monitoring along with lack of discretionary decisionmaking with the Indian Embassy in Kabul were also issues, for example, once Delhi tightened the screws and accepted greater local discretion both the Salma dam and the parliament building project picked up momentum and finished far faster than what its progress till date had shown possible."
334,354,0.984,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"By analyzing different initiatives, we have stressed that the positionality within, and against, the dominant migration regime is the crucial starting point for the selforganization of refugees and migrants. These groups all shared the idea of developing self-organized political practice and resistance grounded in the specific situation of the social group in order to defend their rights and shape their political demands. Critically, one main strategy of the migration regime has been to isolate refugees and migrants, deny them a legitimate subject position, and silence their voices (Monforte and Dufour 2013; AtaÃ§ et al. 2015; Schwiertz 2016a; Mokre 2018; Hinger et al. 2018). As a result, when these activists make their demands public, it is a key moment of self-organization, as they are making their own situation visible. Most groups emerge from an attempt to organize themselves and build a structure due to their personal issues and problems. And it is from this point that they develop and raise their demands. For Lampedusa in Hamburg, this was the right to stay in the city, but also more specifically the permission to work and gain recognition of their Italian documents. In asylum-seeker protests, such as the Refugee Protest March to Berlin, the right to stay is also a central claim. However, they are also"
371,12,0.984,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"This edited volume focuses on migration as a speciï¬c strategy developed by EU citizens to adjust to an adverse socio-economic environment. In particular, we propose to look at the mobility of EU citizens proceeding from the Southern European Member States that have been most affected by the crisis (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain) and moving to Northern European Member States, where the job market has remained attractive in spite of the crisis (Belgium, France, Germany, United Kingdom). In other words, this book seeks an answer to the following question: have old South-North migration routes within Europe reopened? More precisely, our objective for this volume is twofold. First, we intend to identify the scale and nature of this new Southern European wave of emigration and the socio-economic integration of these migrants within Northern European destination countries. This will be achieved through a quantitative analysis of the most recent data on the ï¬ows and proï¬les of this new labour force using databases from both sending and receiving countries (labour force surveys, census records, migration ofï¬ce statistics on national and EU levels, Eurobarometer surveys, etc.). Such analysis will, overall, point to the differences and similarities between this current wave of Southern European migration and previous ones. However, as the different chapters in this volume show, quantitative data often presents limitations that invite us to use such information with great care. For instance, the measurement of the migration ï¬ows of EU citizens can be undermined by the voluntary non-registration of EU migrants with the authorities in both the home and the host country. EU migrants do not have a strong incentive to register as permanent residents in the host country. In fact, they may have important reasons not to deregister as residents in their home country; for example, to avoid losing entitlements to health care provision, social security rights or unemployment insurance, amongst others. Alternatively, not registering with the host country authorities may be a conscious strategy by EU citizens concerned about the removal of their residence permit if they are in a ï¬nancially precarious situation (see Chap. 7). In addition, the circular nature of migratory moves applies to a non-negligible number of Southern Europeans. Some migrants may thus not be interested in registering upon arrival if they plan a short-term stay. Such data limitations entail the possibility that recent migrantsâlike the newly arrived Southern Europeansâare under-represented in ofï¬cial data, while longerterm migrants, who arrived well before the crisis, are over-represented. As underlined in Chap. 8, well-settled migrants with stable housing and jobs are more likely to be included in large surveys such as the Labour Force Survey than are new migrants in a precarious housing situation. Second, this book will look at the politics and policies of immigration from the perspective of both the sending and the receiving nations. Because of the uncertainties regarding the proï¬le and motivations of those who leave their home country, Southern European governments have been speculating on the impact of this loss of labour force and on the appropriate policy response to adopt. Similarly, Northern European governments have had mixed attitudes towards this new inï¬ux of EU citizens. Reactions in Northern Europe have varied: some countries have set up programmes to actively recruit and train these migrants, while others have promulgated the stigmatization of mobile EU citizens. In this volume, each chapter has designed"

In this regard, stakeholders in environmental management in the BNP were identified and grouped in order to define their importance and establish appropriate dialogue (Fig. 14.4). It is likely that appropriate stakeholdersâ information about the measures that they plan to apply (e.g. long-term strategies for mowing, participation in environmental schemes, change in the type of land use) can be included in impact-assessment and ecosystem response analysis with the use of modelling tools (e.g. Wassen et al. 2011). Such an approach would become an integrated feedback assessment tool for the climate change â stakeholder reaction and environmental response. Four groups with different levels of interest and influence were identified: key players, context setters, subjects and the crowd (Fig. 14.4). Among the stakeholders, which were defined as the âkey playersâ in the adaptive management process in BNP, there are farmers, land owners, land managers and the Regional Environmental Conservation Directorate (RECD) (Pol.: Regionalna Dyrekcja Ochrony SÌrodowiska). In case of the most challenging discussed âextremeâ scenario of climate change in 2070â2100, the most critical reaction of those groups is expected due to their legislative context. Farmers, land owners and land managers, all substantially benefitting from the presence of the unique habitats on their land (by obtaining EU environmental subsidies for rare species such as Acrocephalus paludicola and Crex crex), are expected to increase their pressure to drain the Biebrza mires as those measures are subsidised. In this regard, the RECD, as the key player responsible for management measures approval on Natura 2000 sites, will face the appropriate environmental evaluation of prospective initiatives, such as drainage. However, the utmost challenge in this process will be to deal with valuable habitats threatened by the same, direct climate change impacts as for the agriculture. The discussed, possible"
164,21,0.984,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","The social exclusion approach overlaps with the concept of marginality when it is seen as a condition and process of âbecoming detached from the organizations and communities of which the society is composed and from the rights and obligations that they embodyâ (Room 1995, 243). In Chap. 3 (this volume) Zohir emphasizes that in relation to exclusion: In all development endeavors over the last two decades or more, either in the guise of Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), or to achieve greater equity and foster inclusive growth, the general concern was reaching out to those who are âleft outââ¦[where]â¦âleft outâsâ could be children not being sent to schools by their parents, poor rural women unable to avail themselves of health services or market opportunities, people from minority or socially outcast groups having little or no access to jobs and public amenities, and the physically or mentally disabled. We refer to these people or social groups as âexcludedâ and to the broader subject of study as âexclusion.â"
366,269,0.984,"The Future of the Law of the Sea : Bridging Gaps Between National, Individual and Common Interests","Arctic Council has taken initiative to negotiate even binding regional agreements in areas beyond national jurisdiction through past efforts such as the Agreement on Cooperation and Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response and the Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement.79 The precedent of binding treaties in waters beyond membersâ EEZs could serve as grounds for a regional treaty creating MPAs even beyond EEZs, though only binding for the eight Arctic states and other parties that choose to accede to the treaty through future signature and ratification. Such a regional legal arrangement may prove to be more politically expedient compared to a UNCBD additional protocol or an UNCLOS implementing agreement. Common needs in the Arctic have resulted in notable past regional cooperation and governance arrangements. The Arctic Council possesses a mandate to protect the Arctic environment by way of the Ottawa Declaration, reaffirmed by the Arctic coastal states in the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration. Greenpeace suggests that the Arctic Councilâs mandate to protect the Arctic environment might give it grounds for greater action, extending even beyond its respective countriesâ borders. Past Arctic Council initiatives resulted in a number of binding and nonbinding agreements relating to the marine environment, creating precedent for regional approaches to Arctic Ocean governance. A binding agreement, to be concluded within the auspices of the Arctic Council, among the Arctic Eight might be used to coordinate MPA creation in the Arctic ABNJ. Further, PAMEâs existing work to create a pan-Arctic MPA network among the Arctic EEZs provides a reasonable foundation for an extension of the network into the high seas. A regional-agreement-based MPA does not legally bind a nonstate party, thus remaining compliant with international law and UNCLOS. Further, coordination with international bodies such as the IMO is considered necessary to ensure that creation of an MPA in the high seas does not violate existing international maritime law.80 Compliance with UNCLOS does limit the ability of such a regional agreement to enforce high sea MPA observance among nonmembers. However, such regional agreement can establish powerful normative guidance and also achieve nonparty compliance through mutual observer status, which would establish reciprocity for the mutual acknowledgement of participating partiesâ protected areas. For instance, the OSPAR Convention cannot enforce MPAs for international actors not party to the Convention (abiding by UNCLOS), but the Convention has mechanisms to engage nonparty states operating in OSPAR waters. The 17 contracting parties can invite nonparty states to accede to the Convention, often through arrangements of mutual observer status or memorandums of understanding (MoUs), thus making the MPA in ABNJ more enforceable while acknowledging freedom of the high seas. Thus, an Arctic-style regional agreement modeled after OSPAR could provide a robust marine environmental governance regime."
99,262,0.984,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"As the interviewees representing the three innovations reported almost unanimously, cooperation with district authorities and councillors and, vice versa, with childcare and family care providers is marked by mutual understanding and very much focused on issues and problem-solving. For instance, heads of family centres and project leaders praise the district authorities for their support and local pragmatism (e.g. when dealing with legal requirements) but accuse the senate (which decides the budget for Berlinâs family-minded policies) for its lack of action. Actually, the political clout of the local coalition for child and family issues at the district level remains rather weak. Both, project operators and district authorities are equally âsupplicantsâ of the Senate that cannot do much except put forward arguments for more financial support. On the other hand, their powerlessness in terms of budget planning reinforces the bonding effect among local actors, who perceive themselves equally as victims of the Senateâs austerity policy, which is regarded as family unfriendly."

Using the combined approach, this paper discusses the effect of using different sets of control groups on estimates of treatment effects of the agricultural extension system in Uganda, the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) program. The goal of the NAADS program, which was initiated in 2001, is to increase incomes through increased adoption of profitable agricultural enterprises and improved technologies and practices, agricultural productivity, and marketed output. The program aims at targeting the economically-active poorâthose with limited physical and financial assets, skills and knowledgeâthrough farmer groups based on specific enterprises identified by farmers (NAADS 2007). Although the program is a public intervention, farmers have to decide whether to participate in the program or not. When a farmer decides to participate, he or she has to do so through membership of a NAADS-participating farmer group. Then, together with the members of the group, and with members of other NAADS-participating groups, they request for specific technologies and advisory services associated with their preferred enterprises and obtain grants to procure those technologies and related advisory services. The grant is initially used to finance the establishment of a technology development site (TDS) for demonstrations and training, and proceeds (outputs or sale of outputs) from the TDS become a revolving fund for members of the group. The main channel of impact of the program is thus via farmersâ access to this grant. Knowledge and skills gained from the activities surrounding the TDS, as well as from select farmers trained to provide follow-up advisory services [community-based facilitators (CBFs)], are also very important. The program is expected to generate indirect or spillover effects to the extent that the TDSs, NAADS service providers and CBFs are accessible as sources of knowledge and skills to other farmers in the community where the program is implemented. Estimating these indirect effects involves identifying farmers that have benefited from the program in such a manner, which is potentially challenging due to possible misclassification of service providers. For example, the governmentâs regular extension service and NGOs operated in the same areas as the NAADS program. Since some ex-government extension workers and NGOs are occasionally contracted to provide NAADS services, it is possible for them to be wrongly associated with the NAADS program even when they are operating outside the NAADS framework. Spillovers across program boundaries or communities through information flow among farmers and from non-NAADS service providers using the NAADS framework are also possible. We discuss the implications of these from using different controls groups. Next, we present the data and evaluation method, followed by the results, conclusions, and implications."
381,182,0.984,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Reassessing the Federal Role First, we should de-emphasize the role of the federal Department of Education in K-12 standards-based reform from defining and enforcing the details of school reform to a collegial support role. The states and districts will have an unprecedented challenge to implement the Common Core in addition to their other duties. Common Core has created a host of new policy questions that must be made by states and districts, not by the federal government or the Common Core national administration. These include which assessment system to choose; how to phase in these new assessments and standards into already complex systems of curriculum, testing, and accountability; how to produce or purchase curriculum materials that will serve their needs and comport with Common Core standards; how to provide the requisite teacher education and professional development; and how to guarantee that students in the least effective schools will have equal access to what they need to achieve in the Common Core. Given the importance of these decisions, which will manifest themselves differently in the various states, it may be an opportune time to reconsider the relationship between the federal Department of Education and the statesâ role in providing high-quality education and increasing educational opportunity. Aside from challenges of the Common Core, there is a renewed sense among many educators that the states are âwhere the action isâ and that on many matters the states can assess their needs, capacities, and priorities better than the federal government. This is not suggested in the spirit of a âkinder, gentlerâ face of the department or to âreduceâ the federal role but to suggest some changes given the giant workload Common Core will generate for the districts and the states. Furthermore, in this past 23 years of standards-based reform, the states have had ample time to develop reform systems and accountability; most have more capacity than they have ever had. One example of federal-state cooperation is suggested by a recent article about California having some documented success with a state program of more extensive on-site technical assistance in individual districts (Strunk and McEachin 2014). If such successes continue, the Department of Education could disseminate information about California and subsidize state education agencies so they can create such units or use Californiaâs insights to strengthen their present technical assistance programs. The relationship between Common Core and the Department of Education will continue to exist. It is hard to imagine that there will not be issues where adjustments might have to be made in federal regulations or in Common Core procedures. One important area might be the relation of the Common Coreâs heightened standards to possible disparate effects on economically disadvantaged students, students"
106,99,0.984,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Evolving Community Policing Models and the Impact of Social Network Community Policing (CP) is built on the belief that people deserve and have a right âto have a sayâ in policing in exchange for their participation and support (Kenney and McNamara 1999). CP is âThe process of enabling the participation of citizens and communities in policing at their chosen level, ranging from providing information and reassurance, to empowering them to identify and implement solutions to local problems and influence strategic priorities and decisionsâ (Trottier 2015). CP has become the paradigm of contemporary policing, evolving significantly over the past years (Johnston 2005; Tilley 2008). The CP evolution initiated with 1st Generation and âInnovationâ (1979â1986) where early CP initiatives were referenced as âexperimentsâ and âdemonstration projectsâ. From 1987 to 1994 CP continued evolving with the âDiffusionâ phase and focused on drugs and fear of crime issues. The third generation known as âInstitutionalizationâ continues from 1995 up to date with a broader scope of CP activities (Peak 2013). Nowadays, a major difference to the classic CP studies of Whyte (1943), Gans (1982) and others is the emergence and spread of social media networks and mobile internet devices. Manning (2011) recognized the importance of technological components (modules) in a police-designed Social Network required to serve the police needs and support crime mapping and analysis. In addition, the rise of virtual communities and âhorizontalâ online social networks have complicated the"
224,317,0.984,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"equality between men and women was also enshrined in the legal instruments of the African Union (AU). In 2003 at Maputo, the AU Heads of State adopted the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoplesâ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol). This protocol calls for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, including the condemnation and prohibition of harmful practices against women and the assurance of equal rights in marriage for men and women. The right to food security was also explicitly included in the Maputo Protocol, calling for the provision of women with âaccess to clean drinking water, sources of domestic fuel, land, and the means of producing nutritious foodâ (African Union 2003, Art. 15). However, while 46 of the 53 member countries of the African Union had signed the protocol by 2010, only 28 countries had also ratified it (African Union 2010). Despite ratification, the laws and institutional structures required for the protocolâs implementation are not yet in place throughout these 28 countries. In a study by Nwakeze (2006) womenâs access to productive resources in Nigeriaâa country that has signed but not yet ratified the Maputo Protocolâis empirically analysed, exemplifying the broader consequences of institutional weakness. Nwakeze found that 69 % of the female respondents in the study indicated that they do not own land. This was not surprising because the case study was carried out in Anambra State in the south-eastern region of Nigeria, an area inhabited primarily by the Igbo who live in a patriarchal society where the line of inheritance normally passes through the sons. This limited control over land also affects womenâs access to credit because land is often required as collateral. Gender budgeting initiatives are another example of attempts to improve womenâs access to productive resources and unleash their economic potential. Gender budgeting is a broad and encompassing phrase for government efforts that seek to address gender issues in the domain of public expenditure and policy. Australia and South Africa were the pioneers in gender budgeting initiatives, and other African countries including Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Uganda have adopted similar measures. Stotsky (2007) argues that reducing economic disadvantages for women can lead to higher economic growth and to greater stability. Similarly, Buvinic and King (2007) assert that greater gender equality in terms of access to opportunities, rights, and political empowerment can lead to a more efficient economy and improved institutions. However, this link between the promotion of gender equality and overall economic and social well-being has hardly entered into the mainstream political arena. Measures taken to promote equality for African women have not yet succeeded in thoroughly improving their situation."
127,84,0.984,Young People's Perceptions of Europe in a Time of Change : IEA International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 European Report,"Main findings and implications for policy and practice Within its overarching purpose of investigating the ways in which young people are prepared to undertake their roles as citizens in a range of countries and through its questionnaire for students in participating European countries, the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2016 (ICCS 2016) addressed issues related to the specific European context and to the problems currently facing Europe. Decreased solidarity together with the increase in populist, nationalist, anti-establishment political parties in several European countries are the factors complicating dynamics linked not only to the original project of European integration but also to the economic and political relationships between countries (Archick, 2017). Furthermore, in recent years, public debate in Europe has been characterized by broad questions relating to citizensâ sense of belonging to Europe, the need for stronger cooperation among European countries, and concerns about immigration and the effects of the financial crisis. In addition to demographic changes, European countries are facing comprehensive and intertwined problems such as pollution and economic crisis. The rising demand for democratic participation is often connected to a sense that the established governance procedures are proving inadequate (Hennette, Piketty, Sacriste, & Vauchez, 2017). These issues explain why the European ICCS 2016 research team paid special attention to migration and to freedom of movement within Europe, and viewed these matters against a background encompassing perspectives focused on increasing integration and cooperation among European countries and on the wider milieu of the financial crisis. Within this context, the European student questionnaire also explored studentsâ attitudes toward Europe and the extent to which students felt they belonged to it, as well as their perceptions of Europeâs likely future. This chapter summarizes the main findings from the ICCS 2016 European student questionnaire with regards to studentsâ perceptions of their being European and their opportunities to learn about Europe at school. It also summarizes the findings on studentsâ attitudes toward freedom and restriction of movement and immigration in Europe, and to studentsâ perceptions of Europe and the future of Europe."
181,6,0.984,Global Perspectives On Recognising Non-Formal and informal Learning : Why Recognition Matters (Volume 21.0),"Series Editors Introduction Worldwide, countries are examining what role education and schooling can play in contributing to a more just, equitable and peaceful world, where there is sustainable economic and social development for all, and the end of poverty. In doing this countries recognize a need to re-engineer education for change: that is, rather than just âtinkering with the existing systemâ, to examine the fundamental, often taken for granted and unexamined values and practices upon which current education and schooling systems are built, and to modify (or even rebuild) these from their foundation upwards. Countries already know the range of education challenges and stumbling blocks that need to be confronted to achieve the improvement of education and schooling for change. These are well researched and documented. But do countries have the courage and commitment, and political will, to take the necessary action? These are amongst the matters addressed by Madhu Singh, a researcher at the UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning in Hamburg, in this important book which examines the importance of re-engineering education for change by moving away from the limited notion of âeducationâ for all, to that of âlearningâ for all, and to placing an increasing emphasis on non-formal and informal learning, rather than largely focusing on learning that occurs in the formal education system in institutions such as schools and colleges. Singh surveys global perspectives on the importance of non-formal and informal learning, and of giving greater recognition to such forms of learning, rather than just that which occurs in formal education institutions, which traditionally tends to be the emphasis of researchers, policy makers and practitioners. The reason is that much of the most important learning that occurs for individuals and groups in societies worldwide is not that which occurs in formal settings in schools or colleges, but that which occurs through informal and non-formal means, from family, friends,"
371,45,0.984,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"Since the start of the economic crisis of 2007/2008, political and public discourse increasingly challenge the freedom of movement of people within EU as an absolute right. Alarmed by the prospect of large inflows from the Central and Eastern European member states upon the end of the transition restrictions, numerous political leaders have spoken publicly on taking measures to âcontrolâ migration from the other EU member states. The anticipation of the end of restrictions for Romanian and Bulgarian workers in January 2014 âwhile most European countries were facing their own internal economic crisisâ triggered a wave of anti-immigration reactions in the EU as well as outside of it (see Barbulescu 2014). In the spring of 2013, ministers of four member states â UK, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands-wrote a joint letter to the European Commission and Council [at that time under Irish Presidency] warning it of the fact that some cities in their countries were being put âunder a considerable strain by certain immigrants from other member statesâ (Ministers of Interior of Austria, the Netherlands, UK and Germany 2013). The letter called for tougher controls for freemovers including efficient repatriations and re-entry bans: â[a]ll necessary measures need to be taken to deal with the consequences of this type of immigration and to fight its causes. This includes legal as well as financial measures.â Interestingly, the member states refer to freedom of movement as âthis type of immigrationâ and pleads for new âlegalâ measures to tackle it. The letter is important because it makes visible an emergent coalition of freedom of movement hardliners amongst the North-Western EU member states who, not accidently, have also been the main receivers of migration from the other member states. In response, a parallel coalition supporting freedom of movement emerged and brought the Scandinavian countries and the Central and Eastern European states together. The ministers of Sweden, Finland and Norway jumped in defence of freedom of movement in a joint letter set to the Financial Times (January 2014).

169,546,0.984,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"At the same time, transboundary river basin management is facing a number of challenges, not only relating to the mechanism of basin management itself (and thus, for instance, to the human, technical, and ï¬nancial capacity required for effective basin management) but also to the broader context of transboundary water cooperation. Three challenges appear to be particularly problematic in this regard: ï¬rstly, the fact that national interests of basin-sharing countries often differ or even are in outright conï¬ict makes the management of water resources across borders very problematic. Consequently and secondly, riparian states often pursue infrastructure development projects that exclusively meet their national (short-term) development needs and do not consider transboundary negative effects on other riparian states. And thirdly, even if states acknowledge that cooperation is more beneï¬cial for their interests as well as the entire basin and, hence, establish legal and institutional mechanisms for cooperation, conï¬icts of interests may arise due to the different degrees to which agreements are legally binding at the national and the international levels. While national implementation in water resources management is usually legally binding, the enforcement of international RBMPs is vague. Hence, successful implementation and related compliance on the international level remains challenging. In spite of these severe challenges, academic research as well as empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that long-term cooperation beneï¬ts prevail over potential short-term gains from noncooperative behaviorânot only for the basin, its resources, and its ecosystems but also for riparian people and states as a whole. River basin management approaches and RBMPs that consider long-term planning and implementation can further improve cooperation. However, besides formally agreed mechanisms for cooperation and coordination, essential prerequisites are cooperation, will, and trust between countries sharing a basin. In case the latter aspects are lacking, transparent river basin management (see Chaps. 15 and 16) can be used as a tool to build these aspects as foundations for better formulation and implementation of policy, law, and, eventually, sustainable development of river basins and riparian states."

However, at the national level, it is important to highlight that the CMEC has responsibility for the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials which provides information on formal credentials assessment services, provincial/territorial education systems, post-secondary institutions, regulated and unregulated occupations and how to connect with provincial/territorial regulatory bodies that have responsibility for issuing licences to practice in each jurisdiction. In addition, stakeholder engagement at the national level includes CAPLAâs yearly conference that attracts a wide range of RPL stakeholders from across Canada and abroad. A Strategic Advisory Panel on RPL involving representatives from Canadaâs provinces and territories, has been hosted by CAPLA since 2009 for purpose of sharing innovative ideas and initiatives. The Canadian Network of National Associations of Regulators hosts events for regulatory authorities that have responsibility for protection of the public, and competency assessment is discussed frequently. Across Europe the tendency is to divide recognition procedures between levels of state authority, private stakeholders, community organisations and agencies of civil society. In 2005, Switzerland launched its RVA system (Validation des Acquis), which is overseen by the Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. The system is based on close cooperation between the federal government, cantonal governments and social partners and voluntary associations. In this way, Swiss recognition is founded on a model of shared responsibility. These partners are engaged in the process of developing a common framework revolving around the inclusion of different levels of recognition, the roles of the different agents, the inclusion of quality assurance and the training of experts (Switzerland. Office fÃ©dÃ©ral de la formation professionnelle et de la technologie (OFFT) 2008). Like Switzerland, Austria is well equipped to operate a system of shared responsibility in recognition policy (Schneeberger et al. 2008). It divides its recognition procedures between levels of state authority, private stakeholders and agencies of civil society. The responsibilities for the regulation, provision, financing and support of learning activities are divided between the national and provincial levels. In Germany, there is neither a central institution nor a standardised institutional framework in place for validation. Instead, a variety of approaches exist. The chambers of crafts, industry, commerce and agriculture regulate admission to the external studentsâ examination. With respect to access to higher education, the German Rectorsâ Conference has defined a framework for recognition, but specific regulations and procedures are established by the respective university. The ProfilPASS system is managed by a national service centre which supports 55 local dialogue centres (Otero et al. 2010). The responsibility for continuing education falls across a number of areas. Continuing education in Germany experiences less regulation at the national level than other areas of education and as a result it"
334,351,0.984,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Parallel to the struggles occurring since 2012 in Berlin and Munich, a self-organized group of refugees that became known as Lampedusa in Hamburg emerged in northern Germany in 2013. This is a protest group of 300â350 refugees mainly from Sub-Saharan Africa, who had previously migrated to Libya and then fled from the civil war in the country that began in 2011 to Italy. They established their organization as a direct response to European migration laws. Coming from Italy where they had few opportunities to make a living, they challenged the limitations of free movement imposed by the Dublin regulation. In Hamburg, the group started to organize and develop collective political claims. Homelessness, the lack of health care, limited access to education, social exclusion, and a lack of basic social amenities â the denial of social rights â were the major challenges that motivated the group to form and organize themselves politically. All of the group members had already gone through the asylum procedure of recognition in Italy, having their identities checked, meaning that they all had Italian residency permits before they came to Hamburg. Therefore, having a refugee status issued by the Italian government shaped their social position: this status gave them no real access to social rights, but did give them some legal possibilities to move within Europe via a temporary tourist visa. For Lampedusa in Hamburg, the permission to work was vital for survival, since crisis-ridden Italy had nothing to offer; there was neither work, nor support for a living. Therefore, their specific positionality shaped their claim to a right to stay and work in Hamburg, which is encapsulated in their main slogan, âWe are here to stay!â This powerful slogan challenges the idea that refugees are only here for a temporary amount of time. The protest forms of the group therefore derive their strength from this declaration of legitimate presence. Most of their efforts attempt to make this slogan a reality and â together with supporters and networks of solidarity â demonstrate that the group is already part of the local community, even though the Hamburg Senate denies this. Their political self-organization and mobilization has also motivated political groups and civilians in Hamburg who have given humanitarian and political support, showing that the group is part of a common social space (Borgstede 2016). Lampedusa in Hamburg has engaged in a fundamental and vital struggle for their right to stay as well as for the rights of all refugees and migrants. Therefore, they began opposing procedures and laws that limited their right to dissent. On 5/22/2013, the group occupied the Town Hall, asking local authorities and particularly Mayor Olaf Scholz from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) to listen to their demands and start a dialogue; the politicians ignored these demands. As the struggle began to attract the attention of civil society and the media, the Senate of Hamburg, and in particular its governing party, the SPD, began to look for different opportunities to evict the group. One of these attempts involved using the St. Pauli church â which had provided shelter to some of the group members â as an intermediary. By November 2013, this tactic had forced some members of the group into a second"

In view of the housing challenges catalogued in preceding chapters, it is clear that African governments on their own cannot resolve the continentâs housing crisis. There is an urgent and growing need for development partners and the private sector to join government efforts to tackle the crisis. This book has provided an orientation for housing stakeholders to the identification, design, and implementation of housing sector operations. Pursuing some of the policies proposed here can help overcome the policy, regulatory, and structural barriers to addressing Africaâs housing crisis."

The cases of social innovations that were examined demonstrated the mutual relationships that exist between all of these four components of a (local) welfare system â (local) state, business sector, third sector organisations and the, often informal, networks of community and family life. Reaching out to all sectors of local welfare systems Even though there was considerable variation in the level and impact of state funding and support for the social innovations that were studied, overall it could be stated that these initiatives were concerned with establishing links with all sectors and that the organisations involved thereby often took on a hybrid character. It could be argued that most social innovations would have liked to receive more state and municipal support, but equally it can also be assumed that they would not have wished to be incorporated into the public sector. It can be suggested, therefore, that social innovations could best be captured by concepts of welfare that were based on a deliberate mixing and pluralism among actors, resources and responsibilities. Needless to say, the share of state-public welfare contributions of various kinds of third-sector organisations, ranging from associations to social enterprises, from NGOs to community networks and, finally, the level of corporate social responsibility was a matter that involved some controversy and conflict. Such conflicts not only concerned ideas and finances but also power. Aiming for less standardisation, more diversity and more localisation in welfare arrangements Innovation became difficult, if not impossible, wherever the right to act, organise or provide differently was denied. This could be the case in both large private-sector business organisations, which were managed centrally, and in certain market sectors that were controlled by private sector oligopolies. This means that those who wanted a more important role for social innovation would have to secure a degree of decentralisation, diversity, difference and, moreover, the possibility of unconventional mergers between elements that were usually separate. What is more, supporting innovation meant opting for arrangements that allowed for a new balance between guaranteed universality and diversity in localised arrangements. A good example of what is involved in combining and balancing concerns with universalism and diversity could be found in those municipalities that had worked to secure the right to develop their own options for occupational integration strategies, such as the âOptionskommuneâ in MÃ¼nster,"
97,389,0.984,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Climate change involves complex environmental, political, and socio economic interactions that cannot be addressed in isolation of holistic societal and human well-being concerns, including social cohesion, equity, and social justice interests (IPPC 2001; Adger and Barnett 2009; Haase, Chap. 13, Kabisch et al., Chap. 12 and Braubach et al., Chap. 11, this volume). With a changing climate, policy makers and advisors face challenges on how to mitigate and adapt while taking into consideration societal goals. One of the ways to deal with societal goals in the context of climate change is through nature-based solutions, including a wide range of green and blue infrastructure measures. This chapter focuses on urban gardens, particularly allotments and community gardens, as one type of green infrastructure. Allotment gardens are mostly larger estates divided into plots that are allocated under rental payments to a single person or a family for non commercial cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants and recreational purposes. They are normally ruled and managed by local authorities, associations, or private or public organizations. In contrast, community gardens are single pieces of land that are gardened and managed collectively by a group of people. Community gardens, may have a permanent or temporary character, and are often characterized by informal claiming of urban voids with the purpose of local community development (Adams et al. 2013). In this chapter, we explore how allotment and community gardens can serve as multifunctional nature-based solutions to achieve both climate-related and societal goals. Throughout the chapter, case studies illustrate how ecosystem services are provided by urban gardens in cities such as Lisbon, Leipzig, Manchester, and Poznan, all set in different socio-ecological contexts across Europe from northern to southern regions and from eastern to western regions. We first outline a brief history"
347,239,0.984,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Contemporary marine governance is often depicted as comprising multilevel and multi-actor interactions, competing knowledge claims and evolving patterns of comanagement, where stakeholders and users play increasingly important roles in overall governance. However, while this is true with regard to fisheries, eutrophication and protection of biodiversity, Baltic Sea shipping is characterised by hierarchical governing structures where IMO acts as a global regulatory hub, EU as a stakeholder and enforcer, HELCOM as an important interface between individual governments and intergovernmental organisations at regional and global scales and governments as key stakeholders typically promoting issue-specific national interests. Despite its globalised nature, modern shipping is to a considerable extent governed by intergovernmental organisations practising a policy mix comprising command and control measures as well as mechanisms to reduce gaps between operatorsâ economic incentive structures and politically agreed upon regulations. It has been illustrated in four brief examples that both the EU and HELCOM have played important roles in Baltic Sea marine governance. However, their roles have been markedly different from each other. An interesting role that the EU has played at times is that of an enforcer of global conventions at the EU level. The EU has used its legal regulatory instruments and directives, for example, to enforce a faster phasing out of single-hull vessels within the Union and thereby also speed up the global IMO phasing-out process. Another example was when the EU turned the recommended 25 % port inspection frequency by IMO into a mandatory requirement in all EU ports. The EU has, in other words, been able to strengthen global conventions internally and sometimes even influence global governance. In contrast, HELCOM has no other governance mechanisms at its disposal besides for the Helsinki Convention and the Recommendations which both are built upon consensual decision-making and do not allow for legal enforcement. Despite this, the example of the No-Special-Fee system shows that it can be possible to take Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland had partially implemented the No-Special-Fee system, whereas Sweden and Russia were not audited."
61,239,0.984,Mergers and Alliances in Higher Education : international Practice and Emerging Opportunities,"Joint construction refers to a merger process where, while financial resources remain basically the same, the central and provincial governments each exercise leadership in administering and developing institutions. Later, this extended to the lower reaches of government and administration, and some new forms of merger emerged, such as those between ministries of the central government, provincial capital and sub-capital cities, or between the provincial and municipal governments, or between ministries and corporations. The primary significance of joint construction is to change, or at least reduce, singular jurisdiction, including the removal of barriers between ministries of the central government and provincial governments. It is also aimed at strengthening the capacity of provincial governments to take a strategic approach (taking the whole situation into account), and enabling institutions to serve local society actively. Secondly, joint construction builds closer relations between institutions and the provinces/cities. Thirdly, joint construction can help raise funds. By so doing, institutions gain more financial support than would have been possible from a single source, improve their institutional running conditions, and optimise their resource allocation. Up to July 1996, 56 higher learning institutions had been constructed jointly in different ways. Of these, 27 institutions fell directly under the State Education Commission, while 29 belonged to various ministries or commissions (Deng 1997)."
334,493,0.984,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Instead, we would characterize the activities in urban areas as being connected, and sometimes part of, other social movements, such as anti-racist and pro-migrant movements, and in rural areas they tend to either not be aligned at all to such movements, or they are aligned to faith-based or other groups that are also involved in other struggles for human rights, ethical trade, and the like. (c) The Discursive Impact An important contribution of protests against deportations is the resulting increase in visibility of the issue and, as mentioned earlier, a counter-acting effect against the isolation of many asylum seekers. Deportations are often conducted at night, and asylum-seeker accommodation is situated in remote areas. Therefore, protests against deportations and media coverage thereof bring the issue to the attention of a public that usually has no contact with deportees. In order to successfully prevent a deportation, people also need to talk about their risk of being deported and to go public when they receive a letter informing them of their upcoming deportation (see Odugbesan and Schwiertz 2018). Given the widespread association of deportees with criminals (for example, through detention prisons, through deportees being taken by police during the night, or through pictures of handcuffed deportees), knowledge of the phenomenon and of the specific circumstances of deportations makes these criminalizing practices debatable. (d) The Politicizing Impact The visible presence and discursive impact of deportees or deportable populations is a prerequisite for another outcome of these protests, specifically the politicization of protest actors that were not previously social movement activists. As our media analysis and case studies have shown, individuals from a wide spectrum of age groups, political orientations, educational backgrounds, and professions potentially participate in anti-deportation protests. Several protest actions from among civil society in different places were conducted to voice disapproval with official asylum and deportation policies. The strategies were personifyingâfocusing on the deportation of a specific person or family who is or are seen as integrated in the community and thus deserving of the right to stay. Conversely, generalizing protests are conducted by religious groups or left-oriented activists using the case(s) of one or several migrants as examples illustrating the outcomes of a policy, which they perceive as unjust and whose reform they demand. The activists under scrutiny in this research were beyond the spectrum of social movement activists, political party members, or religious groups. The qualitative case studies demonstrated the significant personal impact that a deportation order can have on acquaintances. In some of the interviews, we were able to follow the interviewee step-by-step through the phases of moral shock, organizing protest activities on different levels, broadening their perspective, and learning about asylum procedures and asylum policies in general, thereby changing the political and ethical judgments they had initially held."

Indeed, all across human history and geography, people have perceived, lived, used and explored marine resources in coastal lagoons and bays, estuaries and shores, which conducted to changes in those habitats and their natural populations. Consequently, coastal communities changed their values and perceptions of the sea, as well as their way of living and of using natural resources. Thus, advancing change within any civilization does not occur in a vacuum, but rather must evolve out of the given circumstances and discourses that prevail. For instance in western civilization, we cannot think of culture without considering the context in which products and goods are produced, mediated, and consumed over time. Thus, aquaculture as culture exists in relationship to broader societal discourses that evolve across different scales, from interpersonal and group relationships to mainstream media discourses (Bell-Jordan 2008; Fiske 1987; Rosteck and Frentz 2009). New aquaculture industries, especially in rural areas, should strive to integrate into the cultural fabric of the local community (Burbridge et al. 2001). This is paramount consideration, i.e. if an aquaculture industry develops successfully in a region or community that has previously been dominated by other types of industries, it can alter the very image of what the region, community and its inhabitants âisâ. This can be because the base economic activity has been a fundamental factor for the identity of the community and its inhabitants, be it ï¬sheries, tourism, agriculture or something else. It can be because aquaculture introduces new and very visible landscape elements, and a third possibility is that in-migration substantially alters the cultural mix in the community population. Furthermore, gender issues, like the opportunities for increased women participation and responsibility in the labor market through aquaculture development may gain more prominence. However, this seems to primarily have been an issue for developing countries (Veliu et al. 2009; Ndanga et al. 2013). How aquaculture development and planning processes are organized may also affect learning among and between stakeholder groups. Leach et al. (2013) examine qualities in aquaculture partnerships in the US that enhance knowledge acquisition and belief change, and these include procedural fairness, trustworthiness among participants, diverse participation and the level of scientiï¬c certainty. Their work also indicate that knowledge acquired through collaborative partnerships make the participants primed to change their opinions on science or policy issues. Stepanova (2015) ï¬nd that knowledge integration and joint learning are crucial for conflict resolution over coastal resource use."
164,533,0.984,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Typically, as in countries as diverse as Bolivia and Cameroon, or even in Pakistan,2 local governments do not have full responsibility over program functions or sub-functions. This translates into inadequate control over the economic categoriesâwages and salaries, hiring and firing decisionsârelated to the devolved functional responsibilities (e.g., basic education). Yet specific health programs or activities such as building schools are often assigned to local governments that do not have the full associated economic or functional responsibility. For example in Cameroon (World Bank 2011) recent attempts to make municipal governments responsible for the construction of additional schools or clinics, without the corresponding responsibility for providing primary education or basic health care services, make it easy for the local government to evade responsibility or accountability for outcomes. It is quite easy to blame another level of government for the lack of teachers or health care personnel. A system of overlapping responsibilities cannot be easily overcome through social action or political sanctions for nonperformance. The linkages between functions and how these might be implemented are seen in representations of the typical classification of the budget process (see Table 18.1), depicting the intersection between functions and sub-functions (rows), and the inputs classified by economic categories and administrative arrangements (columns). The responsibilities of lower levels of government appear in designated cells, but not along the rows (functions) or the columns (economic or administrative categories). With this pattern of responsibility, it is hard for an electorate to hold government"

Participatory planning tools and techniques enable participants (stakeholders) to influence development initiatives and decisions affecting them. The tools promote sharing of knowledge, building up commitment to the process and empower the group to develop sustainable strategies. The participatory and informed planning process makes use of the âCircles of Influenceâ model (Fig. 13.19) that enables to structure participation to limit numbers but not the influence of speciï¬c groups of stakeholders (Cardwell et al. 2008; Bourget 2011). Under this model trust is developed in concentric circles; planners and managers work to develop trust with leaders and organizations that other stakeholders already trust. That is, those most directly involved in policy analysis activities (i.e., planners, managers, and modelers who do most of the actual work; Circle A) who communicate with trusted leaders and major stakeholder representatives at the next level (Circle B). These stakeholders then in turn provide a trusted link to all other interested parties, who have much less direct involvement (Circle C). Ideally, Circle B participants would be active in professional or issues-oriented organizations and provide links to others whose interests they represent. Hence, Circle C stakeholders should see their interests represented in Circle B, and have formal"

For example, the term migration itself comes with particular preconceptions of human movement in a particular region. For us, it was valuable to consider the role of circular migration in mediating (poor) health outcomes in both sending and receiving communities. Considering various ways of approaching migration in the region represented a first effort to engage and connect different people who can contribute to research, policy, and practice related to migration, urbanisation and health. At our meeting, the main focus was figuring out ways to speak that were less alienating to those engaged in practice, and those for whom urban or migrant health was a more peripheral part of their work. There needs to be multiple layers of engagement and multiple entry points into understanding linkages between migration, urbanisation and health in SADCâfrom research that serves to dispel myths, to that which builds much deeper knowledge in the region. In addition to exploring ways to use language and approaches that not only speak across disciplines, we wished to understand ways to directly engage with those who are mobile, and who may experience health penalties as a result of their mobility or migration status. These methods shouldâwe feltâbe participatory, highly local, and support participatory action. Our focus on local, rather than reproducible, large scale, or transferable, kinds of knowledge, reflected a need to understand and foreground our local context. Place-based contextual knowledge allows for opportunities to connect and understand local policy and practice. Being connected to and engaging with the state is vital in our research, as the state is a key actor â both in defining who migrates, and in defining their experience of migration."

The guidelines discussed in this chapter have been developed and used by Dutch experts in Deltares to assess water resources systems and to develop plans and strategies for managing them. Deltares has been actively involved in numerous water resources planning and management projects throughout the world. The approach described in this chapter illustrates how these projects are conducted, and the major factors that are considered while conducting them. The effects and impacts of some of their projects have been relatively local and required consideration of only a few sectors of the economy. Other, more comprehensive projects have had national or international impacts, and led to transboundary (international) compacts. Clearly each water resources system is unique with respect to its management issues and problems and its institutional environment. Project planning and analysis approaches must adapt to these situations. Hence, each project will differ, and will no doubt need to deviate from the suggested guidelines presented in this chapter. Other approaches are possible and may be equally effective. What remains important in all cases is the establishment of a comprehensive, systematic process of planning and analysis together with constant communication among planners, decision-makers and the interested and affected public. The end result should be an improved, more sustainable, and equitable water resources development plan and management policy, appropriate for the region and its people."

This organization multiplies the actors and entry points in environmental issues. As in Ecuador, the basic component of this system is the National System of Protected Areas (Sistema Nacional de Ãreas Protegidas (SERNAP)). The Plurinational Council is directly hinged to the presidency of the Republic. Another important environmental agenda of the two countries is climate change. The respective ministries and other state agencies have created plans for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. The development of this theme, and of the environmental agencies overall, has relied heavily on international cooperation. Prominent international actors, who are common to both countries, are the World Bank, UNEP and the ofï¬cial German cooperation. Finally, the Bolivian and Ecuadorian governments agree that the rich biodiversity of the two countries provides opportunities for some kind of âgreenâ development, and they have advanced policies in this direction. Since 2001, Ecuador has been developing a National Program of Bio-knowledge, whose management depends on the ministries of environment and agriculture under the National Biosafety Framework (MAE, 2013; Andrade and Zenteno, 2014). In Bolivia the âFramework Law . . . â and the âBolivia Agenda, 2025â contemplate a similar development, but the government has not made progress in the implementation of these policies. As indicated above, the Ecuadorian environmental policy differs from that of Bolivia in the importance that it gives to the environmental damage caused by oil exploitation. Since 2008 the Ecuadorâs government has promoted an active policy of environmental remediation, executed by the Reparation Program of Environmental and Social Liabilities (Programa de ReparaciÃ³n de Pasivos Ambientales y Sociales (PRAS)). The notion of âshared responsibilityâ â between the state and local communities in the management of environmental problems that prevail in institutional environmental designs â opens up opportunities for the participation of local communities and municipal, provincial and (in Bolivia) departmental governments. The role of scientiï¬c knowledge in this layer of environmental governance is important.

Internal conflicts and alliances, and local notions of social space, structured the legal and organizational framework of the communal councils. The boundaries between the popular sectors and the state were difficult to discern, simply because the state effect (Mitchell 1999) had not yet been grinded into shape. Mobilization was taking place in a hybrid space between institutional and legal frameworks that were not yet concretized and much less enforced and systematized. âPopularâ ways of doing things were flourishing in the absence of public officials that knew how to enforce state policy or had internalized their role and agency as representatives of the state. This produced a hybrid space, I will argue, whereby the communities tentatively tried to âbecomeâ communal councils, yet steeped in complex local socialities shaping those processes. At the same time, public officials were also trying to learn âhow to become the stateâ while at the same time upholding the principle of promoting el poder popular."
174,201,0.984,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"Both the NSP and the SDP have their strengths and weaknesses. While NSP is quite participative at the community level, and creates the basic units of democratic choice, though doubts have been expressed about it in practice in different parts of the country, it operates outside the government system. The facilitating/implementing partner gets the credit, not the government as a whole. Its biggest lacuna is the complete absence of ownership outside MRRD, quite unlike SDP. At the same time, NSP has created considerable local, economic assets that are very useful to the community. However, leading from this, its second basic problem is inability to scale up and create projects that bring about sustainable, favourable economic outcomes. Third, what happens to the CDC once the project is over or when the NSP winds down? The resulting frustration could produce cynicism and reversion to more atomised behaviour patterns. The SDP could do well to replicate CDC-like consultative mechanism. It would also do well to look at additional resources, including by diverting from non-productive programmes and by attracting other donors. Better tracking would improve accountability and lead to better outcomes. Both the SDP and the NSP emblemise a different approach to peacebuilding and development than that exhibited by many traditional donors in Afghanistan. Reflecting the belief that âState-building and peacebuilding are primarily internal processes,â (DFID 2010) then-finance minister Ashraf Ghani âdemanded that assistance was to be channelled through the ministries, and aligned with national plans and prioritiesâ (Strand 2014). Many donors including the USAID, Japan and most UN agencies, preferred to execute projects themselves, often without even coordination with the government. The international military in particular with their Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and the Commandersâ Emergency Response Program (CERP) spent very substantial sums of money, for example, US$80 million in three quarters of 2005, aimed at âwinning hearts and mindsâ (Karp 2006). Unfortunately, tactical considerations such as rewarding friendly individuals and groups, or the need to âdeliver developmentâ drove such investment decisions. This was true at both the battalion as well at national levels. In the bargain, basic âprinciples for assistance were set aside for military and political objectives, leading to nepotism and corruption as the Kabul Bank scandal illustratesâ (Strand 2014). The ISAF and PRT approach, though called âwinning hearts and minds,â was a top-down process that did not address an imbalance between areas receiving lots of resources and others that received little or none. They also reflected âquick fixesâ that were less effective"
282,211,0.984,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"1. CorpWatch, for example, is a US-American NGO investigating and exposing corporate violations of human rights, environmental crimes, fraud and corruption with the aim of holding these companies accountable for their actions. AccountAbility is an international NGO collecting and developing tools to increase accountability worldwide. The Campaign for Accountability of Our Media Voice seeks to increase the accountability of the media, especially of broadcast television. Corporate Accountability International is an NGO seeking to hold corporations accountable through lawsuits. These are just a few examples to illustrate the importance of âaccountabilityâ as a political catchword. The list could be extended at will. 2. In the US Congress, for example, a large number of proposed bills even contain the term âaccountabilityâ in their title. Melvin Dubnick lists 52 examples of legislation proposed by the 107th Congress including âaccountabilityâ in their headings (Dubnick, 2002, p. 29). 3. A similar point is made by Richard Mulgan, who puts it in the following terms: âThat âaccountabilityâ is a complex and chameleon-like term is now a commonplace of the public administration literature. A word which a few decades or so ago was used only rarely and with relatively restricted meaning [â¦] now crops up everywhere performing all manner of analytical and rhetorical tasks and carrying most of the major burdens of democratic âgovernanceâ [â¦]. In the process, the concept of âaccountabilityâ has lost some of its former straightforwardness and has come to require constant clarification and increasingly complex categorizationâ (Mulgan, 2000a, p. 555). 4. In the political sciences, the term âcivil societyâ is disputed. Here, however, the purpose is not to contribute to that debate. In the following, the definition proposed by the London School of Economics Centre for Civil Society will be used: âCivil society refers to the arena of uncoerced collective action around shared interests, purposes and values. In theory, its institutional forms are distinct from those of the state, family and market, though in practice, the boundaries between state, civil society, family and market are often complex, blurred and negotiated. Civil society commonly embraces a diversity of spaces, actors and institutional forms, varying in their degree of formality, autonomy and power. Civil societies are often populated by organisations such as registered charities, development non-governmental organisations, community groups, womenâs organisations, faith-based organisations, professional associations, trades unions, self-help groups, social movements, business associations, coalitions and advocacy groupsâ (Centre for Civil Society, 2004). 5. Since the possibilities for citizen control are limited, constitutional theorists have long argued for systems that control themselves. This is what is meant today by âchecks and balancesâ â independent political institutions that can check each otherâs power. In the words of Persson, Roland and Tabellini: âChecks and balances work by creating conflict of interests between the executive and the"

Two of these are Kurdish organizations, which are linked to mother organizations in Kurdistanâ one in Koye and one in East-Kurdistan. Furthermore, there are two organizations for youth of Turkish origin. One was founded in 2001 and aims to promote cultural, academic, and social activities. For several years, this organization served as an important channel for youth to reach the attention of political authorities in Norway. In 2014, the organization dissolved when the founder quit her unpaid job as General Secretary in the organization. In 2005, the other organization for youth of Turkish origin was founded (Centre for Multicultural Youth). All members speak Turkish and focus on arranging social and cultural activities. All organizations are non-proï¬t, non-religious and non-political voluntary organizations, in the sense that they do not support a speciï¬c political party, neither in Norway nor in Turkey.

164,589,0.984,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","The terminology and publicized approaches to CSR are largely shaped by AngloSaxon tradition, with its differentiation between economic and social affairs, focus on individualistic rather than community values, and the limited role of government in regulating markets (Blowfield and Frynas 2005; Sadler and Lloyd 2009). Proponents of CSR tend to emphasize the benefits of volunteerism and selfregulation as more effective means to promote socially responsible corporate activities. For instance, the Department for International Development (DFID) in the UK (2003, 9) warns that âinternational legally-binding frameworks for multinational companies may divert attention and energy away from encouraging corporate social responsibility and towards legal processes.â The ânorthern-centeredâ view of CSR has driven research agendas over recent decades, which has largely concentrated on firms in high-income countries, notably in North America and Europe, and the adoption of universal norms such as workersâ rights. These approaches have also shaped the way that CSR is being applied in developing countries. As Blowfield and Frynas (2005, 504) note, âby the time empirical studies started to be commissioned to investigate whether CSR could benefit the poor and marginalized, certain conventions and orthodoxies had already been established.â Thus development related CSR emerged largely as a response to growing criticism of multinational companies from activists, consumers, and shareholders about poor labor and environmental standards, and associated impacts on local communities. An initial focus on codes of conduct and voluntary company-level standards has expanded to include ethical sourcing, certifications, community development, and stakeholder engagement. While NGOs were a key driving force behind promoting CSR in the 1990s, they have become increasingly critical, accusing some companies of using CSR as âgreen washâ for unsustainable business practices and/or to avoid regulations. For instance the UK-based NGO Christian Aid (2004, 14) acknowledges that civil society groups, through their support for CSR, âhave unwittingly enhanced company"

There was also concern that rising energy costs might affect the growth of their businesses, such as the glass crafts produced by the Wathaurong Aboriginal Co-Operative. On the positive side, CCA could offer Aboriginal people opportunities for greater involvement in land and sea care programs. For instance, the Boon Wurrung Foundation aspire to having Indigenous ârangersâ, modelled on the sea ranger program in the Northern Territory, established within the Port Phillip Bay region. The Wathaurong Aboriginal Co-Operative is planning to link community training in land care programs with their management of their Wurdi Youang property. Quandamooka people have been employed in the national parks of North Stradbroke Island. The Jagera Ganay-Magil Aboriginal Corporation participants stated an interest in developing âlooking after countryâ type roles, particularly in native plant propagation, national park management and the wild food industry. The Kaurna community has similar aspirations with the development of ecotourism ventures, possibly through the Warriparinga Living Kaurna Centre. With greater inclusion in caring for country programs, Indigenous people will have more employment opportunities for individuals and be able to develop investment strategies for their businesses and organisations."

The EGs have terms of reference and mandates adopted by each country cooperating within the ICPDR framework and meet several times a year. The Expert Groups discuss issues related to their terms of reference (ICPDR 2016) and prepare reports and recommendations for coordinated action toward the ï¬nal Danube RBMP. On demand, time-limited Task Groups (TGs) may also be established for speciï¬c actions and in which not necessarily all countries are represented. In practice, the River Basin Management EG coordinates the overall development of Danube RBMPs, steering the other relevant EGs and compiling all information into one ï¬nal plan. Draft versions are shared with all EGs as well as presented and consolidated at the ICPDRâs plenary meetings that take place twice a year, until the ï¬nal Danube RBM Plan is adopted for implementation. In the end, the coordinated technical work and joint management efforts of the EGs and TGs support countries in consolidating the content of the Danube RBMPs due to their full involvement during the entire development process. Besides the coordination aspects that need to be in place to develop international RBMPs, the achievement of deï¬ned milestones that are aligned to a river basin management cycle is important. The Danube Basin Analysis (ICPDR 2005), which is equal to State of Basin Reports, was the ï¬rst milestone within the Danube RBM Plan development. Four basin-wide Signiï¬cant Water Management Issues (SWMI) have been identiï¬ed, which can directly or indirectly affect the status of both surface waters and transboundary groundwaters. The SWMIs address pollution by organic substances and nutrients, pollution by hazardous substances, as well as hydromorphological alterations. The identiï¬cation of these SWMIs has been an important step within Danube RBM planning. Over one and a half years, a joint process of the ICPDR and its River Basin Management Expert Group elaborated a strategic document on the four SWMIs. The SWMI document includes visions and management objectives for each SWMI (ICPDR 2008b, 2009, 2015) that have been adopted by the contracting parties in the ICPDRâs Ordinary Meeting. The SWMI visions and, speciï¬cally, the management objectives describe the basin-wide implementation steps toward the environmental objectives that need to be achieved by 2027 at the latest. The management objectives guide the Danube countries toward agreed joint aims. Basically, the management objectives for the SWMIs describe the measures that need to be taken to reduce or eliminate existing pressures for each SWMI on a basin-wide scale. In addition, the management objectives help bridge the gap that can exist between the national level and their agreed coordination on a basin-wide level to achieve the environmental objectives. Although SWMIs and their management objectives can be ï¬exibly adjusted to the needs of the Danube River Basin from RBMP to RBMP, their adoption by the contacting parties of the ICPDR is crucial to ensure ï¬xed joint aims and, hence, a solid implementation basis. As a next milestone, a speciï¬c and coordinated analysis has been undertaken for each of the identiï¬ed SWMIs within the Danube RBMP that enables targeted management on the basin-wide scale. For each SWMI, pressure types that may"
99,57,0.984,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Today, there are two core beliefs that are widely shared by MÃ¼nsterâs business community, chief administrators and key representatives of the two major parties. The first is an âinvestment frameâ according to which any policy has to pay off in the long run. Hence also in the area of social policies, any initiative has to either be an âinvestmentâ, for example in human capital, or aim at enabling the respective individual, group or local community to become self-sustainable. The second is a so-called prevention frame, according to which action, in particular in the area of social policies, should be taken at an early stage in order to prevent a downward development. Thus, the two frames correspond and are related to each other. In order to attain legitimacy, social innovations have to be in accordance with both. However, social innovations also have to be initiated and promoted by âthe right peopleâ in town. The results of the WILCO project show that there is a relatively small circle of stakeholders in MÃ¼nster who meet regularly in the various roundtable and working-group settings initiated by the municipal administration in which crucial policy issues covering a broad range of topics are discussed. Indeed, the local parliament long ago stopped being the central forum for decision-making. Since MÃ¼nsterâs business community is very homogeneous, consisting primarily of retailers and representatives of saving banks and insurance companies, the municipal administration constitutes âthe spider in the netâ: it sets the agenda and promotes new initiatives. Newcomersâsocial entrepreneurs that are not mainstream and do not belong to the inner circle of decision makersâfind it difficult to be acknowledged and accepted in MÃ¼nster and to have their proposed social innovations validated. Hence the city is characterised by a co-operative governance arrangement as regards social innovation, but innovative concepts and new ideas have to make their way into the âinner circleâ of decision makers in MÃ¼nster in order to be heard and recognised. The second type of governance, called governance of growth, gives priority to economic policies. The orientation is anti-urban, and politics are strongly influenced by economic interest groups. This growth-machine orientation (Molotch 1976) privatises social problems as individual faults. Pamplona, Dover and Birmingham are examples of the predominance of this kind of governance. Birmingham in the UK, analysed in this book by Nadia Brookes, Jeremy Kendall and Lavinia Mitton, is a fine example of a city that follows this model in its attempt to reconcile social and economic policies. In the nineteenth century, the city used to be the âworkshop of the worldâ. Even today, Birminghamâs political and welfare culture is consistent with the paradigm posed by Adam Smith, according to which a vibrant economy is the most effective underpinning for community development. Accordingly, governance of growth assigns social policy a subordinate role. In the case of Birmingham, this subordinate role is consistent with the tradition of a liberal welfare regime in which the market constitutes the prime source of individual wellbeing. Hence, as Brookes, Kendall and Mitton argue, âthe city council has focused over the years on the promotion of local economic development, and the two policy priorities of economic growth and labour market activation and social inclusion have usually been dealt with separatelyâ."
284,299,0.984,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"rules increase uncertainty and the ability of forest users to comply with government regulations. Conï¬icts between local and national monitoring systems add to the challenges for local institutions. In Mexico a federal government agency (the ProcuradurÃ­a de ProtecciÃ³n Ambiental) is ofï¬cially responsible for monitoring compliance with federal forest rules. Limited coordination between the Mexican environmental enforcement agency (PROFEPA) and the monitoring initiatives of local communities leads to conï¬ict between the two institutional arrangements. Imposed rules, external â and often inefï¬cient â monitoring and sanctioning, âcrowd outâ risk, and eroded local institutions have resulted in a favouring of local âopen accessâ conditions (CÃ¡rdenas, 2008). Finally, the community forest economy index combines (1) a level of vertical integration of forest production and the capacity to add value to forest products; (2) diversiï¬cation of forest uses, taking commercial and domestic purposes into account; (3) productive forest assets owned by communities; and (4) ownership of ï¬nancial assets. This index corresponds to âforest dependenceâ, an important condition for the social value of common forests, and the incentives to commit to their governance and conservation (Ostrom, 2009). The level of development of the communal forest economy was considered âvery lowâ in 69% of the sampled communities. In half of the communities, forest only provides ï¬rewood for domestic use. In the other half, residents harvest and sell non-timber forest products (NTFP) such as mushrooms, resin, medicinal plants and ï¬rewood.32 Individuals or family groups who take part in these activities are often the poorest members of the community. These products deliver very low proï¬ts due to market control by intermediaries. Logging remains the most important (legal) income-generating activity in forest regions. It takes place in one-third of these communities, of which 13.6% sell timber as âstumpâ. In these cases, outsiders perform forest management and extractions with little community control. These operations, which often have a high impact on forests, deliver scarce local beneï¬ts, and create mistrust and opposition to commercial forestry. Forest management and timber-harvesting operations are carried out in only 17% of the communities. About half of this last subgroup produced only raw material (logs) due to limited productive capacities and ï¬nancial resources to cover production costs. Nearly 10% of these communities have achieved productive vertical integration, including their own forest mills and sale of primarily tables. However, only 4% of the"

Policymakers in cities and at the sub-national level can lead the way in making the transition towards increasing resilience and integrating ecological concerns within urban planning and decision-making. Instead of an infrastructure agenda in which nature is a problem, a cost, and a political risk, nature can become part of the solution. Cities around Europe have already shown a commitment to integrating nature into their urban planning and management, and thereby demonstrated awareness of the importance of protecting natural capital. The Regional Climate Plan for Paris, for example, highlights the importance of protecting ecosystems in order to adapt to and mitigate climate change (Conseil Regional DâÃle-De-France 2011). The city also recognises that forest management practices which optimise their capacity for adaptation and resilience can lead to multiple benefits for biodiversity, people and the city (Natureparif 2015).

170,470,0.984,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"2 Literature Review 2.1 Realistic Needs1 of Migrant Workers Although the expression of opinion is conceived as the most basic form of political participation, prior empirical studies have showed that, in general, ordinary Chinese people are not active in expressing their opinions, especially in the public space, mostly due to the strict political control and low political efficacy (Pan et al. 2010; Chan and Zhou 2011). While scholars also argue that when people encounter realistic needs to resolve existential problems such as pollution in their living environment, their intention to engage in expressive behaviours would be higher (Yang 2009; Zhou 2011). So when studying the expression of migrant workers in China, it is better to examine the expressive intentions when they are faced with realistic needs or existential problems. To focus on the realistic needs of migrant workers is also responding to the call for attention to the concept of âneedsâ in the ICTD research or âsouthernâ communication studies. As Qiu (2010) put it, it is imperative for âsouthernâ communication studies to tackle issues of needs (versus wants). âNeedsâ are basic resources or fundamental problem-resolving demands to help ordinary people especially marginalised groups to survive in the living world, to address issues such as job seeking, housing, education, health care, and social networking, while âwantsâ refer to those perceptions promoted by advertising and marketing campaigns, imposed by peer group pressure, and internalised as oneâs personal wants for âmodern lifeâ and âurban styleâ, such as conspicuous consumption (Fitzgerald 1977). Following this conceptual distinction, Qiu (2009) argues that the most fundamental force to drive the information have less to adopt, and the use of new media technologies is the bottom-up needs of these marginalised people to deal with the existential issues created by the transformations of Chinese society, exacerbated by existing structural inequalities. The rise of working-class network society in China is, in this sense, a grounded transformation consisting of daily struggles by members of the have-less people to use working-class ICTs as micro-solutions to meet their needs at the grass-roots level. Hence, it is important to explore whether and to what extent migrant workers will voice themselves when they are faced with realistic problems. What then are the main needs or realistic problems of new-generation migrant workers in the contemporary China? Prior empirical investigations, albeit limited in number, have showed two lines of them: one is the labour rights protection and the other is personal emotion problems (Chinese National Labour Union 2010; Wang and Chen 2012). The labour right protection problems refer to those problems that they are faced during the working process, including excessive working time, delay in paying, and working-related injury or illness. The personal emotion problems"
167,493,0.984,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"How can we use an intersectional approach to illuminate social, political, and environmental developments taking place in the Arctic? In my own work on the Arctic I use both a intersectional and a security analysis approach. Both concepts are actively present politically and socially across the region, and they are intimately tied to environmental use (or exploitation) and change. The term security invokes power, whereby the utmost priorities of the person, state, social group are linked to the survival of values and practices for the future (Hoogensen GjÃ¸rv 2017). Many are quite familiar with the narrower, militarized understanding of security that focuses on the use of the military for purposes of defending one actor, the state, from existential threat (Walt 1991). However, when we think in terms of actors more broadly, and diverse practices to ensure survivial (and the diverse ways in which survival is understood), a much more complex analysis results. Through intersectional analysis, it is possible to best understand the dynamics and tensions between priorities and perceived futures for the Arctic. This can be exemplified with the concept of âhuman securityâ which has been increasingly employed in Arctic research to articulate linkages between individual and community values and prerequisites for survival, and political and social policy. Human security was popularised in the 1994 United Nations Human Development Report, expanding the notion of security to include dimensions of food, health,"
334,28,0.984,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"border control regulations nor a modification of asylum and deportation regimes. Rather, it is characterized by activities aimed at saving certain individuals from being deported or at least at making the deportation practices more humane. Policy implementation protests, including ânoble activistsâ (Anderson et al. 2013, 5) are mainly concerned with what is just and what is not just, as applicable in individual cases. As mentioned above, solidarity action is driven by actorsâ moral judgments. Solidarity protest takes joint action against the implementation of general rules. The logic of excluding certain people is dismissed, exemptions from the rule are required (for a critical debate, see Walters 2010; Hiemstra 2016). It is the discursive rationale of deservingness which builds the justification for a strategic or moral intervention to expand membership rights to a few âdeportableâ individuals. On the question of protesters focusing on the individual enforcement of deportation rather than on policy regulation, Ellermann (2009) has provided a rational choice-oriented answer. She distinguished between the stages of policy design and implementation and found that public attention shifts from the benefits of restrictive policies to the high and individualized costs once they are visible at the implementation stage. However, the question remains as to why policy implementation protests emerge at all. A major strand of theoretical and empirical explanation refers to the phenomenon of social ties and emotions, but also to the subjects of protest, namely the people affected. Most interestingly, Flam (2015) has stressed the function of emotions in eliciting public declarations of sympathy for refugees and irregular migrants. A revealing account of the role of social determinants relating to the subjects affected by deportability was offered by Patler and Gonzales (2015) in a study on anti-deportation case-based mobilization in the United States. Their findings highlighted that groups with a higher level of social acceptance, such as students, were more likely to receive media coverage and eventually be saved from deportation than less accepted social groups, such as low-wage workers. Whether a group attracts an anti-deportation media campaign thus depends, among other factors, on educational status and income. As we turn to refugee activism calling for social inclusion and membership, the fundamental demand for social and political change clearly has a different goal. Refugee activism is more radical in that it makes demands concerning modifications to the asylum regime, the machinery of deportation and the right to free transnational movement. In their demands, the (moral) right of a nation state to regulate borders and to decide on entry and stay is disputed (see the chapters by Mokre 2018; Odugbesan and Schwiertz 2018). A potential explanation for this comparatively more radical policy is that refugees have almost nothing to lose and therefore do not feel the need to appeal to political actors and institutions. However, implementation protests are not only acknowledged but are also the subject of critical reflection in the literature. For instance, Rygiel (2011, 2) points out that anti-deportation protests can produce âdifferentiated modalities of mobilitiesâ and hence âdifferential inclusionâ (ibid., 4). Solidarity protests may well cause political authorities to reverse a decision and to prevent a person and their family from being shunned by the social and political community, with the consequence"
164,497,0.984,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Vulnerable or marginalized groups often differ from one country to another due to unique historical, economic, political, and cultural situations. In most developing countries women, children, the elderly, and the disabled suffer disproportionately from hard work, disadvantages with respect to property rights, income inequality, limited access to education and health care services, limited political participation, and difficulties in other spheres of life. Because of cultural barriers and a widespread lack of knowledge of legal rights the situation is often more severe in rural communities. Ethiopia is a signatory nation of most UN and African conventions on vulnerable social groups and is expected to incorporate these obligations into its domestic laws and regulations. The 1995 constitution, the 2002 revised family law, the National Women Policy, and the National Youth Policy are examples of legislative efforts that were designed in conformity with the major principles of international conventions as they apply to the countryâs specific circumstances. The various development programs discussed in this paper (SDPRP, PASDEP, GTP, PSNP, HSDP, etc.) also recognize the special circumstances of these vulnerable social groups. In addition to constitutional provisions that affirm the equality of all persons and the need to protect their rights from any unlawful circumstances, the federal government has attempted to mainstream the concerns of the different social groups into the different policies and programs. Gender-Related Policies: Women are more likely to suffer from physical abuse, including rape and early marriage, in addition to being subject to hard work and problems associated with access to resources and property rights in many parts of the country. One persistent cultural problem imposed upon Ethiopian women in rural areas is forced marriage. Mainstreaming gender issues into socio-economic development plans has been the main strategy to address the concerns of women as a social group. Institutions have been put in place on the federal, sector, and local administrative (kebele) levels with different organizational structures to deal with gender issues. The Revised Family Code which begun to be implemented in 2000, protects women from forced marriages and imposed a lower age limit for marriage at 18 years of age in order to reduce health and psychological problems associated with early marriage. Article 35 of the constitution also included a clause specifically to remedy the cultural legacy of discrimination and inequality against women (FDRE 1995). This article stipulates the right of women to own property, including land, and to participate equally in policy decisions affecting the public and their personal well-being."
164,559,0.984,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","protection strategies across Asia and Africa: they talk only of CCTs because in the USA the general assumption is that all transfers must be conditional. From Europe and especially from European donors, there is less suspicion of the poor and greater support for social protection and unconditional cash transfers, but also a tendency to view cash transfers as welfare or antipoverty measures, rather than as an essential component of national developmental strategies. The emphasis of European development efforts is on targeting to minimize expenditures and to ensure that the ultra-poor are the main (or only) beneficiaries, because poverty reduction rather than national development is often the goal. These three tendencies (Global South, USA, and European) reflect different responses, both to recent economic crises and to the centrality of market-led development. Back in 1944 the renowned economic historian Polanyi outlined what he called the âdouble movementâ in the development of modern capitalism. The âself-regulating marketâ was promoted by governments with a host of special legislation and it did bring growth, but this free market could not work for labor and the environment. Low wages and unemployment created poverty and misery on a large scale, leading to the counter movement for âsocial protection,â which was increasingly supported in society, forcing governments to intervene in markets (Polanyi 2001; Putzel 2002). The failure of structural adjustments made in the 1980s and early 1990s to promote economic growth in low-income countries, and of âsocial fundsâ to protect the poor and newly poor from capability depleting vulnerabilities, showed that palliative approaches to social protection were ineffective. The lack of development and the growth of poverty outside of China and India, culminating in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, demonstrated the failures of neo-liberalism and the âWashington Consensus,â and brought the second part of the double movementâthe push for social protection. The northern response, epitomized by the MDGs, provides a real increase in social spending and strict social targets for health and education, but also kept governments at armâs length from the economy. The southern response, with Brazilâs Bolsa familia as a classic example, has been cash transfers that shift the emphasis to providing poor people with the money necessary for them to take actions to end their own poverty and make greater use of economic opportunities.5 Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa introduced large-scale social protection programs in the late 1990s in a Polanyian response to the harm being done by a sole focus on the market as the answer to all development problems. This was a challenge to the Washington Consensus, because the programs were (and are) redistributive and involve governments reallocating resources within countries. The initial response from the North was criticism and the commissioning of studies (Barrientos and Hulme 2008). These studies found that social protection programs worked and that cash transfer programs (with and without conditions) performed particularly well. They reduce both immediate and intergenerational poverty, stimulate the economy, and promote developmentâespecially in marginal rural areas as shown in South Africa (Samson et al. 2004)."
27,191,0.984,Limits To The European UnionâS Normative Power in a Post-Conflict Society : Eulex and Peacebuilding in Kosovo,"involved in peacebuilding in Kosovo. It is within this interplay of different actors, including local ones, that the (un)success of EULEX should be discussed. Yet this does not imply that EULEX could not have performed better in several areas. Last but not least, before discussing the implications, one might also question the attempt to isolate the added value of EULEXâs involvement in the rule-of-law reform and argue that certain achievements or failures have been the exclusive result of EULEXâs work. Neither EULEX nor any other international engagement in Kosovo has managed to change the fact that people in this former Yugoslav provinceâalmost 20 years after the Serbs (the FRY) de facto lost power over Kosovoâstill largely rely on particularistic networks to access resources for survival. Yet, it would be too much to expect this local characteristic, peculiar to several post-conflict societies, can be effectively reversed by a single actor. As rightly argued by Skendaj (2014, 181), every war produces economic scarcity, insecurity and generalised distrust, whereby relying on local components often literally amounts to âwho you knowâ and âwho can help youâ to provide basic needs that in more developed parts of the world are typically addressed by more or less efï¬cient state administrations. What does this mean in practice? In everyday life, which may still be improved in the direction of a modern state (supposedly always working for the greater equality and well-being of its citizens), could the rule of law have been better implemented? A wide network of people who beneï¬t directly from engaging with international actors is developing around all the international organisations in Kosovo and foreign countriesâ embassies in this ânew-born countryâ. By deï¬nition, this means some people are privileged over others and that meritocracy in, for example, the situation of getting a job is not always the case. This is yet another and hardly disputed characteristic of several post-conflict societies, not just Kosovo. The insistence of âinternationalsâ, including those of EULEX, on an inclusive concept of peacebuilding has led to the scenario whereby some locals are invited to take part in projects solely to comply with donorsâ requirement to ensure the inclusion of locals. The result in practice is that locals often agree to become subcontractors or collaborators of international organisations or foreign embassies in exchange for being awarded a project that directly beneï¬ts them in several ways (good ï¬nancial remuneration, international travel, educational and training programmes funded by international actors, and other opportunities for internationalising the careers of âchosen individualsâ). The more resourceful the international organisation, the wider the network, with EULEX being an excellent case in point. Yet, faced with limited chances to lead a decent life, the locals cannot be blamed for taking advantage of such opportunities, at least not until they work legally and work to help stabilise the country. What then are the lessons the EU and CSDP can draw from this? EULEX withdrew relatively early from its involvement in the customs reform. Given the above ï¬ndings, some might propose that EULEX similarly consider withdrawing its involvement in the Kosovo Police because the continuation of its presence there is today questionable and adds to or exacerbates the localsâ dependence on âthe"

The Global South is both experiencing phenomenal development in some places (with the attendant environmental and social challenges) and still facing deep poverty and hunger. Some of this is, in turn, partly but never exclusively related to socio-demographic changes, including ageing societies virtually everywhere around the world, and increases in lone-parent families (ILO, 2011). Global population flows, whether from the Global South northward or within the European Union from poorer to richer member states (whether from east to west or north to south), are also creating new wealth for some and precariousness, poverty and even misery for others (Dustmann and Frattini, 2011). Historically marginalised groups facing prejudice â Aboriginal peoples in many countries and Roma almost everywhere they live â find their lives increasingly difficult (UN, 2009; European Commission, 2011a). Many of these changes can be summarised under the label of ânew social risksâ (Bonoli and Natali, 2012). The structure of these new risks challenges previous configurations of the welfare diamond and associated social policy programmes, practices and ideas about the proper and possible balance of spaces for markets, states, families and communities. In effect, the market corner of the welfare diamond is being exhorted by social policy communities to expand, by recognising the contributions of â and contributing towards â the social economy and social entrepreneurship more generally. But often practices of social innovation also include reworking both the responsibilities of the community corner of the diamond and aligning it in ground-breaking ways with respect to the market. As it does so, social innovationâs status as a quasi-concept is very clear. Numerous ways of understanding it co-exist as markets are re-imagined."

While it is considered perhaps the most inclusive education system in the world, Italy serves as an important reminder about the many challenges of translating the language and values of law into practice. Article 24 of the CRPD calls for an inclusive education system which should be flexible to meet the special needs of people with disabilities. Adjustments are especially needed to address ASD pupilsâ needs, for whom education cannot rely on centrally-determined curricula and teaching methodologies. Qualified by the OHCHR has a good example of support measures consistent with Article 24 (2) (d) of the CRPD, the IEPs should be intended, in order to meet the needs of pupils with ASD, as a global plan including didactic, rehabilitative, social and welfare aspects. Good examples in this regard are the PEI in Italy and the EHC plan in England. Similarly, the sensitivity of the institutions and the public towards people with autism has increased over time in the field of vocational training and lifelong learning. However, it seems necessary to continue encouraging the promotion and development of vocational training initiatives aimed at teenagers and adults. A project of development training of persons with ASD should include the provision of effective support to their families, as well as opportunities for social development, through organized services, and the design of routes towards work orientation, stimulating at the same time ways to manage leisure and recreational time. The implementation of Article 27 of the CRPD in the EU Member States shows that the level of protection of the right to work and employment of persons with ASD in each country depends by several factors including social, cultural and economic circumstances. From this perspective, there is no a one size-fit-for-all approach in the implementation of employment rights of people with autism at domestic level, but different regimes may be enforced, on a case by case basis, with the aim to achieve the objectives of Article 27. However, disability-related legislations to be adopted at national level in this field have to rely on two ânormative principlesâ: in the first place, the adoption of a normative definition of disability sufficiently wide to encompass ASD and, in the second place, the avoidance of national legislations ambiguous about whether failure to provide reasonable accommodation is to be treated as a form of unlawful discrimination. These two principles have to be regarded as benchmarks to be applied by national implementing legislations. In conclusion, the promotion of equal rights for people with autism, in the key areas of education and employment, should be high on the agenda of EU Member States in consideration of their commitments deriving from the CRPD. Being the overall aims of the Convention the inclusion and full participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of life, the achievement of such goals for persons with ASD can be realized especially through education and employment, as highlighted by the UNGA Resolution 67/82 of 19 March 2013 and by the message of the UN Secretary General on the 2014 World Autism Awareness Day."
334,478,0.984,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Protests may have different sources and may aim at different political objectives: They may be caused by self-interest or by solidarity for those who are in need of helpâor, in the case of restrictionist movements, against the effects of immigration and refugee admission. The support of those not threatened by deportation may be seen especially as an act of civil courage, acting on behalf of others who are, in particular when they are in situations of extreme stress and (legal) deprivation, not able to speak and act for themselves in the same way others might be. A significant percentage of these solidarity protests, though the figure varies from country to country, are organized in collaboration with the affected, either the deportees themselves or members of their communities and networks. Therefore, protests may aim for larger social and political change or for individual solutions for potential deportees, depending on the motivations of those who are mobilizing. The creation of personal ties and the transmission of emotions may help to increase the mobilizing effect. In this respect, access to formal political channels may be beneficial, as it increases the leverage on political decision-makers. However, given the situation"
183,96,0.984,Technologies For Development : From innovation To Social Impact,"4.2.3 Learner-Centered Pedagogies and Human-Centered Design in Support of SDG 4 and EFA In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the United Nations to expand upon the Millennium Development Goals which concluded that same year. SDG 4 focuses on education and reads, âEnsure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning.â This SDG redefines and shifts the approach to education set out in the previous MDG on education: learning is now considered a lifelong process, and is not limited to primary education. According to the most recent UNESCO Global Monitoring Report on Education for All (EFA) in 2014, great progress was made in recent years towards reaching the targets laid out in the MDGs, particularly for universal primary education. Progress towards targets in secondary education access was also made. Yet in areas of conflict, the number of out-of-school children has increased (UNESCO 2015). Humanitarian education programs have typically focused on children, particularly those enrolled in primary education, as educational programming in humanitarian contexts is decidedly reliant and linked to international policies (Zeus 2011). Yet, with the new shift towards lifelong learning embedded in SDG 4, humanitarian education programs will need to be more holistic, broadening their approach to youth and higher education. International humanitarian and development policies play an instrumental role in determining education programming on the ground in conflict and crisis settings, setting the stage for institutions of higher learning to engage as humanitarian actors. The global targets laid out in the SDGs refer to a broad mandate of deliverables by the year 2030. Among these, specific mention is given to tertiary education; increasing the number of youth and adults with skills for employment and entrepreneurship; educating children and youth in vulnerable situations; and promoting peace and appreciation of diversity. These targets, while ambitious, will require innovative solutions and changes to current educational programming in emergency contexts. More importantly, the learners in these communities should be active contributors to the design and implementation of such programs. Human-centered design will thus emerge as a critical aspect of this process, which can be further promoted through learner-centered pedagogies that have been an integral part of the InZone approach and which prepare refugee learners for lifelong learning journeys. In designing and producing OERs with other HEiE actors in the North and the South, InZone has taken its lead from refugee learners themselves, engaging them in the design process and supporting bottom-up innovation. Evidence from the implementation of OER-driven courses informs the creation of new resources, particularly with respect to how to design âthe last mileâ to optimally support learning outcomes. Higher Education programming for fragile contexts should be field-proofed and codesigned by learners before it aspires to scale. To meet the objectives of SDG 4 and EFA, we must listen to beneficiaries. By engaging them in the design of both content and delivery, we will foster communication across languages and cultures in the field, ensure that learning materials are contextualized and access to learning is guaranteed,"

These four organisations established almost from the beginning of the Bologna Process a working relationship through the E4 group. Togetherâdespite sometimes diverging opinionsâthey have developed a common platform for quality assurance: the European Standard and Guidelines (ESG) created and managed the European Quality Assurance Register (EQAR) and organised the European Quality Assurance Forum (EQAF). The combination of these initiatives created a pan-European stage for continuous discussion and exchanges of good practice between European, national and institutional policy makers and stakeholders like no other Bologna action line has. Second, the four stakeholder organisations also have âwalked the talkâ by developing projects that have tracked and promoted the development and implementation of both external and internal quality assurance practices. The European stakeholder organisations have created fora where members have been able to discuss and develop recommendations with peers via individual or joint QA projects. The discussions and exchange of experience in these projects and their reports have helped to promote and inform the development of a quality culture in European higher education institutions, and simultaneously helped to track the development and helped to engage in communication with and between stakeholders at European, national and institutional level on the progress. Third, the annual European Quality Assurance Forum (EQAF) has been a cornerstone in the communication within the European quality assurance community since 2006. It has been a major contribution to QA in higher education, and a flagship activity in this ï¬eld (Loukkola 2012). EQAF provides a platform and an opportunity for the higher education and QA communities to follow, discuss, shape and anticipate developments in the area. The conferences have traditionally brought all the key actors in the ï¬eld together: higher education institutions (leadership, QA responsible/practitioners and academics), staff from quality assurance agencies, students and European policy makers. EQAF keeps attracting all stakeholder groups and the theme of the 2014 forum indicates a shift in the view on quality assurance. The title: âChanging education â QA and the shift from teaching to learningâ point to a move in focus from quality assurance policies and practices to an increased focus on the development of the core of the European Higher Education Area reforms: teaching and learning and the provision of student-centred learning. A move from form towards content. Fourth, the training that thousands of academics are receiving as national and international evaluators and the staff engaged in quality assurance who work at institutional and national level on the development of policies and practices serve to promote quality assurance and spread good practices. Only one other action-line: internationalisation has created such transnational âeducationalâ structures and communities through EAIE. Other external change drivers that have promoted quality assurance include the impact of the rapidly expanding student numbers that in many European countries"

Systematic consultation of representative stakeholders required us to develop a methodology which will neither repeat the spatial areas nor ignore any spatial locality. The methodology designed for the selection of local community stakeholders and conducting the questionnaire survey was the six-step approach given in Fig. 9.4 (Thoradeniya 2010). The importance of this approach is the prominence given to the Governmentâs local administrative mechanism. Establishing connections with the local community stakeholders through the âGrama Niladhari â GNâ (lowest level Government administrative official) was advantageous to develop a trustful attitude towards the research.

But do these data tell the full story? Or does an examination of internationalization policies and activities provide indications that change is indeed taking place, albeit to varying degrees and at varying rates across the system?

303,4,0.984,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"Foreword In the new millennium, multiculturalism has significantly declined as a policy and social aspiration. While multiculturalism has long been criticized for connoting the mosaic like cohabitation of mutually exclusive cultures and communities, it has come under much stronger attack and critical scrutiny, particularly since September 11, 2001. Multiculturalism is alleged to be nation dividing, a detriment to national unity, and harmful to national security. Thus, the denunciation of multiculturalism has been accompanied by the intensification of national border controls and the reclaiming of national integration; this has resonated in a reactionary fashion, further amplifying peopleâs growing sense of anxiety and longing for a secure and peaceful community in which to live. However, the demise of multiculturalism has diminished neither the dynamics of national border crossings nor cultural diversity within national borders. The speed and scale of transnational mobility and interconnection have become even more intensified. Stuart Hall (2000) famously distinguished the âmulticultural questionâ from multiculturalism, which refers to policy discussion on the management of immigration and cultural diversity. An imperative multicultural issue we need to engage with is âhow people from different cultures, different backgrounds, with different languages, different religious beliefs, produced by different and highly uneven histories, live together and attempt to build a common life while retaining something of their âoriginal identityââ (p. 210). The decline of multiculturalism necessitates that we develop better analytical tools and approaches that seriously tackle the multicultural question by involving a wider strata of people and institutions. While multiculturalism has come under serious criticism in many Western societies, the management of emerging multicultural situations has come to be officially discussed in East Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, though the term multiculturalism is not necessarily adopted. In these countries, in addition to long-existing racial and ethnic minorities, the rise in the last few decades of labor migration and transnational marriage, especially involving people from other parts of Asia, has considerably increased the number of foreignnational residents, migrants, and âmixed raceâ youth. The multicultural question has become a key issue in the Asia-Pacific, though in contrast"
242,90,0.984,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","from twelve per cent in the UAE to sixteen per cent in Saudi Arabia and forty-six per cent in Kuwait (Baldwin-Edwards 2011). Here, gender-based barriers to participation in the labour force do not seem to be related to womenâs lack of education and skills but to a combination of factors, such as religious and cultural values that bar women from certain jobs, or socio-spatial rules that affect their mobility. The significant presence of domestic workers in this case seems to reflect the structure of families and living arrangements, lifestyle, and the maintenance of newly acquired social status (Anderson 2000; Sabban 2002: 12â13). As has been suggested, the growing dependence of households on foreign domestic servants in the UAE may also be seen as part of the unspoken bargain between the modern state and the emerging civil society, by which the state provides a leisured life in exchange for complete political control, leading to what has been described by a local politician as the growth of an âunproductive familyâ (Sabban 2002: 13). In this latest phase of the transformation of the relations that organize domestic work, there is a revision of the term âsecond shiftâ into the âcare deficitâ, to emphasize âcareâ as a public issue (Ehrenreich/ Hochschild 2004) that concerns young children and the ageing population as well as the health care system (Yeates 2010). In sum, the organization of domestic work, paid or unpaid, must be seen as contextual and nested in a mixture of care-related institutions within a broader policy framework concerning gender equality, the family, and women's economic participation in a nation state. The emerging intersection between care and migration as distinct national policy domains calls for analytical attention to the value frames applied in the interpretation of care and domestic work within the broader transnational economy of care. The place that care work (including domestic work) occupies in national law and policy regulating migration has consequences for how actors cooperate among themselves transnationally in order to move care and domestic workers as service providers across borders. Their modes of cooperation have implications for accountability that concern the protection of the rights of the workers who are being moved in order to deliver a service."
224,427,0.984,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"(FAO 2011b) suggests. We need another concept that considers the negative sides of agricultural development more seriously. On the one hand, environmental movements and feminist concepts are focusing on the sustainability of development, including ecological and social welfare components as well as long-term economic prosperity. On the other hand, feminist analysis is illuminating the unbalanced power relations on the local, regional, and global levels. Feminist analysts view gender justice and the right to food and clean water as necessary human rights. This approach will involve moving beyond the strategies that have proved to be unhelpful in overcoming hunger and food insecurity during recent decades. This outcome is a shame because sufficient food exists to nurture as many as 12 billion people globally (Ziegler 2010).6 Meanwhile, the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD 2008) offers a different approach to rural development than the FAO approach (FAO 2011a, b). The IAASTD report (2008), which resulted from the collaboration between 2002 and 2008 of more than 400 experts from most countries around the globe, offers a rather critical view of the modernisation processes for agricultural development in recent decades. The reportâs main message is that âbusiness as usualâ is not an option if food security is to be achieved. One of its recommendations addresses womenâs participation in agriculture and food security. This message should be considered more seriously if the international community wants to eliminate hunger in the foreseeable future. There is an urgent need for priority setting in research to ensure that women benefit from modern agricultural technologies (e.g., labor-saving technologies and reduced health risk techniques) rather than being overlooked in the implementation of technologies as has often occurred in the past [. . . ]. For social and economic sustainability, it is important that technologies are appropriate to different resource levels, including those of women and do not encourage others to dispossess women of land or control their labor and income. Development of techniques that reduce work load and health risks, and meet the social and physical requirements of women can contribute to limiting the negative effects of the gender division of labor in many regions. Modern agricultural technology should not undermine womenâs autonomy and economic position. Targeted measures will be needed to ensure this does not happen. (IASSTD 2008, p. 79)"

Thailand had never allowed the employment of unskilled foreign workers in the country before; its existing legal framework did not provide clauses for such initiatives, so the government decided to use a cabinet resolution as the mechanism to establish a new legal framework. The cabinet resolution is an ad hoc type of policy formulation based on the belief that the employment of migrant workers would be a temporary event and the situation would change after some years (Chantavanich 2007a: 1â2). This belief in the âtemporarinessâ of migrant labour has proven to be misplaced. Many economic sectors in Thailand have relied continuously on migrant workers for more than three decades and there appears to be no prospect that Thai workers will return to these labour-intensive jobs. On the contrary, a research study suggested that the structural dependence on migrant workers tends to persist in the medium- to long-term since there is little evidence of alternatives such as a mechanization or re-structuring of the national workforce to attract Thai workers (Martin 2004: 3). 17.3.1"
303,258,0.984,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"In the case of South Korea, the historical experience of having a large emigrant population as a consequence of colonization, decolonization, war, and economic difficulties, has prepared an abundant âresourceââ namely overseas Koreansâfor networking. It became especially attractive for the government following the economic crisis of the late 1990s. The growing numbers of immigrants, as well as such social problems as an aging population and declining birth rate, have also fueled the shift in migration and citizenship policies. The New Nationality Law, with partial recognition of dual citizenship, represents the changing attitude of the South Korean state toward immigrants and the diasporas. It may become a springboard not only for resolving social problems and labor shortages, but also for recognizing the value of social diversity and realizing multiculturalism. However, in reality, South Koreaâs immigration policies, including dual citizenship, still have many limitations and inadequacies in achieving the ideal. Who benefits, then, from dual citizenship in South Korea? For the government, it is an attempt to attract skilled and talented individuals from abroad, as well as to generate economic gains from overseas Koreans through their investments and other transnational activities. However, these expectations seem quite difficult to fulfill, given the social and legal obstacles, such as persistent ethno-racial nationalism and suspicion against cultural diversity, or exclusion from the dual citizenship policy of foreign-born Koreans under the age of 65 and male citizens who have not completed their military service. Such obstacles make dual citizenship an impractical and questionable option in the eyes of diaspora Koreans. The scope of South Korean transnational nationalism encompasses South and North Koreans, Koreans adopted abroad, and overseas Koreans around the world trying to reconstitute globally the nation (Park, 1996). The New Nationality Law may provide further institutional infrastructures for this reimagining of the nation beyond territorial boundaries, and then dual citizenship will become an arena where competing interests and identity-claims come into play. In fact, diaspora communities are not homogeneous, but consist of individuals and groups from different backgrounds with varying needs and interests. It is therefore an extremely difficult task for the government to balance and manage their interests with those of native citizens and other immigrant groups, because policies favorable for the diasporas or immigrants may cause opposition from native citizens. Without tackling this issue, however, a series of policies for the diasporas will not bring about any successful outcomes; and that is applicable to nonKorean immigrants as well."

Indeed, these are situated within a broader context of mobility between the two countries, which involves a diversity of cross-border movements and various types of flows in both directions. Geographical proximity is the primary factor shaping such mobility, which has now entered a new phase following Bulgariaâs EU accession. Hence, there has been some degree of political unification of the Greco-Bulgarian space. However, various elements beyond conventional labour migration existed long before 2007. These include migrantsâ informal practices, which stretch across the borders through social networks linking localities of origin and destination and transnational lifestyles between the two countriesâoften conditioned by necessity. Practices of this kind might include visits to home villages or towns, whether for holidays or other reasons (Hatziprokopiou 2006, pp. 207â212).

For instance, more and more fishing incidents involving Chinese fishermen have triggered greater conflicts in regional waters. The outward and rapid expansion of Chinaâs marine fishery sector has put further pressure on the already limited stocks in the world and could further weaken the already fragile marine ecology (Greenpeace 2015; Mallory 2013; Zhang 2016b). Furthermore, while China recognizes that the agricultural sector must be modernized, the prevalence of small, fragmented land plots and unproductive farms render the task daunting, as pointed out by Chen Xiwen (2017), the former head of the Chinese Communist Party Office on rural policy and deputy head of the partyâs office of financial affairs. Chinaâs household-based smallholding agriculture has inherent limitations. Chief among these are the high costs and risks in gaining the capital, the skills, and especially the market access needed for commoditized agriculture, which deterred many small agriculturalists from making the transition. As such, China began to formulate and implement its agricultural modernization program in the mid-1990s, which aimed to transform the countryâs small-scale, household-based agriculture into a modernized agriculture, with the emphasis on increased scale, specialized production of higher-value goods, and market-orientation (Zhang 2012)."
242,376,0.984,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Masculinity at Work: Intersectionality and Identity Constructions of Migrant Domestic Workers trasts starkly with the invisibility of their work in private homes, as well as with their marginal social and economic status. The forms of injustices that female and male migrant domestic workers face in a variety of ways entrench the symbolic and material divides between migrants and employers, as well as between migrantsâ home and host societies. While this has been pointed out in earlier studies, we bring to the fore how migrant domestic workersâ efforts to adhere to hegemonic gender identities not only reproduce patriarchal gender relations amongst themselves, but also corroborate white privileges in productive and reproductive work. Given the âtwo facesâ of gender justice that Fraser (2007: 26) identifies, redressing these injustices requires changes both in the economic structure and in the status order of contemporary society. In combining the demands for respect and for labour rights for domestic workers, this necessity is reflected in domestic workersâ national (see for example FNV Bondgenoten 2011) and international campaigns (see for example IRENE/IUF 2008; IDWN no date) that have culminated in the ratification of the International Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers by the International Labour Conference (ILC 2011) as an intermediate success. These labour movements have taken on a new terrain of struggle. Beyond the traditional focus on the material aspects of labour conditions, the new approach has taken workersâ social status into account and has also led to a campaign for greater respect. Its emergence is probably related to an increasing awareness of the rise of precarious employment relations amongst trade unions. Precariousness, in turn, is often related to the low social status of the respective work.12 Importantly, these struggles have included changes in domestic workersâ own mindsets, from seeing themselves as âhelpersâ to emphasizing their dignity as workers. While national and transnational labour movements for greater social justice for migrant domestic workers have been effective, they are probably not the most powerful actors in this arena. In many cases, national labour regulation continues to neglect the private home as a workplace (ILO 2010; Simonovsky/ Luebker/Oelz 2011) due to gendered association of work and breadwinning with the public sphere. This chapterâs intersectional analysis has shown how these legal frameworks are underpinned by social constructions of migrant domestic workersâ location of work, 12 We are grateful to Freek Schiphorst for pointing this out."
110,22,0.984,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"time in many years; this demand is coming from a solvent urban middle class in the developing countries themselves. There are new skills and new entrepreneurial spirit among youth including in rural areas that could be mobilized for the modernization of the rural economy and for agribusiness. Some have started investing in agricultural value chains. IT technology, particularly cell phone usage, has been easily adopted by large number of rural individuals and enterprises and is used to reduce information gaps and transaction costs. No doubt, these factors are essential for creating an enabling environment for investment in rural areas and in agricultural production. The private sector has clearly identified them and is aggressively entering the sector to take advantage of this favorable situation. Hence, today, it is now possible to operate and finance agricultural and rural activities profitably. They are mostly run by entrepreneurs and enterprises that have assessed their risks, evaluated their potential gains, and made a well-thoughtthrough investment. Today, modern agriculture in developing countries is, by and large, private-sector led and profitable. Lower-end rural households have developed a diversification strategy to mitigate risks and get regular income throughout the year. This strategy has been paying off and could be financed quite safely through adapted lending methodologies. Over the last two to three decades, this situation could be considered as a unique chance for agriculture and off-farm activities to support significant growth for the rural economy in developing countries. Appropriate financing is highly needed to transform this opportunity into wealth creation.12 However, many challenges still remain, among others the negative impacts of climate change on production and productivity. This has led to tension over water and land, internally (between herders and farmers) or externally (âacquisition of farm lands by international buyersâ â the issue of âland grabbingâ).13 Will these large farms operated by foreign companies create decent and sustainable jobs for local laborers or will they marginalize the most vulnerable? Other challenges are related to access to technical advisory services for small farmers where public extension services have been phased out and not replaced by a private service provider. How will they be able to cope with new technical problems/crop diseases? How will they be able to take up new varieties or improve the quality of their production? A decade ago, major African political leaders and their partners, in the context of the New Partnership for Africaâs Development (NEPAD in 2001) and Comprehensive Africa Agriculture development Program (CAADP in 2003) and later, the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA in 2006) analyzed this situation"

These are (1) education; (2) local political participation; and (3) anti-discrimination legal frameworks. Education and multiculturalism is a well-researched topic and many frameworks for understanding different and varied developments have been advanced. If one includes the pioneering efforts in both Korean and Burakumin communities to promote education for human rights, multicultural education can be considered to have a long history in Japan. Tai (2007) documents the many nuances of Korean ethnic education connected to civil rights, particularly in Osaka City, home to the largest number of Koreans in Japan. Koreansâ campaign for ethnic classes (which include language, music, history, and other topics) in mainstream schools was partly inspired by the notions of âliberation educationâ that had been developed previously by Buraku activists (Tai, 2007, p. 8). While placing great emphasis on human rights and the struggles that have achieved them to date, such education is also somewhat limited by its separation into the majority/minority communities (Tsuneyoshi, 2011; see also Okano, 2006). In contrast, a framework of internationalization for education is used for newcomer education (as well as Japanese returnees from abroad). Much of this education focuses on Japanese language learning. In public schools there is no special budget for teachers who can teach in studentsâ native languages. Research on Brazilian and Peruvian schoolchildren (many Nikkei22 and some with mixed ethnicity) shows some of the problems of education in a multicultural Japan. Mooreheadâs (2013) examination of the âAmigos Roomâ at an elementary school in central Japan shows that teachers are sometimes unenthusiastic (they are not specialized, but chosen to staff the room in rotation) and the room is not well supplied and serves not as a place for supplementary Japanese language instruction so much as a space for students to overcome their feelings of isolation by being with immigrants like themselves. Next, I turn to local political participation. Kawasaki City in Kanagawa Prefecture became the first city in Japan to establish an assembly for foreign residents in 1996. This was followed by other cities: Tokyo (1997), Kyoto (1998), Mitaka (1999), Atsugi (2002) and others (Green, 2013). Kawasaki also became the first city in Japan to abolish the requirement"

Closely related to this line of thinking is the emphasis recently placed on the third sector as a major contributor to social capital, to those bonds of trust and reciprocity without which neither democracy nor markets can operate (Putnam 1993, 2000). Howard and Gilbert (2008), for example, find empirical support for the Tocquevillian argument, according to which those persons with greater levels of involvement in voluntary organizations also engage in more political acts, have higher life satisfaction and are more trusting of others than those who do not. TSOs also are thought to play a central political role by channeling, articulating and advocating individualsâ and groupsâ interests and values (Habermas 1998) and by participating in policy networks (Rhodes 1997) or advocacy coalitions (Sabatier 1998).

381,601,0.984,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Designing Governmental Policy to Motivate and Support Improvement and Equity Governmental and administrative policy at the federal, state, and local levels has been the predominant source of external pressure and support for educational change in the U.S.âparticularly with regard to equalizing opportunities for poor students, students of color, and English learners. Over the past six decades, this source has generally become more centralized, with states providing an increased portion of school funding (and demanding greater accountability for how those funds are spent) and the federal government taking more of a role in not only enforcing equality but also influencing the core direction of schooling. With respect to the balance between pressure and support, the scales at these two levels have recently tipped toward pressure and compliance, though requirements are often tied to categorical funding streams that wear the guise of inducements and fiscal support rather than blanket mandates. We have noted earlier how this emphasis on compliance can actually thwart improvement and lead to unintended negative consequences for underserved students, even when they are the intended beneficiaries. In addition, because policy is made at all levels of the system, schools are frequently confronted with a panoply of conflicting rules, overlapping programs, and fragmented directions that divert attention and prevent real change. To move toward a system that facilitates continuous improvement where it matters mostâin the schoolsâwill require a reconceptualization of the roles of the three levels of government and a rebalancing of emphasis between pressure and support, with greater attention going to providing long-term support for improvement than has been the case in recent years. At the core of this reconceptualization are the twin principles of (a) common commitment at all levels to the goals of equal opportunity, achievement, and attainment, and (b) governmental restraint and focus to achieve these goals. By restraint we mean that each level of government must fully consider the likely tradeoffs and potential unintended consequences before it creates new rules, strong incentives, and/or legislation based on ideology, politics, or even some evidence of effectiveness. The question must be, will the proposed action actually motivate and support greater equity and higher quality, or will it disrupt ongoing improvement processes and stress the schools and the teachers?51 A first step for all levels of government on the road to help schools and districts to achieve the improvement and equal opportunity vision is to model the ideas of continuous improvement within their own operations and to reach out to create"
2,414,0.984,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"The Three Countries Compared When we compare the countries, service areas and economic sectors, we generally ï¬nd that the users in the Danish school system are more empowered and have access to better systems for participation in decision-making. This has to do with the combination of long traditions of the free school system in Denmark, few legal restrictions on the content of the teaching, and the parentsâ rights to establish new schools. The users and the administrative system have clear and coherent expectations of âself-owning institutionsâ to such an extent that the new type of private kindergartens and âindependent nursing homesâ, which may take out proï¬t, so far tend to operate in a similar way to the traditional free schools. Whereas the importance of the nonproï¬t sector in Denmark constitutes a stable element, Scandinavian welfare provision is also changing. The role of user choice is increasing. In Sweden, this has been combined with increased involvement of for-proï¬t service providers. This has resulted in a strong growth and concentration of ownership in a small number of welfare conglomerates partly owned by international venture capitalists. The large Swedish conglomerates appear to use their ï¬nancial foundations to gain shares also in the emerging welfare markets in Denmark and Norway (Herning 2015). Moreover, some of them have established businesses also in the UK and other European countries. The case of Denmark nevertheless illustrates that a relatively strong nonproï¬t welfare provision is possible within a Scandinavian welfare model, and this has dampened the commercialisation process to some extent. The long-standing tradition for independent nonproï¬t schools in Denmark points to the importance of path dependency. The strength of the nonproï¬t sector in Denmark has been conducive to a strong political support across party lines. In contrast, the marginal nonproï¬t sector in Sweden has not been able to muster much political support. In this respect, Norway occupies a middle position between Denmark and Sweden."

This manifests itself in organizations that begin life in an advisory capacity. Founders are typically respected thinkers or practitioners with existing cache within the country, and often abroad. Whether they be from within the establishment or having worked with friendly international entities, they have come from a background where they have worked with or on behalf of government entities.

In Italy, too, the efforts to include such adults socially and in the labour market are rather weak. Although the context of the needs and difficulties has been defined as a result of the Tavolo nazionale di lavoro sullâautismo (National Working Table on Autism), effective and sufficient measures and funding have not followed. Currently, there is not available, in fact, an organized network of public services responsible for people with autism and, for most situations, there is a no homogeneous reality able to respond effectively to the growing request by family members and the institutions themselves for help in the management of their everyday life. Given, therefore, the decades of copious Italian legislation in the field of education and school and the social integration22 of students with disabilities, an analysis by Autism-Europe notes that both national laws and international standards allow, in general, an effective guarantee of the right to education of persons with disabilities, also recognized in court proceedings. However, the legislative path concerning access to employment for people with disabilities is different, as stated above."

Both regions could benefit from regional cooperation based on sharing the benefits of water resource development, for example, through regional electricity networks. The prospects seem good in Southern Africa, if the countries can move from talking to investing and creating a more integrated regional economy based in part on shared management of water resources. The potential is great but prospects are less rosy in South Asia: there are growing challenges internally in providing water and power services. These could be addressed through effective regional cooperation. But without stronger regional networks, partnerships and institutions supported by external facilitators, South Asia may fail to take full advantage if its water resources to achieve better lives for its people by 2030.

The most important aspect of this distinction is that the EU is not a state, does not have a ânational paradigm of migration researchâ and does not fund research centres and institutes in a comparable way to what happens in some of the other case countries within this book. This does not mean that there is a complete absence of EU competencies. Since 1999, the EU has established a range of âharderâ (essentially meaning with legal effect) governance mechanisms, including two directives on anti-discrimination, plus directives on family reunification and the rights of long term residents that contain provisions on integration measures. The EU is, thus, relevant to the study of dialogues on immigrant integration in Europe; but the task is to establish why, how and with what effects this relevance has been established, has become evident, who the key players are, and how the dialogues have been structured. The chapter shows how dialogues on migrant integration are embedded within and enabled by an EU context with its own distinct source of legal, social and political power. Any attempt to characterise EU dialogue on migrant integration needs to be attuned to this EU context and its development without exaggerating its effects but aware of its activities and their implications (both actual and potential) for the development and exchange of knowledge about migrant integration in Europe."

The end of the 20th century consequently saw widespread expectation that free elections, recognition of human rights, freedom of speech, and rule of law would become commonplace around the world. However, during the past decade, concerns have arisen over what Diamond (2014) has termed a worldwide âdemocratic recession.â This concern has arisen because of a surge in authoritarian government practices, for example in the Latin American region, as well as the failure of popular movements to replace undemocratic regimes in a number of Middle-Eastern countries. Lately, there has also been an increase in populist movements in many democratic societies. Their successes have been attributed, at least partly, to failures to mobilize young people to vote (see, for example, Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, 2016; Jackson, Thorsen, & Wring, 2016). Set in this global context, the second cycle of the IEA International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2016) aimed to investigate the ways in which young people are prepared to undertake their current and future roles as citizens in a range of countries.

Finally, in terms of diversity, the cultural-religious dimension, policies may be designed under two very different premises. The first is that integration demands the adaptation and learning of immigrants but also significant changes in access to and the working of institutional structures of the host society. The second is that societal rules and structures, including underlying norms and values, should be taken as a given and immigrants should (voluntarily or even as a mandatory task) adapt to them. Finally, the third question to be addressed is for whom are integration policies meant. Migrant integration policies that designate specific groups of immigrants as target groups are different from policies that focus on all immigrants and are even more distinct from policies targeting all individuals regardless of their origin or targeting natives, established civil society, and the general institutions of society. In practice, these different approaches result in very different policies, again with regard to the three dimensions of integration: Political rights can be granted to immigrants as individuals, for instance, by granting voting rights, or as groups, which often means the creation of representative bodies. Policies may seek to promote equal opportunities for all citizens, meaning equal access to housing, education, health care, and the labour market, or they may seek to promote an equal share in access to these goods and services. Finally, cultural diversity can be promoted as an individual or group right, the latter often implying state support to immigrantsâ own organizations and institutions. Frames cannot always be analysed directly; they often have to be reconstructed from policy documents and political discourse. When a policy is defined, it generally includes an explicit formulation of the perceived problem and the desired outcome of the specific efforts encompassed by the policy. Thus, politically debated statements in and about policy documents contain the essential elements of policy frames. The most important elements to be studied and compared are the general assumptions and orientations about the causes of the problem and remedies as well as basic concepts used (or explicitly rejected); the general aims of policies and dimensions of integration addressed; and the definition of the main target groups."

282,159,0.984,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"In his frequently quoted and powerful words, James Madison describes the importance of knowledge for democratic government as follows: A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. (Hunt, 1900â10, Vol. 1, Chap. 18, Doc. 35)70 Organisations like Privacy International, which runs a major campaign for freedom of information legislation, emphasise the link between access to information and the ability to participate: Democracy is based on the consent of the citizens and that consent turns on the government informing citizens about their activities and recognizing the right to participate. The public is only truly able to participate in the democratic process when they have information about the activities and policies of the government. (Banisar, 2006, p. 6) Because of its centrality to both accountability in general and to participation, transparency has become a very broadly recognised standard of democratic governance. Thus, for instance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognise the right to seek, receive and impart information.71 Moreover, the UN Convention against Corruption requires governments to take measures to enhance the transparency of their public administration and the Rio Declaration demands access to environmental information to enable participation.72 The importance of transparency is also increasingly reflected in government practice. Thus by 2006 70 countries from across the globe had adopted comprehensive freedom of information legislation, while another 50 were in the process of developing it.73 Consequently, the codes defining governance norms for standard-setting organisations also emphasise transparency. Both, ISO guide 59 and the ISEAL code of good practice, demand that standard-setting organisations publish their future work programmes or notify stakeholders of upcoming decisions, make available copies of the draft standards, publish approved standards promptly and document the process of standard development. Beyond that, ISEAL proposes that organisations publish all received comments, as well as the ensuing reactions and that they create a dedicated focal point for enquiries to facilitate the provision of information.74 As discussed in section 2.2.2.4, as well as in section 4.2.3, transparency can concern many different aspects of an organisation.

However, it is important not to confuse the mere fact of undertaking international activities with having an actual, plausible, effective, and beneficial policy of development cooperation. It must be understood that simply having a significant number of foreign students or some courses on international topics does not necessarily imply or mean that the concerned institution actually implements and practices real tangible international development cooperation. In recent years, rising expectations have been generated with regard to the need to adopt new perspectives in actions of international university cooperation directed toward less-developed countries. However, universities need to attain a more secure and prominent situation in the arena of international development cooperation than many NGOs have apparently been able to manage in recent years. Therefore, university authorities should overcome budgetary constraints and other impediments in order to pursue the necessary efforts to enhance the incorporation of international cooperation in their institutions. Technical international cooperation is one form of international university cooperation. Back in the nineteenth century, Alfred Nobel stated: âTo spread knowledge is to spread well-beingâ. Technical cooperation could be said to have its origins in this premise and has certainly developed to its present state in accordance with this view. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) defines technical cooperation as âthe activities whose primary aim is to increase the level of knowledge, technologies, practical know-how or productive attitudes of the population of developing countries, that is to say, to increase their reserve of human intellectual capital or their ability to use their current resources with greater efficiencyâ [3, 7]. As technical cooperation is the key issue of this chapter, a more comprehensive definition follows. Technical cooperation can be defined as the branch of development cooperation that uses the provision of know-how in the form of personnel, training, research, and associated costs of development. It includes contributions to development primarily through the medium of education and training to increase the level of knowledge, skills, technical know-how, or productive aptitudes of the population of developing countries, which in turn increases their stock of human intellectual capital, or their capacity for more effective use of their existing factor endowment [3, 7]. The basic aim of technical cooperation is to support the ability of people and organizations in creating, adapting, strengthening, and sustaining their capacity to set their own objectives. Its aims are that countries or institutions with a more advanced level of development in certain areas contribute to the solution of specific problems of less-developed countries or institutions through the transference and interchange of scientific and technological capacity and of human and material resources. This cooperation mode considers education as the engine driving the transformation of expanding economies. Technical cooperation between developed and less-developed countries can take several forms such as expert services, scholarships, transference of equipment and supplies, sending of bibliographical material,"
170,133,0.984,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"types of policies: ICT policies and sectoral policies where ICT4D research can have a catalyst effect. By ICT policies, I refer here to those policies of infrastructure, access, and availability of ICT that the government puts in place. It refers to what has been previously analysed and what is traditionally considered the arena of proposed changes for those working on ICT and development. This arena is still important since countries constantly delineate and adjust their ICT policies in accordance to the context and the appearance of new technologies. After the revision of the literature in the ICT4D domain, however, it is salient that its outcomes can inform other policies as well. For example, the work carried out on the impact of access to price information through mobiles (Islam and GrÃ¶nlund 2007) could inform agricultural systemsâ policies and other agricultural policies. These sectoral perspectives go beyond the traditional ICT sectoral policy perspective and view ICTs as possible disruptive forces in other fields. Informing these policies might be a way in which the catalysing effect of ICT policy can be realised. The challenge of approaching other policy debates, however, is that it might require sectoral experts who understand the specificity of that given debate."
371,353,0.984,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"construction workerâ in Belgium are the best examples of this rhetorical effort to associate perceived negative effects of EU migration with specific nationalities of EU citizens. Southern EU citizens have been affected by restrictive policies applied to all EU citizens in times of crisis. These policies undermine their ability to make use of their freedom of circulation in Northern Europe. But, in the cases we reviewed, only in the United Kingdom did we find explicit negative references made by policy-makers towards new Southern Europeans. Underlying this, and this is the third line of segmentation, is the fact that the history of migration has benefited Southern European migrants more than those from Central and Eastern European when they moved in times of economic crisis. Long-established Southern European migrant communities did not necessarily generate a higher level of intra-community solidarity between old and new migrants. Yet, new Southern European migrant communities, such as the Italians in Belgium or the Portuguese in France, have often had a comparative advantage when dealing with attacks on their freedom of circulation: they are able to benefit from long-established homeland institutions and organizations (i.e. political parties, trade unions, immigrant associations, etc.) based in receiving countries. Such organizations specialize in defending immigrant rights and have built significant connections over the years with other institutions and organizations based in destination countries. The mobilization of civil society organizations against the removal of residence permits from Southern Europeans living in Belgium, who are much less affected by this policy than Central Eastern European migrants, is a very telling example of this discrepancy."

The State is no longer the only, and sometimes not even the main, agent in the political arena that can exercise informational power over other informational agents, in particular over (groups of) human informational organisms. The European Commission, for example, recognised the importance of such new agents in the Cotonou Agreement3 between the European Union (EU) and the Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, by acknowledging the important role exercised by a wide range of nongovernmental development actors, and formally recognising their participation in ACP-EU development cooperation. According to Art. 6 of the Cotonou Agreement, such non-state actors comprise: âthe private sector; economic and social partners, including trade union organisations; civil society in all its forms, according to national characteristicsâ.4 The phenomenon is generating a new tension between power and force, where power is informational and exercised through the elaboration and dissemination of norms, whereas force is physical"

Admittedly, Europeanisation has impacted different parts of the system to different degrees. Larger, national-level HEIs have had better access to student mobility programmes, staff professional development opportunities which often bring Western notions into the Ukrainian realities (e.g. empowerment) and joint degrees with overseas institutions. HEIs located in Kiev also tend to have an advantage due to their relatively better accessibility for foreign visitors. Smaller institutions located in smaller towns tend to have less contact with their EU counterparts, less funding to finance international conferences or institutional visits and, as a result, develop fewer international links. International links and academic staff with overseas backgrounds form an attractive and prestigious feature for students. Hence, to a certain extent, Europeanisation policies have contributed to the vertical diversification of the institutional landscape. The Law on Higher Education (2014) and the Most Recent Changes in the Institutional Landscape The recently adopted Law on Higher Education (2014) has a special significance in the process of HE reform in Ukraine and comes at a significant time in Ukrainian history, following the Revolution of Dignity and the assertive stance Ukraine adopted on national self-governance. As insufficient time has yet to pass from its adoption it would be unreasonable to expect fully fledged implementation at the time of writing. It is, however, important to note several aspects which weave in the above-mentioned changes, leading to already noticeable alterations in the institutional landscape. First of all, there is an explicit effort to engage all the most immediate stakeholders of HE with the quality assurance process. The newly created Quality Assurance Agency is expected to draw on representatives of academic staff (excluding senior managers), employers and students. Secondly, rectors will once again be elected, with studentsâ voices having a greater impact (15% in proportional representation) on the outcome than before, which democratises the system. The Ministry of Education will be obliged to appoint rectors who have been elected in this fashion, regardless of the Ministryâs own views. This is a clear step towards supporting institutional"

In this chapter, it is argued that while global structures are important, contemporary multilevel and multi-actor governance patterns cannot be grasped without also including the roles played by individual countries and intergovernmental organisations. These actors are often driven by issue-specific interests but also bound by restrictions in terms of resource shortages and level of organisational skills. The focus of this chapter is on different measures that have been taken to reduce risks of accidental oil spills and strengthen operatorsâ incentives to follow rules and norms on intentional pollution. It will be argued that the EU plays an important role both as regulator and enforcer in marine environmental governance, namely, in between the regional (HELCOM) and the global level (IMO/ILO). HELCOM, on the other hand, plays an important mediating role between national interests among the Baltic Sea countries and regulations in the EU and IMO. Furthermore, it will be argued that individual countries play important roles in specific governance situations, especially when they perceive strong national interests to be at stake. Mechanisms to facilitate proactive governments taking action when it is in their interest to do so could in certain situations contribute to improved and more sustainable governance. The remaining part of this chapter is structured as follows. After a brief section on ecological and economic impacts of oil spills, we have a section on measures to reduce accidental spills and mitigate intentional spills. Examples of both command and control as well as incentive-based measures are given. The chapter concludes with a discussion on possible ways ahead, with a particular focus on what roles the EU and HELCOM can play in regional governance of marine oil transportations."

On a less positive note, this civilian missionâs legitimacy has been seriously eroded by the cases of corruption among EULEX staff and the criticism of its reluctance to prosecute political and economic elites allegedly involved in organised crime and corruption. In this respect, our research corresponds with several analyses conducted by other scholars (see Chap. 4 for details). Thus, it is no surprise that a signiï¬cant majority of the Kosovar population and local institutions would prefer to see the termination and withdrawal of this mission. Regarding the efï¬cient use of resources needed to achieve the required level of functioning of Kosovoâs customs, police and judiciary, the picture is also not promising. The majority of âlocalsâ and âinternationalsâ believe EULEX has spent signiï¬cantly too many resources (ï¬nancial, human, material etc.) for its relatively modest contribution to the rule of law and sustainable peace. Some authors like Capussela (2015) even claim notwithstanding this enormous investmentâfar bigger than in other countries in the region in which the EU is also engagedâthe improved functioning of these three sectors has been too slow. He adds the EUâs efforts to bolster the rule of law in Kosovo have mostly failed. This is consistent with World Bank (2014) worldwide governance indicators from 2014 showing that Kosovo continues to score lowest in the Western Balkan region for the rule of law.1 With regard to the normativity of EULEXâs approach to Kosovar institutions, it is noted that the target institutions have beneï¬ted from EULEXâs policy, which calls for a balance in the ethnic and gender composition of local law-enforcement institutions. The representation of Kosovo Serbs and other minorities within them reflects the actual composition of society relatively well, with some minor deviations. What remains a challenge is the relatively small number of female police and customs ofï¬cers. Several structural and cultural factors might explain this. Theoretical and policy implications of the research In spite of almost two decades of engagement by the EU and other international actors, Kosovo remains a partly free and semi-consolidated authoritarian regime. This is not something a country that supposedly adheres to the rule of law can be proud of. However, certain progress has been made and should be acknowledged (Freedom House 2016). In addition, Kosovo remains economically one of the least developed countries in Europe, with widespread unemployment and inactivity, especially among women and youth, âwhich leaves an ample amount of human potential unused, misused or underusedâ (UNDP 2016). Hence, when discussing the theoretical and policy implications of this research, one should recall that EULEX is only one, albeit a very robust and resourceful, international actor"

However, the discussion about public versus private service delivery often overlooks the potential for pioneering and distinctive roles of nonproï¬t providers that initiated most of the welfare services we have today (Sivesind 2008). In short, policymakers are worried that the public welfare spending may not give the best results, and to ï¬nd out they wanted to create competition. This is the background for a very broad implementation of new public management tools and quasi-markets in Scandinavia. It all started when local governments made an internal separation between contracting authorities and providers of services. This happened in the beginning of 1990s in Sweden (Erlandsson et al. 2013, 27) and late in the 1990s in Denmark and Norway (VabÃ¸ et al. 2013, 171). Since then, responsibilities for results have been increasingly decentralized from political councils to lower administrative levels and even to semi-autonomous agencies, for example, regional health authorities in Norway. Frame agreements between public purchasers and service providers that would almost automatically be renewed are being replaced by contract negotiations, open tenders, and user choice in combination with voucher systems with national agencies authorizing service providers. This latter model has been spreading rapidly to new service areas and governance levels in Sweden since the 1990s, and it is recently getting wider implementation in Norway and Denmark as well. User choice, influence, and adaptation are backed by several recent policy documents from all the Scandinavian countries pointing out that the dominant public provision is no longer capable of meeting new challenges that endanger the welfare modelâs sustainability. This includes the emergence of new groups of young users, more old people with a need for different kinds of help, limited personnel resources, increased private prosperity, and more social and cultural heterogeneity (An example from Norway is Report to the Storting (White Paper) nr. 29 2012â2013). These changes make recipients of all kinds of services require adaptation to individual needs. Traditional, standardized welfare services are struggling to meet these challenges. âTo secure the future"

The Green Economy Strategy itself is informed by and arose from the requirements of the Western Cape Climate Change Response Strategy, which highlights the need for planning, preparation and innovation to maximise the provinceâs capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change. However, there is currently a lack of suitably qualiï¬ed professionals and technicians to successfully implement the Climate Change Response Strategy and Green Economy Strategy. The Province has thus identiï¬ed an urgent need for skills development in the areas of climate change mitigation and adaptation, the green economy and infrastructure development. To this end, representatives of the Western Cape Government (WCG) met with the Cape Higher Education Consortiumâs (CHEC) Coordinating Group on Climate Change, and communicated the need to match university education with the knowledge and core competencies that will be required by the Climate Change Response Strategy and Green Economy Strategy. Subsequently, the task team was requested to extend the scope of the project to cover Further Education and Training Colleges if support from the CEOs of the colleges was provided and suitable researchers could be found. The vision of the CHEC representatives is for the four universities to collaborate with one another and with the Province to provide up-to-date, relevant education in the areas of the green economy and climate change, and equip professionals with the skills and core competencies necessary to bring the âGreen Economic Hubâ to life."
110,35,0.984,Finance for Food : Towards New Agricultural and Rural Finance,"At the macro level, successful agricultural and rural development built upon a private-sector-led approach would certainly have an impact on growth. And as this sector involves a majority of the population and most often the lower end segment, a spill over effect is likely. With appropriate policy, there should also be a significant impact on food security and food sovereignty for countries and regions that have been dependant. 3.2 Roles of Governments (Central and Local), Donors and Private Players in Supporting the New Agricultural and Rural Finance Having a conducive environment is absolutely essential to transform this opportunity into growth, economic development and impact on people. For once, all stakeholders seem to agree on what is needed for success. Role for Governments On the overall framework, governments at the central level should show strong support to entrepreneurship, as well as any form of economic initiative developed by the private sector, be it from the rural households, the migrants, farmersâ groups, or from companies of all sizes, national or foreign. Incentives to invest in rural areas, add value to local products, and to serve the domestic food market should be put in place in the form of temporary tax exemptions, facilitation in getting licence to operate, reducing administrative burden, etc. Specifically, a rural and agricultural finance policy could set a clear vision, the objectives that the country want to achieve, and define roles for all players. It will certainly specify the role that the government want to play and how it wants to promote and achieve public-private partnerships (PPP). Such a rural finance policy is either absent in many countries or is more of a agricultural and rural development policy rather than a financial sector policy that takes the specific needs of rural and agricultural finance in consideration. Among others, governments can invest in IT infrastructure to lower costs for banks and MFIs using technology to further penetrate the rural markets. Local governments could very well be one of the major beneficiaries of the outcome of rural and agricultural value-chain financing, if investments are made in villages and secondary towns, if permanent jobs are created, and if tax for productive infrastructure is paid It could also play a promoting role by creating a attractive environment for entrepreneurs to invest and settle their business locally. Did I understand? This could be through the mobilization of research laboratories of universities to work with firms on new products, or usage of vocational training centers to provide adapted skills that firms may need or facilitate apprenticeship. In value chain financing, setting up a local or regional venture capital in joint venture with private sector and banks is emerging as an innovative funding vehicle to encourage entrepreneurship."

Villagers in the delta describe enormous ï¬sh discard (waste) by the motorized commercial boats, including large deposits of ï¬sh bones and other waste, that create major problems for their small nets and also destroy ï¬sh reproductive and feeding habitats. One Dasanech ï¬sher responded this way when asked for his view of the foreign ï¬shing boats: What is bad about them is the amount of ï¬sh they kill. Some of them [ï¬llet] the ï¬sh right there and throw the waste in the lake, so this makes the lake water poisoned. We get small nets from some of them, but mostly we are losing our ï¬sh, so nets donât help us if the ï¬sh are gone. The Ethiopia-based ï¬shing corporations have steadily increased their catch range into Kenyaâs Lake Turkana, where they are in clear violation of that nationâs sovereignty. These company boats extend their ï¬shing ventures as far southward as North Island (Figs. 1.3 and 5.2), often display the Ethiopian flag and are often accompanied by Ethiopian guard boats. They pay no fees to Kenya, nor do they obtain ï¬shing licenses or make catch reports to Kenyaâs local Beach Management Units. Turkana representatives from villages along the northwestern shoreline have appealed to the Kenyan government numerous times to expel the foreign fleets, and Kenyan ï¬sheries ofï¬cials are fully aware of the situation. As of early 2015, the Kenyan government had taken no effective action, despite innumerable requests by Turkana ï¬shers and their representativesâ including in the locally based Beach Management Units. Nor have the development banks, in their assessments of lake conditions, ï¬shery status or socioeconomic conditions (AFDB 2009 and 2010) raised the issue of the incursion and impact of Ethiopian commercial fleets in these Kenyan waters on ï¬sh stocks and on the worsening interethnic conflict among ï¬shers. What amounts to state-sponsored piracy into Kenyan waters is a matter of international sovereignty, but also greatly worsens the crisis faced by vast numbers of Kenyaâs Turkana whose livelihood is dependent upon the lakeâs ï¬shery. â¢ Violent conflicts between Dasanech and Turkana ï¬shers who are increasingly desperate to secure catch from these northern waters constitute a major problem in the region. The northernmost portion of the lake accounts for many of the âhotspotsâ of conflict expansion (Fig.5.3). The frequent violence over gear theft and sporadic killings noted above frequently spreads to pastoral and agropastoral communities in the region (and visa versa) with extensive series of reprisals between the two ethnic groups. The frequent points of conflict among ï¬shersâindicated in the map of Fig. 5.3âare also the likely points of major expansion of local conflicts into regional ones. This trend is already well underway and is greatly ampliï¬ed by the plummeting of livelihood resources as a result of Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultural development. Governmental, non-governmental and U.N.-based accounts of conflicts among ï¬shers and in the border region generally exclude consideration of the actual causes of this mounting crisis. Instead, the âsolutionsâ prescribed are most often either interethnic âmediationââwithout account of the real dynamics at playâor additional militarization by the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments, or both."

Next to investments, we have to address the question of adoption of sustainable land management practices and policies. To implement land restoration, we need to understand obstacles within the social, economic, and the political context. The results of this study show that particular attention needs to be paid to tangible local incentives for taking action against land degradation. This requires secure land rights, enhancing extension services, and empowering local communities to manage their natural resources. The identiï¬cation of implementation pathways through multi-stakeholder processes assumes a particular importance in this regard.

Innovative projects and organisations with precarious funding may then be marked even more by those negative trends to be observed in todayâs labour markets, such as time-limited working contracts that offer no job security. This may be counterbalanced by the fact that people working in innovative projects and earning their money there may enjoy an atmosphere of creativity and cooperation and more âpositiveâ stress than the negative type that comes from hierarchies and lack of appreciation. Trust-based relationships may cause many contributors to participate for short periods and accept short-term contracts, secure in the knowledge that a new contract is a possibility once circumstances allow. Innovative elements such as building trust, cooperation and unwritten rules of respect are part of the working climate. However, they can hardly be seen as an adequate antidote to low levels of job security. Making them part of the working conditions in innovative projects is, therefore, essential but not sufficient. Various working collectives Models for individual engagement in social innovation projects were typically much more diverse than in the public or business sector, since they included not only various forms of (casual) paid employment but also many forms of voluntary and civic contributions. The latter ranged from short-term activism to regular, unpaid, volunteering over the long term or from hands-on volunteer work to regular contributions in the form of civic engagement on a board of management. Various working fields were taking shape that linked paid work, volunteering and civic engagement. It was remarkable how blurred the boundaries were becoming between those who operated inside organisations and those that were considered as âco-producersâ. An illustrative example, which is representative of many other similar instances, was an initiative named âBimbo Chiama Bimboâ (Child Calls Child) in Brescia, Italy (Evers et al., 2014, p. 164). This project offered various forms of support for households with children through collaboration with neighbourhood and municipality stakeholders.

35,538,0.984,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"While early studies mostly focussed on technological feasibility, environmental impacts, and proï¬tability, the perceptions of stakeholders in the offshore realm have experienced increasing attention in the North Sea context. A number of studies have collected and analysed stakeholder attitudes, their interests and concerns over the past decade (Michler-Cieluch et al. 2009a, b; Michler-Cieluch and Kodeih 2008; Michler-Cieluch and Krause 2008; Vollstedt 2011; Wever et al. 2015; Michler-Cieluch 2009) (Projects No. 4 âCoastal Futuresâ, Project No. 13 âOpen Ocean Multi-Useâ). Many of the stakeholders from the ï¬shery and offshore wind industries, public administration, environmental groups and the research community have been part of the ongoing offshore research process since its very beginnings and still remain to date. Table 11.3 gives an overview of the most relevant actor groups in this context. In the early process of identifying key stakeholders in the offshore realm, it became apparent that the types of actors involved in, or affected by offshore ventures clearly differ from stakeholders in coastal areas, and so do their interests and concerns with respect to offshore uses (Krause et al. 2003; Michler-Cieluch 2009). Coastal areas have a long history of a great variety of uses, so user patterns and stakeholder networks have naturally grown over a long time period. Offshore areas to the contrary have only recently experienced intense utilisation due to technological advancements. This resulted in conflicts, as new types of use emerged or intensiï¬ed, while other uses are marginalized or even banned. The offshore wind energy sector has turned into a powerful, international player that has beneï¬tted immensely from the current political agenda in Germany. Other users, such as ï¬sheries, are pushed out of large areas of the ocean. Within this highly contested"

In the communist era, all actions of state agencies were âplannedâ, the âplanâ usually being ignorant of reality, and never based on evidence or scientific expertise. There is no tradition of commissioning research and to add to this, despite ideological declarations stating otherwise, the social sciences themselves are not accustomed to providing applicable research results. The public administration and its officials remain procedure-oriented rather than goal-oriented. All these features of the state may be presented here with a certain dose of simplification and exaggeration, yet these broad brush strokes quite adequately depict the conditions for dialogue on certain issues in Poland. When it comes to civil society in Central Eastern Europe, there are three factors of weakness (as compared to the West) according to Howard (2003): (1) illegitimacy and distrust towardss forms of collective association, which often were obligatory in the communist period; (2) strong bonds of family and groups based on friendship which render formal forms of association less relevant; and (3) increased individualism caused by a disappointment with corrupt and inefficient collective action (Howard 2003). Similarly, Bafoil lists the following features of non-governmental organisations in Central Eastern Europe: âthey are more widespread in urban than in rural areas; they are able to mobilise only a small number of voluntary workers (in comparison with the figures for Western Europe); they are particularly short of funds [ : : : ]; and their relations with the public authorities are often difficultâ (Bafoil 2009:174â5). Non-governmental organisations are not perceived as partners by public authorities, but rather as providers of services. According to Bafoil, mistrust between the state and non-governmental organisations in many sectors has actually risen since the fall of communism, as governments did not wish to share their prerogatives. Howard and Bafoilâs observations need to be supplemented with a reference to the Polish historical context that goes further back than communism: the perception of the state as oppressive originates in the nineteenth-century occupation of parts of Poland by the Russian Empire, and in the feudal social systems before that. The mistrust between public officials and NGO activists hinders constructive dialogue and cooperation. However, such mistrust also seems to institutionalise specific forms of dialogue, such as scandals and symbolic conflict. Non-governmental organisations in Poland have been significantly strengthened recently thanks to the hitherto unknown possibility of acquiring European funds, which provide resources unattainable through private donors or authorities. As mentioned, social scientists in Poland are generally not familiar with applied research for policymaking, despite occasionally expressed ambitions to advance social engineering. Applied research is perceived by some scholars as less prestigious than âpureâ scientific inquiry. But even scholars interested in social policy often develop indicators that are not applicable by policymakers. Expertise provided to authorities is often perceived as decorative in nature by researchers themselves. In relation to public authorities and non-governmental organisations, social scientists often behave like âsupportersâ of NGOs. In the case of research on refugees in Poland it has been shown that authors of publications assume beforehand that NGOs act in favour of refugees, while public organisations are tools of exclusion and discrimination (Pawlak 2012)."
242,774,0.984,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","At the end of the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s the EU increasingly framed Libya as a strategic territory for the movements of people through the Saharan and Mediterranean regions, despite the fact that the transSaharan space has been traditionally crossed by people in movement (Blanchet 2011). On the one hand, economic downturns and regional conflicts increased migration flows in the trans-Saharan space and tight controls on other parts of the Mediterranean coast, in particular the Straits of Gibraltar, resulted in a partial reorientation of migratory movements with migrants trying to reach Europe from Libya. On the other, Libya remained mainly a destination country, but its description as a transit area has been used as political leverage for Gaddafi to negotiate with European governments (De Haas 2008; Branchet 2011; Paoletti 2011).

106,34,0.984,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"The use of traditional media bettering the image between the police and citizens has been in use for some time. For example, an NGO interviewed in Kabul explained how they invited a police representative to their radio show to facilitate direct interaction between the police and communities. Also, a radio channel called âRadio Policeâ was launched by MoIA with the intent of bettering communication and contact between the police and public (Zaland 2015). In addition, MoIA1 has been developing their Media and Outreach Directorate to perform better outreach to citizens and improve transparency. In 2009, MoIA launched the helpline 119 as their first major ICT initiative. The line was originally designed with the aim of assisting citizens to help them make complaints against police misbehavior, corruption and human rights violations. It later included the reporting of criminal and terrorist activities. In 2013 the line was extended to five other provinces. In order to create public awareness about the existence of the line, a private TV channel had a TV program called âShow Reaction 119â (Zaland 2015). Still, however, there are no 119 units in most of the provinces. Despite increasing awareness and use of the helpline, both ethical and technical shortcomings have been pointed out by MoIA officials and NGO representatives. Some of the technical shortcomings identified were lack of sufficient maintenance and support systems. People manning the call centers are not professional police, causing delays in action to be taken. On the ethical side the biggest challenge is, as mentioned by NGO leaders, safeguarding the identity of the caller and controlling who has access to all the incoming data. In 2013, MoIA launched a Facebook and Twitter page. These are forums where the police can inform of their activities and people can comment on them, and people can also inform the police about security issues or problems occurring in the neighborhood and even post films showing the police catching criminals. From our field studies in Nimruz Province, examples from the Shuras2 in the city show how communities in partnership with the police help to curb crimes and insurgencies. An important step in this preventive measure is the provision of cell phone numbers of the police to Shura members who can now call upon them anytime in case of an emergency. These efforts on the part of the Government may look small and insignificant. However, keeping the context of Afghanistan as a conflict/post-conflict society facing insurmountable challenges on the issues of trust, security, corruption and accountability in mind, such measures can nevertheless contribute to improving relations between police and communities. What is important to note, however, is that these technologies are only useful if they are initiated in a context of mutual trust â they need a trusted relationship to begin with, and then may build trust over"
99,346,0.984,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"From a local political issue to an emblematic and publicised project, the Ilot Stephenson story has profoundly influenced the Tourcoing mayor, urban planners from SEM Ville RenouvelÃ©e and Lille Metropolis and other stakeholders in the project. It has definitely led to the integration of a human and participatory dimension in urban planning and urban renewal projects. According to the architects, calling into question, even if partially, the plan for a large and emblematic urban renewal project already voted in by the local authorities remains quite rare. Although such innovations are quite sensitive to the local context, several factors can be identified for explaining why it has worked. Firstly, Ilot Stephenson, like the housing rehabilitation in Boulogne-sur-Mer, was considered a problematic zone within the initial urban renewal plan. Faced with deadlock situations such as residentsâ protests or the retrenchment of welfare services, local policymakers opened their minds to new ideas and agreed to explore new urban solutions. Consequently, the political will of the mayor was fundamental for long-term support for the architects in the face of scepticism expressed at the beginning by a number of social landlords, local urban planners and social workers. Secondly, the national reputation of the architect and his connections with the political network are another important factor, not only for launching such a specific experiment, but also for integrating and legitimizing it with networks, processes and resources from other scales. Thirdly, it is worth noting that the contract mechanism used for this experiment is also unusual for this kind of urban operation. Whereas local authorities usually turn to public procurement for urban planning projects, this was a partnership agreement (convention de partenariat), which provided the contractual frame between the architectsâ firm and SEM Ville RenouvelÃ©e. An adapted contracting mechanism is favourable to this sort of tailor-made urban project. Finally, the Ilot Stephenson case is interesting because conceptualisation is an ongoing process, expressed by the slogan Faire ensemble, Le Grand ensemble [âWorking together to build the whole urban areaâ], which has been tested successfully in other places, such as the rehabilitation of all the precarious housing on a street in Boulogne-sur-Mer. This ability of the Construire architects to transform local experiments within a specific context into a more or less mainstream concept is crucial for being able to influence collective representations of what is or is not innovative, and to become relevant to people and institutions from outside. Architects regularly conceptualise and communicate on a new urban approach to social housing construction and urban rehabilitation through publications, conferences and videos. In addition, one of the architects who worked in the Stephenson neighbourhood throughout the entire project won a prize for young urban planners in 2012. The Ilot Stephenson project has been subject to local publicity and media coverage with a special website and numerous articles in the regional press. The inhabitantsâ organisation was often solicited by journalists. Stephenson has gradually become a kind of showcase project, with all the risks of overexposure in terms of expectations created. Whereas the Ilot Stephenson was a local political problem at the beginning of"

Analysis of statewide data can help states set priorities for moving forward to ensure that all students have access to the standards. But standards and priorities are only one step toward setting direction for the state. Equally important is ensuring consistency in the signals to local districts and schools through consistent leadership and sustained commitment to improvement. This has been and continues to be a major challenge in the majority of states. All too often, state leaders do not have a deep understanding of the nature of the problems; state bureaucracies are locked into patterns that are directive and punitive rather than supportive; and lobby groups work to maintain current practices, often by guiding the votes of legislators and the behavior of the administrators. These practices will not change quickly, but they can be ameliorated over time. Though not yet fully successful, leaders in states such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Texas, and now California have made substantial progress. The key is sustaining the work over time. One- or two-term leadership is not enough; change of the sort we describe here takes a decade or more to embed itself into the fabric of the system. The task is not easyâthe commitment to sustain a policy direction that is based on continuous improvement and equal opportunity is difficult to keep up without succumbing to the siren call of âmagic bullets.â But it is necessary. And we suspect that strategic mobilization within the profession and among community stakeholders will be necessary to reach a common vision and ensure that state governments actually stay the course (see below)."

Furthermore, since TSOs have to manage an increasing deficit, debts are increasing (Chaves et al. 2016; Petrella et al. 2016). TSOs are struggling in Spain to make ends meet; however, compared to Poland and particularly Croatia, the sector enjoys a favorable public image, TSOs active in the social domain are linked to powerful umbrellas, specifically, to ONCE, Red Cross and Caritas (Chaves et al. 2016), and recently, a major support infrastructure was set upâthe Spanish Social Third Sector Platform. On the other hand, the sector in Spain is also confronted with significant difficulties in developing further into the direction of the welfare partnership model. There is a lack of awareness of the social and economic impact of the sector; politicians and government officials tend to overlook the sector while designing public policies. Finally, clearly indicated in the Spanish national report on the sector are the difficulties firstly to assess and secondly to work with EU funds. Also, in Spain, working with public funds comes along with increased requirements for control, and hence bureaucracy. In summary, the third sector struggles with a scarcity of resources and increasing difficulties to cope with those administrative demands that are most likely a side effect of the introduction of NPM instruments in Europe. It seems that TSOs have to invest time and organizational capacity to comply with administrative and monitoring requirements of funders and/or contracting partners. Furthermore, due to changes in their environment, TSOs are forced to act more and more business-like. If we perceive working with volunteers as a special ingredient of TSOs, during the last decades, it has become more difficult for TSOs to be volunteer-based in terms of both their labor force and their governance structures. In order to be competitive, TSOs tend to reduce the cost of their labor force. However, the organizations are aware that in the future this might cause problems, since the low-pay jobs offered by TSOs might be less attractive for highly qualified personnel. âTo get the right person for the jobâ also constitutes a big problem for the governance of TSOs that look upon a tradition of being managed and/or supervised by board members serving in honorary positions. Nowadays, there is a decreasing interest in taking over these positions. In the next chapter, we will turn to the topic of how to address the identified barriers appropriately and to develop a policy agenda that indicates âthe way aheadâ for the third sector in Europe."

The integration of academic credit with non-credit workforce programmes is driving governments to develop national competency-based reference frameworks, learning outcomes-based approaches to curricula and learner databases. Drawing on Amartya Senâs distinction between human capital and social opportunities, this chapter also highlighted how in some country contexts social-justice related policies are used to tackle inequality, while other countries use indirect policies to deal with increasing equality in educational opportunity. Depending on the particular contexts and circumstances, both policy types have benefits. While in some countries RVA is a tool to increase the number of persons with higher education, in other countries RVA efforts are more targeted and are designed either to entrench the gains made by increased literacy levels (Botswana, South Africa) or to close the gap between different sections of the community, particularly immigrant groups (Norway), indigenous populations (New Zealand), rural groups, low-qualified workers (Mauritius) âyoung leavers at riskâ (Scotland) and those trapped in the poverty cycle. In the latter approach, recognition is an important tool for the promotion of inclusion. The chapter also highlighted research evidence showing low-uptake of RVA among equity groups such as women. This finding is related to the lack of familiarity with formal learning discourses. Instead, equity groups are more likely to participate in training than to seek recognition of existing skills. The use of RVA to promote equality of access and participation in education is often driven by wider policy frameworks or contexts. In Portugal, the high number of under-qualified young people entering the labour market is a major driver of RVA (Gomes 2013); in Scotland, recognition became a means of recognising the skills of learning and qualifications of migrant workers and refugees. In the Netherlands, validation is applied as a tool to tackle the economic crisis and targets young unemployed persons lacking Level 2 vocational qualifications, those who are at risk of losing their jobs, or those who need to achieve mobility on the labour market. In Botswana and South Africa recognition serves to allow adults to participate in adult basic education and training (ABET) upon becoming literate; in post-conflict societies international organisations like the UNHCR are promoting policies so that children, young people and adults record what they have learnt. In many countries, recognition is a part of skills development agendas. In Canada, recognition is an important policy for recognising the experiential learning of indigenous populations; in New Zealand recognition is a part of the Tertiary Education Strategy to close the gap between Maori and the rest of the population. In Australia, recognition forms part of the social inclusion agenda. RVA benefits individuals by improving career and employment prospects and creating pathways to further learning and qualification opportunities. Beyond the bounds of these external dimensions of personal development, RVA contributes to self-esteem, confidence and motivation, greater awareness, improving personal reflection, increased confidence and self-directed learning management."
277,208,0.984,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"The relevance of what happens at the other levels of the increasingly multilevel governance of integration in Europe becomes clear after the European Union initiated its own integration policy in 2003. Although the European Commission has a very specific definition of integration and of target groups (which is certainly not always shared by cities), increasingly direct policy cooperation has come into existence between the European Commission and local authorities, bypassing the national governance level. In that new constellation of multi-level governance, an interesting form of research-policy dialogues has mushroomed: networks of European cities that evaluate and share their own practical knowledge, assisted in that process by researchers, and financed by the European Commission. A systematic study of what has been produced in three of these networks, Cities for Local Integration Policies, Integrating Cities and Intercultural Cities, would teach us a lot about local policy-research relations as these have evolved in the last decade, both in terms of the individual cities involved and in terms of their cross-national cooperation.

It is imperative that the presence of the United Nations and other international agencies remain is a priority even when a zero target had been reached. As a developing country, it is important that cultural practices that have been long established and which may have a potential to counter recovery practices are dealt with in a sensitive manner. A dialogic process with community people will yield better answers and empowerment than coercive measures. The outbreak has created high rates of unemployment particularly among the youth.

341,81,0.984,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"redundancies and gaps in the institutional framework that affect policy coherence and sector performance. Stakeholder mapping can be used to identify the core stakeholder functions in the sector and to assess how effectively they are carried out. Such mapping also highlights the interaction with, and the impact of stakeholders on, other areas that influence the water sector. Beyond the âtraditionalâ actors, new players have gained interest and influence in water governance (Fig. 3.4). Whilst the role of the private sector has been inclined to focus on companies delivering water supply and sanitation, businesses have paid increasing attention to water governance in their strategies, especially to cope with regulatory risks and to secure water allocation. In parallel, citizens and water user associations have gained increasing influence over political decisions on water. As risks of floods intensify, property developers are also gaining influence, as spatial development generates long-term liabilities and financial implications in terms of water management, such as compensation for the loss of green areas and water amenities. They can play an important role in harnessing new sources of finance and contributing to the development of nontechnical solutions to manage floods. Institutional investors (e.g. pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds) have also begun to factor environmental, social and governance issues into their decisionmaking process, and they are investing more and more in water infrastructure and utilities. Some stakeholder categories are frequently excluded from the process. These include women (as the primary users of water in many parts of the world, for domestic consumption, subsistence agriculture and health), youth (as the future generation that will need to solve issues related to water), the rural and urban poor (as the main consumers in informal urban and rural settlements) and indigenous and aboriginal"
341,123,0.983,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"the political, administrative and technical capacity to support development, in what has been summed up as constituting the âsoftware and the hardwareâ of developmental states (see Kim 2007; Weiss 2010; Dadzie 2013). In short, the developmental state is understood, at one level, to be a unitary actor vis-Ã -vis markets, social forces and international pressures. It is also conceptualised as a set of institutions that structure the behaviour, preferences and strategies of all political actors, inside and outside of the actual state apparatus (Wong 2004). Ultimately, robust state-intervention measures determine the nature and pace of socio-economic progress (Routley 2014). The implications of this state-centric paradigm, both as an empirical reality to be studied and a theoretical construct to be debated, are far reaching, particularly when one considers governance of a resource sector such as water and sanitation. It is also important for scholars to understand that in East Asia where the concept was successfully tried out and popularised, government development policies were neither socialist in design, nor did they promote completely unfettered markets (Fakir 2007). The East Asian experience, and the role of the state in facilitating postwar growth, confounded existing capitalismâsocialism and NorthâSouth debates (Johnson 1999). When understood against this ideologically charged context, it becomes easier to understand how the examples of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea are often regarded as the living prototypes of developmentalism. Krieckhaus (2002) states that many East Asian countries have obtained economic growth rates unparalleled in human history, with per capita income roughly doubling every decade over the past 30 years. Therefore, they were post-war anomalies whose experiences still demand explanation (Leftwich 2005). Some of the key factors that have been identified as necessary ingredients for the emergence and sustenance of developmental states include the establishment of production-oriented private sectors and performance-oriented governance generally, which essentially refers to fully functional and effective institutions (Meyns and Musamba 2010). Beyond merely identifying and stressing the importance of these factors in the emergence of developmental states, the literature has also extensively examined the processes by which they can and should be put in place. For example, the developmental states in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan used public policy instruments to allocate productive resources rather than relying solely on the market (Bagchi 2000; Kim 2007). They also targeted certain industrial sectors in their allocation of resources, sometimes playing a leadership role in prospecting potentially lucrative industrial sectors and at other times playing a followership role in strengthening pre-existing private-sector initiatives (Wade 2004). Through the creation of tariff barriers, the subsidisation of research and infrastructural development, the use of export incentives and centralised control over the financial system, the developmental state demonstrated how âgetting the prices wrongâ through government intervention into the market was an effective strategy to compensate for East Asiaâs relative economic backwardness and to jump-start the regionâs catch-up development (Meyns and Musamba 2010; Mkandawire 2012). The distributive consequences of economic growth were less important to the developmental state, provided that social inequality was never too severe and that the"

99,279,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Message TwoâAbout Innovations in Regulations and Rights These days, working and living patterns are changing and less continuous; zones of transition between life situations and life stages are becoming more complicated (Bovenberg 2008). Traditional services cannot always cope with these complexities. This may mean being out of school but not yet in a job, on the track back to employment but without access to a place to live. Often this coincides with other acute problems that may require immediate help. What some have called ânew social risksâ (Bonoli 2005) cannot be dealt with using the manual of standard risks. Innovative ways of offering a quick fix, often provisionally, may well be the critical missing link when it comes to providing living and working arrangements that keep people âin the gameâ. Quite a number of social innovations studied in the WILCO project involve establishing flexible forms of ad hoc support that meet newly emerging risks short-term. One telling example is the Welfare Foundation Ambrosiano in Milan, Italy (see Sabatinelli and Costa in this chapter), that supported individuals and families who were temporarily in need for various reasons (redundancy, illness and so on) through quick micro-credits, regardless of their previous or current type of employment contract and country of origin. Traditionally, most public welfare services have the status of rights that are unconditional, insofar as they simply require a set of material preconditions to be fulfilled. A new tendency in welfare arrangements (see Evers and Guillemard 2013), particularly in the field of âworkfareâ, is for clients to enter a form of contractual relationship in which the preconditions for support concern their future behaviour. This requires clients to take exclusive responsibility for themselves. Among the set of innovations studied, there were also other types of moves from rights to contracts, defining the notion of âgiving something back for what one gets from societyâ more broadly. People received access to goods and services once they committed to doing something for others in the form of volunteer work or providing clearly defined personal support for vulnerable people in the community. One example of this is Time for a Roof, an intergenerational home-sharing service in Nantes, France (see Coqblin and Fraisse 2014 in: Evers a. o. 93). It offered cheap accommodation to students who entered into an intergenerational cohabitation arrangement. Message ThreeâAbout Innovations in Governance The social innovations under study all represented a combination of new social âproductsâ and new social âprocessesâ, the latter term referring to the internal organisation of decision-making and interaction with the environment, the public, various stakeholders, social partners and political and administrative authorities. Many social innovations that seek to develop new kinds of services also have a governance dimension. However, for some innovations, influencing and changing the system of governance was their main goal (see Moore and Hartley 2009; LÃ©vesque 2013). This is the case, for instance, in the Citizenâs Agreement for an inclusive Barcelona. More than 500 participating entities in spheres such as the economy, culture, education, health and housing worked on a new participative governance structure (see Montagut et al. in this book). Likewise in Bern (see Felder in this chapter) where new integration guidelines that became mandatory for public stakeholders"
10,86,0.983,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Over the last two decades EU Drought Policy has developed from a series of scattered policies that range from broader forms of water governance that tackle water issues to more recently, direct policy actions to adapt and mitigate drought occurrences. In either case, the effectiveness of drought-related policy frameworks largely depend on the mobilization and operationalization of the policy through national and regional drought policies and initiatives (Bressers et al. 2013). Moving forward, there is a critical need to shift from a crisis-oriented management approach to a risk-based (or even resilience-based) management approach. In addition, further integration and strengthening of various policy instruments, as suggested by the Blueprint for Safeguarding, that aim to promote policy measures, such as water efï¬ciency, across water, land, and nature, and other management and policy spaces, are necessary to begin catalyzing such a shift. More support, in the form of ï¬nancial mechanisms, at all policy levels is also essential, particularly within more complex policy mixes such as the WFD and the CAP. At the moment, the only policy instrument directly tackling drought that exists at the European level is the Europeans Commissionâs Communication on water scarcity and drought. However, due to its lesser status in relation to Directives, the Communication is still weak and lacks teeth in the policy landscape. Somehow coupling WS&D with the"

In particular, the SMEs represent the most important source of new jobs; according to the figures released by the European Commission, in fact, they account for the creation of over 4 million new jobs (EC, 2013, p. 4).29 In the Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan, the commission remarks that propensity to entrepreneurship greatly varies among the various EU member countries, due to a variety of factors, such as difficulty to access credit, red tapes and burdensome administrative procedures, difficulties to relocate companies, fear of sanctions in the event of bankruptcy, poor knowledge of the structure of small and medium-sized enterprises, inadequate measures to support them, an educational system that does not provide the basic knowledge and background to start and develop an entrepreneurial career. Within the same action plan, the European Commission detects a widespread tendency in the current market context to ignore, or not acknowledge in the right way, the entrepreneurial efforts and initiatives as well as a lack of rewards for successful entrepreneurs (EC, 2013, p. 4).30 The Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan emphasises three areas of immediate action: 1. Entrepreneurship education and training aimed at supporting the creation and development of businesses. 2. Strengthening of the market conditions for the benefit of entrepreneurs, removing all structural obstacles and providing them with support during the most important phases of the enterprise life cycle. 3. Reignite the entrepreneurship culture in Europe: foster and raise a new generation of entrepreneurs. The first action (Table 3.3) moves from the premise that entrepreneurship represents a key subject within the European education framework (EP and EC, 2006).31 The action plan puts a particular emphasis on entrepreneurial education of young people as a fundamental instrument to promote that cultural change needed to support economic growth. Some authors (Jenner, 2012, p. 27)32 stressed out that young people who receive an entrepreneurship-oriented education are more bound to develop not only a higher knowledge of the business world but also additional skills and attitudes to operate in this sector, including creativity, a spirit of entrepreneurship, tenacity, teamwork, responsibility and superior risk-assessment capacity."

By conducting empirical studies among women, farmers, poor, and other grass roots in the developing world, scholars have explored issues such as how the development and access to low-cost ICTs enhances access to accurate and reliable information for the poor (Elijah and Ogunlade 2006); how acquiring ICTs skills increases womenâs confidence, general knowledge, as well as knowledge of their rights (Green 2008); how ICTs can assist women in addressing the chronic issues of widespread poverty (Elijah and Ogunlade 2006); and how engagement with ICTs empowers grass roots to facilitate their civic engagement (Kwon and Nam 2009; Leung 2009), among others. Even so, a less studied issue concerning the empowerment role of ICTs is whether new technologies could help the marginalised group to voice themselves when they are faced with actual problems in their working and living situations. The current study will address this question by examining the status of opinion expression of new-generation migrant workers in China and its relationship to ICTs. New-generation migrant workers, referring to those young ruralâurban migrant workers aged under 30 who differ from their parents in their lack of farmer experience, low intention to return to home villages, and increasing reliance on ICTs, are typically marginalised people in post-reform China. This happens because they are poor, lack equal social welfare, are excluded by urban society, and are without significant power over their lives despite of their contributions to Chinaâs urbanisation. Compared to other social strata, new-generation migrant workers have less opportunities and skills to express their opinions in a traditional media environment, because they are inaccessible to such marginalised groups. Then, will new ICTs empower new-generation migrant workers by facilitating their intention to express their opinions via new media channels? Will expression via new media channels further encourage them to express via other channels such as interpersonal network or official institutions? These questions deserve careful empirical studies. Here, we treat facilitating opinion expression as one important dimension of empowerment of ICTs for migrant workers in China. This chapter begins with literature review on the realistic needs of migrant workers, the expressive behaviours in the Chinese context, and the role of the Internet in facilitating opinion expression. Based on the discussions, we develop a set of specific hypotheses and research questions. Next, we quantitatively test our theoretical propositions with the data from a questionnaire survey we conducted in Shanghai of China. We conclude this chapter by discussing the implications of the research findings for academic research, governmental innovation, and corporation co-operations."

The dual process involved in the recognition of indigenous knowledge has thus been made part of the development pattern for agricultural and environmental policies. In this dual ministerial context, the Mexican Government undertook the task of integrating the participation of the native and peasant population into its agricultural policy and also into its political agenda, thereby institutionalizing national environmental policy. The Ministry of the Environment has conï¬rmed that âthe native populations that maintain a very close link with natural resources and biodiversity actively support sustainable development through on-site conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats, and the maintenance and recuperation of viable populations of species in their natural surroundingsâ.15 In 1997 the Ministry of the Environment initiated the Conservation and Restoration Programme of soils. In 1998 it launched the National Reforestation Programme and other programmes that sought to combine economic and social development with environmental conservation. The objective was to devote economic resources to National Protected Areas and to the restoration of regions identiï¬ed as priorities from an environmental perspective. The main tools that the government has used have always been aimed at the conservation of biodiversity and of forests, in accordance with the National Strategy for Biodiversity (2000), complemented by the Mexican Strategy for the Conservation of Plants (which has existed since 2008 and was revised in 2012) and subsequently enhanced by the National Strategy combating invasive species. Major programmes within this framework have been speciï¬cally dedicated to native and peasant populations. A twist was introduced, however, when the Ministry of the Environment developed its Regional Sustainable Development Programme (Programa de Desarrollo Regional Sustentable (PRODERS)) in an attempt to link the environmentalist vision to a developmentalist one. The programme was presented as a comprehensive initiative by means of which SEMARNAT contributed to the support of sustainable development in poor rural regions. These regions often include native and peasant populations who live where the major biological and environmental riches are located, far from the rural nodes. The management of this programme was supposed to be decentralized and participative, based on a long-term vision (Toledo and Bartra, 2000)."

Policymakers are thus invited to learn from the Senegal experience how schemes and access to rights can be improved. The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. The next section will discuss the research methodology. This is followed by a brief review of Senegalese migration to the EU and Spain and its legal framework, setting the context for the research findings. These are presented in two main parts: one dealing with the temporary agricultural work migration scheme, and another, more substantive one on the process of becoming irregular migrants employed in the domestic work sector in Spain.

380,459,0.983,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"Many in the older generations were also cynical of new community initiatives and political initiatives emerging from the government, brushing them off with es la misma vaina que los adecos (it is the same thing as the adecos), meaning that they considered it as promises that would not materialize. In a similar manner, many people considered the communal councils to be replicas of the former neighborhood organizations that served as client organizations to AcciÃ³n Democratica. These former neighborhood organizations had different formal names (see Rivero Santos 1995), but people habitually referred to them as juntas de vecinos. The association between these organizations and the communal councils made people prone to think that either those who were active in the communal councils had joined solely to attend to their individual interests, or that it was communal councilsâ spokespersonsâ responsibility to âfixâ things for the rest of the community. In any case, these habituated perceptions of neighborhood councils as self-serving client organizations impeded many people from joining the communal councils, constituting a great deal of frustration for grassroots activists trying to mobilize their neighbors."
143,502,0.983,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Problem Statement Innovation precedes policy in emerging areas such as ICTs. This, however, should not happen if significant resources are committed to research and development. Until 2007, Kenya was among 22 Eastern Africa countries grappling with the challenge of linking the region to the rest of the world through undersea fiber optic cables. The challenge centered on whether it was commercially viable to lay such cables and if the governments required development assistance to build the infrastructure. At the time, no relevant policy existed, and so, naturally, focus turned to the legal guidelines that were required to see the project through to completion. A steering committee comprising mostly nontechnical government teams from each participating country wanted a policy framework spelling out operations of the proposed project before infrastructure development began. Embedded in some of the engagements were government interests, all of which had engaged experts to help them in the policy negotiations. This was in contrast with the team I led, which took the view that, because we had the political will, all was needed was the creation of a general policy statement that could be modified and updated as construction went on. In my view, it was premature to formulate a comprehensive policy statement in a technical area in which many of the participants had limited subject matter expertise. It would be more effective to develop a general policy to help guide those involved gain more experience and exposure to the technologies being proposed."

CSR activities are often seen as cosmetic rather than operational or strategic, summarized in reports that âaggregate anecdotes about uncoordinated initiatives to demonstrate a companyâs social sensitivityâ (Porter and Kramer 2006, 79). The focus, it is claimed, is on mitigating tensions between companies and society rather than on recognizing their interdependence and working for their mutual benefit. As a result the âpotential of companies to take actions that would support both their communities and their business goalsâ is lost (Porter and Kramer 2006, 81). The promotion of CSR as a development tool has also attracted criticism. Specifically it is argued that CSR neglects issues related to the power dynamics and political economy of the contexts in which the companies operate. In particular marginalized groups are often left out of CSR activities, thus they are unable to engage in stakeholder dialogue or express their concerns when their interests do not coincide with NGO, donor, or company priorities. This can be particularly problematic where the choice of CSR activities is primarily driven by business considerations. As Blowfield and Frynas (2005, 508) point out: [s]ince inclusion in or exclusion from stakeholder status is not based on either legal rights or moral obligations, a stakeholderâs recognition is contingent upon the business case for that recognition. Consequently, the well-being of some groups in developing countries may be jeopardized by the very pursuit of CSR."

334,38,0.983,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"event. Mokre shows how the protest movement made its interests public by raising universal claims, group claims and individual claims at the same time. Furthermore, she identifies relations between refugees and supporters that reflect the lines of mobilization, strong and weak ties (Granovetter 1983), and a mixture of individual support and collective political action. Most importantly, the protesting asylum seekers established close social relations (friendships) with people of various social backgrounds, citizens and non-citizens, a fact which became an extremely relevant resource for the life of the protest. Part V contemplates the scope of progressive protests by examining restrictive protests against the arrival and reception of asylum seekers in Austria and Germany. Interestingly, this kind of restrictive protest is not widespread in Switzerland, which is why we decided against a case study on it. In particular, the Austrian paper indicates a proximity and connection and connectedness between protesters and institutionalized politics, a feature that clearly distinguishes solidarity from restrictive protest movements. In Chap. 11, Dieter Rucht analyzes protests by right-wing groups against asylum seekers in Germany. The author embeds his analysis in the historical context of increasingly aggressive right-wing populism and right-wing radicalism. Organizationally fragmented but ideologically consistent, as the author stresses, for years this right-wing movement has been driving xenophobic activities forward. Analytically, Rucht demonstrates and proves that the concepts and tools of social movement research can be especially useful in analyzing and explaining the recent upsurge in xenophobic sentiment and activities because they allow insights into internal networks and repertoires that are taken partly from the parliamentarian and partly from the extra-parliamentarian arena. Miriam Haselbacher and Sieglinde Rosenberger investigate restrictionist protest in Austria in Chap. 12. Examining protest events reported in diverse media channels, the authors elaborate on the features and success of restrictionist protest activities against the establishment of reception centers for (new) asylum seekers. The research findings demonstrate that this protest is mainly local and small-scale, is often initiated and supported by state actors, and is successful in terms of achieving its main demands, namely that the location in question not become operational. The protagonists employ demonstrational as well as confrontational action repertoires. The chapter shows that institutional and discursive opportunities are relevant for the spread of protest activities, whereas their high rate of success is due to the close relationship between protesters and representatives of political parties and political authorities (mayors). Initiating and joining protests is revealed to be a resource used in institutional politics by governing actors to mobilize people and to send signals about their responsiveness towards their constituents. In Chap. 13, Gianni DâAmato and Helen Schwenken present and discuss the key findings of this volume. Summing up the similarities and differences in the characteristics presented by different forms of protest, this chapter stresses protest diffusion and presents evidence for it. Moreover, four anti-deportation protest impacts are identified: case-specific impacts, as many deportations could be stopped; movement-related impacts in terms of a broadening of protest activities; discursive"
131,182,0.983,The Ethics of Educational Healthcare Placements in Low and Middle income Countries : First Do No Harm?,"celebratory glow is a thorny question: in a context when the UK is itself struggling to place, train and fund its own, why should we expect low resource settings to take responsibility for training its future health workforce? Our role in the deployment of long-term volunteers has made us very aware of the need for careful recruitment and deployment within structured, supported and managed programmes if we are to avoid becoming part of the problem and undermining health systems. Indeed, this is an unfolding story of âunintended consequences.â The EEP model builds on eight yearsâ experience of managing volunteers in the context of the Ugandan public health system. Unlike other elective placement schemes run by private companies keen to proï¬t from the burgeoning demand for international placements, the EEP model grew out of our Sustainable Volunteering Programme and is ï¬rmly situated within an active and evidence-based partnership-based engagement. The ethics and sustainability of our engagement has formed a key component of project design and evaluation. Building on our previous (exploratory) experience of deploying medical students alongside professional volunteers we anticipated two key dimensions of (positive and sustainable) impact. In the ï¬rst instance, we knew that professional volunteers working for long periods in highly stressful circumstances and often with reluctant learners and absent colleagues were often ârefreshedâ and re-energised when UK students arrived. Secondly, having witnessed some very bad practice involving payments for supervision by small poorly organised income-generating electives programmes, we were aware of the pitfalls of cash inducements to local supervisors/ mentors. These payments typically failed to guarantee any supervision on the ground and contributed to systemic corruption. On the other hand, we witnessed the important contribution even quite small strategic investments could make to removing simple âsnagsâ that debilitate local health systems.

On the other hand, companies find it difficult to respond in case of low local entity competitiveness. Because local circumstances are different from those in the home country, the likelihood of making improvements through efforts led by the headquarters is low. In this case, it is more effective for companies to form partnerships with local companies, thereby enabling a better understanding of the business environment in the target country and an analysis of any failures. Major Japanese manufacturers typically have multiple overseas operations. In addition to Europe and the US, they have entities in China and Southeast Asia. Many of these companies also have operations in India, South and Central America, and other areas. Corporate strategies differ according to prioritized regions, but from the perspective of risk dispersion, companies are not likely to choose an overseas strategy that centralizes operations in one location. Thus, headquarters must account for a variety of circumstances in the management of its overseas operations. According to the classifications listed in Table 15.1, the size of differences in operating environments with the home country affects the skills required in the headquarters function. Particularly where there are large differences in the operating environment, companies must think of flexibility in regard to the local entity. The one-way management of knowledge flow from the headquarters to the local entity that is typical in Japan does not work well. Global strategies should not be homogeneous across an entire company but must share an awareness of regional and national diversity at the top levels of the company."

Responsibility for volunteer induction in the SVP context was shared throughout the management team with HP leads contributing to the induction pack and playing a critical role in in-country volunteer induction.

States that stand to gain economically from fishing rights and navigational routes have the potential to conflict with state and non-state actors on their visions for the conservation of the Arctic Ocean. Further, a growing body of influential observer states have eventually outnumbered the Arctic states themselves. Admittedly, the observersâ mandate does not hold a significant role in decision making in the Arctic Council. The Arctic Eight may, however, find their individual interests in the Arctic complicated by a growing number of actors exerting pressure by way of expertise, written opinions, and funding power. At the 2011 Nuuk Ministerial Meeting, one Russian diplomat voiced the concern that a growing majority of observers might demand more rights, perhaps to the extent of designating the Arctic as âuniversal humankind heritageâ on the model of the Antarctic.33 Thus, while present discourse often depicts non-Arctic observers as potential resource exploiters and obstacles to preservation, the growing influence of non-Arctic states in the region (particularly as Arctic Council observers) has the normative power to reframe the Arctic as a global commons of sorts mandating sweeping, collaborative protections. Thus, any observer state pressure to designate the Arctic as âuniversal humankind heritageâ in need of a new legal regime would fundamentally challenge the status quo adherence to Law of the Seas for Arctic Ocean governance."

It reflects the strong commitment to integration and a transdisciplinary approach, embracing disciplines as diverse as physical oceanography, sediment dynamics, agriculture, demographics and poverty. Input of policy experts and a substantial array of stakeholders are also fundamental. This study provided opportunities for substantial learning across standard discipline boundaries, providing co-produced policy relevant outputs and insights. It also fostered a family of researchers who developed a shared understanding that could be applied to this difficult and challenging problem. This included effective sharing of knowledge and learning to question and contribute effectively outside an individualâs specialist field. Integration is core to what has been accomplished here bringing together natural and social sciences in ways that are distinct and groundbreaking. Such integration needs to start as the research is initiated and is an ongoing process. Integration needs to be core to the project with key questions and themes that are properly resourced. To be policy relevant, the research must be guided by the perspectives, needs and expertise encapsulated by local stakeholders, especially the decision-making processes and governance context of the deltas in question. Stakeholders from civil society, the non-government sector and of course agencies of government are all involved in policy formulation. Indeed, one of the outstanding successes of the ESPA Deltas collaboration, which is reflected in this book, has been the engagement with and the impact on the policy context of Bangladesh. The research has raised, for the first time, consideration of ecosystem services, their links to poverty and livelihoods and their influence in the national policy and planning process across a range of government agencies including the Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission and other government partners such as the Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO). Indeed the Government of Bangladesh has requested continued engagement and further development of some of the modelling tools in the context of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, which is a new national planning approach. Engaging with policy was always a main aspiration of the research and is perhaps the aspect of which we are most proud. The research provides both the foundation and analyses which has led to some of its most innovative approaches and significant insights.

Development projects can very uneasily be mandated from above in a pre-designed manner. Rather, projects need to be firmly rooted in the social realities, local populations and specific needs in the locality which they are intended to benefit.

303,61,0.983,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"role of concealing the political and economic gap between minority groups and cultural diversity within a minority group (Gordon & Newfield, 1996). Subsequently, it was often said that the discourse of multiculturalism only functions to integrate such people into the framework of the pre-given âmulti-cultural,â creating an impression of tolerance presumably residing in the minds of the majority. In this way, multiculturalism began to be used as a theory of national integration (Yui & Endo, 1999).1 In the 1990s, multiculturalism became even more visible. This concept continues to be welcomed widely in the US even now. Discussion of multiculturalism is particularly active at educational institutions, higher educational institutions in particular, where ethnic groups with different roots are actively featured in classrooms as a part of the history of multicultural America. Multiculturalism is, therefore, still believed to represent an imperative and indispensable aspect of America that comprises a wide variety of cultures (Hollinger, 1995, p. 150). The cases where Japanese immigrants are utilized by mainstream multicultural discourse in America often emphasize the collapse of their identity resulting from compulsory confinement during the Second World War, and regularly refer to the reconstruction of their identity as Japanese American with the victory of the compensation movement in the post-war period. Although textbooks feature Japanese immigrants as a part of the success of multiculturalist policies in the US, they ignore the complicated, multi-layered, and diverse experiences of Japanese immigrants. In fact, multicultural education often fails to focus on the identity of Japanese immigrants during the period from their first arrival in the US to their compulsory confinement (Petersen, 1971). In order to clarify this point, it is necessary to review the academic research previously conducted on Japanese immigrants, and compare this with the narratives of those who were marginalized and the movements continuously protesting against the established social structure. The period from Japanese immigrantsâ first arrival in the US until their confinement in the camps was essentially characterized by the discriminatory sentiment they encountered. In the receiving society, the government and the majority usually strive to integrate minorities into the established rules and norms of the society, as well as maintain and expand their social merits and privileges. If the majority in the receiving society finds no difference between themselves and immigrants, and if the majority shares a mutual interest with them, the immigrants are easily accepted into the society. This type of integration is often related"
46,168,0.983,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"(5) The economy and the labor market. Besides the public infrastructure and the welfare system, the economy and the labor market are probably the most influential institutions when it comes to child poverty, although children are kept out of both to a large extent in many countries. It is a widely shared conviction in many countries, especially in the highly developed world, that children should not work to provide for themselves, and up to a certain age it is certain they cannot do so anyway. The economic position of the family, however, determines the life chances of the children who live in them in many ways. Work, income and wealth, education, health, social status and power are interdependent throughout the life course, even before birth and early childhood. It is therefore no surprise that welfare and workfare are very close and that work and improvements to the familyâs economic position are seen as primary child poverty alleviation measures in many countries. They enable families to provide for children without aid from the state or other national and international institutions and NGOs. (6) The community of citizens in a society. Every child is a member of a wider community; in most cases, children are citizens of the states they live and grow up in. Citizenship is important for access to services and institutions and determines which rights children have on the national or local level. The citizenship of their parents or caregivers is equally important. On the one hand, if children and their families are illegal immigrants or have refugee status, they usually have significantly lower opportunities in the country they live in; they may be denied political and social rights. On the other hand, being member of a bigger community provides certain opportunities. In many states, the welfare system is supported by the majority of citizens who finance it, and there is a certain degree of solidarity between them. Whether or not one agrees that justice is dependent on such a mutual sense of community, it is certainly the case that citizens influence each otherâs well-being even if they never interact directly. Prominent examples are tax systems, to which everyone contributes and which are crucial to financing the welfare system from which the worst-off profit the most. Other examples are political institutions: on the one hand, they might be designed in an inclusive way, supporting poverty alleviation and creating a sense of solidarity; on the other hand, they might opt for gated communities, private schools, cuts in the welfare system and the criminalization of begging, thereby marginalizing poor families and their children."

The case study on IAS, in contrast, illustrated the existence of an embryonic global regulatory framework, the International Convention for the Control and Management of Shipsâ Ballast Water and Sediments (BWMC). This convention, however, has not yet (August 2015) entered into force.8 HELCOM has played an important role with regard to all these issues by establishing a political and regulatory space at the regional level and more recently through harmonising its regulations with EU regulations (Kern and LÃ¶ffelsend 2004: 124). Although HELCOM lacks strong enforcement mechanisms, several interviewees we spoke to emphasised the many important roles that HELCOM plays. They said that HELCOM embodies an important part of the governance structure, as it is the only regional forum for negotiations where the entire BSR (Baltic Sea region) is represented, including Russia. It also plays an important role in linking Russia with the EU in debates and policy-making. HELCOM furthermore increasingly serves as an important arena for information sharing, negotiations and policy-making (e.g. BostrÃ¶m et al. 2015; VanDeever 2011), despite the parallel strengthening of EU competence in the Baltic Sea region. HELCOM helps to coordinate countries in areas where there are many, partly overlapping and conflicting regulations (eutrophication, chemical case). It provides data and action plans (BSAP) and identifies hotspots. Based on such information, national NGOs as well as public authorities can then promote the implementation of programmes, projects and decisions made by HELCOM. HELCOM can thus function as an important reference point â a cognitive authority rather than rule-setting authority â for nationally based campaign organisations. HELCOM can also take a proactive approach in issue areas that are poorly developed."

Such ideal benefits from circulation for the destination countries are in her opinion possible only if âEU member states make sure that their legal entry channels are simple and fast, so that migrant workers can satisfy the demands of domestic labour markets in several sectors where shortages are identifiedâ (2011:10). However, both quantitative and qualitative studies carried out in Poland and Hungary stress the positive outcomes of Ukrainian circular migration. In Poland temporary Ukrainian labour migrants complement the native workforce, filling market niches (see for example, Grabowska-LusiÅska and Å»ylicz 2008; GrabowskaLusiÅska et al. 2010; GÃ³rny et al. 2010b; Chap. 7). Researchers analyzing Ukrainian circular migration to Hungary underline its positive aspects in terms of migrantsâ economic activity in the face of Hungaryâs ageing population (Kincses and RÃ©dei 2009). In contrast, studies on Ukrainian, Albanian and Moroccan circular migrants in Italy and Spain (Triandafyllidou 2011: 5), illustrate the negative side of circular migration by stressing that longer absence of migrants from work in the destination country (while they visit the home country) is negatively valued by the employers, as they âwant reliable, stable, year-round migrant workersâ. Other negative aspects of Ukrainian temporary migration to Europe are often linked in the literature to irregularity, with irregular status becoming a major concern for receiving countries which not only lose out in terms of their national budget (undeclared work of migrants) and the additional costs of control and detention but also have to somehow address the issue of a group at risk of exploitation and marginalization (see Malynovska 2011). Moreover, it has been stressed in the literature that Ukrainian temporary migration, especially when the secondary sector of the labour market is involved, reproduces social, ethnic and gender inequalities (Fedyuk 2012, 2015; Tolstokorova 2010)."

Targets such as an improvement in the productivity of raw materials, water, and energy; the minimization of waste and emissions; an increase in recycling and reuse; and the use of renewable energy (Viet Nam Government, draft) should be accompanied by skills development. Considering that a small number of institutions are able to start addressing these issues, and there are no speciï¬c plans in place, TVET in Viet Nam is ill-prepared to address the needs of industry with regard to the emerging green economy. Bac Thang Long (BTL) has close links with local businesses to minimize the gap between TVET outcomes and job requirements. It uses well-established mechanisms to collect data through industry surveys, interviews, and workshops to ascertain the needs of industry and ensure that the content of courses is relevant to the skills required of students to undertake future employment. Training programs are available for mid-level skilled occupations, and provisions are in place for students to transfer to university studies for high-level skills training. Student preferences and satisfaction are major influences when the college plans the content of long-term programs. Students receive workplace training as part of their courses, and their progress is regularly reviewed. They are fully supported by highly skilled teachers. All courses are reviewed annually to ensure their relevance. For the training of existing workers, short-term programs have been speciï¬cally designed to meet industry needs. This is a good indication of quality training that is in demand by industry. Professional development is conducted regularly with teachers to ensure that their skills are up to date, and thus they are well qualiï¬ed to teach students current theory and knowledge. Industry is fully involved in the professional development of teachers. In anticipating greening of the economy, and in meeting the social demand for addressing environmental and social issues, BTL is proactive in introducing new courses and in effectively building awareness raising. Environmental legislation, which is the current attention of MOET, and the social responsibility mission of BTL, are the drivers behind these changes. The inclusion of generic green skills has not been addressed by the college, although it also pays keen attention to attitude development and takes measures to increase studentsâ environmental awareness. This case study concluded that effective practices in TVET provision observed at BTL could be scaled up in the context of green inclusive growth, as advocated by the government. Implementation of the Viet Nam National Green Growth Strategy will have a signiï¬cant impact on TVET; therefore BTL could serve as an institution for driving forward green change. It could, for example, be a key, focal point member of a consortium2 to assist with implementation of green skills best practices."

For the Amazon Fund, the government of Brazil pledged to allocate US$500 million, but it is estimated that an additional investment of US$1 billion per year would be required to fully implement the plan (Meyer, 2010). Brazil has the technical capacity to monitor changes in forest cover through remote-sensing technology and to ensure transparency to deal with the fund through institutional structures and mechanisms. By 2008, Brazil had already put in place some of the conditions to be enabled by Phase 1. This in part explains Norwayâs support of the Amazon Fund, which placed Brazil in phases 2 and 3. The Norwegian support of the Fund is contingent on demonstrating avoided deforestation against a historical baseline (results-based payments). Norwayâs involvement is also based on ideas of economic rationality, altruism and self-interest9 as a humanitarian/environmental protection actor. The establishment of the Brazilian Amazon Fund can be explained by the combined effect of the activities and initiatives of NGOs, state governors in the Amazon region, and politicians in key positions (the president and the minister of the environment). Norwegian support through Norwayâs International Forest and Climate Initiative (NIFCI) gave the scheme the ï¬nal thrust to get the fund started. The Amazon Fund is important for advancing the Brazilian approach to REDD. This approach is well established in existing Brazilian institutions and is in accord with the countryâs views and priorities. Brazilâs REDD strategy has been characterized by a strong involvement of the central government, but NGOs and lower levels of the public administration have also played a role. The advanced technical capacity of Brazil in terms of remote-sensing and the establishment of a historical baseline of forest cover place the country in a privileged position in regard to the phased approach promoted at the international level. The alliance of Brazil and Norway for ï¬nancing the Amazon Fund has given Brazilâs strategy a very advantageous starting point. Brazilâs approach to ï¬nancing REDD efforts has been based on the idea of a centralized fund that would allow the country to avoid the voluntary carbon market for ï¬nancing reduced deforestation. However, the growing involvements of other networks, particularly those in which governors of the Amazon states are involved, have pushed the country towards additional mechanisms for ï¬nancing avoided deforestation, particularly through their partnership with the governors of California and Illinois.10"
2,270,0.983,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"Elements of Collaboration Across the Scandinavian countries, the analysis shows that the degree of collaboration between municipalities and private schools is very limited, while there is more collaboration when it comes to public schools. However, there are some differences between the countries, regarding both the content and level of collaboration. In the Danish case, elements of collaboration between municipalities and nonproï¬t schools are very limited in both municipalities, according to the administrative leaders. Due to state funding of the schools, there are no ï¬nancial relations between nonproï¬t schools and the municipalities, and none of the municipalities have formal meetings with representatives from nonproï¬t schools (Interviews, administrative leaders, DK, 8.10.2013, 18.12.2013). The limited degree of collaboration is closely related to lack of steering possibilities and control in relation to nonproï¬t schools. Their possibilities for influencing the schools are very limited, which, from a municipal point of view, might minimise the motivation for collaboration. Speciï¬cally, at a time when limited ï¬nancial resources are available: When a municipality has to plan efï¬cient services in all ï¬elds â including schools â and we really need to do that in these years â it is a big challenge that one-third of the pupils are attending schools where we do not have any influence at all.

284,313,0.983,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"ecosystems on which they and we all depend. Regardless of where one turns in the region, there is an increase in the number and intensity of conï¬icts between groups committed to promoting economic development (i.e. growth), and those claiming to speak for the planet and/or the welfare of the large majority of the population or particular minorities, who feel excluded from these processes and are bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of these activities. This chapter addresses some of the underlying causes of these conï¬icts by giving voice to some of the actors who are actually involved in developing their own alternatives to the development proposals of the hegemonic forces driving the transformations in their societies. These alternatives emerge from groups whose organizations are shaped by different cosmologies, products of their multiple ethnic origins, and by the profound philosophical and epistemological debates of the past half-century that emerged from numerous social movements proposing different strategies for achieving progress, improving wellbeing and conserving ecosystems. While many past confrontations among social groups have produced compromises modifying individual development projects, few have created some space for the emergence of alternative social and productive structures that respond to the demands for local control of the governance process to assure local wellbeing and responsible environmental management. The analysis draws on an important emerging literature that proposes a different epistemology and methodology, reï¬ecting the direct participation of a diversity of communities around the world in research about themselves and their possibilities for implementing different approaches to improving their wellbeing. In spite of the widely separated regions and traditions from which they come, there are striking commonalities in their reï¬ections on how research should be conducted and how they might collaborate with âoutsidersâ in their search for ways to advance in their pursuit of an improved style of life and their ability to govern themselves. A notable early contribution from this intellectual and academic current was published by a Maori sociologist (Smith, 2012), reacting to the tendency of scholars from the principal academic institutions in New Zealand to make assumptions about local social structures, production possibilities, and the possibilities of and competence for innovations of their âaboriginesâ. Since this early text, a burgeoning literature has emerged, not only emphasizing the methodological limitations of much Western scholarship in the Third World but also extending the critique to epistemological, ethical and cosmological planes. The contributors to this process argue that since social"

Rights-based approaches fill a major gap in the dominant discourse of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), as âIn practice IWRM has to a large degree neglected to directly address social equity issues and Human Rights Based Approaches can be seen as a methodology to strengthen such workâ (WGF 2012: 13). The High Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition in their report on Water for Food Security and Nutrition examined the interlinkages between food security, water and nutrition in relation to the right to food and the current right to water for personal and domestic uses. One of the key recommendations is âPromoting a rights-based approach to water for food security and nutritionâ (HLPE 2015: 108). Scholars started exploring concrete implications of rights-based approaches for women, the poor and other marginalised groups. Hellum et al. (2015) invoked the right to non-discrimination in the Convention of the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Recognising the indivisibility of rights and the importance of both domestic and productive uses of water for multifaceted wellbeing, they made the case for a gender-equal right to water for livelihoods (Hellum et al. 2015). In the remainder of this chapter, we will further examine concrete implications of closing the current gap between the state as duty bearer of human rights and the state as infrastructure-based water provider for both domestic and productive uses and as regulator in allocating water resources. The focus is on the most marginalised women and men in low- and middle-income countries, whose human rights to water are most severely violated. In the following, we first go back to the first milestone in connecting human rights and water management. This is the legal opinion on the human right to water by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), in its General Comment No. 15 of 2002 (UN CESCR 2003). This Comment prioritised water for drinking and other domestic uses and underpinned the Resolutions in 2010. However, as we will see in the next section, this Comment also clearly identified prioritisation in other dimensions of freshwater governance, in particular in infrastructure development and water allocation. Section 7.3 discusses rights-based approaches for the core function of the state of promoting infrastructure development, partly by own public investments in infrastructure and partly by promoting others to invest. Section 7.4 examines rightsbased state regulation in the quantitative allocation of water resources, as illustrated by experiences in South Africa. Section 7.5 draws conclusions."
27,195,0.983,Limits To The European UnionâS Normative Power in a Post-Conflict Society : Eulex and Peacebuilding in Kosovo,"contribution of the EUâs engagement will remain limited to the tactical (low) level (e.g. improving the work of the police in dealing with trafï¬c safety and petty crime, better performance of customs, certain administrative reformsâ¦), while leaving the main objectives of the missions or operations, which are strategic in nature, still to be accomplished (e.g. ï¬ghting corruption and organised crime). Even the substantial ï¬nancial and human resources the EU spends on CSDP engagements cannot help much in the absence of genuine aspirations of the EU (and its member states) and the USA in Kosovo to go after those political and economic elites allegedly involved in criminal activities. This would, however, require renewed negotiations between the US government and the EU. If this level of misaligned and unsynchronised approaches among influential international actors persists, this will further justify the criticism that the EU (and the West generally) should either strengthen the level of its intervention to ensure real change in the post-conflict society or withdraw from the country. On the other hand, it comes as no surprise that the EU and its member states, or even the USA, generally do not become strategically and comprehensively involved as the problems, at least for now, seem to be âlocally containedâ from the security aspect (and there are several other more pressing issues for both Washington and Brussels than Kosovo). Political leaders of countries in the region, with rare exceptions, generally enjoy the support of the West and are well aware of what the EU, drowning in its own problems, wants: namely, that any problems affecting the Balkans remain contained within the area without threatening to spill over, to avoid any (further) flaring up of the wider region. When grasping the EUâs desire to become a âforce for goodâ instead of a âregularâ security actor, one that uses all means available to achieve the desired outcome in peacebuilding, we must recall our theoretical predispositions: we have analysed the EU based on a normative identity as a subjective term, created by the EU itself and its interactions with others. In terms of the EUâs normative identity, it is very likely the EU structures wish for their peacebuilding efforts to be perceived as being normative in nature. However, this endeavour to be regarded as a genuine âforce for goodâ has misaligned expectations from the outset. It has raised the local populationâs expectations regarding EULEXâs capabilities to tackle all of Kosovoâs problems, while then failing to deliver on its promises in the eyes of the same peopleâbe it regarding the corruption that still exists, the establishment of somehow functioning relations between the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, or tackling high-proï¬le cases of individuals allegedly involved in criminal activities. This does not mean the EULEX personnel are not interested in fulï¬lling these promises, but that âBrussels is far awayâ. The EU member states actually dictate policies, but cannot agree on the level of engagement or the countryâs status, which often proves to counterproductive in the ï¬eld. The EU (thus, EULEX) does not have a strong stance on elite politicians regarding non-popular measures the mission tries to implement. Hence, the mission often sacriï¬ces its position to maintain somewhat stable relations between conflicting parties in the country. Local politicians of course directly blame the mission for the failures. If the EU can only"

Peacebuilding, while it certainly entails activities to rebuild core government functions to prevent lapses into conflict, also includes supporting activities to build trust in order to allow more âdirectâ peacebuilding efforts to take place. This is crucial since peacebuilding has been seen as external intervention by outside actors into a countryâs domestic affairs, which is sometimes considered a challenge to the host governmentâs sovereignty. Such distinct approaches also entail a set of unique principles. There are at least two principles to highlight. The first principle is the importance of carefully considering the âcomfortâ level of the host country in accepting the offer to help with a peacebuilding process, while at the same time seeking an entry point. This is critical to gaining the trust of the partner country and eventually determines the level of success achieved in this peacebuilding effort. The host"

Stakeholders were identified by way of an extensive mapping process (principally based on a snowball approach (Reed et al. 2009)). Additional stakeholders were identified at the more localised level (i.e. in the project case study areas in the Khulna and Barisal divisions). This process was bolstered through enhanced engagement with a small number of key stakeholders whose interests aligned most closely with the project from the perspective of use and uptake, data provision and cross-sectoral relevance. It became clear that for the mutual benefit of both the project and a small number of these key stakeholders, a more formal relationship would be preferable, and this resulted in the Water Resources Planning Organisation (WARPO) becoming a formal project partner and the establishment of a strategic alliance with the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission of the Government of Bangladesh. Representatives from round 60 institutions were actively involved in the engagement between the project and relevant institutions across multiple scales in Bangladesh. Initially, this engagement primarily took the form of formal one-to-one interviews and latterly through more widely attended workshops.1 The range of stakeholders who were contacted by project partners and who chose to participate included the following: â¢ National government officials in a range of Ministries, the portfolios of which relate to ecosystem services and human well-being (e.g. Planning Commission; Ministry of Agriculture, WARPO) â¢ Relevant non- and inter-governmental organisations at the international level (e.g. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), International Organisation for Migration, Global Water Partnership, CARE) â¢ UN organisations, multi- and bi-lateral donor agencies (e.g. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Food Programme (WFP), World Bank, Asian Development Bank)"
99,122,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"4.6 Three Social Innovations in MalmÃ¶ A limited set of social innovations could be identified in the local welfare landscape of MalmÃ¶ during the time of the research project (Evers et al. 2014; Nordfeldt and Carrigan 2013). Three examples of innovative activities will be described below. These innovations are of different size and composition and include a broad neighbourhood program, an incubator that at the same time is considered as a social innovation and a promoter of other social innovations, and an employment and empowerment project. Starting with the broad neighbourhood program, âOmrÃ¥desprogrammetâ is a program aiming at revitalizing certain districts in MalmÃ¶ out of socioeconomic stagnation. The program focuses primarily on creating more jobs and enhancing the living conditions first and foremost for the people living in selected districts. The program is organized into five âresource groupsâ, focusing on city development, culture and recreation, the elderly, youth, and the labour market, and economic growth. The main innovative feature of the OmrÃ¥detsprogrammet, according to the involved actors, is that new solutions are sought through collaboration. In this context, collaboration seems to imply engaging and cooperating with the people living in the selected areasâas partners and co-producers, challenging the municipal administration to work cross-administrational, and encouraging cross-sectoral cooperation among civil society organizations, companies, universities, and landlords, among others. Accordingly, involved participants highlight the importance of collaboration, working with existing means within existing infrastructures, and finding new solutions."

Of course, this is also true in successful organizations around the world, but given the cultural traditions and historical context of the region, it is particularly important in Asia. Bainian Vocational School (BNVS), for instance, chooses its board of trustees strategically to meet its mission in job placement. BNVS board members are well positioned both to help financially and to provide access to future company employers. The China Medical Foundation (CMF) takes an additional step in targeting successful business leaders for its board. Unlike many other organizations, it requires a financial commitment of at least US$10,000 per annum from each board member. Many nonprofit organizations encourage board giving, but CMFâs requirement is made explicit for every incoming board member. In addition to financial support, CMFâs board members are often in positions to help reach out to potential donors and government partners in China. With âskin in the gameâ through their financial investment, CMFâs board is highly committed and involved with its success in China. Given the importance of relationships in Asia, it is natural for boards of trustees to further organizationsâ causes. We also found that for those organizations that begin within the elite, the board offers productive social empowerment. Outside such circles, boards tend to have less reach, and are often comprised of friends and family, when such a board exists at all. Closing this gap of experience can help many SDOs in Asia, as they increase the capacity of their boards to help achieve their missions."

This brings up the relevance of the concept of intersectionality as (1) a combination of forms of institutional discrimination (gender, age, migrant status, and ethnicity) that are interconnected and cannot be examined separately, and (2) the link between a labour migration system and a health care system. As they are on temporary contracts, migrant workers often circulate between different places of employment and their home countries. Health insurance systems in their countries of origin may not cover expenses abroad and insurance in the host countries may not be easily affordable, particularly for lowskilled workers. Low-cost health insurance applicable across borders does not exist in many countries, and where it does there are major limitations.7 Even when their health status is cleared before departure, once on the move the employment situation of migrant workers in their destination countries becomes what basically underlies their overall state of well-being. It defines the boundaries of their new environment and its social connectivity, which in turn can directly and indirectly affect many aspects of their health physically and psycho-emotionally. Those who are undocumented, or have an âirregularâ status, are particularly disadvantaged and deprived because of their social invisibility. Lacking social and legal protection from frequent violence and abuse at the workplace, they run the risk of arrest and deportation when accessing public health systems. Seeking private health service providers with steeper costs, turning to self-medication, or experimenting with indigenous or alternative practices are basically the only options they have when encountering health problems (Marin 2012). There is a real and pressing need to understand structural vulnerability as produced by a combination of interconnected forms of institutional discrimination and by the link between migration systems and health systems. The right to health as built into international human rights law has no meaning until migrants can exercise them. Advocacy approaches to SRH justice for migrant domestic workers would ben7"

This is substantiated by the numerous activities intended to improve groundwater governance in their countries, but in many cases, there is no or insufficient progress or actions not addressing those governance aspects that are locally most critical. The aforementioned Groundwater Governance Project has developed a Global Vision to encourage and guide the international community in the endeavours to improve groundwater governance. It intends to be âa Vision of the World in 2030 in which countries have taken appropriate and effective action to govern their groundwater in order to reach globally shared goals of social and economic development and avoid irreversible degradation of groundwater resources and their aquifer systemsâ (Groundwater Governance Project 2016b). This requires âgood governanceâ with at its heart an effective legal system, capable government agencies, well-designed policies, a structured process for implementing groundwater management plans and mechanisms to facilitate effective participation of stakeholders. The Vision underlines the important role of groundwater around the world, the dependency of humans and ecosystems on it and the existence of significant threats to the groundwater resources. All these factors call for âgood groundwater governanceâ, guided in particular by the following working principles: â¢ Groundwater should not be managed in isolation, but conjunctively as appropriate with other water sources to improve water security and assure ecosystem health. â¢ Groundwater quality and resources should be co-managed, and therefore groundwater management needs to be harmonised with land management. â¢ Effective groundwater governance requires co-governance of subsurface space. â¢ âVertical integrationâ is required between national and local level in the elaboration and implementation of groundwater management and protection plans. â¢ Coordination should be established with the macro-policies of other sectors â such as agriculture, energy, health, urban and industrial development, and the environment."
98,208,0.983,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","Finally and controversially discussed is the impact of the so-called European third sector community that consists of encompassing third sector umbrella organizations operating in Brussels (Kendall et al. 2009). The so-called European TSOs are working as lobbyists on behalf of the sector in Brussels in close contact with the EU policy machinery, the Commission, the Parliament and the various interdepartmental groups (Kendall et al. 2009). Partly funded and sometimes even founded by EU institutions, the so-called community of European TSOs operating in Brussels is somehow in a position of dependency. It has a low profile and seems to serve a useful function for the EUâs policy machine by providing expertise and also legitimacy for selected policies, initiated by the Commission. TSOs active in Brussels are not at all in a position of being able to significantly influence the agenda or addressing major topics that are key concerns of the EU and directly and indirectly impinge TSOsâ fortunes in the European member states such as the liberalization of social service provision, the introduction of rigid and highly bureaucratic procurement procedures, the neglect of the added value of TSO activity in terms of community building and civicness, just to name a few (Zimmer and Hoemke 2016). In sum: Although the EU does not have a direct impact on TSOs in Europe, the EU exercises a remarkable influence on the environment of European TSOs by both neglecting the third sector as a valuable underpinning of the social fabric of Europe and exclusively supporting third sector activities that are business-like and favorable for the economy. Moreover, the âcultural shiftâ toward marketization in third sector government relationships as well as the increase in bureaucratic control mechanisms, on which we will focus in the following chapter, has been promoted and significantly supported by the European Union. Therefore, the impact of the European Union translates into a homogenization of the barriers TSOs have to cope with; however, these barriers play out very differently in the countries due to the heterogeneity and diversity of TSO embeddedness in the European regions. In the following, we will draw heavily on the results of country reports of the TSI team.3 Thanks to the reports, we were able to identify both See National Reports of the TSI countries: http://thirdsectorimpact.eu/the-project/workingareas/barriers/."

Space: ICTs de-territorialise human experience. They have made regional borders porous or in some cases entirely irrelevant. They have also created, and are exponentially expanding, regions of the infosphere where an increasing number of agents (not only people, see above) operate and spend more and more time. Such regions are intrinsically stateless. This is generating a new tension between geo-politics, which is global and non-territorial, and the Nation State, which still defines its identity and political legitimacy in terms of a sovereign territorial unit, as a Country. 3. Organisation: ICTs fluidify the topology of politics. ICTs do not merely enable but actually promote the agile, temporary and timely aggregation, disaggregation and re-aggregation of distributed (Floridi forthcoming) groups around shared interests across old, rigid boundaries, represented by social classes, political parties, ethnicity, language barriers, and so forth. This is generating a new tensions between the Nation State, still understood as a major organisational institution, yet no longer monolithic but increasingly morphing into a multiagent system itself (see below), and a variety of equally powerful, indeed sometimes even more politically influential (with respect to the old Nation State) and powerful (see above), non-State organisations. The debate on direct democracy is thus reshaped. We used to think that it was about how the Nation State could re-organise itself internally, by designing rules and having the means to promote forms of democracy in which citizens could vote on policy initiatives directly almost in real time. We thought of it as a complementary alternative to forms of representative democracy. The reality is that direct democracy has become a medialed democracy, in which multiagent systems (understood as distributed groups temporary and timely aggregated around shared interests) have multiplied and become sources of influence external to the Nation State. Citizens vote for their representatives and influence them via opinion polls. Because of 1â3, the unique position of the historical State as the information agent is being undermined from below and overridden from above by the emergence of multiagent systems or MASs, which have the data, the power (and sometimes even the force, as in the case of cyber threats), the space, and the organisational flexibility to erode its political clout, steal its authority and, in the long run, make it redundant in contexts where it was once the only or the predominant informational agent. The recent Greek crisis and the actual agents involved in its management offer a good template: the Greek Government and the Greek State had to interact âaboveâ with the EU, the European Central Bank, the IMF, the rating agencies, and so forth, and âbelowâ with the Greek mass media and the people in Syntagma square, the financial markets and international investors, German public opinion, and so forth. A much more networked idea of political interactions makes possible a degree of tolerance towards, and indeed feasibility of, localisms, separatisms, as well as movements and parties favouring autonomy or independence that would have been inconceivable in Modern times.

It will require new revenue and time, but as we suggested earlier, the change could be spread over time and partially supported by the federal government. States should also seek ways to stimulate within-district equalization. Each of these actions would very positively alter the current unequal resource allocation problems in many states. A fair and equitable finance system also must face the challenges of providing extra support for the groups of high-risk students that do not fit into the categories of the protected because of race or poverty. Special treatment is necessary for four additional groups of at-risk students that together may constitute up to 4â6 % of all of the nationâs children in school: foster children (400,000 in the U.S.), children with incarcerated parents (2.7 million), homeless children (500,000 in any given year), and children/youth who suffer from a serious mental disorder (estimated four million nationally, many of whom are not served by special education).61 Effective Data Infrastructure We have already considered the importance of data to continuous improvement; we believe the state is in the best position to ensure that the data infrastructure is sufficiently robust and adaptable. Beyond this the state must be able to point to examples of effective use of data as integral to continuous improvement and as offering a methodology for use throughout all of their districts and schools.

224,274,0.983,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Food security as a global field of governance and livelihoods/entitlements as concepts of a âsocial economyâ are very relevant in Africa and can be considered to be crosscutting issues (as are gender and environment). Livelihoods are very often constructed not only by private and public means but are also constructed through translocal systems of social and gender relations. Social security is a system made of gifts and distribution (upheld to a large extent by women) in a manner that links formal and informal institutions (Lachenmann 1997; Tanzania, Steinwachs 2006). Migrants created new and gendered translocal livelihood systems. In the past, only remittances were examined and critics made about the mere âconsumptionâ finality. Typically, money from young male migrants is sent to their mothers (the older women) instead of to the fathers (as I observed in Senegal). However, in some cases, migrants enter into agreements with local traders to avoid conflict within the family. In many cases, there are groups and associations that assist at the sending end in locations such as Paris or New York. A typical case is the shared responsibility for education and health services between different family and social networks, with links to kin living in towns and/or working in the formal sector. Consider the case of translocal gendered relations between two (ex) co-wives in Senegal. One woman takes care of all of their children as a housewife in the reproductive sphere with the support of a formally employed husband who has corresponding connections to state institutions, such as schools and hospitals. The other wife works in a semi-formal job in the peasant movement and takes care of matters in the nationâs capital, such as accommodation and university access for their children. She performs a variety of âself-help jobsâ. Her compensations and per-diems amount to a salary of sorts, and she establishes connections to formal state-authority structures and policies by means of her former work in the community development sector (she lost this job as a result of structural adjustment) (empirical case study by the author). Therefore âgendered social securityâ (social security in the widest sense of the term) or formal/informal connectivity are very important dimensions of embeddedness (Risseeuw and Ganesh 1998). Alternatively, problems of âinsecurityâ and sustainable livelihoods should also be considered. Women should be regarded as active providers/producers instead of passive recipients of social security. Furthermore, it"
221,430,0.983,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Abstract The response to climate change is a matter of increasing urgency, and from 2020, every nation will be required to reduce its GHGs. The unified reduction policies of the central governments of each country form the core of reduction policy implementation. Actual reductions are planned and implemented for each region and sector. As climate policies are strongly related to the development strategies and energy policies of each country, it is thus necessary for each country to independently mobilise knowledge to formulate strategies and policies based on domestic natural and developmental conditions. The response to climate change has brought about a major turning point in modern civilisation, which was founded, and yet is still heavily dependent on fossil fuel energy. As Asian countries are currently in a period of strong growth, Asia as a whole must set a course towards low-carbon development that differs from the paths taken to date by developed industrialised countries. Science-based initiatives are indispensable to the formulation of climate policies, and in order for individual countries to frame policies and maintain ownership of them, scientific bases will, respectively, need to be created by each country. From 2020, part of all-country participation in climate change mitigation entails INDCs (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) be formulated. It is here that the achievements of a series of scientific cooperation projects promoted in the Asian region by the Government of Japan, in particular the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, can fully be appreciated. Reducing GHG via scientific policymaking involves following the sequence of reduction target setting, reduction policy design, policy implementation, continuation and feedback (see Fig. 12.2). In order to carry this out, it is necessary to (1) ascertain GHG emission volumes for all processes (GHG inventories); (2) establish approaches to create unified climate policies for central and local governments (technologies, energy and GHG policy integrated assessment model, IAM); and (3) develop mechanisms to foster related research communities and strengthen"
170,333,0.983,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"6 Re-examining the Philippine ICT Framework and the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012: Implications ICT for Development The Philippine ICT framework programmed the countryâs ICT industry for the provision of the Filipino brand of âworld-class service.â It capitalized on the countryâs âhuman resource advantageâ (CICT 2006) to strategically position the country in the global digital economy. The framework, we argue, inherently lacked enabling requisites for workers and citizens. Instead, it framed the role of the Filipino ICT labourer primarily as service and support, as exemplified by the provision of customer care, customer service or customer-relations management. In reducing its workforce to front-liners in service provision, the government is pre-empting, rather than channelling, skills and energies toward the creative and meaningful strategies of ICT use. Pushing the country to be a leader in cyberservices destination, the State has exploited foreign capital and technology to rationalize and streamline labor. Affective labour, i.e. the mobilization of affect in cyberservice provision, becomes the product being sold in the global digital economy. As the State endeavours to leapfrog ICT-led national growth, it excluded sectors it was quick to judge as illegal to sustain the integrity of ICT-related businesses and clear the ground for foreign investors. Thus, the Stateâs limited understanding of cybersex and a priori judgement of cybersex workers has the tendency to be exclusionist. Categorizing cybersex as a crime has been a clear example of this. Understandably, determining which ICT practices are considered acceptable and legitimate, and justifying them based on perceived public threats, is a function of governance. With this approach, the State fails to consider values created from the periphery. ICT governance, preoccupied with creating limits and securitizing the technological infrastructure, unwittingly forces individuals and communities, especially those from the informal sector with little to no income or property, to live in subsistence and to rely on their means of survival. At worst, these people"

Private higher education institutions (Council on Higher Education 2000). The CHE report indicated âthat there should be no closure of institutions but that the absolute number of institutions should be reduced through combinationâ (Council on Higher Education 2000). Here, however, it was constrained by the Ministerâs injunction that there should be no closures of any universities or technikons, even though White Paper 3 had left this open as a possibility. The CHE provided âexamples of possible combinations for illustrative purposesâ, but urged that the Ministry should âinvestigate the full range of possibilities for combinations, and should also be open to compelling combination possibilities that may emerge from the iterative national planning processâ (Council on Higher Education 2000). It also proposed âthat as part of national planning and the development of a national plan, there should be an iterative process between the Minister and institutions around the reconfiguration of the system, combination and the mandates of institutionsâ (Council on Higher Education 2000). The CHE stressed these critical points. First, the Ministry had to âbe mindful that under apartheid, institutions designated for black South Africans and the technikons were disadvantaged in different waysâ; the CHEâs âreconfiguration proposals makes possible developmental trajectories for institutions to enable them to undertake specified mandates within a new national frameworkâ. Second, the âsuccess of reconfiguration will require the setting of nationally negotiated priorities and targets, as well as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track progress in their achievementâ. Third, a new institutional landscape would not be possible âwithout the mobilisation of public, international donor and private sector funds for key strategic interventionsâ (Council on Higher Education 2000). The Ministry responded to the CHE through its 2001 National Plan for Higher Education. The National Plan reaffirmed its commitment to the White Paper 3 goals (Ministry of Education 2001). It also signalled the Ministry of Educationâs impatience with the pace and nature of change and its determination to act. The Minister of Education noted: âAfter apartheid, privilege and disadvantage is no longer kept in place by violence but by the workings of inertia and of continuing privilege â the higher education system, in large measure, continues to reproduce the inequities of the past. This must endâ. The Minister added that the âtime is long overdue. The reform of higher education cannot be further delayed. Nor can it be left to chance. The Plan is [. . .] not up for further consultation and certainly not for negotiationâ (5 March 2001). The Plan elaborated seven specific objectives and 21 priorities that would be pursued in relation to five identified White Paper goals, the 16 outcomes that would be sought and the strategies and mechanisms that would be utilised to realize the outcomes. The goals related to the production of graduates (participation rate, student recruitment, distribution of students by fields and the quality of graduates); student and staff equity; the maintenance and enhancement of research outputs; differentiation and diversity in the higher education system, and restructuring of the higher education landscape (Ministry of Education 2001)."

Although IPEA, the government think tank, has been in charge of collecting data on different aspects of Brazilâs South-South cooperation, the government institutions that are invited to open up their data do so voluntarily (IPEA 2011). More broadly, the MRE in particular has been reluctant to adopt monitoring and evaluation practices because these are considered by some Brazilian cooperation specialists to have a heavily Western bent, especially when associated with the practices of donor countries and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, recognizing the need for more systematic planning that establishes benchmarks for both process and outcome-based evaluations, ABC in 2016 began considering the possibility of developing âhomegrownâ M&E practices. It is worth noting that the public institutions from which Brazilâs SouthSouth cooperation experts are drawn, such as Fiocruz and Embrapa, have robust mechanisms for M&E that are applied to projects domestically, and that these toolboxes have not been implemented abroad partly due to the low institutionalization of Brazilian peacebuilding, but also due to political resistance.10 At any rate, part of objective of this technical cooperation is politicalâthe maintenance of good diplomatic relations, an element that is not readily captured by traditional M&E processes. Also on the flip side, Brazilian arms companies like Taurus also benefitted from expanding African markets (and indirectly, from African conflicts and instability) to boost their sales of arms and military equipment, including some, such as cluster bombs, that had been banned under UN regimes. In 2013, Brazilian exports transferred some USD$10 million in small arms and accessories alone to other countries (Small Arms Survey 2014). As with other major arms-exporting countries, these transfers sometimes undermine Brazilâs peacebuilding credentials abroad."

They recognise quasi-conceptsâ polysemy and describe such concepts as those which are not yet stabilised or are in the process of being destabilised (Bartsch, 2002, p. 50). For a more elaborate presentation of social innovation as a quasi-concept, see European Commission (2013). 2. In this group are other useful notions such as social cohesion (Jenson, 2010a; Bernard, 1999), social investment (Jenson, 2010b), social inclusion (Levitas, 2005) and social capital (McNeill, 2006). 3. The notion of welfare diamond presented here is clearly an extension of GÃ¸sta Esping-Andersenâs popular âwelfare triangleâ, which identifies the state, market and family as the three sources of well-being. I believe that it is a mistake and misleading to try, as he did, to subsume the welfare-generating community sector under the family corner of the triangle and to restrict the production of welfare to âmarkets (purchased welfare), families (the reciprocity of kin) and government (solidarity)â (Esping-Andersen, et al., 2002, p. 4). Hence I propose a welfare mix with four corners that make a diamond. For this representation, see also Evers, Pijl and Ungerson (1994) as well as Evers and Guillemard (2012). 4. The recognition that there is no single form led, among other conceptual exercises, to the large literature on welfare regimes (e.g., Esping-Andersen et al., 2002) and welfare mix (e.g., Evers and Guillemard, 2012). For a recent review of the results of such choices in local welfare systems, see Evers, Ewert and Brandsen (2014). 5. The OECD has been tracking mounting inequalities both in the OECD world and in the Global South for almost a decade. See, for example, OECD (2011, p. 22). 6. For one recent discussion of such examples, see Nicholls and Murdock (2012, especially Chapters 3, 5, 6). 7. It is interesting to note than an early precursor was Piore and Sabelâs Second Industrial Divide (1984), which argued that innovation for the late 20th century could come not from firms organised around the social relations of Fordism but from those harking back to the 19th centuryâs personalised social relations of craft production. A decade later, Charles Sabel led the team assessing the potential for social innovation of the Irish Governmentâs experimental âcreation of urban and rural area-based partnerships to address issues of social exclusion in a more flexible, decentralised and participative wayâ (OECD, 1996, p. 5). This assessment of partnerships with various civil society groups as well as local authorities concentrated in disadvantaged areas was quickly followed by a number of OECD studies of the innovation potential of local partnerships for local development (OECD, 2001). 8.

The process was supported and observed by CONCAMI, the Red Muqui and leaders of local organizations. The regional governor, the Ministry of Agriculture, and representatives of regional ofï¬ces of development and production, and energy and mines, also participated as observers (Servindi, 2012). When this consultation occurred, the national government was promoting a law to regulate indigenous consultation rights. The question of whether the KaÃ±aris are peasant or indigenous, and hence entitled to FPIC according to ILO 169, triggered a wide debate (Greenspan, 2013). While the national ombudsman and transnational indigenous groups recognize the FPIC for KaÃ±aris, the government denies this right and claims that the government consultation is the valid one. In 2013 the Candente mining company stopped mining exploration, pointing to low copper prices as the reason. Ecuador, Kimsakocha project (Azuay) In October 2011 the ï¬rst mining community consultation of Ecuador took place. The conï¬ict arose from an open-pit project owned by a junior Canadian company. Concerns rose regarding the impact on water resources among indigenous and peasant groups located downstream from the project area (PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). The idea to conduct a consultation emerged in the context of growing pressure from the national government to promote mining activities in the country, in the midst of verbal and legal delegitimation and criminalization campaigns against Ecuadorian indigenous and anti-mining activists (interview with local activist, 2012). Moreover, local indigenous and peasant leaders were in contact with Latin American indigenous, anti-mining and human rights movements, in particular from Ecuador and Peru (interview with national anti-mining movement leader, 2012). In June 2011, local indigenous leaders led the organization of a continental peoples meeting with a strong emphasis on the impact of mining agendas on the environment and indigenous groups (PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). A community consultation was called by the Junta de Aguas, an indigenous and peasant organization that administers access to household water.

This volume also demonstrates that the nexus is now the subject of a stream of academic writing, as are the outputs on the migration-security nexus (Walters 2010) and the migration-development nexus, in which migrants are increasingly being seen as Transnational Development Agents (Faist 2008). Migration research is something of an industry in its own right, in which examination of these connections illuminates understanding, yet still most non-academics and those in civil society without access to policy-makers remain excluded from the policy discussions. The EUâs Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM) includes some aims to include migrants in a rights-based approach to policy-making (BanulescuBogdan 2011) however this is in a context in which the main EU policy objectives have already been set. (How this happened is described below in Sects. 8.3 and 8.4). The general absence of migrant voices and civil society from the researchpolicy nexus is the result of several factors which have positioned migrants as the object of study and recipients of policy measures. These factors include: the lack of transparency and accountability in EU migration policy-making; the focus of much migration research on policy concerns (currently integration and security); the use of research methodologies which investigate migration-related topics from theoretical and expert, academic positions; the exclusion of migrant voices from media coverage. Many migrants are excluded from much of society, let alone the migration debates, by citizenship laws, poverty, gendered social and economic injustice and institutional racism. They are structurally excluded and their lives are hidden from the priorities and gaze of the academic-policy nexus (notwithstanding some"
98,201,0.983,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","partnership.â Included here among our TSI project countries are the Netherlands, Germany, France and the rural areas of Austria. These countries or regions look back upon a tradition of close cooperation in human service delivery between the third sector and the welfare state. In all, religious politics and strong conservative as well as social-democratic elites kept social welfare provision in the hands of party or religiously affiliated TSOs. In these countries, TSOs have traditionally served a partnership role vis-Ã -vis the state, particularly in the welfare domain. TSOs in welfare partnership countries used to be protected from commercial competitors, and hence enjoyed privileged access to funding through government protection or, more specifically, through legal regulations. Their TSO sectors have consequently had unusually high levels of government support and a dominance of paid staff in their workforces. A considerably different pattern emerged in the UK. Here, state support for the third sector, and indeed for social welfare services, has long been far less pronounced than in the welfare partnership countries, a residue of the power of commercial and industrial elites and the historic weakness of labor elements. The mobilization of labor in World War II opened the country to elements of the welfare partnership model, but only partly, leaving behind a third sector more reliant on private than on public resources. Two of our project countries exhibit a social-democratic model of civil society development, though in one of them (Austria) this reflects a bifurcation of the countryâs social welfare system between urbanâin particular Viennaâand rural areas, with the urban areas displaying a social-democratic model characterized by direct delivery of social welfare services and a third sector much more strongly focused on sports, recreation and expressive activities, while the rural areas exhibit a welfare partnership pattern with the heavy involvement of Church-sponsored organizations. Finally, three of our countriesâPoland, Croatia and Spainâretain distinctive elements of a statist pattern fastened on the countries by modernizing elites in the military or authoritarian parties that restrained third sector development. One of these countries, Spain, is clearly in transition from a statist past to a welfare partnership future, and the other two are on a similar path, but a decade behind."

The economic crisis that has hit the European economy in recent years resulted in high social costs that call for the adoption of specific measures to support the weakest segments of the population as well as effectively contribute to the economic recovery through the creation of new development opportunities. Today, individuals at risk are not just those outside the labour market due to disadvantaged conditions, but also other numerous subjects â young people, women, immigrants, off-workers, those ejected from the labour market â who, although in possession of professional skills, are unable to enter (or re-enter) the labour market due to a scarce demand for jobs by enterprises and the impossibility to access credit.

Migrants in the latter two groups have to change their migration flows and choose urban places as their destination if they want to take full advantage of efforts to protect their rights under the conventional approach; however, this is not necessarily in their best interests. Great efforts must also be made to link the policies and measures targeting different groups with different migration flows, so that their protection will not lapse if they transfer from one migration flow to another. 8.5.2"

Accordingly, nowadays, TSOs have to actively recruit volunteers. With respect to voluntary contributions, such as donations, volunteering and serving on boards, TSOs are faced with a competitive environment, similar to the one they encounter on the market for government grants and contracts. Additionally, a growing share of volunteering takes place independently and without the framing of TSOs. As regards the key topic of our inquiry, the Austrian report summarized, âOne of the biggest barriers of TSOs stems from the lack of financial resources (Simsa et al. 2015, b).â The combined lack of public funding and private donations as well as the decreasing profit margins from TSOsâ market activities result in an ongoing trend toward marketization and professionalization, which will most likely impact negatively on the social and civic mission of the sector. TSOs in the welfare partnership countries are confronted with problems of identity and legitimacy since they are becoming more and more business-like in order to hold their central position in the market domain of social service provision."
35,414,0.983,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as a 200 nautical mile zone off the coast of a State, over which it has special rights regarding the exploration and utilization of marine resources. Thus, the EEZ is a special areaâit is not a state territory even if a coastal state has there somewhat sovereign rights and jurisdiction, which refers to the coastal stateâs rights below the surface of the sea. As a case in point, in Germany, the EEZ is an area where three legal systems come together: international law, law of the European Union and national German law. Indeed, the ocean space of the EEZ has been regulated or allocated in a number of different ways, but most importantly, this has been done predominantly within individual economic sectors. Obvious examples of ââsectoral zoningââ include waterways for shipping, disposal areas, military security zones, concession zones for mineral extraction, aquaculture sites, and most recently marine protected areas. Although the context and outcomes are different because of the dynamic and three-dimensional nature of marine environments, the land use planning concepts and techniques can be translated to the marine environment, thus leading to a contemporary rise in the development of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) efforts. At present, there are few frameworks that facilitate integrated strategic and comprehensive planning in relation to all activities taking place in marine areas. This current stage of development of spatial planning of marine waters can be viewed somewhat in parallel to the past land use planning efforts. The latter arose in response to speciï¬c social and economic problems and later environmental problems that were triggered by the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century. Next to the problematic nature of marine spatial planning, the offshore realm is a place far off the coast, which bears challenges to the technological development of aquaculture systems that are able to withstand the harsh offshore conditions, vis Ã¡ vis supporting feasible operation and maintenance demands. Candidate species must be tolerable to these exposed conditions whilst holding sufï¬cient economic potential. Last, but not least, stakeholders and their interests, concerns, rights and duties must be taken into consideration. In the following we illustrate these different aspects and challenges of offshore aquaculture in multi-use settings employing Germanyâs North Sea EEZ region as a case study. We draw here on research and experience from various research efforts in this areas since early 2000 until today (see Buck et al. 2008a). Figure 11.1 shows a summary of the projects conducted in the German Bight all led by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), which were related to the four main topics: (A) biology, (B) technology, (C) social science as well as (D) economics. All projects are displayed in a chronological order by taking the scientiï¬c coherence into account. Project No. 1, the feasibility study, gave the basis for the following projects and the entire suite of aquaculture-wind farm multi-use research. The Coastal Futures Project (No. 4) acted as key node project, in which the other projects either have contributed to or have been stimulated by its transdisciplinary approach. Due to their problem-focused approaches and early and continuous integration of multiple stakeholder groups, these projects initiated and accompanied several activities and outcomes outside academia. For instance, it called for wind"
296,277,0.983,Becoming a World-Class University : The Case of King Abdulaziz University,"The concept of âinternational cooperationâ describes all cooperation activities with foreign countries, whether by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), bilateral (from one country to another), multilateral (involving a number of states), or decentralized (between local authorities). The most established definition of international cooperation in the literature is by Keohane [2]. Keohane assumes a conflictive policy situation between countries at the outset of each cooperative agreement. Policy adjustments are then negotiated to bring agreements more in line with each actorâs preferences. Once both policies become more compatible, the act of cooperation is completed. âAidâ is something different from cooperation. It still has a social content, since it presupposes a relation between partners, but it does not imply sharing. It implicates inequality and it is sufficient that aid takes the initiative in favor of the other, with a certain degree of privilege [3]. Also, universities can enter into agreements in which one of the partners is âaidedâ by the other (for example between a university in a developing country and one in the developed world). The term âcollaborationâ is the action of working together with other people to produce or create something. It is used, in the context of universities, mostly on the level of research. Roschelle and Teasley [1] see collaborative work as the mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve the problem together [4]. Research collaborations can take many forms. There is a continuum ranging from the classic partnership between researchers in the same laboratory or academic department to the partnership between researchers in the same institution, to even partnership between researchers in different countries. Sometimes, two or more researchers at different institutions work separately and yet collaborate on a project. This can occur, for example, when working on different aspects of the same project, exchanging data, compiling data for the entire project, and subsequently conducting joint data analysis, reporting, and publication. Collaborations between or among researchers are particularly complicated when the researchers work at institutions in different countries. Not only can distance affect communication and project oversight, but cultural differences may further complicate communication and the projectâs overall conduct. Cooperate/cooperation has been in vogue for many years, while collaborate/ collaboration is a more recent addition to selection criteria terminology. How do these terms differ? Basically, they are synonyms and both words are used interchangeably, but they represent fundamentally different ways of contributing to a group and each brings with it its own dynamics and power structures that shape groups in different ways. In other words, cooperation can be achieved if all participants do their assigned parts separately and bring their results to the table, while collaboration implies direct interaction among individuals to produce a product and involves negotiations, discussions, and accommodating othersâ perspectives. The key difference between these approaches to group work is that cooperation is more focused on working together to create an end product, while successful collaboration requires participants to share in the process of knowledge creation [1, 5]."

In Libya, the group of black people and sub-Saharan black Africans is a heterogeneous population, internally stratified by race/ethnicity, age, religion, class, sense of loyalty, nationality, and history of migration into the country. They also constitute a highly gendered group of migrants, in the sense that a considerable majority are male as men are more easily integrated into the construction, agriculture, and oil sectors offered by the Libyan labour market. Their treatment and subordination have been largely determined3 by intersectional and dynamic patterns of violence related to the unfolding of the conflict. However, in addressing how the media construct subSaharan black Africansâ masculinities in connection with the Libyan conflict, it is important to observe how, despite their diverse social locations, they tend to be homogenized by race/ethnicity along the lines of a âthreatâ to different actors, and how this undermines their entitlements to security and protection as human subjects under international norms. Studies of media and conflict have pointed out the significant role and risky implications of media categorization and other representational strategies regarding the selective exposure and characterization of certain actors and their particular conditions, which provide moral accounts and justification for particular actions (Hall 1997; Zarkov 2011; Tucker/Triantafyllos 2008; Fudge 2010). Media, located within the broader frameworks of contemporary processes of globalization and relying on discourses and forms of representation embedded in global societal power relations, propose specific understandings of international involvement, and may support non-intervention or call for action (Hall 1997; Didero 2011; Fraser 2009).

381,635,0.983,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"accomplish two goals: right the broken funding and governance system, and provide coherent support for deep transition to the Common Core at the school and classroom levels. A first step was restoring funding for education as the state began its economic recovery; without this move, the other steps would have been difficult, if not impossible, both politically and fiscally. But at the heart of the fiscal transformation has been passage and implementation of the LCFF, which has two major components: (a) a more equitable allocation formula to districts, based on the numbers of students, with additional weights for counts and concentrations of students in poverty, English learners, and foster youth; and (b) the removal of categorical funding streams, and with them, the myriad of conflicting, burdensome, and top-down regulations that made it difficult for local districts to develop coherent, contextspecific improvement strategies. The second focus has been to support effective implementation of the Common Core. The governor, State Board of Education, Department of Education, and state legislature have all united around this goal, and the legislatureâs allocation of an additional $1.25 billion for capacity building for Common Core standards implementation had both symbolic and material benefits toward its realization. In addition, policies for curriculum and instructional guidance (recommendations of texts and development of instructional frameworks), teacher licensure, admissions criteria for the stateâs public universities, and accountability systems have been or are being aligned to support Common Core implementation. Each of these areas reflects the same state restraint as in LCFF, with the state playing a supportive and advisory role and placing much greater discretion with districts to respond to their local contexts. Perhaps one of the boldest and most illustrative moves of the state was the decision to end use of the existing California Standards Tests in spring 2014, before the new Common Core standards-aligned assessments were ready for full implementation. Believing that continued administration of the old tests would send mixed signals to teachers and schoolsâand recognizing that students and adults could benefit from a run-through with the new assessment formats and technologyâstate leaders pushed back against accountability demands from the federal government and instead expanded the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) field test to include all students in the relevant grades across the state. This move was accompanied by a systematic collection and analysis of data on the implementation of the field test to inform state and local leaders about their readiness for the official SBAC administration set for spring 2015. State leaders have also maintained focus by eschewing âreformsâ that they believed were not in the best interests of the state or would detract from the fiscal and Common Core foci. Most notably, they declined to apply for an NCLB waiver because it would have required creation of a state test-based teacher evaluation system, which they felt would both violate state law and jeopardize the emerging coalition in support of Common Core implementation."

Broadly, Krause and Williams point out three directions in which the so-called ânew thinking on securityâ debate is heading (Krause & Williams, 1996, pp. 229â230). The first approach aims to broaden the scope of security studies with the purpose of including non-military issues under the concept of âsecurity.â The second trend is to deepen the agenda of security studies by flexibly adjusting the level of analysis from that of individual or human security to that of international or global security. The third group maintains the state-centric approach, but focuses its analysis on diversified forms of inter-state security cooperation, such as common, cooperative, collective, and comprehensive cooperation (Krause & Williams, 1996, p. 230). The traditional approach in the field sees states, groups, or individuals as givens, and treats threats external to these givens in the search for solutions to remove such threats. In contrast, the first and second approaches mentioned above focus on the process through which threats against an individual or group are constituted as âsocial factsâ (Krause & Williams, 1996, pp. 242â243). Their interest therefore lies in whoâa government, business enterprise, or charismatic personâdefines âsecurityâ for particular issuesâeconomic well-being, military build-up, or environmental degradationâand in the process, under what conditions do they effectively provide it (Krause & Williams, 1996, pp. 242â243). Among the scholars within this ânew thinking on security,â Buzan and those who contributed to his work (1998) engage in âthe most thorough and continuous exploration of the significance and implications of a widening security agenda for security studiesâ (Huysmans, 1998, p. 480). Nonetheless, even their efforts are criticized for failing to pay attention to the concept of âsecurityâ on the basis of gender.11 This lack of attention, Hansen (2000) insists, results from one of the two main shortcomings of security studies, namely âsecurity as silence.â12 According to Hansen, âsecurity as silenceâ occurs in situations where the potential subject of security is forced to either remain silent or likely face even greater âinsecurityâ if the particular situation should receive attention. FODWs fit well into this category. As âwomen,â they face enormous pressures to tolerate lesser âsecurity,â whether in their home country or receiving countries.

99,281,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"building, cooperation and unwritten rules of respect can hardly be regarded as a reliable antidote to missing job security. Furthermore, models for taking part in social innovation projects are typically much more diverse than in the public or business sector since they include not only various forms of (casually) paid employment but also many forms of voluntary and civic contributions. The latter range from short-term activism to regular long-term unpaid volunteering, from hands-on volunteer work to regular contributions in the form of civic engagement on a board of management. Hendrickson and Estanyâs contribution on Neighbourhood Children Services in Pamplona in this chapter is an illustrative example. This innovation provides leisure activities for children and young people such as activity groups, playgrounds, summer camps and neighbourhood festivals. In the working structure, one can find volunteers and paid practitioners from neighbourhood associations, cooperating with directors both of local social services and the associations themselves. For its network and activities, this combination of professional and lay contributions is indispensable. People working in innovative projects must typically manage tasks that fall outside the limits of traditional professions and the divisions of labour that they imply (Brandsen and Honingh 2013). They might have to learn to converse with various kinds of users, clients, co-citizens and volunteers; sometimes they are specialists, entrepreneurs and managers simultaneously. Many of them need a combination of both technical and social knowledge. This kind of âre-professionalisationâ process may, for example, involve collaborators who are architects by training but work simultaneously as community organisers and mediators. The social innovation based in a neighbourhood called Ilot Stephenson near Lille (see Fraisse in this chapter) features a group of architects supporting inhabitants in renovating their own houses under the slogan âFaire ensemble, le grand ensembleâ (roughly translated: âworking together to build the whole urban areaâ). This is a good example of a new kind of professionalism that combines previously fragmented knowledge. Many, if not the majority of the social innovations we studied, are based on combining multiple sources of funding. The mix varies, and often state financing remains the most important component. But usually there is some degree of (financial) co-responsibility on the part of other organisations from civil society and/or the business sector. Furthermore, funding arrangements are usually precarious and limited in time. Examples of the possibilities and limitations of innovative projects that work with short-term funding, combining resources from different stakeholders, can be found in many innovations presented in this book (see, for instance, the contribution on work corporations in Nijmegen and their resource mix). Message FiveâAbout the Need to Question How (Local) Welfare Systems are Framed The WILCO project sought to examine the possible contributions of social innovations to changes and developments in local welfare systems. It was understood that this label meant more than just local welfare-state institutions. Referring to a welfare system usually means includingâin addition to the local welfare state and municipal welfareâwelfare-related activities and responsibilities from the third sector, the market sector, communities and the family (Evers and Laville 2004)."

The result was an extensive mapping and analysis of usersâ needs involving health personnel, citizens and management bodies of the health regions. The analysis ended up with the identification of priority service areas, informed the formulation of a strategy for digital specialist health services, and led to the formation of a specific project on digital citizen services for the specialist sector. In Italy, an improvement process was put in place right after launching the e-booking service. The process involved all the main protagonists, the Health Department, the three health units, ITALSIEL and SYNWARE. The Health Department, specifically the CUP directorate, led this process. Overall, also in this case, organisational processes for planning and controlling changes were implemented. In Sweden the principle of local contribution to the national ecosystem was formalised and became one of the six architecture principles of the national reference architecture. In the cases of local and regional needs that are not aligned with national prioritizations, a group of county councils, municipalities and solution vendors have been able to join forces to develop solutions on their own for more local and regional use. The principles of national functional scope secure that the solution can grow to a national scale in the future. As time passes by, county councils, municipalities and solution vendors continuously negotiate to bring their local or regional solution to a national level, sharing the solution with all publicly funded care in Sweden. In Catalonia, the new patient-oriented eHealth services had to face uncertainty and multiple possible alternatives. Since many of the services could not be specified in advance, decisions and choices had to be exploratory and adaptable. At the beginning of the project, the sponsors of the portal tied the development to the Public Shared Electronic Medical Record. So, the portal started simple, without a big architectural blueprint and complex anticipatory design. A catalyst for further growth has been the decision to put in place the means for connecting to existing applications and stimulating the development of new ones by third parties. The interoperability framework and the app accreditation process were critical for this."
128,133,0.983,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"considerable time, a proliferation of negative policy discourses aimed at those seeking refuge and asylum in the UK and indeed at migrants more generally (Sales 2002; Statham and Geddes 2006; Squire 2008). Our findings confirm that there is certainly a section of the population which stands in stark contrast to the âracist publicâ thesis, and their practices point towards a current of solidarity suggested by extant research (Squire 2011). Nevertheless, there has been, across governments of different political orientations, a drive towards policies which are far more focused on border control than solidarity when it comes to refugees arriving in the UK (Squire 2016). Given that immigration and asylum policy is reserved to Westminster control and there are few avenues for devolved administrations to pursue alternative approaches, this perhaps only leaves space for rhetorical divergence. Moreover, our findings reveal that among our three groups, it is unemployed people in the UK who are supported by the lowest number of solidarity participation practices. Any analysis of why the unemployed are the least supported group should be caveated by the fact that most support for the unemployed in the UK has traditionally been delivered by the welfare state through support with basic subsistence such as Jobseekerâs Allowance (JSA) and with the cost of rent through Housing Benefit (HB). It is, however, worth noting that both of these benefits have been at the centre of a welfare reform agenda pursued in the aftermath of the financial crisis by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government elected in 2010 and articulated through their policy document Welfare in the Twenty-First Century which highlighted concerns of a âculture of worklessnessâ in the UK. Moreover, ever since the break with the post-war consensus initiated by Margaret Thatcher and followed through by both Conservative and New Labour prime ministers, support for unemployed people has been under attack with those out of work increasingly characterised as lazy and as undeserving of public support. Rather than unemployment being understood as a social, political, and structural problem emerging from the limits of capitalist production, it has now been fully recast as an individual-level problem resulting from the deficient personalities of certain people. Indeed, such policies reflected this ideological process of transformation of poverty and unemployment from market failure to personal failure (Wiggan 2012). Indeed this has been shown as a consistently strong trope in austerity Britain, even impervious to contrary evidence (MacDonald et al. 2014a, b), and offers some context as to why"

Where the initiative has not been taken by politics, however, higher education Institutions have questioned and improved the quality of Doctoral education on their own initiative. The majority of Institutions have implemented part of the Salzburg Principles promoted by the European University Association or have joined other bottom-up initiatives like the Tuning recommendations on how to develop Doctoral programmes. Institutions begun to see differently the relationship between themselves and the doctoral candidate. The commitment of both parties, roles and expectations should be clariï¬ed and approved in advance in order to make the best use of all available competence and institutional assets. Looking at the various reform initiatives, some common elements can be found: â¢ an increased attention on the quality of supervision; â¢ an increase in the international dimension of programmes, with more Doctoral candidates and supervisors mobility, and more international cooperation through joint programmes; â¢ an increase in interdisciplinarity; â¢ an increase in collaboration with the non-academic labour market, with more focus on industry, in all the forms that it might take place. The role of supervisors for the successful completion of a Doctoral programme and of a research project is being recognized as increasingly important. They help candidates in the achievement of a broader set of competencies and in the development of their research careers. To accomplish this role, they should be adequately trained and supported by Institutions. In many cases, it can be seen a move from individual, one to one, supervision approach to a more team-based approach where one or a group of candidates interacts with a team of supervisors from different research backgrounds. Concerning the increase in internationalization, in interdisciplinarity and in collaboration with the non-academic world, a mean to reach these ends has been the creation of Doctoral Schools and, more generally, a structured approach to Doctoral programmes. Structured doctoral training leads to clearer governance structures and policies at the institutional level concerning admission, quality assurance, assessment, supervision. In parallel, sometimes as interlinked strategy, institutions embedded training activities in the discipline or in transferable skills leading to"

Historically, the nation state has sought to monopolize control of movement of people across its borders in order to protect its territorial sovereignty, for its own security. However, the nature of threats and the security referents have changed under global capitalism. Both as a scientific and as a political concept, security has been reconceptualized in the post-Cold-War era (see Brauch/Oswald/Mesjasz/ Grin/Dunay/Behera/Chadha/Chourou/Kameri-Mbote/ Liotta 2008).

Due to outcomes from this, further deregulation or new support measures are coming into force. For development in other areas the results, including any impact the project had on the local community, are expressed in numbers so that the accuracy and details can be adequately grasped. Further developments are also described as it is possible that the local community may be impacted even further as the project continues to expand. The basic intention of the entire Handbook is to make Input-Output relations as clear as possible so that cause-and-effect relationships are clarified. To this end, the IDEF system of analysis was used as a base. Rather than examples, the Handbook focuses more on factors for success and the development processes of various cases. For example, the senior high school in the town of Ama was in danger of becoming closed down. However, the implementation of a program to have students come to the island and study at the school successfully increased the number of classes. This excellent result was brought about by the sense of crisis shared by the town mayor and island residents that keeping the school viable was directly linked to keeping the island viable. As well as the entire town getting involved in this project, factors for its success are that experts were brought in from outside and that the project was carried out with collaboration and division of roles with these experts. Out of these, ideas unique to the island were born. They included conducting social education with the town residents as teachers, and opening a publicly run learning center. Toyooka city has made extensive use of white storks and developed a special brand too. In order to raise white storks by artificial incubation and eventually"

The background to the law reform involved several reports from both governmental committees and NGOs.5 From October 2013, it became statutory for Danish municipalities to create a Barnahus in each region to meet the needs of all children and young people in cases of the suspicion or knowledge of violence or sexual abuse (Consolidation Act on Social Services, Â§50a).

284,348,0.983,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction This chapter studies the emergence and spread of community consultations in large-scale metal mining projects in Latin America. These consultations are different from the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)-related consultations, or consulta previa, that are fostered by national governments. From Tambogrande (Peru) in June 2002 to Mataquescuintla (Guatemala) in November 2012, 68 consultations/referenda have been conducted in Peru, Argentina, Guatemala, Colombia and Peru. In all cases the result has been a large opposition to mining projects. This process is occurring in a context of growing pressures to extract mineral ores in Latin America and an increasing number of related socioenvironmental conï¬icts (see Chapter 2). The particularity of these consultations is that these are not commissioned by national governments as part of ofï¬cial procedures to consult communities but instead are promoted by environmental justice movements (EJMs), usually with the support of local governments. The emergence and spread of consultations in Latin America remains poorly studied. Studies addressing mining consultations/referenda have focused on the ï¬rst four cases: Tambogrande, Esquel, Sipakapa and Majaz/RÃ­o Blanco (Muradian, Martinez-Alier and Correa, 2003; Subies et al., 2005; Haarstad and Floysand, 2007; De Echave et al., 2009; McGee, 2009; Walter and Martinez-Alier, 2010; Fulmer, 2011; Urkidi, 2011; Bebbington, 2012a); along with the wave of consultations in Guatemala (Holden and Jacobson, 2008; Rasch, 2012; Trentavizi and Cahuec, 2012)."
56,209,0.983,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"empower migrants to return. In the last two decades, transnational migrantsâ communications with their left behind families have been transformed by advances in technology, particularly mobile phones and cheaper landline calls. A growing literature on the use of ICT in transnational social fields, has noted the empowering and uniting effects of these technological advances, both for migrants and their left behind relatives and friends (Horst 2006; Madianou 2012; Panagakos and Horst 2006; Tall 2004; Thompson 2009; Vertovec 2004; Wilding 2006). Drawing on the concept of return preparedness (Cassarino 2004), it follows that transnational ICT use should also empower prospective returnees, enabling them to be better informed about conditions in their homelands and therefore better prepared for a sustainable definitive return. However, as will be discussed here, ICT use among hostel residents may actually serve to impede return, by exacerbating the pressures to remit and amplifying the family tensions noted above. Advances in transport and communications technologies are held to be central drivers of transnationalism (Faist 2000; Portes et al. 1999). The wider availability of these technologies has transformed transnational activities: no longer the prerogative of business elites, transnational practices are part of everyday life for a growing share of migrants (Portes et al. 1999). Much attention has been focused on web technologies in the globalisation literature and migrants are often perceived at the âcutting edgeâ when it comes to adoption of such technologies (Panagakos and Horst 2006: 111). While some migrants do indeed have the potential at their fingertips to play this pioneering role, such a generalization should be qualified by acknowledging that not all migrants possess the financial and human capital needed to exploit these opportunities to the full. A point on which there appears to be scholarly agreement is that older people are not easily able to manipulate ICT (Hamel 2009; Panagakos and Horst 2006; Tall 2004). Internet-based technologies continue to inspire the lionâs share of scholarly enquiry in the field of migrantsâ ICT use (for example, Oiarzabal and Reips 2012). Less attention has been given to how developments associated with the âseemingly pedestrianâ technology of long-distance telephony link with international migration (Panagakos and Horst 2006: 111â12). Yet Steven Vertovec insists that ânothing has facilitated processes of global linkage more than the boom in ordinary, cheap international telephone calls. This is especially the case among non-elite social groups such as migrantsâ (Vertovec 2004: 219). Within this non-elite group, ageing migrants experiencing literacy problems may be especially receptive to advances in this technology. This is the case for the less-skilled migrants who formed Europeâs post-WWII âguestworkerâ cohort. Dialling to DembancanÃ©: The All-Conquering Mobile Phone Given the importance of international telephony to migrant communities, rather than speaking of the âruptureâ that new communication technologies are commonly held to represent (Appadurai 1996), Mattelart (2009) argues it is more accurate to describe todayâs long-distance communication technologies as forming a continuity with the past, encompassing letters, phone calls, tape recordings, and video messages. Certainly, among my respondents, letters and tape-recorded messages were the most popular means of communicating with family up until the 1990s. One or two public call"

More importantly, âthe right to leave and the right to enter a country are not symmetrically protectedâ (Cornelisse 2010: 175). This principle of territorial sovereignty in international law has, however, been seriously undermined as different legal systems and social normative structures, both national and international, coexist within nation-states, leading to theoretical and actual clashes that have the potential to either limit or advance a personâs social protection."
381,604,0.983,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Federal Role and Policy As the 10th Amendment to the Constitution implies, the basic responsibilities and practices of delivering education are left to the states and districts. And, as the 14th Amendment provides, the federal government has a responsibility to protect and support when needed those who require assistance to receive equal opportunity. Following from these constitutional provisions, a simple test for suggesting what the federal government shouldâand should notâdo in K-12 education is to apply two criteria: â¢ Does the activity protect or directly support the U.S. constitutional and legislated rights of schoolchildren to receive equal opportunity to a high quality education? â¢ Does the activity apply to the entire nation and is it more efficiently and effectively delivered by the federal government than it would be by states and districts? Implementing these criteria would reduce the current portfolio of the U.S. Department of Education and clarify its role around a more highly focused set of responsibilities. The reasons for such a reduction include the great diversity of U.S. students and school environments; the complexity of effective teaching and school management; and the all too real danger of ideology, politics, and regulatory zeal overriding useful evidence within administrations and the Congress. We suggest instead a federal role that works to ensure equity and provides resources but eschews the one-size-fits-all prescription of education practice to states, districts, and schools. This view of the federal role calls for increasing the resources and capacities for support of the programs and policies that directly influence equal educational opportunity. The activities of our proposed new role may be organized into four groups: protecting and supporting the rights of all students to equal educational opportunity; ensuring equal opportunity for specific groups of students protected under federal law; providing financial resources to equalize educational opportunity for all"
10,254,0.983,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"Regarding instruments, the current existing instruments addressing droughts have not been developed within a strategic approach. The instruments were developed very independently for each of the different relevant areas. Because only a limited number of instruments relevant for drought purposes are in place, in general the instruments do not overlap. Smaller problems exist, e.g. between groundwater recharge and rainwater storage, which should be taken into consideration for new instruments. Over the past years, the topic of water scarcity and droughts has been integrated in several strategy papers and the Flemish vision on water. However, the future development of these issues could be helped by a more strategic approach. Further activities for a coherent approach in water management in general, can be seen in the synchronization of the planning period of sub-basin RBMPs (and basin RBMPs. Also the integration of drought measures in the RBMPs (from 2015) shows a tendency to a harmonized approach of developing and implementing drought measures with other water management measures. The responsibilities for water scarcity and droughts are unclear or not assigned in many organizations and levels, including the Flemish regional level. Within in VMM, responsibilities are associated with different departments and therefore are very fragmented. This fragmentation leads to own individual discussions with the ânormallyâ involved institutions and levels. A coherent connection between the different discussions and approaches is not realized in the most involved organizations. Because the issue is not high on the agenda, there are as yet no competence conflicts between the different actors."

Certain implementation barriers such as technical knowledge gaps, missing internal collaboration links between different municipality departments (e.g., urban greening and water) and a current absence of strong communication strategies towards citizens were also identified at the EUGIC conference. A growing number of small to mega scale cities in Europe and beyond have been already setting out their green infrastructure strategies, followed by legislation processes and funding in regards to green roof and walls, e.g., the city of Hamburg (BehÃ¶rde fÃ¼r Umwelt und Energie 2015). Some cities are already by far advanced and could be recognized as frontrunners, e.g., Green Capital award winning VictoriaGasteiz in Spain. A clear knowledge gap and barrier to successfully mainstreaming of green infrastructure was identified in quantitative and qualitative, integrated short- and long term monitoring data of all considerable economic, ecologic and societal benefits and disservices of strategic larger scale nature-based solution implementation in Europe. The European Commission has therefore launched a rich bundle of Horizon 2020 calls, especially call SCC-02-2016-2017 demonstrating innovative nature-based solutions in cities, fostering demonstration and implementation actions, is expected to create a significant impact on implementation, research and communication. On the other hand, the way cities will approach the challenge are context-specific: starting by recognising international frameworks and targets (IEEP 2011), followed by national specific strategies/governance plans (Buijs et al. 2016) complemented by an analysis of local target challenge areas resulting in specific implementation plans and monitoring systems (Madueira et al. 2011) and creation of a common knowledge base on green infrastructure existing stock and potentials of implementation in certain built structures (e.g., Urban Green Stock and potential Cadastre of the City of Vienna1)."
176,66,0.983,Russia'S Turn To The East : Domestic Policymaking and Regional Cooperation,"Implementation of Russiaâs regional policy has been hampered by sluggish economic performance and by the attempts of Western powers to reprimand Russia, politically and economically. Unsurprisingly, the recent fall in GDP led to a reduction in the federal governmentâs capacities for investing in regional development. In November 2016, substantial funding cuts to the federal targeted programme for the socioeconomic development of the Far East and Baikal region were announced (Primamedia. ru 2016c, 2017a). Besides budget constraints, another reason for reducing the funding to the Far East has been the alleged low effectiveness of programme implementation. Both the Ministry of Finance and the State Duma Committee on Regional Policy and the Problems of the North and the Far East have assessed the effectiveness of implementation of this state programme as unsatisfactory (Primamedia.ru 2016c). Key causes for this lack of progress are the lack of coordination among various branches of the government and the new institutions they have set up, problems of corruption and an unsatisfactory investment climate. Instead of deregulation, bureaucracy has proliferated. New entities for managing development projects are established, spending project budgets on developing new governance methods, performance indicators and the likeâwithout bearing any responsibility for the effectiveness of the end product. High levels of corruption still plague major government projects in Primorye. At present, the development forecast for Primorskii Krai can hardly be called optimistic. However, thanks to the implementation of several projects, some moderate growth can be expected. Moreover, if Moscow will continue to keep the Far Eastern periphery in focus, that should help to prevent further economic and demographic decline. One can also hope for greater interest from Russian and foreign entrepreneurs in the new mechanisms that have been introduced to stimulate socioeconomic development. If the federal and regional authorities can work together and coordinate their efforts, and if the authorities and business can cooperate, the goal of improving the investment attractiveness of Primorye may be achieved. Growth centres, such as the ASEZs, the Free Port of Vladivostok and international transport corridors, have already been established, but much work remains to be done to ensure that these mechanisms will live up to expectations. In sum, there remains a substantial discrepancy between the declarations of making Primorskii Krai the frontrunner in Russiaâs âturn to the Eastâ and actual achievements."

Fruitful engagement is also greatly promoted by simply having more time for change agents and communities to interact and make the correct decisions. Time constraints are ultimately imposed by the short-term funding cycles that characterize most development projects today."
61,318,0.983,Mergers and Alliances in Higher Education : international Practice and Emerging Opportunities,"a new higher education landscape. In 1997, however, the state structure responsible for higher education was still in its infancy and its institutional capacity was yet to be fully developed. Between 1997 and 2001 there was strong contestation between the state, the national interest groups representing universities and technikons, and individual higher education institutions around institutional restructuring and the creation of a new higher education landscape. The struggles were manifested in the documents and utterances of different actors, and during meetings between the minister and his officials and individual institutions and the representative bodies of institutions, and also found expression in the public media. This revealed the fragility of the White Paper 3 consensus in so far as specific goals were concerned and the principal and particular criteria, processes and strategies that were to be deployed to achieve policy goals. Some actors, like the South African University Vice-Chancellors Association, wanted institutional restructuring to be left to voluntary actions on the part of higher education institutions themselves. Some historically advantaged white universities wanted a new landscape to emerge as an outcome of market forces; indeed, after 1994 some of their actions led to the higher education terrain taking on a âDarwinianâ character, with a reinforcing of historical and racialised patterns of institutional advantage and disadvantage. Certain initiatives of historically white contact institutions, such as the offering of academic programmes through distance learning, while professed to be in support of expanding provision gave the impression of seeking to maintain largely white student bodies and white privilege. Some black institutions were focused solely on institutional redress and silent on the critical question of redress to create what kind of institution. Some technikons claimed to be disadvantaged because they had been confined to diploma and certificate programmes as opposed to degree programmes and clamoured for a different development trajectory. Left unchecked, these developments had the danger of solidifying a âfree for allâ higher education âsystemâ characterised by the supremacy of unacceptable vested institutional interests and even greater fragmentation and incoherence, institutional inequalities and inefficient and ineffective utilisation of resources. The Ministry was well aware of this danger. It had noted that it wanted to âavoid [. . .] a laissez-faire proliferation of higher education programmes by an increasing range of providers, without benefit of a planning framework and without adequate safeguards to ensure the quality of provisionâ (Department of Education 1997). It understood that âthis would almost certainly result in the unplanned blurring of institutional roles and functions, and, given resource constraints, a strong tendency to over-provide low-cost programmes in low-priority curriculum areasâ (Department of Education 1997). To the extent that significant and diverse social and institutional interests were not effectively mediated, there was the danger of policy paralysis and reproduction of the status quo. In the face of the strength of particular institutional interests, which made substantive consensus difficult, the role of the state began to predominate and there was acceleration towards substantive policy development of a distributive, redistributive and material nature. Concomitantly, and unfortunately, self-imposed austerity measures introduced by the new government to manage state debt and spending and the concomitant inadequacy of public"

Thus the law now recognizes the risk of rape in the workplace but is still reluctant to recognize labour abuse. Without legal recognition of their presence, female domestic migrant workers are vulnerable to violations of rights committed by the staff of recruiting agencies, trainers, employers, or other actors in the migration business. The protection they may receive overseas by the representatives of their government is derived from their citizenship and not necessarily from their being recognized as a full member of the Indonesian overseas workforce. Furthermore, there is a consensus among scholars and civil society organizations in Indonesia that Law No. 39, 2004 is weak on protection. Despite a number of additional Ministerial Decrees and central government regulations, the overall assessment is that the law puts far too much emphasis on work placement and pays insufficient attention to protection measures within Indonesiaâs territory and abroad. Among the 109 articles and sixteen chapters, there are only eight articles (Articles 77 to 84) that regulate protection, while the rest deal with the mechanisms for the placement of migrant workers. The articles on protection do not codify the specific rights for which an Indonesian migrant worker can enjoy legal protection, and do not comprehensively govern protection in the migration process across all stages. Article 76 states that private recruiting agencies can charge the following costs: processing identity documents; health and psychological tests; job training and certificates; others. The category âothersâ is spelled out in Decree No. PER.14/MEN/X/2010 and covers: visas; food and accommodation during training; airfare; airport tax; local transport to the training centre; insurance premium; and agency service fees. Article 77 defines protection in phases: pre-placement, placement, and post-placement, and the rest of the provisions define placement in terms of the specific period during which the worker is deployed overseas. Article 82 assigns private human resources companies to be in charge of recruitment and training; these are to be known as private recruitment agencies. The regulations covering education and training in the predeparture phase (Article 42, sub-point 1) demonstrate the seriousness of the government in preparing the applicants for labour export programmes with knowledge of the law and an understanding of their rights in line with the requirements of their jobs in the destination country.

277,519,0.983,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"16.2 Migrant Integration: Key Issues Time and timing are always important when studying problem structures in particular policy areas. The debate about migrant integration is linked to the broader debate about EU immigration and asylum policy that was given significant impetus in the 1980s and 1990s by three fundamentally important events in this history of European integration. The first was the creation of the Schengen Area in 1985 by a smaller, vanguard group of member states (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). The aim was to move more quickly to the attainment of free movement objectives by creating an area within which people would be able to move freely with âcompensatingâ internal security measures. As of 2011, Ireland the UK remained outside Schengen while non-EU members Iceland and Norway participated as observers. Schengen does not deal with migrant integration, but does play a role in shaping the EUâs institutional setting. Immigration and asylum became issues that were largely populated by officials from interior ministries and internal security agencies. The relevant frame here was the security setting within which a rights-based conceptualisation of the economically mobile citizen existed. The second key event was the Single European Act (SEA) of 1986, which had as its core objective the creation of an internal market for all member states which would be an area without internal frontiers within which the free movement of people, services, goods and capital would be assured. The SEA marked a progressive extension of earlier market-based liberalisation that had occurred on the basis of the Treaty of Rome and had led to the creation of the Common Market in the 1960s.

Furthermore, we introduced the concept of reverse innovation, in which innovations from emerging nations are rolled out to global markets. Because of the vastly different business environments between emerging nations and a global companyâs home nation, global companies often cannot respond by just improving products originally made for the home nation for local markets. In these cases, it is necessary to develop products with a completely new mindset using a team focused on the unique qualities of the local subsidiary. Commitments from the top management for these projects, and resources and organizations to bridge the gap between both countries are necessary to incorporate local innovations into corporate-wide activities. Finally, we must comment on topics not raised in this chapter with regard to R&D internationalization. First, we need to address the question of how reporting lines in overseas facilities should be structured. As shown in this chapter, it is easier to discuss âresearchâ and âdevelopmentâ separately. âResearchâ in overseas facilities is often a part of home countryâs corporate research groups or R&D centers, whereas âdevelopmentâ is often performed within the division of each product line. However, there are recent movements to strengthen the connections between âresearchâ and âdevelopment.â For example, many divisions outsource certain projects to corporate research groups, and researchers that conducted basic research in the firmâs research center are transplanted to development groups to manage projects for specific products and services. In these cases, the reporting lines of research centers and operating divisions in overseas research organizations can become entangled, creating the risk of decreased efficiency. In these instances, companies must consider on a project-by-project basis whether the technology or region axis is more important and structure reporting accordingly. For example, for projects that have a common technology platform, it is effective to work under the home countryâs research group; for projects that involve regional business development, it is effective to work under the regional headquarter. Of course, both sides must share information, but matrix organizations with multiple reporting lines often do not work well. In addition, as a practical matter for overseas R&D management, the management of technical information is important. The importance of this issue differs greatly between research and development groups. Research groups often conduct"

Thousands of people have found employment and residence in Costa Rica, providing services to Costa Rican citizens; for example, many Costa Ricans can work at paid jobs because a Nicaraguan is caring for their children or for older adults. Some economic activities, such as construction, export agriculture, private security, and of course paid domestic work structurally depend on the participation of Nicaraguans. Although, as Benhabib (2004: 93) notes, âpeoples are radically and not merely episodically interdependentâ, she emphasizes that âcitizenry and the practices of political membership are the rituals through which the nation spatially reproduces itself. The control of territorial borders, which is coeval with the sovereignty of the modern nation state, seeks to ensure the purity of the nation in time through the policing of its contacts and interactions in spaceâ (Benhabib 2004: 18). For normative-cum-transformative work, rather than suggesting new totalities Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2009: 125) favours the work of âtranslationâ, which he specifies as âthe procedure that permits the creation of reciprocal intelligibility among the experiences of the world, both the available and the possible, revealed by the sociology of absences and the sociology of emergencesâ (de Sousa Santos 2009: 136). Translation involves links between various kinds of knowledge, agents, and social practices and is particularly necessary in the search for links between perspectives of a more analytical kind and those more focused on regulatory approaches. The importance of this link acquires more relevance if one recognizes, as Jonathan Rutherford (2007: 19) has noted, that the predominating theories that emphasize the de- and reconstruction of social identities, generally related to post-structuralism, have lacked the ethical references to generate new, more egalitarian social relations than the ones they seek to deconstruct. The emphasis on the possibility of reconstruction has not been accompanied by a similar impetus in terms of articulating emerging worlds. Translation also facilitates the configuration of âcontact zonesâ (Sandoval 2009b) between kinds of knowledge, perspectives, and actors who do not frequently encounter each other. Law, says de Sousa Santos (2010: 12), âcan be emancipating when it is used counter-hegemonicallyâ. In other words, the lonely academic critique or the communications from organi-"

Furthermore, despite research over the past decade, e.g., the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme in West Africa (FAO IDAF; e.g., Fabio et al. 2003), much research remains to understand their livelihoods and food security strategies as professional groups, households, and individuals. In addition, development research in Africa has a tragic history of narrowly focusing on technical methods whose use terminates with the end of each project and never become integrated into the policy and practice of society (Raynaut 1997; Batterbury and Warren 2001).

With Convention 181 on Private Employment Agencies (1997), the ILO definitely departed from this earlier concern and paved the way for private sector involvement in matching demand and supply in transnational labour markets. This approach has received broad support from influential global players such as the World Bank (e.g. World Bank 2006). The governments of Lao PDR and Thailand have not ratified any of the ILO conventions mentioned above, yet employment agencies are firmly situated in the newly emerging Lao migration regime. The MoU on Employment Cooperation assigns an important role to âcompetent authoritiesâ in the management of migration. Later policy documents reveal these âcompetent authoritiesâ as migration employment agencies.13"

They have coined the concept of the âdemocratic deficitâ to describe this state of affairs.21 While the EU has attracted most attention, analysts have extended the critique to other international organisations or the system of global governance in general. Favourite targets for diagnosing a democratic deficit and demanding institutional reform are the global financial institutions,22 the United Nations23 and other intergovernmental institutions or processes.24 But the demand for more democracy does not stop with intergovernmental institutions. Rather, many scholars and political analysts extend it to all organisations contributing to global governance.25 The Commission on Global Governance, a panel of eminent persons initiated by Willy Brandt, recognises NGOs, citizensâ movements, transnational corporations and capital markets along with intergovernmental institutions and processes as part of the system of global governance. In its influential, but controversial report âOur Global Neighbourhoodâ it demands that adequate governance mechanisms [â¦] must be more inclusive and participatory â that is, more democratic â than in the past. [â¦] This vision of global governance can only flourish, however, if it is based on a strong commitment to principles of equity and democracy grounded in civil society. (Commission on Global Governance, 1995, Chapter 1) This amounts to a general demand for democracy or democratic accountability for all influential institutions. Echoing Peter Spiroâs comment quoted above, Held and Koenig-Archibugi express this in a very concise way: âthere is agreement among democrats that wherever power is exercised there should be mechanisms of accountabilityâ (Held and Koenig-Archibugi, 2004, p. 125). Faced with the erosion of national autonomy and the increasing influence of international institutions, there appears to be a rough consensus that more democracy is needed.26 How this is to be achieved in practice, however, is highly controversial. It would be beyond the scope of this book to portray even just the major proposals in detail or to analyse their advantages and criticisms. The following paragraphs therefore only sketch some of the main approaches. What is important is that they all advocate the creation of stronger accountability, though they have very different mechanisms in mind. One possibility for safeguarding democracy is to limit the influence of global forces and to reassert national autonomy. Some leading thinkers doubt that intergovernmental institutions â let alone transnational corporations, NGOs or partnerships â can ever be democratic. Robert Dahl, for example, the most respected and vocal sceptic in this regard, doubts that citizens can ever exercise effective control over international organisations. Nevertheless he acknowledges that international institutions can be"

To identify and explore the barriers and bridges to that integration, a range of social and systems sciences were applied to examine the effectiveness of ârepublican,â e.g., national, based on the French system, and traditional forms of governance and the potential to harmonize them. In addition, exercises in scenario development allowed managers and planners to explore potential paths of policy development. Finally, conceptual modeling afforded a systems analysis of the ecological, economic, and social factors that can individually or by interaction create opportunities or barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries management. The results were used to make recommendations for ï¬sh and water policies, in education (universities and governmental agricultural professional schools), and will have practical relevance for food security and health care (Melcher et al. 2013; Ouedraogo et al. 2014; Sendzimir et al. 2015). This chapter pursues the central question of the SUSFISH project, e.g., what is the long-term potential to establish sustainable ï¬sheries and aquatic ecosystems on which they depend in BF? SUSFISH embraced this question as a challenge wider than simply transferring the technical means to monitor ï¬sheries but in instilling and awakening a culture of healthy ï¬sheries that is broadly supported across Burkinabe society as well as in government policy. We begin by describing the scientiï¬c advances that the project used in application to establish bioindicators and monitoring methods as the technical base of ï¬sheries management. We then consider the many factors, biophysical as well as economic, political, and cultural, which potentially can inï¬uence the trajectory of Burkinabe ï¬sheries toward sustainability.

In some countries there has been a marked decline in voters exercising their hard earned right to vote in local, national, and in the European Union, international elections. ICTs are increasingly being seen as an essential way of bridging the divide between the governors and the governed.

334,395,0.983,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"In reaction to the massive influx of so-called guest workers coming from predominantly Southern European countries, a minority of West Germans complained about the presence of these âforeignersâ1. There were also some isolated acts of aggression. However, this did not result in coherent and organized collective xenophobic activities (Bundesanstalt fÃ¼r Arbeit 1967; KÃ¶rner and Spiess 1982). Despite the guest worker immigration program officially ending in 1973, the number of âforeignersâ living in West Germany has continued to increase until today. In part, this was due to guest workers who not only decided to stay, but also brought their family members to Germany. In later periods, legalized work force mobility within the EU as well as several refugee movements contributed to rising numbers of âforeignersâ in (West) Germany. According to official statistics, in 2014 about one fifth of the population in Germany had a migration background. Among this fifth, two thirds are first generation immigrants and the rest are second and third generation immigrants. Representative surveys undertaken from the 1950s to the present day indicate that the proportion of Germans who hold right-wing or right-radical worldviews and, often connected to this, those that express xenophobic sentiments, has changed little over time. Generally speaking, right-wing attitudes are firmly anchored in parts of the German population (StÃ¶ss 2010; Heitmeyer 2011). Depending on the survey instruments, precise wording and timing, between 15 and 25% of the adult population fall into this category. These people provide the central resource pool and sounding board for decidedly right-wing organizers and agitators and a solid base for xenophobia. In addition, xenophobic ideas also resonate in other strata of the population, including people who place themselves in the middle and even the left section of the political spectrum (Zick and Klein 2014; Decker and BrÃ¤hler 2016; Decker et al. 2016). People holding certain ideas and attitudes do not necessarily turn those beliefs into practice. Rather, beliefs can form a potential for action resulting from previous or ongoing processes of consensus mobilization (Klandermans 2013). Occasionally, this potential is more targeted in attempts of action mobilization. The extent to which people can be activated, or put differently, the extent to which they are willing to take action, depends on many factors, both internal and external to the networks and movements under study. Action mobilization, ranging from: public speeches or symbolic statements, to collective rallies in the streets or to violent attacks, does not occur randomly but rather manifests itself in waves. Quite often, such waves are strengthened or triggered by catalytic processes, e.g. perceptions of crisis, threat, vulnerability, injustice and so forth (Koopmans 2004). It has been argued that the rise of xenophobic activities in Germany was encouraged by the increase of âforeignersâ in certain time periods. One crucial period began in the late 1980s. Apart from the many immigrants with German roots coming from the Soviet"

We emphasise the practicalities of eating and drinking as social processes, undertaken in households and communities, besides the more abstract approaches to food and water taken by food scientists or hydrologists. Without underestimating the power of agri-food corporations and global trade agreements in shaping contemporary food systems, we emphasise the agency of ordinary people in meeting the daily challenges of âfeeding the familyâ (De Vault 1991). We also focus on the challenges involved in managing water which enables food to be grown, for families to have their right to water met for drinking, cooking, sanitation and survival needs, and for societies to access water that enables them to flourish and develop. As with the other publications in this series, we emphasise the links between bio-physical and socio-cultural processes, and the connections between different geographical scales, from the most local decisions taken at household level to the (Footnote 5 continued) treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966.

224,126,0.983,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"While the land use system on Bellona may be seen to examplify a âclose to autonomous village situationâ in the Boserupian heurisitc rhetoric because of its immediate appearance as a traditional shifting cultivation system, the island specific population-land use nexus and the classical Boserupean trajectory of intensification have been bypassed. The apparent status quo situation of the land use strategies can be explained by the important cultural value embedded in the traditional agricultural practices. Overall, the area under cultivation in Bellona since 1966 has remained remarkably unchanged despite the significantly increasing population. The land use pattern has also remained fairly constant although a few new crops have emerged in âwaves of changeâ (e.g. coconut palms making way for more permanent gardens of mainly sweet potato and/or watermelon). The production techniques as well as technology have remained unchanged as a traditional shifting cultivation system in the absence of affordable inputs such as agro-chemical fertilizer for more intensive practices, in spite of the fact that the population pressure has grown considerably. Changes in economic and human resources in Bellona have, however, also made living conditions and food provision challenges very different, mainly as a result of income opportunities occurring from migration, remittances, aid and increasing bureaucracy. Faced with scarce land resources and opportunities found off the island, the Bellonese have under the new circumstances been able to generate alternative livelihoods to subsistence agriculture, for example, through the mobility of family members. The value the Bellonese give to tradition and culture is another important part of the explanation of the land use stability. Many inhabitants consider traditional agriculture to be an important part of their daily life, beyond rational assessment criteria. Yam gardens are, for example, attributed great importance for cultural identity; they help maintain the social institutions that continue to provide an important social safety net (embedded in various collective labour relations and the sharing of harvests among kin). Alongside the seeming continuation or status quo of the land use pattern, a number of changes have occurred, some closely linked to humanâland relations and others to changes in socioeconomic conditions. Notably, the food producing area per person in 2006 has decreased by one third compared to 1966. Apparently the influence of the âmodern way of lifeâ, particularly on young migrants returning after completing their education or (un)successfully pursuing job opportunities has reduced the inclination for âhard workâ in the traditional gardens among the younger generations. Within the last decade, eight new shops have opened on the island, functioning as storage depots for imported foodstuffs and other goods. This indicates that people do have money to spend and that the availability of âmodernâ food on the island has increased. The overall portfolio of livelihood strategies observed has become much more diversified. Although our study has shown clear signs of the developments suggested by classic scholarship on the populationâagricultural change nexus, it also illustrates how land use practices are closely linked to societal institutions and their ability to adapt to changing socioeconomic conditions. Despite the pressures on land resources"
334,456,0.983,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"By contrast to most social movement activities, which aim at social change and policy reform, the cases analyzed here include the rather explicit implementation claim of preventing the opening of an accommodation center. The measurement of success of this very specific claim is feasible and its outcome traceable. First of all, our research underlines a high rate of successful protest outcomes. This finding derives from the investigation of three outcome variables: first, the prevention of a specific facility (success); second, a reduction of the occupancy and/or a shift to a smaller building (partial success); or third, the opening of the accommodation center (no success). The first outcome, prevention, was achieved in one third of the protest cases analyzed. In another third of the cases, the original proposal was prevented at least to some extentâthe opening of the facility ultimately took place, but the pressure exerted by the protest altered the original proposal so that the center was moved to a seemingly more âappropriateâ building, or a reduction of the occupancy was obtained. In another third of the cases, protest had no impact on the implementation and it was realized as envisaged. Taking the protest development into account, we observed that in the cases in which the centers were ultimately opened, protest activities ended as soon as refugees moved into the building. Policy and political responses are much more difficult to identify than clear-cut implementation claims. In Austria, at least two institutional and organizational responses have to be mentioned: (1) On the political level, the Austrian Association of Municipalities (Gemeindebund) engaged in measures to prevent the sort of conflicts discussed above, and provided assistance on dealing with new community members. The mayors of municipalities accommodating asylum seekers established networks and organized meetings to strengthen their positions in the field of asylum policies. (2) On the level of policy reform, the federal government reacted to intensified protest activities with measures aimed at running facilities without the support of the provinces or the municipalities. A consequence of protest was the adoption of the Accommodation and Distribution of Aliens in Need of Aid and Protection Act (Durchgriffsrecht des Bundes) and the implementation of a so-called municipal quota. This law reform aims at improving the coordination of the dispersal of asylum seekers between the federal government and the provinces (and thus also the municipalities) and allows the Ministry of the Interior to establish reception facilities in municipalities which did not fulfill the reception quota of 1.5%. This proposition can also be enforced against the declared will of the municipalities."
284,200,0.983,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Introduction Mining activity has undeniable environmental impacts due to the nature of its operations, processing plants and foundries. Mining companies proclaim their environmental responsibility by implementing policies that limit environmental risk and impact, while also applying new technologies and production processes that are more respectful of the environment. The degree of efï¬cacy of these sustainability measures and the degree to which companies voluntarily ensure environmental care cannot belie the fact that â no matter what â mining activity has and will always have environmental impacts. There are two major points of view about the subject, according to Whitmore (2006). On the one hand, there are the views of companies â that is to say, the actors who control the mining bulldozers and claim to ensure that everything goes well and that mining is, or can be, sustainable. On the other hand, there are the views of those who are affected by mining activity, such as the communities, peasants and indigenous peoples who are displaced without proper consultation, who suffer illnesses, and whose lifestyles, health and environment are impacted. This chapter will not address the mining problem from the conventional perspective of whether or not mining is sustainable. The majority of the socioenvironmental conï¬icts that arise around mining are focused on this problem.1 We refer to the fact that mining consumes large quantities of water and energy and is one of the most widespread productive activities.

Movements of people were seen by media as carrying negative consequences not only for the migrants themselves, but for other actors too. For example, European states were represented as legitimately perceiving their coasts as âinvadedâ and facing resentment towards migrants by their populations, widely supportive of anti-immigration stances (AJ 4; NYT 23; TG 5-8). The rightness of such positions was then justified by the idea that migrants, especially sub-Saharans, are untrustworthy and dangerous subjects for Europe (AJ 3; NYT 2-3). The media suggestion was that most, by entering Libya illegally, had proven themselves to be disrespectful of rules. Further, their desperate condition was seen as a factor that might cause further problems to European countries, as desperation leads to desperate and irrational behaviours (NYT 2-3). In addition, Tunisia and Egypt were other actors presented in some of the articles analysed as facing the problems of migratory movements. Notwithstanding their proven goodwill in helping migrants, the two North African states had to face exasperation from their own citizens for the problems caused by sub-Saharans in refugee camps who âstupidly protestedâ about their situation without appreciating the efforts made by those countries (TG 6). As a consequence, the needs for border control, refugee camps, and organized management of migratory movements were implicitly presented as necessary and appropriate solutions for avoiding additional problems in destination countries and for migrants themselves (AJ 3-4; NYT 3-7; TG 6). From these understandings of the conflict and migration crises, the humanitarian intervention was established by media as a necessity in order to save lives from the irrational violence of Gaddafiâs forces. The international community was the actor charged with the responsibility of preventing fighting from escalating and alleviating suffering (AJ 1-2-5-6-7-8; NYT 1-2-34-7; TG 1-3-5-7). However, even if the term âinternational communityâ conventionally refers to the community of world states and UN organizations as supposedly super partes actors, in media it more often indicates just Western states and certain international agencies as high moral subjects committed to protect Others, beyond the principle of sovereignty (AJ 1-8; NYT 1-2; TG 1-2). Such selective use of the term establishes a hierarchy in which states like Egypt or Tunisia, though actively engaged in the organization of human-"

They participate either because they trust the NGO to decide on their behalf or because they want to avoid being perceived as opposing an organization that provides them with needed services. Similarly, international NGOs hold perceived power by providing essential services and distributing needed supplies, especially during emergencies. Universities can acquire such power, even unintentionally, not only from the prestige and status that educational institutions generally enjoy, but also from the potential benefits that research projects bring to the camps. Intentional or not, exercising such power can raise unanticipated problems for the research enterprise. To protect research participants, some national and international commissions have published guidance documents about equitable distribution of benefits and respect for autonomy, beneficence, and social justice. These documents include the Nuremberg Code (1947), the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1964), The Belmont Report (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 1979), and the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Science 2002). Even though these international guidelines acknowledge the need to consider culture and community, they lack adequate guidance for community-based public health research (Racher 2007; Bledsoe and Hopson 2009). In addition, these guidelines are difficult to apply in nonbiomedical research contexts in community settings. This difficulty could be attributed to applying guidelines without first considering local contexts (Dawson and Kass 2005; Benatar 2002; Chilisa 2009). Many community-oriented practitioners find the principles too limiting to guide public health research ethics in community settings and recommend incorporating broader conceptions of respect, trust, inclusion, diversity, participation, empowerment, and advocacy (Racher 2007; Bledsoe and Hopson 2009). Biomedical guidelines often clash with community interactions, especially in the nonindustrialized world (Bledsoe and Hopson 2009; Matsumoto and Jones 2009; Chilisa 2009). One such clash occurs between individual-oriented societies and more collectivist societies that view personhood and individual decision making through the lens of a personâs relation to society (Marshall and Baten 2003). Another clash occurs between the artificially impersonal character of research environments and the centrality of relationships and partnerships in communities. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs), for example, require control of all possible confounders, a nearly impossible standard to achieve in close-knit and dense community settings (Makhoul et al. 2013). Implementing ethical guidelines in the context of power dynamics (Marshall and Baten 2004), like the pronounced power that males wield over females in patriarchal societies, can instigate numerous clashes. In communities like refugee camps that offer few economic or career opportunities, the perceived power that NGOs and, even more so, academic institutions wield is a force that must be taken into account. In such restricted settings, the power dynamics between researchers and research subjects can take on a subtle coercive character. These same tensions, challenges, and dynamics will emerge in any efforts to obtain informed consent to participate in research. The emergence may stem from"

98,186,0.983,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","The previous chapter shows that the TSE organizations and volunteers are a significant economic sector of activity in Europe. In this chapter, we have assessed the available evidence about the contribution of this TSE sector to the socioeconomic development and democratic governance of European societies through systematic reviews of research and new analyses of data. This indicates that the impact of the TSE sector is significant albeit difficult to assess empirically. This is because the activities of organizations and volunteers can have impacts in different social domains and on different levels, from individuals to local communities and society in general, and the research front is less advanced in some of these areas than others are. However, there is no support for unconditional and general claims about the third sectorâs contribution to improvement of health, well-being, innovation, social capital, empowerment or economic development. There is a potential for individual benefits of membership or volunteering in TSOs. However, these positive impacts are not equally accessible or do not spread among the population.

In the case of Malawi, consider the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) and the Agriculture Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp) as important policy programs (Government of Malawi 2006, The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Republic of Malawi 2010). Table 1 describes which policy interests evolve in society that drive political behavior according to these two major policy documents. Interests are listed in descending order of average interest over interviewed organizations. Further, Table 1 lists common interests and conflicting positions that occur within one specific dimension of the state of the world. While common interests will drive political homophily and thereby communication, conflicting positions increase the potential for policy deadlocks but allow also for policy learning. Consider, for example, the welfare of smallholders. Actors might be equally interested in reducing hunger and malnutrition but have different experiences and information about the political strategy to reach their common aim. One actor might favor input subsidies to increase maize yields, the other one might consider budget spending on extension services as a more efficient policy strategy. Information exchange between these two actors can help to choose a strategy that best fits their common interests.

Within those regulations lies a subordinate set aimed at curtailing foreign funding oriented toward changes in individual rights, freedom of speech, and political engagement. The governments in question find this outside involvement an infringement of authority, and they have little or no interest in permitting foreign organizations to meddle with official aims. The second category includes policies aimed at increasing local philanthropy, particularly when it is in line with the governmentâs agenda, and the third set is of laws endeavoring to create more transparency and accountability. On this last count, many governments are aware that if the trust deficit can be mitigated, increased local giving could result. This chapter examines the policies governing civil society in each of these three categories. The definition of civil society is difficult to pin down. In fact, in 2001, the BBC stated, âThe paradox about civil society is that it covers a vast range of activitiesâyet itâs very hard to define.â In an attempt to address this difficulty, the BBC produced a 12-part series called What Is Civil Society?1 Despite this noble effort, the definition still evades us, although we can all agree that facets, goals, and operating norms of civil society differ across cultural contexts. The details give context to the current legal changes in Asia. Civil society is often thought of as the voice and actions of the people, instead of that of companies and of the government. In the Western context, it is considered a basic tenet of a pluralistic society. While not necessarily the case, the term is often used as a contrarian voice against the government and the private sector. Civil society tends to focus on human rights and social justice. Civic engagement is a different story. Civic engagement is the way in which ordinary people can participate in helping their communities and countries, and the term does not carry an antagonistic connotation. Although civic engagement can utilize both political and non-political processes, it is not about pluralism as an endgame but of the human tendency to help one another. But the distinction can become complex. Many efforts start off as engagement only to become advocacy, and vice-versa. It often becomes clear to those trying to solve a problem that systemic change must include the government, and sometimes that implies the government must also change. Over the past decade, we can see a trend in Asia to channel energy into civic engagement while trying, at times with great conviction, to curtail the growth of civil society.

The aim of the proposed Nature Protection Planning project is to make a detailed assessment of the nature and ecological status through the Jordan Valley, including the nature areas designated earlier by the Israeli Military Authorities in the West Bank, and will lead to deï¬ning plans and policies for nature preservation and protection areas, including grazing lands and parks, under Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli Law, and development of ecological protection plans beyond. The aim of obtaining international accreditation for the Jordan Valley with international organizations such as UNESCO World Heritage, Ramsar and IUCN Protected Areas is to draw substantially more international attention to the Jordan Valley and to create related ecological protection and economic growth opportunities. However, such accreditation will likely depend on a ï¬nal peace settlement between Israel and Palestine, and appropriate integrated management structures for the valley. The purpose of the regional co-ordination intervention is setting up a regional coordination structure, or Steering Committee, among key Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian governmental stakeholders for the implementation of the proposed national and regional interventions in the Jordan Valley with regards to the Ecology. The objective is that this Steering Committee will eventually be embedded in the structures of the overall River Basin Organization for the Jordan Valley (ref. intervention IC01 REG Jordan River Basin Organization). The aim of the Jordan River Ecological Restoration Project in Israel is to restore the ecology of the Jordan River Section between Sea of Galilee to Naharayim (fully located"

While an institutional approach to sustainability is yet to evolve, individual motivation is high. Close to 80% of industry respondents witnessed a growing awareness among senior managers concerning climate change or environment-related jobs, while only 50% agreed to integrate jobs related to dealing with climate change into the work environment. Shortage of Skilled Workers is Impacting Businesses Nearly 60% of respondents from the energy sector conï¬rmed that they are facing a shortage of skilled workers in energy-efï¬cient construction and retroï¬tting, renewable energy, energy efï¬ciency, and environmental services, thereby impeding the transition toward green growth. Rural electriï¬cation programs are suffering because of a lack of skilled workers. The reasons for these shortages include a scarcity of scientists and engineers, the poor reputation and limited attractiveness of certain sectors such as waste management, and the limited number of well-qualiï¬ed and high-quality teachers and trainers in environmental services. Corporate and Social Responsibility Mandates and Import-Export Requirements are Key Drivers to Develop Green Jobs and Green Skills The hospitality industry appears to be most active in adopting sustainable practices in its businesses, whereas the transport and logistics sector leads in employing new workers for climate change. Corporate and social responsibility (CSR), import-export requirements, and government legislation seem to be the most important drivers for developing new green jobs and skills. While the demands for green skills in traditional industry arise mostly out of compliance with regulations, demands in new industries arise out of the resource crunch and global sustainability arrangements such as renewable energy. While the scope of green jobs may be limited, the scope of green skills in all jobs is unlimited. There is a greater emphasis on the requirements of hybrid skills (generic plus green) that top-up existing skills sets. IndustryâTVET Linkages are Weak and Cosmetic The low levels of engagement between industry and TVET institutions continue to deter the improvement of courses and development of industry-relevant curricula. On average, only 18% of industry respondents provide course feedback to the TVET institutes, while TVET providers appear to be unsure about their programs with respect to green skills content. Green topics are largely excluded from the skills development curriculum. Only 50% of TVET providers have âshades of greenâ content in their general curricula. Large numbers of nongovernment and private institutes seem to have created their own internal certiï¬cation criteria, which may not be necessarily recognized by national and authorized bodies such as the National Council for Vocational Training or the All India Council of Technical Education. Most institutions in the survey indicated that their teachers are not adequately trained to provide green skills training to students. The absence of accreditation and certiï¬cation on green standards is a deterrent."

Over time, mobility on the European continent has changed remarkably: if in the postwar period, Southern Europeans were recruited as guest workers via bilateral agreements established between states, the creation of freedom of movement allowed people to migrate freely and on their own choice. The consolidation and extension of freedom of movement rights continued as the European Union has grown âever closerâ, it gradually extended from workers and their families to include students, retirees, job seekers and every European Union citizen with sufficient financial resources to support her/his stay. Over time freedom of movement has gradually evolved in a form of international migration unique in the world which, encompasses a population of half a billion people and 32 countries (EU28, EEA and Switzerland). In the context of the economic crisis that has started in 2007, citizens and political elites in several member states are challenging in systematic manner the principle of freedom of movement for the first time. At the EU level too, the hitherto progressive expansion of rights for freemovers which culminated with the introduction of Directive 38/2004 was stopped after in mid 2000s."

Another set of guidelines will address multi-stakeholder partnerships for MHEWS and the mainstreaming of related goals and strategies into development processes, including legislation, policy development, institutional frameworks required and planning of development programmes and investments at international, regional, national, and community levels. These need to be based on identiï¬ed user requirements, good practices and existing guidance material. Lastly, an important expected outcome is a mechanism that is in place for sharing of good practices and expertise in relation to MHEWS across regions, countries, cities, and local communities (e.g. through lessons learnt from the use of indigenous knowledge in early warning, regional demonstration projects, etc.) and in a manner that enables countries and key stakeholders to use this information effectively. The Network will facilitate dialogue between and among stakeholders on the scientiï¬c, technological, and social issues concerning individual hazard EWS and MHEWS, and regular publications and their open access dissemination (e.g. via web portals such as PreventionWeb, media exchange, etc.) promulgating the case studies, lessons learnt and emerging issues on MHEWS, as well as related policy developments in countries, will be made available.

73,830,0.983,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"they pose to sustainability and liveability. An understanding of these needs is necessary because it is the mega-urban regions and particularly peri-urban regions that will be the focus of most urban-orientated growth absorbing a large portion of all urban increases over the next decades. At the same time there is restructuring in urban cores and inner zones creating a more densely populated and expanded builtup environment which is experiencing increasing prices of land and housing that encourages decentralisation of ofï¬ce services, industry and residential housing. These developments will pose challenges because the increasing integration to the global economy is creating an economic environment in which more investment is directed to the core and inner zones thus creating ï¬scal imbalances between the core and inner zones and outer peri-urban zones (Mc Gee 2008). The policy solutions for these latter regions are not easy for many Southeast Asia mega-urban regions that are governed by several layers of national, provincial and local government which is often highly fragmented. Sub-regional variations in the eco-systems, densities and urban morphology thus create great difï¬culty for policy makers. These developments create a complex managerial environment in which a myriad of decisions at the local level come into conï¬ict with the transformative elements of higher level government, and ï¬rm decisions, often resulting in a decisional congestion of management in these outer zones. This is exacerbated by the mixed urban developments that occur as outwards expansion in urban clusters as the MURs expand. This will involve rethinking the governance and management systems of MURs to reï¬ect the inevitability of the ongoing expansion of these mega-urban regions (Asian Development Bank 2008) and particularly the growth of urban clusters that leads to policy responses that recognise the growing diversity of MURs. Fifthly, as part of these institutional changes the management of these megaurban regions need to be directed to ensuring liveability and sustainability. Rapid mega-urban growth poses environmental challenges particularly where national environmental policies that operate at the various levels of government inhibit reducing the environmental impact of rapid urbanisation. Many of the policies that are being adopted at present are too broad to effectively cope with the diversity of urban eco-systems. There are also ongoing tensions between the requirements of development and eco-system protection. One way to respond to these challenges is to build the concept of the âspatiality of eco-systemsâ into the policy process that will lead to recognition of the importance of peri-urban regions to the sustainability of MURs. This is particularly signiï¬cant in the delivery of services such as water provision, public transportation, public and private utilities including sewerage and power, housing and social services including education and health. This is challenging in the less densely populated zones and peri-urban zones of Southeast Asian megaurban regions that have mixed land-use, much lower incomes and both environmental and health challenges. The cost of installation is extremely expensive. An alternative approach would be to introduce âeco-servicesâ which would be make greater use of the ecological infrastructure of urban agriculture, water systems wetlands and urban forests that are present in the peri-urban zones that can reduce the"

Using the river basin as the territorial management unit is an attempt to impose a new and ânaturalâ territory, which is justiï¬ed and legitimized by (natural) sciences. It is an attempt to enforce a new scale for the water management and hence to bypass existing political and administrative instances and the related power relationships. The global actors like the Global Water Partnership, UNDP, the World Bank, and the EU try to convey in this way the political question of resource management in a managerial and technocratic frame of governance (Moss 2003). Water governance can be understood in the framework of the debate around the meaning of governance. For several critical authors, the concept of governance serves as a substitute for concepts of government through the reduction of social and political features in the processes of decision-making. Governance hence, refers to mechanisms and to coordinated activities directed towards problem solving. By contrast for government and non government governance is an attempt to minimize the political, e.g., debates,"

(ix) Informal institutions. Informal institutions affect the workings of formal institutions but may also be important for the fostering of entrepreneurship in its own right. The social legitimacy of entrepreneurs is particularly important in this respect. Likewise, norms and habits that facilitate cooperation and impersonal exchange need to be strengthened, especially with respect to trust. High-trust environments have been found to nurture market entry, enterprise growth and productive entrepreneurship. However, the extent to which policy can influence this is unclear. Furthermore, informal institutions vary considerably across regions, which is likely to affect the level at which measures should be implemented. In summary, we hope that this work has inspired both conï¬dence and humility regarding Europeâs innovation future. Later work could analyze and present speciï¬c policy proposals linked to the different clusters of European countries in more detail. A good starting point for a more detailed reform agenda would be to identify the leader in each cluster and base reform advice directed to that cluster or the individual countries matching the leaderâs institutional framework."
99,337,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Due to its particular (political) history and (administrative) structure, Amsterdam has an extensive and intricate system of separate and rather compartmentalized actors involved in the provision of local welfare services. Every city district has its own (welfare) programme and organizations, and due to the availability of sufficient funding/subsidies, all of these actors have long had the possibility of working fairly independently from one another. Instead, at the moment, the political discourse in Amsterdam calls for social innovations that target social cohesion at the local level in an efficient manner. Hence, the political discourse favours social innovations that promote closer collaboration between the many (disjointed) actors that are involved in the provision of welfare services at the local level and that encourage new actorsâincluding for example universitiesâto step up to the plate. In particular, the innovations that seem to enjoy most (political/financial) support are those that seek to combine both the social and the competitive side of the city and try to bridge the gap between those two (so far rather disconnected) worlds. BOOTs are a prime example of this.

170,255,0.983,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4 Institutional Impediments to Addressing Attitudinal Barriers of Teachers Teachers are one key stakeholder among many within the context of an ICT in education (ICTE) project implementation; the others constituting government officials, school administrators, technology developers, students and parents, and often the implementing agency or researchers or both as the change agency. Each of these actors may have different perceptions and opinions about the role of ICTs in teaching and learning. We argue that recognizing dynamic interests of special stakeholder groups in practice would not only influence impact but may in fact constitute an impact in itself. Thus, addressing teacher attitudes, in terms of competencies, confidence and capacity for change, as deeply engrained internalized values could be understood as meaningful to the impact of a project. The inclusion of teacher empowerment and agency as a potential positive outcome of an ICTE project has a basis in the capabilities approach (Sen 1985). This in itself is a radical departure from the individual blame bias (Rogers 2003) that has often held teachers as individuals responsible for project failure, rather than recognizing the success or failure of the system or the innovation. In other words, stakeholders (technology developers, change agencies) involved in the management of an innovation have tended to hold users (teachers) responsible for lack of project success rather than the innovation itself or the system of which these users are part of. When stakeholders involved in the management of ICT initiatives are cognizant of the limitations of a beneficiary group, in terms of their knowledge capabilities or attitudes towards adopting a technology, it could either work for or against the eventual impact of the initiative (Armstrong et al. 2005). The identification of teachersâ capabilities and values as key to the success or failure of ICTE implementation often fails to ascribe a role to teachers in the design of the technology. We hope to understand the point of view of individual adopters, or the community of teachers as users, by identifying their attitudes towards an innovation alongside the unique problems and needs they encounter. This study maintains that addressing barriers would not only build teachersâ capacities needed to support"
72,192,0.983,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Introduction Informal settlements, such as favelas (slums), are complex social ecosystems, characterised by their lack of basic services and by their particular social ties. Favelas in Rio de Janeiro are undergoing rapid changes, and new organisations and relationships are beginning to appear. This is largely as a result of the Rio de Janeiro governmentâs policy of âpacificationâ â a strategy to occupy the favelas formerly controlled by drug dealers, aimed at extending citizensâ rights (and duties) in these areas (Fleury, 2012). This chapter discusses these transformations, considering in particular if and how new services are emerging. This discussion is based on one significant case study â Light Recicla. Light Recicla, in Favela Santa Marta, Rio de Janeiro, is a service operated by the cityâs energy company that seeks to reduce the electricity bills of local residents by exchanging recyclable materials for energy credits, helping them to adjust to the new reality brought by pacification. Under the framework of the pacification strategy, commercial companies and favela residents are establishing new relationships. Light Recicla aims to define a new mode of collaboration between the energy company, Light, and its customers that addresses this new set of social relations. Lightâs initiative is considered in this chapter as an example that highlights specific issues related to social innovation, particularly in terms of new social relations. The focus here is on social innovation âas new ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborationsâ (Murray et al., 2010, p. 3). In the context of the emergence of new market-based relations within the pacification process, the Light"
320,298,0.983,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"This framework helps to identify the response options available to managers of protected areas on a local or regional level but also emphasises the need for cooperation with stakeholders and scientists. It is applicable in all protected areas across Europe and other continents. However, this approach needs an adequate budget, as well as time and expertise. Without additional financial means that have to be provided to protected areas the adaptation of conservation management will be not feasible. Recommendations for required adaptations at policy level targeted at planning and implementation by regional, national, and international institutions â in parallel to adaptation in protected areas â are described in Chap. 9. The methodical approach presented in this chapter aims to answer the key questions for managers in protected areas when it comes to adaptation: â How can management of protected areas be adapted to climate change? â What problems and difficulties may be experienced in adapting protected area management and how can they be solved? â How can protected area managers reduce uncertainties by managing natural resources and learning about them at the same time?"
242,224,0.983,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Factories in Thailand have responded to growing global competition in export markets by seeking to reduce labour costs through the utilization of âcheapâ migrant labour. As has been extensively noted by previous research on export sectors that involve manual operations, women have historically provided the most productive source of cheap labour, and their low unit costs of production are routinely attributed to their ânaturalâ attributes as unskilled, docile, and secondary (and therefore disposable) labour (Elson/Pearson 1981; Wright 2006). But they are also cheap in terms of the ways in which the capital that employs them, and the state in which they are situated, are able to avoid any contribution to the costs of reproduction of their daily labour power and the generational reproduction of the workforce. In Thailand as elsewhere, migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in the form of below-standard wages and poor working conditions since they are generally not protected by labour regulation or citizenship rights. Moreover, they also subsidize capital and the state through the complex ways in which they manage their gendered reproductive responsibilities for securing housing, food, education, and health care and caring for children and elderly and disabled family members (Nagar/Lawson/McDowell/Hanson 2002). Burmese women migrant workers constitute an especially vulnerable and exploitable source of âcheap labourâ in manufacturing. Whilst in other contexts export factories have migrated to cheap labour platforms, for example from the United States to northern Mexico or the Asian Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs), in this instance Thai capital has remained in the country, whilst the cheap labour has migrated over the borders from Burma. Because of the economic and political repression in Burma (Fink 2009) and the limited rights of migrant workers within Thailand, Burmese women migrant factory workers are protected by neither their state of origin nor their state of destination, and, as has been extensively documented, are subjected to arbitrary and exploitative labour conditions including excessive hours of work, unhygienic living conditions, arbitrary deductions from their wages, and vulnerability to arbitrary dismissal, arrest, and deportation."
275,331,0.983,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"This paper will consider potential requirements for trusted autonomy in cyber security, looking firstly at the current cyber environment, including four fundamental principles of cyber security. It will then assess the emerging challenges to this mission, framed though the dimensions of Big Data and consider opportunities to apply trusted autonomy to improve cyber security. The intent of this paper is to help inform researchers of the areas in which development in trusted autonomy may provide greatest return on investment in cyber security. Whilst these areas are specifically related to the requirements for the Australian Department of Defence, they may also be relevant to many other organisations facing similar cyber challenges. Defenceâs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) architecture provides a reasonably robust protection against cyber threats. The lower classification (Protected) network is connected to the Internet via a gateway that provides multiple security mechanisms, thus achieving defence-in-depth. These security mechanisms are highly effective and relatively sophisticated, but involve significant manual processes. Due to the sensitivities and the need to maintain a security advantage, this paper will not provide any details of the tools or techniques currently utilised by Defence. Whereas cyber security threats are on the increase, incidents on Defence networks actually decreased in 2015 in comparison with the previous year. Some 50,000 events were detected in 2015, around the same as 2014, of which there were 580 incidents, which represented a 25% decrease [10]. The causality of the decrease in the number of security incidents cannot be stated with certainty, but there are strong indications that this result is through greater success of security mechanisms, especially through blocking of threats at the gateway. Notwithstanding the evidence of current success in cyber security, Defence needs to further strengthen protections to keep up with, and preferably ahead of the threat."
35,546,0.983,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"The ï¬sheries sector from the outset faces a different situation: while the offshore wind energy sector is privileged with stable and outspoken political commitments and to-date exclusive user rights for vast ocean areas, the ï¬sheries sector is losing ground. This development however has not resulted in any noticeable efforts of the ï¬sheries sector to diversify into marine farming so far. In fact, local ï¬shermen appear rather reluctant to the idea of engaging with marine farming (Wever et al. 2015; Michler-Cieluch 2009). Neither do they possess the speciï¬c knowledge of marine farming, nor the sufï¬cient investment capital, nor do they seem to be willing to move away from their original profession. By some ï¬sheries representatives, the efforts to engage ï¬shermen into alternative occupations are perceived as lip service to avert from the fact that the expansion of offshore wind energy goes hand in hand with the closing of ï¬shing grounds, thus threatening the very existence of the ï¬sheries sector. Earlier stakeholder efforts focused on the potential role of nearshore aquaculturists, in particular mussel farmers, in offshore mariculture operations (Michler-Cieluch and Kodeih 2008). Similarly to the ï¬shermen, the local mussel farmers also generally appeared reluctant to the idea of expanding their businesses into offshore waters. Here again the disbeliefs in economic efï¬ciency and technical feasibility, and a generally low readiness to assume risks were identiï¬ed as the main causes for a sceptical attitude towards offshore mariculture. Moreover, offshore mariculture was found to be perceived as âintruderâ that could displace traditional ways of ï¬shing from the Wadden Sea. The ï¬sheries sector thus felt as a âtwo-fold loserâ that is threatened not only by the loss of ï¬shing grounds due to the expansion of offshore wind farms, but also the loss of their occupational identity if forced into offshore farming in order to secure income. Table 11.5 displays selected supportive, as well as opposing statements from ï¬sheries and offshore wind energy representatives. These results seem surprising, as both ï¬sheries and nearshore aquaculture sectors possess developable equipment as well as valuable skills and knowledge to work in open waters, and both sectors, for different reasons, are confronted with the need to extend and diversify their businesses. They reveal the Achilles heel of socioeconomic studies so far: the lack of a clearly identiï¬ed target group. It is not yet clear who would actually be willing and capable to develop and operate a marine aquaculture facility in offshore waters. In fact, due to the remoteness of offshore installations, operations would have to rely heavily on automated processes. Stakeholders have repeatedly raised their worries that the technology would be attractive only to large, possibly foreign investors and would hardly generate any income or employment effects to the region (Wever et al. 2015). It is also not clear under what kind of arrangement the two very heterogeneous actor groups (wind farm operators and aquaculture operators) with substantially different interests and concerns could be brought together in a co-management scheme. Financial and operational beneï¬ts from sharing a common facility and space may only be attained when a high degree of cooperation between the co-users is achieved, not only"
334,484,0.983,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"First, as mentioned, in none of the three countries under investigation in this book is there a movement for deportations. This is interesting insofar as in the policy field of deportations, the logic does not follow a contender logic. It is not the policy issue as such that is contested by oppositional movements. Instead, rightwing mobilizations choose different targets, such as refugee housing. The number of violent attacks in Germany (including setting fire to refugee accommodations that are under construction or even inhabited) has skyrocketed since 2015.2 During the strong mobilization cycle against deportations in the early/mid 1990s, this was also the case. But why do restrictionist movements not mobilize for deportations? One explanation could lie in the character of anti-deportation mobilizations as implementation struggles (Rosenberger et al. 2018), which means that the broader public might be âin generalâ in favor of strict immigration policies, but in the specific case of implementation, it breaks the heart of ordinary citizens if well-integrated children or a member of their soccer team is to be deported. When the deportee becomes a face, it is difficult even for right-wingers to win public support in favor of a deportation. The second point we would like to make is on the relationship between the state and the protests. As mentioned, in Austria, restrictive protests find themselves often in a rather âclose interaction between institutional actors and protest networksâ (Haselbacher and Rosenberger 2018). This is noteworthy as the protestors legitimize their actions with reference to what official stances are, while anti-deportation mobilizations are characterized by a constellation of âstate against migrantsâ (Ellermann 2009). Thus, right-wing mobilizations, even those using violence against property and people, position themselves closer to official policies than those anti-deportation protest actors who often legitimize their actions with appeals to human rights or compassion. This also indicates that, from a political opportunity structures perspective, the allies for anti-deportation protests tend less to be found within state apparatuses than it is the case in other movements, such as on gender equality. At the same time, in the cases of Austria and Switzerland, allies were also to be found among conservative political elites. Depending on the political culture, the relationship to the different levels of the federal state is configured by the different protest actors. These findings from the comparative and multi-level oriented research project call for further research on the role of state actors, including mayors and street-level bureaucrats."

The clearance of all goods and collection of customs duties, excise duties and VAT commenced at the Jarinje and Brnjak border crossing points on 14 December 2013 as a result of the conclusions negotiated in Brussels (Interview 21 2016s). With regard to regular border patrols on the so-called green border, KFOR troops in particular noted that EULEX does not have sufï¬cient capabilities and manpower to effectively execute the border control tasks, placing an extra burden on KFOR (Interview 17 2016o). Due to the lack of border control capabilities, certain parts of the green border remain exposed and vulnerable; one of the main problems in the area is illegal logging. Such criticism applies most strongly to the north of Kosovo where for security and political reasons EULEX staff only have a limited capability to contribute to border control, although the situation has improved signiï¬cantly in the last couple of years (Interview 19 2016q). On the other hand, the EUâs wider engagement in border control, especially the mentioned agreement on Integrated Border Management for crossing points, has brought substantive progress to the normalisation of border management with Serbia (Interview 13 2016k). While certain interviews indicate the green border remains a key challenge not sufï¬ciently addressed by Kosovo Customs and EULEX, the ofï¬cial reports do suggest improvements. EULEX facilitates meetings with KFOR, while organising joint trainings with the Kosovo Border Police and Kosovo Customs aimed at developing an operational plan for these âgreen border patrolsâ (Compact Progress Report 2015). The mission also has an important role in facilitating interagency meetings among relevant Kosovar stakeholders in border management (e.g. customs, police, food and veterinary agency, tax ofï¬ce etc.). These meetings are held on both the national level and in coordination with the Serbian counterparts (Interview 11 2016j). Speciï¬cally, within customs joint meetings on the regional level between Serbian and Kosovo customs staff have taken place every two months (Interview 14 2016l). EULEX has therefore helped normalise the relations between Kosovo and Serbia by taking steps in the direction of bringing representatives from both sides to the table, establishing the exchange of information, along with a certain degree of coordination and cooperation (Interview 15 2016m). With the goal to achieve higher interoperability and efï¬ciency in border management, EULEX supported the establishment of the National Centre for Border Management. The centre facilitates the collection, analysis and dissemination of information, and supports cross-border and regional cooperation. The centre is also one of the most important benchmarks achieved on the Kosovo roadmap for visa liberalisation (EULEX 2016b). Normative identity tested One can ï¬nd different evaluations of customs and, interestingly, the poor public evaluations of customs as being one of the most corrupt governmental services have continued despite the relatively small number of cases brought to court (European"
346,318,0.983,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","at its very beginning. Nevertheless, IC and ministries followed a double strategy. The process itself was conducted by local experts with the only small representation of the IC. IC, local authorities and stakeholders in education worked together in commissions and project groups, but when agreement could not be reached or results not be implemented, the IC has always the powerâand the HR has used itâto impose needed measures. Therefore, it was not easy to install a feeling of consensual processing at working levels in such an unequal power structure although this is essential if education reform should be accepted by local stakeholders, in particular teachers, pupils and parents. To comply with the ICâs proposals could always be interpreted as compromising with the stronger partner. Textbook commissions were set up for the subjects of language and literature, history, geography, the environment and society as well as religion. when the consultation process started, participants mostly followed a political agenda and saw themselves as representatives of the local ministries which had nominated them. Against the intentions at least of the IC, the starting phase can be characterized as mostly antagonistic in a double meaning. The majority of the Bosnian members showed sceptical or even dismissive attitudes towards the IC. The IC propagated a multicultural approach which wasâand often still isânot well understood by most of the Bosnian membersâscholars from pedagogical universities and senior teachers mostlyâwho were not familiar with this concept and regarded it a threat to their cultural identities. They were not well informed by their ministries about procedures and aims of the commissions and entered them mostly with the feeling that the IC is about to threaten their independence in shaping their own curricula and teaching material. However, the division between IC and Bosnians did not contribute to strengthen inner-Bosnian cohesion, because the Bosnians were united in their negative attitudes towards the IC only in order to maintain their ethnically separated education systems. Thus, the commission was characterized by an internationalâlocal (or Bosnian) antagonism as well as the inner-Bosnian division between the representatives of the three constituent peoples. In the first phase, the main dividing line ran between locals and internationals because the Bosnians were united in their efforts to torpedo the ICâs intentions. Yet, they had at least to agree to those revision measures which were conditioned by the observation of the Dayton Accords and therefore could not be rejected. Consequently, only a minimal understanding could be achieved meaning to take out obvious negative, discriminating and"
282,62,0.983,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"control and competition are the accountability mechanisms ensuring justice and efficiency (Eichenberger and Frey, 2002). Yet another set of proposals accepts the current institutional structure as it is and suggests strengthening its democratic accountability mechanisms. For most writers, this would entail an expansion of the possibilities for participation. Civil society organisations or NGOs already play an increasingly influential role in international politics.29 Many analysts believe that increased NGO participation in international organisations could provide the key for creating more democratic accountability. Jan Aart Scholte, for example, argues that NGOs could help reduce the democratic deficit of global governance, both through their activism and their participation in international organisations (Scholte, 2002). Others, however, are sceptical about the legitimacy and representative nature of NGOs.30 Stutzer and Frey therefore present an alternative for increasing popular participation. They advocate giving groups of citizens chosen through a process of random selection direct voting rights in important decisions and control over leaders of international organisations (Stutzer and Frey, 2005). Finally, some authors see attempts to increase the democratic accountability of international actors as unrealistic. Instead, they propose to rely on a broader variety of accountability mechanisms. Keohane and Nye, for example, suggest that next to electoral accountability, there can be âhierarchical accountabilityâ, âlegal accountabilityâ, âreputational accountabilityâ and âmarket accountabilityâ. Faced with the realities of the current international system, they propose to strengthen its overall accountability by focusing on and fostering these different kinds of accountability: Rather than offer a counsel of despair, we argue for more imagination in conceptualizing, and more emphasis on operationalizing, different types of accountability. It is better to devise pluralist forms of accountability than to bewail the âdemocratic deficitâ. (Keohane and Nye, 2001, p. 8) To cut a very long debate short, scholars of different backgrounds and ideological convictions propose strengthening accountability mechanisms to counter the democratic deficit of global governance. To achieve this they propose reasserting the authority of nation states, creating a world state or at least the functional institutions of a cosmopolitan democracy, increasing participation in international organisations or relying on varied forms of accountability â and this list could be extended further. The number of authors writing in this vein indicates that the argument that influence creates a legitimate demand for accountability gains sway when couched in terms of democracy. But the vast discrepancies in the recommendations derived from this also suggest that the argument is problematic. Two aspects in particular fail to convince when a general"

The ability of terrorist groups to utilise ICTs for propaganda purposes, for planning and implementing activities worldwide and to recruit newcomers to their cause has challenged governments to devise counter-measures that also employ ICTs. Electronic surveillance is part of this, though its use is contentious since the methods employed can be seen as intrusions into private life and there is much scope for misuse.

315,189,0.983,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"shaped by the integration of the child generations into French, British and South African society, where the opportunities available to women are different to those on offer to their motherâs generation in their country of origin. Sometimes these transformations in gender relations were resisted and in a minority of cases they led to family break-off. But what the intergenerational perspective of this study reveals is that for both generations migration afforded family members with a degree of agency over what they chose to transmit to the next generation and for many families this involved opening educational opportunities and greater freedoms to their daughters. A process that seemed to increase as the generations passed (Attias-Donfut et al. 2012a). In intergenerational relations, religious references are important, especially among Muslim families which represent an important and growing part of immigrants in Europe (much more than in the U.S.). Parents come from patriarchal families where the notion of respect is omnipresent and dialogue is absent, especially on topics linked to sexual life. Children have to perpetuate cultural and religious traditions; women must marry a Muslim partner and not have sexual relations outside marriage. In France, the majority of marriages of second-generation Muslim migrants are endogamous, some being arranged by parents, others being negotiated between parents and children, and around 2% are forced marriages (which are illegal of course). Mixed marriages, which represent a minority, sometimes lead to a generational break-off. However, while parental control over children works during the premarital period, it does not work anymore in the conjugal life of children. The latter become more individualized and they progressively adopt the values of their peer group in general society. They adopt norms of education less oriented toward the transmission of the tradition and more toward child development, and as time passes, migrant children are moving away from religious observance (Collet and Santelli 2012). (d) Financial transfers among migrantsâ families. With the circulation of human beings, there is an increasing circulation of financial capital. Remittances nowadays represent a considerable amount of money. The economic stakes involved in these international flows are huge, both at the macro and micro-level of the functioning of the families involved. Money sent by migrants may, to a great extent, improve the standard of living of the family left behind. This also has an impact on the receiving countries, as migrants reduce their standard of living and consume less in the host country because they devote a part of their revenue to their families in the countries of origin. At the macroeconomic level, remittances affect the economic growth of origin countries as well as the brain drain from those countries (Beine et al. 2008). Despite the importance of this phenomenon, the transfer behaviors of migrants living in Europe have not been sufficiently studied. We lack data on this topic as on many other questions related to migration. We hypothesize that migrantsâ attitudes and decisions regarding financial transfers are different from those of the general population, based on four reasons (Attias-Donfut and Wolff 2008). First, family structures vary according to the country of origin. Fertility rates are still high in some developing countries, resulting in large extended families, including many siblings. The family soli-"
27,10,0.983,Limits To The European UnionâS Normative Power in a Post-Conflict Society : Eulex and Peacebuilding in Kosovo,"Kosovo is one of the youngest countries in the world. In the last few decades, its history has been turbulent, stained with blood. When the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) was established back in 2008 as another optimistic effort of the international community to build sustainable peace, Kosovo Albanians, the biggest ethnic group in the country, held high expectations. This is no surprise: Kosovo Albanians have endured difï¬cult periods of violence, particularly during the war of 1998â1999, and despite being citizens of âan independent stateâ face the challenge of living in one of Europeâs poorest countries, dogged by corruption and lawlessness. Although the second biggest ethnic group in Kosovo, the Serbs, does not agree with the Kosovo Albanians on Kosovoâs future political status and oppose both its statehood of and international recognition, there is widespread agreement among them: the rule of law in this corner of South East Europe urgently needs to improve. Professionalising the Kosovar police, customs and judiciaryâEULEXâs three main working areasâremains an urgent task among a handful of other challenges facing this post-conflict society (economic reconstruction and tackling poverty, for example). The early announcements made by EULEX staff were ambitious: they promised to not only professionalise the key services for democratic society to function properly, but also committed themselves to go after the âbig ï¬shâ (Qosaj-Mustafa 2010, 5). Unsurprisingly, these promises of bringing the perpetrators to justice made the local population believe sustainable peace and a well-functioning democracy were within reach. Moreover, most Kosovo Albanian political parties supported the deployment of EULEXâwith one exception, VetÃ«vendosje! (Movement for Self-Determination), a prominent political party that has been ï¬ercely opposed to EULEX from the very start."

REDD emerged as a global initiative from the climate negotiations, but it is going to be implemented in countries with very different approaches to combating deforestation, technical capacity, institutional and political settings, levels of decentralization of forest governance, budgets and so forth. Therefore it is possible to expect REDD to unfold in quite different ways across the region. To understand and analyse the diversity in which REDD is evolving in Latin America, in this chapter our analytical focus will move across different scales and will make use of some paradigmatic examples, with special emphasis on the countries representing such cases. Our analysis will show that despite their initial opposition, some groups of actors support REDD and are taking advantage of the new opportunities that the scheme offers. REDD initiatives, for example, have become an economic opportunity for both state and national governments as well as for international and regional environmental NGOs. This chapter is organized as follows. After this introduction, we present our main analytical argument. The following section examines the phased approach to implement REDD in Latin America. In the third section, we present what we have identiï¬ed as three general strategies to implement and shape REDD across the region. In the next section, we discuss some examples of how pilot projects are taking off in the region. Finally, we present our conclusions."

96,188,0.983,Networks in the Russian Market Economy,"June 2010, citing several recent policy reforms aimed at building âa modern, strong and prosperous Russiaâ. This new Russia would, according to him, be among the co-founders of the new global economic order and political leadership (Medvedev 2010). The new Russian economy would not be built âfrom aboveâ, but through the efforts of private business in a competitive environment where the job of the state is âto ensure a good business climate for Russian and foreign entrepreneurs, and a fair and honest competitive environmentâ. The most ambitious of the new reforms are the plans to make Moscow a global financial center and to create a Russian version of the Silicon Valley near the capital. The reforms also include, among other things, incentives to innovation companies, a law limiting possibilities of arresting businesspeople in connection with investigations into economic crimes, simplifying immigration rules for highly qualified foreign specialists, and cutting the list of strategic enterprises. This kind of new Russian economy would go hand in hand with the development of democracy in a process where information technology has a specific role: Information technology is one of the key elements in developing democracy in general. The speed and quality of feedback between the authorities and society, greater technological possibilities for guaranteeing freedom of speech, and internet technology in operation of political and electoral systems are all important for developing our political structures and institutions. (Medvedev 2010) Even though both the intrinsic connection between capitalism and democracy in general and the blessings of information technology in particular may well be questioned, the emergence of a more diversified economic structure in Russia with a great number of small- and medium-sized enterprises is more likely to be conducive to democratization than an economy dominated by a few big companies owned or controlled by the state. Similarly, the role of the Internet and new technology for political and opposition activism in Russia is likely to grow in importance in parallel with the decrease of the Russian traditional mediaâs ability to fulfill its watchdog function (cf. Lonkila 2008). However, as with the efforts to weed out corruption from the Russian economy and society, the question is, who is going to implement these macro-level reforms and how? The answer has to do with the functioning of personal networks, which has been the focus of this book."
2,139,0.983,Promoting Active Citizenship : Markets and Choice in Scandinavian Welfare,"welfare mix within its boundaries. This arrangement resembles what we ï¬nd in the school sector: National authorities deï¬ne the criteria for being approved as a provider. We therefore state that indirect government also exists in elderly careâin this case, a service concession contract. On the basis of in-house case law, Danish municipalities can also enter into agreements with self-owning institutions, which are outside the scope of the Procurement Act and the EU Public Procurement Directive. They can also launch open calls for tenders on institution-based elderly care. In both Norway and Sweden, the municipalities themselves choose how institution-based elderly care within their borders will be organised (Vabo 2012). In Sweden, a municipality can choose between implementing LOV (The Freedom of Choice Act), using open calls for tenders according to the LOU (Public Procurement Act), or utilising the freedom of action provided by the in-house case law; a Swedish municipality can also choose a combination of these.17 However, Swedish national guidelines nevertheless encourage the use of LOV.18 In short, this means that users can freely choose between service providers approved by the municipality. The municipality must approve all providers that satisfy the requirements, which are formulated by the municipality itself. The money then follows the patient. Norwegian national policy documents encourage open calls for tenders, but leave room for restricted competition between nonproï¬t providers. Norwegian municipalities can also implement free user choice, but this choice is restricted to those providers that have entered into a contract with the municipality on the basis of a framework agreement or the âmoney follows the patientâ principle. National policies on the organisation of elderly care and municipal freedom of action are just some of the aspects of our models of government. Another aspect is each actorâs discretionary power over the content of cooperation on elderly care. National authorities in all three countries express views on the requirements and conditions for entering into a contract. On the one hand, this includes formal procedures based on the EU Public Procurement Directive and adjacent national legislation. These are largely similar in the three countries. However, policy documents in Denmarkâto a much greater extent than in the other two countriesâ stress that municipalities should ï¬nd creative solutions. These documents"
282,73,0.983,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. (Hamilton et al. 1992, Federalist No. 51) Next to periodic elections, Madison proposed âchecks and balancesâ between different government departments as effective mechanisms of control. His claim that governments need to be controlled has been accepted by most subsequent political thinkers. The bulk of the debate has not centred on whether or not accountability is necessary but on which accountability mechanisms are most effective. Standard debates in the normative and comparative political science literature, for example, tackle questions such as which electoral system best enables citizens to express their preferences and control parliament and the executive; how elements of direct democracy can strengthen citizen control; whether federal or centralised, presidential or parliamentary systems are best suited to create accountability while allowing for an effective system of government; and what role independent government agencies play to strengthen or weaken accountability.53 More recently, the tone of this debate has changed. Rather than exploring how the public sector can be controlled most effectively, a range of authors now focus on the negative side effects of existing accountability mechanisms. The predominantly procedural controls, so the argument goes, stifle creativity and discourage public officials from taking risks. As a result, public services are often inefficient. Despite this critique, however, these authors do not simply demand the abolition of existing accountability structures. Rather, they advocate the adoption of different kinds of accountability mechanisms. The New Public Management literature,54 which is at the forefront of this debate, for example, demands replacing procedural accountability with accountability for outcomes. Christopher Pollitt summarises the New Public Management proposals as follows: Responsibility is to be decentralized, targets â not procedures â are to become the key focus for public officials, costs will be cut, bureaucracy eliminated, standards raised, and service to the citizen-customer thrust to the foreground of concern. (Pollitt, 1995, p. 203) Even among the critics of the standard accountability arrangements of governments it is thus widely accepted that a âgoodâ form of government is an accountable one because this protects citizen rights and ensures that officials respect their duty to act in the best interest of citizens.

381,3,0.983,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"a report issued by ETS in 2007 titled Americaâs Perfect Storm.1 That report examined the likely impact of three powerful forces on the prospects for the future. Those forces were (i) wide gaps in literacy and numeracy among both school-age and adult populations, (ii) seismic changes in economic activity and the restructuring of labor markets, and (iii) demographic trends leading to a population that, over a generation, would be somewhat older and much more diverse. The authors argued that, left unchecked, the convergence of these forces would drive the country on a path leading to lower average cognitive skills and greater polarization, economic and otherwise, with grave implications not only for millions of individual lives, but also for society as a whole. Under the direction of a national advisory panel, this initiative looks more deeply into the dynamics of how human and social capital are developed, along with their growing influence not only on adult outcomes but also on the transmission of opportunity to the next generation. An overarching goal of the initiative is to contribute to public understanding of how these dynamics drive inequality of opportunity where, by opportunity, we mean pathways to the accumulation of human and social capital. This volume is one of several products planned for the Opportunity in America initiative. It contains 14 chapters, including an epilogue, written by leaders across a range of fields including education, economics, demography, and political science. They bring a variety of historical, theoretical, and research perspectives to the discussion of inequality of opportunity. As a set, these chapters not only illuminate key aspects of the problem but also offer suggestions of what policies, programs, and/or changes in practices could begin to reverse the trends we are seeing. Written in an engaging style, this volume constitutes an essential foundation for informed discussion and strategic analysis. We extend our deep appreciation to those who contributed to the ETS initiative now known as Opportunity in America. We especially wish to thank the authors who contributed to the development of this volume and to acknowledge the guidance provided by the members of our National Advisory Panel, whose names appear in the appendix. We enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with all of them. In addition to Kurt Landgraf, who, with the full backing of the Board of Trustees, provided the funding and support necessary to conduct this phase of the work, we also wish to thank Walt MacDonald, the current president and CEO of ETS, and Ida Lawrence, Senior Vice President for Research and Development, for their continued interest and support of the initiative. Special thanks also go to our colleagues at ETS for their excellent work on various aspects of the project including contacting and supporting the national advisory panel members and the authors, arranging their travel and contracts, as well as for their planning and supporting the meetings and seminars that were held in Washington, DC, and at Educational Testing Service in Princeton, NJ.

282,29,0.983,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"is hierarchical accountability. Each official in an organisation is accountable to his superior and the individual at the top of the organisation is held accountable for the behaviour of the organisation as a whole. Again, this model presents a very clear and easy-to-apply solution to the problem of many hands. Problems arise when the leaders of organisations lack adequate information and control over all activities of the organisation. In these cases, hierarchical accountability only has a limited preventive and educational effect on the organisation43 (Bovens, 1998, Chapter 6). Another solution is collective accountability, that is, a system in which each individual member of a group or organisation is held to account for the actions of the collective. This mechanism is certainly very effective in ensuring that individuals are held to account and might have a strong preventive effect. At the same time, most individuals identify as members of specific groups and might feel individually responsible for group conduct. Yet enforcing sanctions to implement collective accountability clearly contradicts fundamental principles of the rule of law and of Western conceptions of morality. The application of collective form of accountability in formalised accountability relations is therefore very rare44 (Bovens, 1998, Chapter 7). Finally, models of individual accountability seek to identify the exact contribution of a person to an outcome and hold her accountable accordingly. This solution corresponds most closely to the normative principles underlying democratic societies but is fully affected by the problem of many hands. To overcome this problem, organisations can, for example, clarify who bears what responsibility and improve the transparency of working processes (Bovens, 1998, Chapter 8). Since each of these approaches has advantages and shortcomings, Bovens suggests applying a mix of accountability mechanisms depending on the situation. The question of who is held accountable thus remains contested. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many of the most pressing contemporary public policy problems are influenced by a host of different institutions, groups and individuals. When speaking about the problems that partnerships are designed to address, the problem of many hands therefore applies not only within organisations but also for the multitude of organisations involved. 2.2.2.2 Defining the principal(s) A politically even more controversial question than who is the agent is the definition of the relevant principal(s). In most cases, multiple actors are recognised or are struggling to be recognised as principals. In businesses, for example, shareholders are broadly accepted as having the right to hold management to account, but in many cases we also see customers, employees and suppliers making accountability claims. Similarly, leading public officials in democracies are accountable to parliament as well as to independent financial"
198,229,0.983,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"(PoA).22 The Joint Committee can also consider identifying projects that were planned for the CDM but never could start. In any case, project approval must always uphold additional aspects of projects support, promote new activity, and more advanced technology than the prevailing technology in the country, and start after the earliest date decided by each partner country (most countries decided 1 January, 2013). The functions of the JCM websites (so far, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mongolia have established their own JCM websites in addition to the Japanese websites) should also be optimized to facilitate project developers showcasing their needs and availability, which can be followed up by the JCM secretariats and intermediary organizations. Transparency of information must always be ensured in communicating the JCM opportunities and approval process to eligible entities. These information are crucial for private companies, whom are naturally attracted to the offered JCM subsidy of âup to the half of investment costâ, grant, and full ownership of the technologies. Although the price of advanced low-carbon technologies are generally higher than those available in the market, they are willing to invest because the subsidy helps pushing down payback period to a reasonable period of time. The emphasis on use of advanced technology should also be promoted. Current experience shows that the approved technologies have better efficiency and/or performance than those commonly used in partner countries. As a more specific criteria, MOEJ specifies cost effectiveness level and payback period as eligibility criteria for JCM Model Project support. The role of state actors such as local government and their contribution to national emissions reductions efforts should also be encouraged. As the JCM has the additional value of realizing cost-intensive projects that may support local development plans, the global movement towards realizing sustainable cities and city-to-city cooperation programs can further encourage JCM projects. Schemes such as âsister cityâ and municipality international cooperation offices have been the playmakers for these cooperation. The City of Yokohama, for example, established a âY-PORTâ program in 2014, which aims to enhance collaboration between the government and private companies in the city to promote sustainable cities in other countries, utilizing, among others, the JCM. High social awareness and leadership on the environmental issues are helping to push these initiatives."
73,793,0.983,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Overtime, the lack of planning and landscape intervention has created an urban landscape in which disintegration, juxtaposition and marginality are among the elements capable of expressing its inherent qualities. Areas in search of identity alternate spaces with prevailing residential and community identity, and abandoned spaces coexist with new residential zones; spaces of old and new infrastructures circumscribe and sometimes contain the remains of ancient agricultural practice. New and traditional land uses coexist, thus creating a complex urban dynamic, difï¬cult to conï¬ne in design categories. Projects continue to tackle this intriguing reality; projects that still consider the city as an asset to be exploited, an expression of the economic interests of privileged few. This urbanisation process calls for landuse planning that promotes the positive potentials and shapes the sustainable development of cities over the long term. This is an unprecedented task in its dimension, which assigns to the landscape architecture a unique role in urban development, as it is capable of bringing together diverse needs and creating an integrated plan for the future (Mertens 2010). A plan that not only divides the city into different areas with different rules i.e. zoning, but also focuses on more emergent needs that cities all over the world are facing, such as climate change, poverty and food production, pollution, water scarcity, social inequality. The SchÃ©ma Directeur de la Region MÃ©tropolitaine de Beyrouth (SDRMB), which aimed to plan the evolution of metropolitan Beirut after the civil war, was completed in 1986, but was not ofï¬cially approved. Later, in the early 1990s, it was heavily debated during the beginning of the reconstruction process. The SDRMB was a brilliant intellectual exercise, but the political leaders did not pay attention to it, even when they knew it existed (Verdeil 2003). Consequently, this area has grown into an overwhelming urbanisation, in addition to the fact that future policies which predict, control, and monitor this urban development are absent. The dominant elite, that reached positions of power and authority during and just after the civil war, continues to control the development process holding or investing, as silent associates in real estate. The main form of investment by this elite is âproperty speculation [which] raised the price of land and imposed the construction of luxury apartment buildingsâ (Traboulsi 2007: 160). The concern of most politicians is directed mostly towards their personal interests. This political intervention in the realm of public institutions takes three different forms (Hicham el-Achkar 2011) by: â Politicising the administration. â Issuing exceptions to regulations. â Obstructing the work of some institutions. The result is the implementation of a gentriï¬cation process that in Beirut, as well as in some other cities in developing countries, presents variants from the common norms of gentriï¬cation seen in Europe and North America (Hicham el-Achkar 2012). Gentriï¬cation is creating a new wave of delocalisation or displacement, similar to the one that occurred during and after the civil war, making again a tabula rasa of local cultural identity and causing the de-territorialisation, which in anthropology"
253,252,0.983,"Autonomous Driving : Technical, Legal and Social Aspects","Information on autonomous driving is generally best assessed from DG Connect. While various aspects and projects are listed on their website, DG Connect forwards the reader to the iMobility Forum when looking for âAutomated Drivingâ. iMobility is one of the two main platforms on the European level that addresses vehicle automation. Via the iMobility Forum, the Commission is in contact with stakeholders. The platform is chaired by DG Connect and co-chaired by ERTICO-ITS Europe as well as the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and the European Association with tolled motorways, bridges and tunnels (ASECAP). Within iMobility, there is a working group on vehicle road automation. DG Connect partly ï¬nances this network. The iMobility Forum is linked to the ERTICO platform on intelligent transport systems in Europe. It was founded as a joint initiative by the European Commission, national transport ministries as well as industry representatives and aims to be a networking platform to spur exchange between actors and stakeholders related to all kinds of aspects of intelligent transport systems. It gives an overview about various research projects and activities in European Member States on ITSâand accordingly, automated vehicles [16]. In addition, the European Union provides a platform for debating visions of the future: FUTURIUM, part of the Digital Agenda of Europe. Here several articles about autonomous driving can be found. To summarize, autonomous driving is not strategically anchored in European policy-making. The overarching discourses and objectives in the European transport sector can be subsumed under the headlines âcompetitivenessâ, âsustainabilityâ, âefï¬ciencyâ, âlow-carbonâ and, to a lesser degree, âsafetyâ. While autonomous driving can arguably contribute to any of these overarching objectives, stakeholders have not yet made much effort to make these links. The actors most actively addressing autonomous driving at the EU level deal with communication technologies, smart mobility, and intelligent transport systems (DG Connect including links to the EUâs vision for the Digital Europe). The automotive industry is mainly represented by its association. Individual companies do not appear very active on this issue at the EU-level. Autonomous driving is still in the realm of research rather than implementation and there exists no delineable vision for a future where autonomous vehicles play a major role. The use cases addressed in this book do not play a role at the European level. In addition, there is a lack of integration of the topic into existing visions on transport and mobility. The needs for regulation and further research and development are being discussed in working groups both at the European and the German national levels, although autonomous driving is not high on the political agenda in either case. While the European Commissionâs administration is (co-) funding some of these initiatives, it has not taken a lead on the regulatory front; rather it is mostly active in supporting research and development. This is similar to the case in Germany. The issue of autonomous driving is on the radar screen of the German transport ministry and major associations but is only now slowly beginning to gain somewhat more attention. As is discussed further below, one relatively important new development is the reform of the United Nations Convention on Trafï¬c Safety of 1968 that has been pushed by European automakers concerned about losing ground to international competitors."

174,182,0.983,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"IntroductIon The gradual shift in the economic and political gravity towards the Global South, particularly the Indo-Pacific, is also reflected in the increased role of these rising powers in stabilising countries emerging from conflict. While in terms of amounts of financial resources deployed by them, aside from China whose assistance figures are ambiguous, may not appear very large, the question to be addressed is whether these new actors have brought a different approach to issues of peacebuilding, more especially with reference to projects being demand-driven and owned by recipient societies. China, and to a lesser extent India, is accused of tailoring its assistance to take advantages of natural resources available in African countries. This criticism is further buttressed by the conviction that such flows from âemerging donors might increase the recipientsâ debt levels, ignore environmental and social impacts, and focus on extracting resources â¦ resulting in an erosion of the progress that has been made in the traditional aid community in these areasâ (Dornsife 2013). On the other hand, these rising powers do not see themselves as donors but as development partners;"
10,282,0.983,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"The levels and scales dimension has a supportive extent, as all governance levels ranging from the local level to the EU level are relevant. However, the regional level is the most prominent, since the irrigation policy is binding for the ï¬ve water authorities in the Rhine-East subbasin. At the national level, the displacement chain, which is explained in Sect. 8.3, is implemented to balance the water supply and demand in cases of extreme water shortages. Interactions between different levels also occur for the implementation of relevant EU policies such as the Water Framework Directive and the Birds and Habitats Directives. The national level plays an enforcing role regarding the implementation of these policies. For instance, the Birds and Habitats Directives have requirements on the nature areas that are designated as Natura 2000 sites. The areas where the water level will be higher are identiï¬ed in the provincial plan. Similarly, the measures that the provinces take for the nature sites are deï¬ned at the national level. The extent is also supportive in terms of actors and networks. Many actors are involved in the decision-making processes, mainly including the province of Overijssel, the ï¬ve water authorities, the LTO, the NMO and Vitens, the monopolistic drinking water company. Regarding groundwater management, the province and Vitens assume a role at the regional level. The province oversees the use and protection of groundwater by controlling the water authorities and issuing permits, whereas Vitens is interested in the influence on groundwater abstraction. Regarding problem perceptions and goal ambitions, the extent is neutral. Many actors adopt a supply-oriented approach to water, implying that their major goal is providing the right amount and quality of water to all users. The focus on supply has been shifting since other interests became important in the past few decades. It was realized that the amount of freshwater is limited and climate change is exacerbating this issue. Drought is becoming a problem to tackle for the agricultural sector, although in many areas flood protection is still the major goal. Additionally, drought is a relatively new issue and hard to explain to the general public, although 1/3 of the country is similar to the land in the eastern Netherlands, which has dry sandy soils that are prone to drought. Farmers are affected by dry lands but do not consider this to be as important an issue in terms of âprotecting their investmentsâ that should be taken over by the water authorities through longer term and larger scale investments. Several strategies and instruments are in place to deal with water scarcity and drought, indicating a high degree of extent. ZON is the ï¬rst strategy that addresses the water problems of the East-Netherlands. It involves various measures such as using long-term climate data to demonstrate changes and engaging the relevant actors at multiple levels. The irrigation regulation is the major instrument regarding water use in irrigation. One aspect of the irrigation policy that is lacking in extent is that it only applies to new wells and not existing ones. For surface water management at the national level, the displacement chain is implemented. In terms of priorities, agriculture is the ï¬rst sector that the water use is restricted through âirrigation bansâ, which are decided upon by the water authorities, whereas"

OPS5 concluded that âomitting attention for gender where it is needed may have led to unintended negative gender-related consequencesâ. A baseline study undertaken by OPS5 revealed that many climate action projects were formulated by experts insufficiently aware of gender issues. On the good side it should be noted that the same study also revealed projects that tackle gender issues adequately (GEF/IEO 2014, p. 61). When the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) started in 2008, they did not have an explicit gender focus â most countries did not include womenâs organisations in investment plan consultations. However, in 2009 and 2010, 15 % of the plans started declaring gender considerations. Some works remains to ensure that gender considerations are mainstreamed in CIF planning and carried through to investment projects in the field. In a positive step forward, the CIF hired a gender specialist to develop and implement an action plan to support collaboration among MDBs. Attempts have been made throughout the NICFI portfolio to address gender issues in REDDÃ¾. However, it is stated by the evaluation that among partners, there is a lack of understanding of, and low general capacity to address gender. The strongest contribution has been through the UN-REDD programme, whereby numerous publications on REDDÃ¾ and gender have been produced. For UN-REDD, the importance and need for gender mainstreaming is reflected in most of its policy and programmatic documents and guidelines. However, the implementation of gender mainstreaming activities at the country level is not taking place in a cohesive and systematic way throughout the programme. The evaluation (2014) stated that drivers of deforestation will be better addressed if gender considerations are integrated especially at the local level. The track record on equity and inclusiveness is even less impressive. While equity and inclusiveness are essential dimensions of social, economic and environmental sustainability, they are perhaps too far removed from the often technical nature of the climate actions reviewed in the seven comprehensive evaluations. The Fifth Overall Performance Study of the GEF does not mention equity or inclusiveness, while the CIF evaluation only mentions equity in relation to investments and inclusiveness of stakeholders in consultations. There is indirect attention to the issues â for example in the attention for local livelihoods, involvement of indigenous peoples and civil society organisations. An example is to be found in the NICFI evaluation: since 2008, NICFI provided a total of NOK 1 billion or 9 % of its funding to civil society to generate needed knowledge, for advocacy (international and political), piloting and facilitating implementation (Frechette etc. 2014, xix). UN-REDDâs evaluation stated that âThe Programme provides an enabling platform for Indigenous Peoples and civil society organisations to influence global discussions on REDDÃ¾. The ability of forest-dependent populations to influence REDDÃ¾ processes has so far proven to be more limited at the country level, and non-indigenous communities are not well represented in the programme, overallâ (Frechette etc. 2014, vi). While attention for gender, equity and inclusiveness is on the rise, the evaluative evidence is overwhelming that these dimensions have not yet been fully included in"
326,274,0.983,"Autonomes Fahren : Technische, Rechtliche Und Gesellschaftliche Aspekte","8.4.2 USA The United States is the most advanced nation in terms of introducing autonomous driving vehicles into its transport system. Legislation on autonomous driving has been passed in California, Michigan, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. In another six states â Arizona, Colorado, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas â the legislative attempts failed or are pending. There are another dozen states with ongoing regulatory initiatives. Some common features of their regulation regard the definitions of autonomous driving and autonomous vehicles employed and the conditions for obtaining operation and testing permission. Liability issues are also beginning to gain attention. California has set a 2015 deadline for the establishment of liability rules [51]. The newly enacted legislation in the United States has been developed with an eye towards allowing the testing of autonomous driving vehicles; most existing legislation is very restrictive regarding their use. At this stage neither the US government nor the automotive industries want to take large risks in relation to a technology that is still in an early development stage and that must still prove its reliability and safety. The same could be said for the other countries looked at here. Regulatory initiatives in the United States were a direct response to Googleâs push for legal clarification regarding the status of autonomous vehicles. Google, an active developer of self-driving software and technology, has lobbied state by state for the legislation enabling the operation of self-driving vehicles. Various US politicians have strongly spoken up for the technology. Governors and other state politicians have on various occasions praised autonomous vehicles in public and claimed their leadership relative to other states by being frontrunners in passing supportive legislation. Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval in early summer 2011 upon the passage of his stateâs first law on autonomous driving vehicles stated: âNevada is the first state in the country that is going to be (adopting) regulations for this vehicle (â¦) I think it is important for Nevada to be first on this.

198,305,0.983,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"acknowledging that processes affecting climate change take place in various interlinked scales, it is important to identify the relevant system boundaries pertinent to the evaluation. For this evaluation the targeted market/technology was the unit of the analysis and the system boundaries were set at the national scale. Attention was given to identifying various components, and to the interactions among these components or segments of the market targeted by the project. Special attention was given to identifying market barriers to change and how these barriers affect the functioning of the system and the systems likely emergent properties. orlen and Consults (n.d.), have analyzed changes in the status orlen (2014) and Wâ¬ of market barriers addressed by climate change mitigation projects, including those supported by the GEF. The evaluation built on their work to assess changes in targeted market barriers and factors contributing to change. Subsequent steps focused on assessing the extent and the way in which specific elements of the interventionâs theory of change interacted with elements of the system (Mayne 2008). The focus of enquiry was on how the intervention became part of the system and the changes (intended or unintended) which this brought about (Garcia and Zazueta 2015). This perspective seeks to emphasize the interconnectedness of the intervention and elements of the system unlike other contextual perspectives that emphasize the effects of context on the intervention (Pawson et al. 2004; Blamey and Mackenzie 2007). This approach was woven into the instruments, which were designed to gather information on the GEF activities and on the links of these activities to support provided by other actors that were relevant to the targeted market. The instruments also took into account the extent the activities undertaken by the other actors were influenced by the GEF support and vice-versa. The decision to restrict the system boundaries at the national scale was influenced by the fact that flow of information and learning is easier, and policy framework more consistent, within the national boundaries. Similarly, barriers related to suppliers, finance and expertise are more consistent within a country than among countries. GEF projects too are generally geared towards influencing the targeted markets at the national scale (Eberhard and Tokle 2004). This, however, does not mean that the systems at the national scale are insular and may not be affected by factors that have origins in other countries. The evaluation itself documented three instances â ILUMEX (GEF 575), BRT (GEF 1155) and Landfill (GEF 784) in Mexico which had been replicated/scaled up in other Latin-American countries."
242,1036,0.983,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Likewise, the public representation of migrant children in Thailand is at issue in efforts to meet these youthsâ educational needs. It is significant that public concern in Thailand focuses on the need for public education of migrant children, rather than regarding such education as a public burden, as is sometimes the case in the USA (Abrego/Gonzalez 2010). And yet Petchot indicates that the Thai concern seems to stem from the sense that if they are not educated, children may pose a security risk, and is therefore an instance of a more widespread slippage between concerns for children at risk and the anxiety that children pose a risk. Once again, this is certainly an issue in the USA and in other countries in which key facets of youth culture have been criminalized (Ferrell 1999). There is therefore a clash between the educational priorities of the Thai state and the ostensible purpose of education. Migrant children in Thailand are granted the right to education in order to keep children occupied and out of trouble, to integrate these children into Thai society, and to comply with treaty obligations. Education does not seem designed to equip children for success in life, which presumably is the rationale for making education a right. Instead, school officials interviewed by Petchot appear as begrudging, suggesting that the youth are the ones who need to adapt to Thai educational standards and that migrant children are fortunate to have educational opportunities. The representation of migrant children as interlopers appears to be significant here as well. These representations of Peruvian domestic workers and of Thai children derive, ultimately, from their liminal legality, a form of liminality experienced by"
38,561,0.983,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.2.1 Kenya Northern Kenya is a region of high biodiversity conservation value. It is a hotspot of mammalian diversity in Africa and is critical habitat for several endangered and threatened large mammal species. This region is largely under tribal communal tenure, and the rich flora and fauna of the region are threatened by heavy and continuous grazing by domestic livestock, which has caused moderate to severe land degradation over large areas (Georgiadis et al. 2007). Several NGOs, the largest of which is the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), have been working to promote wildlife conservation and better land stewardship in this region. In 2008, NRT and other scientists developed a simple protocol useable by community members to monitor rangeland condition, which, in turn, determines the amount and quality of forage for wildlife. These methods were based upon pastoralistsâ traditional knowledge and monitoring practices that were also be scientiï¬cally defensible. Through a series of conversations at which the NGOs, scientists, and community members were present, all participants agreed that the indicators currently used by pastoralists to make management decisions were insufï¬cient, as they were largely focused on livestock condition and grass conditions affected by rainfall. All agreed that a new protocol was needed to capture information about long-term (>3 year) trends in rangeland functionality. However, these methods would need to be simple so that they could be learned and used by community members with low literacy. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID-East Africa), a team of scientiï¬c experts was assembled, as well as a diverse advisory panel, to guide this project. This team conducted focus group interviews with community members representing the Maasai, Samburu, Borana, Afar, and Karyu ethnic groups in Kenya and Ethiopia. In these interviews, researchers asked community members to describe the changes in their rangelands they had observed over the last several decades. The responses were markedly similar across diverse social and ecological contexts: increased bare ground, decreased perennial grasses, increased woody vegetation, and increased soil erosion. These observations also matched the general indicators of degradation that have been observed by scientists working in rangelands around the world. Researchers then used this traditional knowledge to adapt an existing set of rangeland monitoring methods (originally developed and thoroughly tested in the western United States) for the East African context. Notably, the US methods were simpliï¬ed by basing them on a stick 1 m long (rather than measuring tapes or other manufactured tools) and created a single graphical data sheet on which data could be collected by circling icons. The intent was that these methods could be used by people who could not read or write but could count and recognise simple icons (e.g., a picture of a shrub representing a sample point with shrub cover)."

Making the reconciliation of work and family life possible for well-educated women has been the main objective in MÃ¼nster. This aim is in line with the national legal requirement to increase the number of places in childcare for the under 3-year-olds. To sum it up, adequate supply of childcare facilities and more flexibility as well as increasing quality standards are seen as important for the individual wellbeing of families as well as for improving the attractiveness of the whole city. All in all, a broad consensus among the relevant actors from local politics and public administration as well as from organised civil society about promoting childcare policy can be identified. Concretely, the welfare associations and other stakeholders such as parentsâ initiatives are strongly involved. The main cleavage in this field regards promoters of affordability and accessibility on the one hand and promoters of high-quality care on the other, while there is agreement on the overall need for a high amount of institutional childcare."
164,45,0.983,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","In conclusion we ask, what can be expected for whom, from the insights gained under the marginality framework developed here and the analyses done in that context? The answers to this question with the following four assertions are a call for accompanying policy actions with applied and interdisciplinary research for marginality reduction: First, recognizing marginality and marginalized people as complex phenomena leads to equally multi-facetted solutions. At first glance, this appears not to be helpful for focused development policy. However, narrowly focused policies often simply aim to treat the most prominent problem areas independent of social, ecological, and economic contexts, and may not deal with systemic problems. When marginality patterns and causes are identified and assessed in a multi-level (local, national, and global) context, appropriate actions become visible. Once the domains in which marginality may be rooted are identified they can be better addressed, such as: the lack of rights (e.g., ethnic, gender, disabilities), or the entrenched human behavior of people who have been discriminated against for a long time in a certain setting, the lack of access to services or technology, or ill designed macroeconomic policies that adversely impact certain segments of the labor market. This is an added value to income-poverty assessment, which are also most valuable as part of marginality assessment, but are further removed from cause and effect concepts. Second, the marginality framework clarifies the actorsâ and agentsâ potential roles, including the marginalized themselves. Beginning with asking questions like: âwho are the marginalized?â; âwhere do they live?â and âhow and why are they marginalized?â leads to a people and community focus and the institutional setting under which they act. The marginality framework sees social and ecological systems as coupled, and facilitates the identification of the relationships between actors and public infrastructure (physical and social), and how the institutional environment creates structures which lead to processes of marginalization. By implication the framework draws attention to the marginality problem and thereby can facilitate targeting action, not in the sense of targeting a set of poor people, but targeting a set of root causes of marginality, say social exclusion, ecological risks, or deficient institutions."

In the Macedon Ranges local government area the future climate is likely to include more hot days, less rainfall and run-off and increased frequency and intensity of extreme events such as drought, flash flooding and wildfire. The purpose of this project was to identify, analyse and evaluate climate change risks and develop an adaptation plan that would assist the Macedon Ranges Shire Council on the outskirts of Melbourne begin to plan for likely impacts arising from climate change. The development of the adaptation plan employed a best practice risk management approach in line with AS/NZS 31000:2009 and AS 5334:2013 and took and whole-of-council approach. Undertaking a risk assessment approach to climate change adaptation planning for a peri-urban local government area was successful. The approach assisted council to build capacity in climate change, adaptation and the process of undertaking a risk assessment and define their area of operation, influence and responsibility in regards to adaptation actions and the role of other external stakeholders. Further, it helped them to integrate the risks and associated adaptation options directly into the existing risk register system and understand the relativity of climate risks to non-climate risks that the council faces, such as land use change, increasing proportions of absentee landholders and an ageing demographic.

Even a cursory review of what happened in these two nations illustrates a lack of parallels to the present case. Both Japan and Germany had a strong national identity and sense of national unityâin contrast, many Middle Eastern countries whose borders were arbitrarily drawn by colonial powers are riven by internal strife and sectarian loyalties. In both Germany and Japan, the foreign occupation was widely viewed as legitimate; and both had solid economic fundamentals, such as a highly educated workforce and established infrastructure. Above all, democracy building started only after all opposing forces were defeated and all hostilities ceased. In recent years, the US as well as the World Bank have scaled back their political development programs. They now tend to favor âmerelyâ state building rather than nation building. They are looking for stable states, and to make governments more effective and less corrupt rather than necessarily liberal and democratic.

282,139,0.983,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"â¢ Mission statements should be published in a prominent position in publications and reference documents and should be known to the partnershipsâ key stakeholders. â¢ To increase the mission statementâs practical relevance and ensure that it is and continues to be backed by partner organisations, partnerships should periodically discuss and review their missions. 5.1.3.2 Orient partnership activities along the mission Once a partnership has created a clear and meaningful mission statement, the next challenge is to ensure its relevance to the partnershipâs activities. Accountability to mission implies that the mission statement plays a central role in the planning and work of a partnership. This can be achieved if the following principles are respected: â¢ Partnerships should not conduct any major activities that are unrelated to their mission. Instead, all important elements of their work programmes should promote their mission. â¢ Mission statements should guide the strategic planning of partnerships. Using a results chain or logical framework approach,42 partnerships should identify which courses of action are likely to contribute to achieving their mission and select them accordingly. â¢ To make the rationale behind their work programmes transparent, partnerships should also structure their activity reports around their mission. These reports should contain an explanation of how the partnershipâs main efforts are intended to contribute to the mission. Moreover, activity reports should portray the partnershipâs achievements, the obstacles it encountered and the consequences it drew from past experiences. 5.1.3.3 Employ resources efficiently in pursuit of the mission Finally, an organisation intent on creating accountability for working towards its mission needs to demonstrate that it uses its resources efficiently in pursuing its goals. Measuring efficiency in organisations addressing public policy problems is notoriously difficult, because they have no clearly defined bottom line and address complex issues.43 Most efforts to evaluate the efficiency of public policy programmes rely on benchmarks. Benchmarking is a technique originally developed by companies. It involves identifying the best competitor and using that organisationâs performance as a yardstick.44 Benchmarking can be a useful tool for assessing the relative efficiency of partnerships or other organisations working in the same field. It could be used, for example, to compare the efficiency of the Global Fund, RBM and other health providers in fighting malaria. Benchmarking, however, cannot usually serve to establish detailed"

Selection criteria would include their objectives and mission, risk and return expectations, investment horizon, ownership structure, integrity and reputation, and their track record in microfinance. 4.6 Promoting Good Corporate Governance: Whose Role in the Future? The changing landscape of microfinance funding is naturally bringing a change in roles of different funders. MIVs and their private managers as well as the holding companies are increasingly taking the driver seats in the governance of MFIs. DFIs are taking the back seats and continue to exert influence more indirectly through their stakes and board seats in the holdings and the MIVs. DFIs must make sure that MIVs and their representatives on the boards of MFIs are professionally and actively engaged. CGAPâs recent finding that most microfinance investors are not taking an active enough role should be taken as an early warning. The other element for promoting good governance in the future is strengthening the âsector governanceâ through investor coordination (e-MFP 2011). Lenders groups and other peer groups may play a more active role in setting standards and defining codes for the industry. It is encouraging that most of the principles and guidelines on corporate governance, previously the domain of DFIs, come from such peer groups and industry associations. Most crucial for future governance, however, is the growing importance of a completely stakeholder group, the local savers and depositors who already are or will be the main funders of microfinance in the future. They are represented by the prudential regulators and supervisors in the respective countries. While regulators are generally aligned on principles and practices of corporate governance as they relate to the financial, fiduciary and prudential side, many of them are on a steep learning curve when it comes to social side and how to balance both sides under the microfinance industryâs double bottom line. This opens a new dimension for promoting good corporate governance in the future."
56,74,0.983,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"ethnic and kinship groups, with relationships between migrants and non-migrant kin being âwritten in stoneâ rather than being dynamic over time (Lacroix 2013: 1021; see also Sinatti and Horst 2015). As Cassarino (2004: 265) notes: â[T]he transnational approach to return migration seems to encapsulate [migrantsâ] initiatives and projects at home in a fundamental set of mutual obligations, opportunities and expectations stemming from common ethnicity (i.e., the diaspora) and kinship (i.e., the family, the household).â Relying on mutual kin obligations in this way, the transnationalism literature cannot explain why some people are heavily invested in cross-border activities while other compatriots are not. In summary, the transnational approach has value in explaining how people maintain cross-border social ties (transport, communications technology), but it cannot fully explain why they do so. Social Systems By contrast, an emerging approach in migration and integration studies14 employs a theory of society in which there is no longer a place for preascribed membership in kinship and ethnic groups. Instead of society being constituted by large collectivities of individuals â be that in kin groups, tribes, ethnic groups or nations â Niklas Luhmann proposed an alternative theory whereby society is constituted by individualsâ communication in different social realms such as the economy, law, politics, religion, the family, education, and healthcare (Luhmann 1995). Access to such systems operates according to fundamentally inclusive criteria. In his theory of social systems, Luhmann locates a fundamental break between pre-modern and modern societies beginning in Europe during the course of the eighteenth century. Up until this time, society had been structured on the basis of group membership â either in âsegmentedâ clans or tribes, or in hierarchically âstratifiedâ classes or ranks (Luhmann 1977). With the fundamentally egalitarian restructuring of society unleashed by the French Revolution, membership in groups on the basis of ascribed or inherited characteristics became less and less important. Arguably, even membership in the nation-state has in recent decades lost some of those qualities which led Rogers Brubaker to describe citizenship as the âmaster statusâ (Brubaker 1994; Soysal 1994). The organisations of society â with the exception of the national welfare state in the political system â are increasingly unconcerned by demarcations of territory and national belonging (Bommes and Geddes 2000; Halfmann 2000). This is seen for example in the emergence of a global financial system, a corpus of international law, cross-border scientific cooperation, âhealth tourismâ, and supra-national political institutions. At first glance the foregoing may seem somewhat opaque, but Luhmannâs theory of functional differentiation is in fact extremely pertinent both to the question under consideration here, and to migration studies more broadly, for two reasons. Firstly, the theory provides a radical new framework for viewing migration by proposing that international mobility should not be understood as an exceptional act (Goldin et al. 2011), but rather as a perfectly expectable response to the inclusive and deterritorialised functioning of all social systems barring the political system.

As we will see below, autonomous vehicle technologies are increasingly being viewed as an important component of future transport systems. Their development is being linked to concerns about industrial competitiveness, sustainable development, resource efficiency, safety, and assistance for the elderly and others who might otherwise not be able to drive a car. At the same time, there are some voices of concern that there could be a loss of control through robotization of automobiles. Here we consider how autonomous driving is discussed at the European level before turning further below to discussions in other economies. To understand how autonomous driving vehicles are being discussed at the European level, we looked at strategy documents, European-funded research projects, and important networks related to autonomous driving. The analysis shows something of a mismatch between the interests of specific industrial actors in a rapid commercialization of autonomous driving technologies with broader European visions and objectives in the transport area in which autonomous driving technologies play some role, but little attention is given to autonomous vehicle technologies. Autonomous driving technologies are not widely discussed in European strategic documents although some research projects are being funded. This could be important since the extent of attention given to a subject and the visions associated with it may determine whether or not political support is lent to a technologyâs development. With little explicit attention given to autonomous driving vehicles at the European level, little political action can be expected unless there are either sudden technological innovation shocks or stronger political lobbying by stakeholders."
4,252,0.983,The Early Years : Child Well-Being and The Role of Public Policy,"The Lay of the Land The way in which a country regards its obligation to young children is embedded in its sociocultural history, which defines not only what services should be delivered, but also how and to whom they are delivered. How policymakers across much of Latin America and the Caribbean think about early childhood development has undergone three recent shifts. First, policymakers are recognizing the importance of focusing on children during their early years. This heightened awareness has translated into service expansion either by increasing services to more children within the same age group, extending services to younger children, and/or diversifying the kinds of services delivered. While the institutional mechanisms chosen for such expansion vary from country to country, policymakers agree that services still need to be expanded and improved. Second, there is a growing consensus that early childhood services are a universal human right and should be guaranteed by government intervention either directly through public provision or indirectly by financing and regulating private providers. Some countries, like Brazil, prioritize direct public provision as the policy option to ensure this right. Other countries, like Trinidad and Tobago, have also voiced a commitment to young children, but to date the public sector has provided limited services. Third, a conceptual shift in the delivery of services in the early years is under way. Countries are moving away from a model of fragmented service providers (such as health, education, or social protection) toward an integrated approach that considers the comprehensive development of each child. The extent of this change, however, varies considerably across countries. In many countries in the region, such as Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Trinidad and Tobago, early childhood development is increasingly viewed as a"

Bioeconomy companies may also benefit from research on bioeconomy that is funded by the public sector, and they may co-fund research together with the government. Bioeconomy companies and their associations may lobby the government with the aim to induce the government to support the development of the bioeconomy. However, companies that rely on fossil resources may lobby the government, as well, which may slow down the development of the bioeconomy."
334,70,0.983,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Austria is characterized by a low level of mobilization of extra-parliamentary protest and a moderate protest culture. Using Protest Event Analysis (PEA), Dolezal and Hutter (2007) as well as Hutter and Teune (2012) analyzed the development of protest activities on a longitudinal basis and across countries. As they have stated, political participation in the form of protest did not increase until the beginning of the 2000s in Austria, not least as a reaction of left-wing movements to the rise of the New Right. However, the increase was only moderate. Extra-parliamentary mobilization remains less frequent in Austria than in other European countries (Dolezal and Hutter 2007, 347; Hutter and Teune 2012, 13). Not only is the frequency and level of mobilization lower than in other countries, it is also more moderate in form: protests such as demonstrations or occupations are of low importance in Austria. The reasons for this moderate protest culture can be traced to enduring and relatively stable opportunity structures and to how the actors are configured. Due to Austriaâs strong state, political challengers seek involvement in informal procedures of decision-making. At the same time, Austrian politics is still characterized by consensus democracy and party cohesion. The number of parties and the ideological polarization of the party system (Dolezal and Hutter 2007, 347) has increased over time and political demands are primarily channeled within this institutional framework (Rosenberger and Stadlmair 2014, 482). The Austrian political scientist Herbert Gottweis (1997, 344) states that Austriaâs history also plays a role in its passive approach towards protest (and political participation in general). He also mentions the countryâs almost non-existent student protests in the 1960s, and how this lack of a movement might have negatively affected the emergence and success of further protest movements (ibid., 345). However, Austria did have its fair share of âtraditional movements,â such as what is known as the second wave of the womenâs movement in the 1970s, including demonstrations and protests for the right to abortion and for general equality with men. These protests were successful in the long run: consistent pressure on the governing SPÃ led to legal establishments of womenâs rights, such as the right to abortion or the right to enter the work force without a husbandâs permission."
99,254,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"âBerlin Mixtureâ It is an open secret that âBerlin has always hosted poverty better than other European capitalsâ (Slobodian and Sterling 2013, p. 2). But what is this judgement based on? Against the backdrop of lower industrial development, a distinctive territorial and social mix characterizes Berlin where rich and poor people live loosely together. On the one hand, this mix refers to the sound balance of inhabitants in Berlinâs numerous Kieze, a local synonym for integrated urban neighbourhoods. On the other hand, the term refers to a specific local settlement structure, supported by authorities, that allows the juxtaposition of housing facilities and local businesses. A combination of both aspects, a mixed structure of residents and settlements in the neighbourhoods, became known by the term âBerlin mixtureâ during the years of rapid industrial expansion in Germany in the middle of the nineteenth century and remains to this day. Social Policy Legacies Local authority policies had a huge impact on Berlinâs urban and social development. Largely in the hands of social democrats (who have taken part in every administration since 1945 bar one), public servants have worked under the banner of âequalityâ and âsocial protectionâ. However, Berlinâs special status also has had to take account of the fact that, although until the 1960s Berlin was an example for classical, post-war welfare policies, West Berlin became âthe front of the Cold Warâ after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and was, therefore, heavily subsidized by the federal government in order to compensate for the cityâs weak economic situation and to remain competitive with East Berlin and the GDR. Traditionally, public authorities have been inclined to pursue large-scale development programmes known as âcareful urban renewalâ (1979â1987), âurban renewal areasâ (since 1994) or âurban redevelopment scheme East and Westâ (since 2002). In a nutshell, the lesson emanating from these contextual factors, especially in terms of their impact on innovations, can be summed up like this: Berlin had over the years been home to a juxtaposition of traditional local welfare politics and values with a strong sense of innovation and innovators focusing on values that were more to do with personalising welfare systems and opening them up to new lifestyles and aspirations. During the long period before reunification, the city was subject to limited growth pressure and served as âa window of the Westâ, supported by considerable welfare subsidies, all of which made Berlin an affordable and rather secure place for both the large array of lower-income groupsââthe scenic poor and the clever unemployed who make the city so attractiveâ (Slobodian and Sterling 2013, p. 2)âand those groups that formed part of new social and cultural movements and searched for new forms of quality of life with different ideas about risks and chances. Now, under the rising pressure of international investment, capitalist dynamics are back and along with them greater inequalities, insecurity and gentrification. Classical social problems are now setting in. In times of financial crisis, the city government cannot mitigate these problems using the traditional means of social and urban policies. This represents a clear danger to the space and support enjoyed by innovators who sought to create a better quality of life and refine social support systems bottom-up."

242,705,0.983,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract In this chapter the experiences of Filipina domestic workers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar are examined in the framework of their structural vulnerability to health problems. The chapter shows how their poor state of Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) can be the outcome of a combination of forms of institutional discrimination that are interconnected and should be investigated in respect of: (a) the worth of their âidentityâ (migrant, female, the work they do); (b) the distinct aspects of discourse on sexuality and normativity which specifically relate to their presence in the destination countries; and (c) ideational and material realities constraining their own agency in finding adequate care. The chapter shows how variations in the potential for access may be explained by the types and degree of their structural vulnerability regarding labour rights, their relationship with employers and migrantsâ associations, and their personal SRH awarenessâtogether with what emerges from cooperation between those government officials and civil society organizations who work with migrant domestic workers. Attentiveness to the particular combination of forms of institutional discrimination in a given cultural and institutional context, especially the ways in which the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Filipina domestic workers are linked to the ways in which labour migration are organized, should be helpful for effective SRH advocacy.

344,430,0.983,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"cycle. Third, providing service jobs or building roads and buildings can be easily targeted to the politiciansâ own constituencies; thus, these policies are highly visible for even poorly informed voters. Gazdar (2000), the World Bank (1998, 2001), and Keefer (2002b) provide empirical evidence for this phenomenon. Another line of evidence for the importance of information for voter behavior and induced governmental performance comes from the literature on electoral cycles in fiscal and monetary policies. Cross-country analyses indicate that electoral cycles in monetary and fiscal policies are significantly larger in developing countries (Block 2002; Schuknecht 2000; Shi and Svensson 2000). Schuknecht (2000) and Shi and Svensson (2000) establish a direct link between electoral budget cycles and the limited availability of information to voters, with the latter factor being measured via access to free media. Analogously, Besley and Burgess (2003) demonstrate that state governments in India respond to declines in food production and to crop flood damage by increasing public food distribution and calamity relief spending in locations that have greater newspaper circulation. Thus, external interventions, such as information campaigns by civic society organizations, may be useful in promoting the diffusion of information that is needed for political accountability, particularly in poorer countries. Further, in line with the Columbia-School of voting (Lazarsfeld et al. 1968) Keefer and Khemani highlight social polarization as another mechanism by which voter behavior impacts governmental performance. Interpreting social polarization as expressive or instrumental voting, a dominance of non-policy voting based on ethnicity or social class might also explain why in many developing countries, where the population is divided into heterogeneous groups, suboptimal policies continue to be executed. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive empirical test of these hypotheses based on voter survey studies is not currently available in the literature. Keefer and Khemani highlighted a third imperfection of political markets that corresponds to the inability of politicians to make credible promises in elections. Persson and Tabellini (2000) demonstrate that when pre-election premises are not credible, elections become less effective as instruments for holding politicians accountable. When retrospective voting is more important (i.e., the more voters base their votes on their own economic welfare that was realized when a party was in government), politiciansâ incentives c.p. to implement policies that serve the interests of their electorate are higher. Of course, the more elected politicians discount future benefits from being reelected, the lower is the impact of retrospective voting on accountability. In this context, the existence of stable political parties is highlighted as an institutional environment that decreases political discount factors, as stable political parties correspond to an organizational commitment device for honoring future benefits from reelection. Keefer (2002a) demonstrates that in countries where political parties are weak or not established, politicians tend to make credible promises only to voters with whom they have built a personal reputation. Such ties emerge most clearly as the patron-client relationship that is identified with politics in developing countries by a large body of literature. Several studies provided empirical evidence for clientelistic policies (e.g., Glewwe and Jacoby 1994; Sanmartin 2001; Glaeser and Shleifer 2002)."

In some cases, political actors may decide to try to accelerate the development of certain technologies and their large scale application. We have seen examples of policy-driven development with, for example, nuclear and renewable energies. In these cases, governments set incentives to support the development of these technologies, e. g. with research and development funding, support schemes, loans, the provision of infrastructure, and the taking over of liability risks even though in some countries, there were later decisions to phase out the use of a particular technology. There are also various examples in the transport sector, where state actors aimed at paving the way for certain technological choices. Apart from providing road infrastructure and thereby supporting individual automotive transport systems, e-mobility is a recent example of an attempt by policy-makers to help boost the implementation of a particular technology on a larger scale [9]. Policy makers do not typically like to intervene in the workings of market economies but at times may feel pressured to do so. As Edquist formulates it, â[t]here must be a âproblemâ â which is not automatically solved by market forces and capitalist actors â for public intervention to be consideredâ [14]. Different factors may be behind a decision to support new technologies or technological applications. Policy makers may choose to promote a technologyâs development in order to support the competitiveness of a domestic industry, in response to problem-pressures (e. g. safety or environmental factors), to experiment with new technological possibilities, or in reaction to international developments. As Edler and his colleagues put it: âPublic innovation policy aims to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy or of selected sectors, in order to increase social welfare through knowledge creation and economic successâ [12]. Numerous studies illustrate the importance of political intervention especially in the field of environmental policy innovation (see e. g. [30], [31], [32]). There are several ways political actors can support the development and diffusion of new technologies. They may encourage and support the development of expert networks, finance research and development, create demand for a certain technology (e. g. by setting up support schemes or mandating government purchasing of a technology), and, by providing basic infrastructure (for a summary of approaches see [35]). Research support has been relevant in the development of autonomous vehicle technologies as well. States that are lagging behind in the technology are now scrambling to catch up. Since innovations go through various phases (see e. g. [26], [36]), governmental interventions may also be limited to particular innovation stages of a technology."
99,100,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"a guiding principle. From the organizational point of view, cooperative solutions between all local actors (administration, economy and civil society) are privileged in this search process. All actors involved broadly accept cooperation as the leading principle for city matters, resulting in the approach that âthe more allies unite for a specific city matter, the greater the chance to push something throughâ.19 This governance arrangement supports the implementation of innovations and allows âanother way of cooperative work could be establishedâ.20 Apart from the overarching logic of the discursive frame and governance arrangements, several other conditions must be fulfilled before social innovations can be implemented or even stimulated. The first condition concerns funding. Original idea and conditions must attract the interest of sponsors in the project. Sponsors have to be market-compliant, which means that they must comply with the lines of argument found in either the investment or the competitiveness discourse. They have to understand that this represents the dominant basis for decision-making. The second condition concerns legitimation, which means that basic legitimation for social innovation is given and accepted by the people involved. Referring to our results from the policy fields we analysed in MÃ¼nster, an innovation is accepted as legitimate if it is presented within the investment frame. The third condition involves the aspect of appeasement: Any social innovation that challenges the dominant frame will only be supported if the innovators give up some of their resistance against the frame in exchange for financial or advocatory sponsorship. The support granted then serves the appeasement of possible opposition and is considered a win-win situation for all parties involved. Finally, the fourth condition concerns a pragmatic approach towards solving problems at the local level. Social innovations in MÃ¼nster need to demonstrate a hands-on approach towards perceived problems. This relates to tangible target groups, deprived districts and so on, while more visionary approaches hardly have any chance of success. The closed-shop mentality, the local welfare discourse with its focus on city growth, local governance arrangements, several conditions that have to be fulfilled to introduce social innovations as well as specific characteristics of local labour market and housing policiesâall these dimensions can be found in MÃ¼nster and must be considered in order to decide whether the initiation of social innovations is fostered or obstructed within the city. Hence, these dimensions create the context that opens the âwindows of opportunitiesâ for concrete social innovators and social entrepreneurs.

334,374,0.983,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"its members, in mainstream discourse it is frequently described as an indistinguishable mass of people often perceived as a threat. Here, each and every member of the group is seen to pose a threat, just as the (potentially unlimited) group does as a whole. According to Sayad (2015, 36â38), the basic structures of our political thought are national and thus immigration, or the presence of non-citizens on national territory, disturbs the national order. This disturbance supposedly leads to chaos and the complete destruction of any order when large numbers of migrants enter the country. These two linked arguments can be found, explicitly or implicitly, in most political mainstream discourse on migration: migration is an abnormality that may lead to uncontrollable consequences if not kept at bay. Political distinctions can be found with regard to the form and scope of regulation, ranging from the complete closure of borders to the acceptance of well-educated and/or affluent migrants or refugees (see Valluy 2008; Merhaut and Stern 2018). Several structural factors additionally hinder migrants from organizing. Apart from differences with regard to race, nationality, gender, class, etc., migrants from the Global Southâas a âgroupââare also clearly differentiated internally by legal definitions and the use of the latter in public discourse. Only few migrants successfully apply for a work or study permit (see AMS n.d.; OEAD 2016). Another option for obtaining a residence visa, which is increasingly being restricted, is family reunification (e.g. based on marriage. See BMI n.d.; Mokre 2015, 178â186). Certainly, the most vulnerable group is made up of irregular migrants without any legal right to stay in their country of residence. Refugees represent a special case. Their right to remain in a country of which they are not citizens is backed up by the Geneva Convention (1951) which states that signatory states may not send a refugee back to a country where his/her life or freedom is threatened due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political conviction. The receiving state is obliged to investigate on an individual basis whether the refugeeâs fear of such a threat is well-founded. Once this has been established, refugees enjoy a relatively privileged position, which in many aspects equates the formal rights of citizens.3 As an abstract principle, the right to claim asylum, i.e. to request protection if threatened in oneâs own country, is rarely contested. Even nationalist and xenophobic political organizations shy away from generally rejecting the Geneva Convention and the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights on which the convention is based. Discourses contesting the rights of refugees to come to Europe and/or a specific nation state are based on two lines of argumentation: a rather implicit one focusing on the above-mentioned understanding of migrants as an unspecified threatening mass, and an explicit one doubting the motives of individual asylum seekers (see Welz 2015). The so-called protection of EU external borders (as well as the more recent closure of national borders by member states) is promoted on the grounds of the threat However, in Austria the position of recognized refugees has become increasingly precarious, e.g. due to a temporary restriction on this status prescribed by an amendment to Austrian asylum law (BGBL 2016)."
164,647,0.983,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","everywhere in Ethiopia. The severity of poverty and the proportions of the poor vary from place to place, depending on various factors. Marginality is often found to be a root cause of poverty (von Braun and Gatzweiler Chap. 1 this volume). Socio-economic development efforts may not equally reach all of the poor because the barriers that marginalize some segments of society prevent policies and development efforts from comprehensively incorporating the poor. Marginality has different meanings depending on context. In this chapter, we consider marginality as Gatzweiler et al. (2011; see Chap. 2 this volume) define it. This study was conducted as part of a pilot research project on marginality and extreme poverty in Ethiopia led by the Environment and Coffee Forest Forum in Ethiopia. We conducted a field investigation in four communities located in separate districts of the regional state Oromiya with distinct environmental, social, and cultural circumstances. The districts (locally called woredas) are: Jida in North Shoa, Yayu in Ilubabor, Adami-Tullu Jiddo Kombolcha in East Shoa, and Arero in Borana. The case study sites were selected in order to capture some of the diverse aspects of marginality by considering the differences in agro-ecological contexts, livelihood strategies, cultural practices, and natural resource endowments. The objectives of the study were: â¢ to assess the diverse factors that contribute to marginality and poverty across gradients of agro-ecological and climatic conditions and livelihood strategies in selected parts of Ethiopia â¢ to better understand the perceptions of poverty among the rural marginalized poor communities"
191,519,0.983,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"In the case of Karin, that particular model grew out of the process of developing a municipal action plan against domestic violence (BRÃ 2013). The MalmÃ¶ municipality already had a specialised domestic violence police station on the one hand and a special unit for domestic violence within the social services on the other. Establishing Karin involved bringing these two specialist parts of two agencies together to create a multiagency facility. In Norway, the Barnahus model was introduced by national authorities, but after much lobbying and pressure from NGOs, politicians and professionals (Bakketeig et al. 2012; Stefansen et al. 2012; Chap. 16 in this book). In the policy field of violence and abuse against children, there seems to have been a consensus that a coordinating mechanism was lacking. Barnahus thus filled a void, in terms of both providing enhanced and specialised police procedures and functioning as a multiagency coordinating mechanism for the follow-up phase after the police interview. The process in November has been more top-down and may prove to become more contentious. As already noted, the initiative came from the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, and the Oslo municipality was not involved until later and so far only to a limited extent. Norwegian municipalities are strongly encouraged to develop action plans against domestic violence as a key coordinating tool. In Osloâs case, there is both an overall plan for the city in general and local plans for all fifteen boroughs, reflecting the considerable degree of decentralised self-government in the Norwegian municipal system. The overall municipal action plan mentions November only briefly, under the heading âCooperation with the policeâ (Oslo Municipality 2014, 8), and notes a health agency as the main coordinating agency for adult domestic violence cases, the Emergency Social and Medical Team, which is part of the Oslo municipal emergency ward (Sosial og ambulant vakttjeneste, Oslo legevakt) (Ibid., page 9). At the central municipal level in Oslo, there is, however, another specialist agency, the Oslo domestic violence shelter. Both the shelter and the Emergency Social and Medical team are 24/7 services and both are, to some extent, given coordinating roles in relation to adult victims of domestic violence. In other words, Project November was introduced into a local context which already had certain structures for coordination and where there seemed to be"
242,895,0.983,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Civic actors also fulfil a crucial role in mediating the translation of international legal norms into local contexts. The role of these translators can be a powerful force in reinforcing social justice claims through other, non-legal means (Abel 1995, Merry 2006b). In order to be effective translators, civic actors must possess a âdouble consciousnessâ of the content of international law and the circumstances and institutions through which it is enforced, as well as the local or national context in which international norms find expression (Merry 2006a, 2006b). NGOs are situated at a place where they can be brokers or âtranslatorsâ of human rights and social justice claims: a bridge between the human rights world, activists, and migrants (Merry 2006a, 2006b)."
245,792,0.983,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"2 Discussion Despite its large number of problems, the evolution of the social dimension has provided positive developments. The progress made with regards to the affordability and portability of loans and grants, identiï¬cation of some underrepresented groups and the commitment to improve access to higher education and completion rates, as well as the collection of data can be seen as a success. It is not so much the CommuniquÃ©s or the ministerial meetings which are problematic for the social dimension, but rather that political promises have often not been followed by political action back home in the ministersâ own countries, in order to really achieve what was agreed during the meetings. The social dimension is a rather complex area of work within the European Higher Education Area as it allows several interpretations of even the basic deï¬nition provided in the London CommuniquÃ© (2007). The real challenge for the future of the social dimension is the gap between the political promises made in the CommuniquÃ©s and the actions actually taken to fulï¬l these promises. There are not many opportunities for stakeholdersâexcluding voting against or demonstrating againstâto encourage legislators to be more active with regards to the social dimension. Investment in and commitment towards a social dimension will not provide short-term beneï¬ts and the retention of beneï¬ts might go well beyond legislative periods of government. In the long term, the commitment to a social dimension is a pre-condition to achieving the original intentions of the Bologna Processâcompetitiveness and attractiveness. The so-called European dimension (EHEA 1999) itself is innately linked with the social dimension; OECD data shows us a tight correlation between democratic participation, perceived (in-)equality, and educational status (OECD 2012a). One step which we hope will be taken after the next ministerial conference is the development of lower-level targets towards overarching goal of mirroring the composition of society within higher education (EHEA 2007). Breaking down the end-goal to smaller increments would not only make it easier to begin to work on the implementation of the social dimension, but also make partial achievements more visible. Furthermore, it would provide ministries, higher education institutions, and all other relevant stakeholders the time to adjust to a more diverse student population and to learn to be able to serve this population. The time for adaptation is not inï¬nite, as more and more areas of Europe will be diversiï¬ed, or in some cases minorities will be the new majoritiesâas Crul et al. (2013) reports it is already the case for some cities like Amsterdam. The EHEA should urgently ï¬nd strategies to adapt to this change."
282,160,0.983,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"relevant in the context of participation. For stakeholders to be able to deliver meaningful inputs, they need sufficient information about the rule-setting process, including the schedule of planned activities and the procedures for submitting contributions, as well as the subject matter under consideration. To strengthen the credibility of the process, two further elements of transparency are instrumental. Firstly, organisations should handle submissions in a transparent way so that stakeholders know how their contributions influence the rule-setting process. Secondly, transparency on their financial sources can help address potential concerns about a partnershipâs independence and objectivity. Organisations can take very different steps to create transparency. Which activities are required to generate an adequate level of transparency depends on the nature of the stakeholders involved. In the case of ICANN, for example, affected stakeholders are by definition engaged in activities related to the Internet. Therefore, it seems appropriate for ICANN to rely mainly on electronic means of communication to publish and disseminate relevant information. For partnerships dealing with well-organised and well-informed stakeholders, moreover, a relatively passive approach to information dissemination may be sufficient. EITI, for instance, predominantly addresses multinational companies active in the extractive industries that have a strong interest in and awareness of international norm-setting processes. The WCD, by contrast, faced different requirements. Among its key stakeholders were local communities affected by dam-building projects. To inform them and encourage their participation, on-site meetings, non-electronic communication, active outreach, capacity building and the use of local languages were essential. This dependence on context makes it difficult to establish general standards relating to the concrete modalities necessary for generating appropriate levels of transparency. Nevertheless rule-setting partnerships should respect the following principles to create the conditions for effective participation: â¢ Provide and disseminate information about the rule-setting process, the procedures for participating, the subject matter under consideration, the way contributions are dealt with and the partnershipâs financial sources. â¢ Choose the format and language for providing and disseminating information depending on the needs and capacities of key stakeholders. A basic starting point for partnerships is to publish relevant information online. In many cases, however, information will have to be available in several languages and may require the use of non-electronic forms of communication. â¢ Where necessary, reach out actively to disadvantaged stakeholders and provide them with training and capacity building. As described in the previous section, measures to support disadvantaged stakeholder groups may include the organisation of separate meetings, capacity building, mandated representation or the use of levelling techniques in facilitation."
164,560,0.983,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Word of the success of the three trailblazers has spread across the Global South.6 At least 45 countries now have cash transfer programs, providing financial support to more than 110 million families (Barrientos and Hulme 2010). Immediate poverty is being reduced by these efforts. Hundreds of thousands of children are now in school because their families can afford to buy them shoes and school clothes, and can get by without the few pennies the children could earn if kept out of school. Families are also investing small amounts to raise their own income with, for example, cash transfers in rural Africa frequently being used to purchase fertilizer. These programs are still young and this is a global learning exercise. Experiences are being shared among continents; research and experimentation are leading to rapid modifications and improvements in similar programs. Serious analysts also recognize that this is not a quest for the âoptimal program,â but a contribution to the evolution of national social protection systems that need to be able to improve their performance, maintain political support, and adapt over time in response to changes in national problems and the international context. The influence of the USA and European tendencies on the development of southern programs varies from country to country, but key patterns can be recognized. In middle-income and larger countries domestic policy makers can âlistenâ to the USA conditionality and European targeting tendencies, and then decide how best to deal with these from a position of relative autonomy. In lower-income countries and in particular those that are smaller and aid dependent, the degree of autonomy is restricted and there is a real danger that the policies selected derive from external debates rather than being part of a nationally-owned policy discussion. The danger of aid donors dominating national policy formulation about social protection becomes a real prospect in such cases. Where there is a national political consensus on an action, however, it can be pushed through despite donor concerns."
99,488,0.983,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"social innovation was not an explicit priority in this city, it was met with sympathy even when it challenged dominant views in the political sphere. The concept was linked to actions of limited scope as offshoots of mainstream programmes, as a way to expand social action without expanding or containing direct public provision. Another example was the city of MalmÃ¶ in Sweden (Carrigan and Nordfeldt 2014). Innovation was made a key discursive concept in the policy arena around local welfare in MalmÃ¶. Political actors considered the concept a cross-political one and used it in the hope of attracting people and organisations from various ideological backgrounds. In both these cities, the concept of social innovation was supported by varied political coalitions, albeit for different reasons. At the same time, other social innovations among the case studies in the WILCO project were limited in their development because others downplayed the contested nature of their work or because they were bogged down by local political conflicts. It was sometimes impossible to distinguish successful from failed cases because there was no consensus on what their goals should have been. In the case of neighbourhood revitalization innovation in Zagreb, for example, a lack of coordination between local government offices and local city companies affected the visibility of the innovation in a negative manner (Bezovan et al. 2014b). Public strategies or social marketing were consequently not on the agenda due to political conflicts, including an unstable political situation, resignation of a mayor and local elections. Another example of political conflicts disabling social innovations was found in the city of VaraÅ¾din (Bezovan et al. 2013). The role and recognition of civil society in the development of social innovation has strengthened over time. However, as argued in the research, political turbulence and changes to power structures hindered the development of more systematic cooperation from being established. There are examples of cities and local contexts, such as Lille, in which the local political arena for social innovation remains weakened by attention paid to a limited number of other priorities due to economic crisis and budget cuts (Fraisse and Bia Zafinikamia 2013). There are also cities, such as MalmÃ¶, in which local political disagreements hindered the implementation of particular innovations (see Chap. 6 in this book). Even though there was political consensus about the need for new solutions in local welfare in general and the promotion of social innovation as a concept in particular, different stakeholders and coalitions disagreed regarding the methods and instruments to be implemented, affecting the emergence and development of social innovations. If the practice of social innovations has more to do with changes in social relations than products or processes, they are necessarily also conflict-ridden and political by nature. Those who claim to study the phenomenon with any seriousness must at least incorporate this much. Resistance and opposition, risks and dangers, as well as negative effects and misuse need to be taken seriously, regardless of the normative good of social innovations (Borins 2001). Such conflicts are rarely discussed in the current mainstream of social innovation literature. Ironically, in its denial of politics, social innovation literature is profoundly political. Being aware of the local context and by implication of the local politics was one of the hallmarks of the WILCO projectâs approach."

Bala, pointed out that âthe role of ASEAN Secretariat is critical in making gender mainstreaming as a standard practice in ASEANâs policies and programmes across the three pillars.â She then added that âbefore we are able to effectively stimulate gender mainstreaming strategy in ASEAN, we ï¬rst need to understand clearly the concept of gender equality and how gender mainstreaming strategy can be applied in our work.â63 With regard to speciï¬c initiatives and legal instruments adopted to promote womenâs rights, ASEAN established in 2010 the Commission on the promotion and protection of women and childrenâs rights (ACWC). The nature of the Commission is intergovernmental, being composed of two representatives from each ASEAN country. According to its terms of reference, its mandate is to promote âthe implementation of international instruments, ASEAN instruments and other instruments related to the rights of women and childrenâ (para. 5.1), and âto develop policies, programs and innovative strategies to promote and protect the rights of women and children to complement the building of the ASEAN Communityâ (para. 5.2). Despite acknowledging the importance of a cooperative approach to enhance women and childrenâs rights, the act recognises âthe primary responsibility to promote and protect the fundamental freedoms and rights of women and children rests with each Member Stateâ (para. 3.5). This clause seems to protect the position of countries, such as Brunei, that allow forms of discrimination against women based either on religion or on culture. The Commission presents an annual report to the ASEAN Ministers meeting on social welfare and development. The Commission has played a central role in promoting effective implementation of common issues in the CEDAW and in the 1989 Convention on the rights of the child, however it presents some weaknesses. The ï¬rst one concerns its composition: independent experts would better guarantee the promotion of womenâs rights, since there would be no influence on their activity by national governments. The second limit regards its mandate, which does not include either the elaboration of reports on each ASEAN or the analysis of individual complaints. Effective implementation of international provisions requires the possibility for individuals to obtain compensation for alleged violations of their rights.64 Whether the national system is weak in that respect, a regional independent mechanism could help in pursuing the promotion of human rights. The ACWC drafted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and Violence against Children in ASEAN, which was then adopted by the"

In other words, the structures did not help individual academics and these academics, in turn, did not support the structures. In addition, the continued central steering from the ministry did not contribute to building institutional strength and effective leadership. Over time, however, the institutional contract and other measures served to build up the strategic capacity of French universities. A new generation of presidents emerged who became attuned to stronger and more effective leadership. A number of these presidents was no longer willing to accept a situation characterised by under-funding, limited institutional autonomy and lack of student orientation and advisory support, which, in the 1980s and 1990s, led to overcrowding and a high failure rate in the first cycle. The university presidents complained that they were trapped between two types of more powerful organisations: the grandes eÌcoles on the one hand, which were properly funded, had more autonomy and could select their students; and, research organisations, on the other, which had their own national research strategies into which the universities were expected to fit rather than they themselves shape. The universities felt, for good reason, that they were the handmaidens of the sector, financially strapped and politically squeezed between the national research organisations and the âgrandes eÌcolesâ. Both types of institutions were considered as the elite part of the sector and, as such, had the ear of the policy makers in Paris. It did not help matters that the top politicians and civil servants had been generally educated in the âgrandes eÌcolesâ rather than in the universities and had little exposure to research-based teaching."

To discuss the issues of migrantsâ security, the Libyan context provides a meaningful case of analysis to illuminate the consequences of migration policies in conflict situations. In fact, this country has been one of the first involved in the process of the externalization of EU border control. Further, regulations producing the illegality of migrants and the restriction of mobility have not only worked to relegate migrants to situations of precariousness and marginality in peaceful times. These regulations also impeded migrantsâ safe escapes during conflicts and suspended peopleâs lives for the indeterminate period of being held in refugee camps. As the deaths in the Mediterranean showed, the EU regime of migration control does not foresee the possibility of accessing airports for sub-Saharan workers in Libya (Kumar 2011).

In addition to a range of restrictive laws, she vividly illustrates a range of social, structural, and institutional âdysfunctionsâ faced by migrants working in the domestic service sector in both the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Vlieger goes on to explain the various legal obligations owed by these states according to international law. In the light of the record of such widespread impunity, she concludes, rather depressingly, that there is, in fact, very little prospect for human rights to serve as a protective framework at all in either of these countries. Similar difficulties in advocating for migrantsâ rights through state institutions exist in Thailand, as Petchot (chapter 17) observes in her chapter on Burmese children born in Thailand, but who lack citizenship and rights. Placing an emphasis on the duties of the receiving state, as Vlieger has done, she demonstrates that migrants pursue active transnational lives, with little if any official intervention, although the possibilities for migrants relying on state institutions to protect their human rights are far more limited than in Chile, but substantially easier than in Saudi Arabia. As in Chile, there appears to be at least some potential in Thailand for advocating social justice and human rights on behalf of migrants through appealing to law, media, and other social or state institutions. Petchot elaborates this further with reference to the specific institutional challenges that migrant children face in obtaining education in Thailand. Accordingly, she addresses the grey area between labour laws and migration laws in Thailand, and the consequences this has for migrant childrenâs education. In doing so, Petchot reveals the structural opportunities for expanding migrantsâ rights in Thailand by exploiting the tensions between the labour laws and immigration laws. The approaches adopted by the contributors in this section differ, although they cover similar case studies. For example, Vlieger and Petchot place greater emphasis on the receiving state and its institutions and less emphasis on the migrant herself. By contrast, Irianto and Truong, in chapter 2 at the outset of the book, adopt a more transnational perspective, accepting the inadequacies of the receiving stateâs institutions, but exploring the responsibility of the sending state, in this case Indonesia, as well as the"
347,101,0.983,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"In 2002, the EUâs CFP underwent a substantial reform process aimed to ensure sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources. This was a landmark shift in EU fisheries governance. Since then, the conceptual basis for fisheries management under CFP is the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) principle, the precautionary approach and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Key elements of this reform include (EC 2002): â The adherence to the precautionary approach to protect and conserve living aquatic resources and to minimise the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems â Adoption of a more long-term approach to fisheries management involving the establishment of multi-annual recovery plans for stocks outside safe biological limits and of multi-annual management plans for others stocks â Reduction of fishing effort as a fundamental tool in fisheries management, notably in the context of multi-annual recovery plans â Aim to progressively implement an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management â Increased involvement of the fisheries industry and other groups affected by CFP through the creation of stakeholder-led Regional Advisory Councils Interviewees suggested that the move to a long-term approach to fisheries management has mitigated (or has potential to mitigate) conflict around TAC levels between scientists and conservation groups on the one hand and fishers and managers on the other hand. This conflict arose because management decisions in the past usually were only âmoderately responsive to ICES advice in setting TACsâ (Patterson and RÃ©simont 2007). Generally, ICES advice is an answer to the question: âHow much fish can we take this year without running the risk of not having enough left over for long-term exploitation?â (cf. Wilson 2009: 10). Over the last two decades, as Wilson argues, the TAC finally decided upon by the Council of Ministers is close to but not as much as ICES has advised. According to scientists, conservation groups and also Commission staff interviewed, the TACs decided upon are not based on carefully weighted biological and social and economic considerations. Instead, they claim that the divergence is due to putting short-term economic and social interests before long-term ecological imperatives. Short-term decision-making along with poor enforcement is seen as the main cause for increased stock depletion risk and economic risks for fisheries and fishers, an issue exhaustively discussed in the scientific literature (cf. Aps and Lassen 2010; Villassante et al. 2011). Over the last 15 years, despite the growing importance of sustainable development, it is believed by many including the media that scientific advice has largely been ignored in European fisheries (Wilson 2009: 28). In recent years, however, there is some indication that TAC decisions by the Council of Ministers have been more in line with scientific advice. As a result, the percentage of European stocks considered as overfished has declined (Lassen 2009, p. 6; EC 2012)."
341,181,0.983,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"cannot be sustained in the long term. Over the years, the integrated approach to urban water management has received impetus from the governments at all levels. In addition to the NWI signed in 2004, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 2009 agreed to increase its efforts to accelerate the pace of urban water management reform and as a result adopted the National Urban Water Planning Principles outlined below: â¢ Deliver urban water supplies in accordance with agreed levels of service. â¢ Base urban water planning on the best information available at the time and invest in acquiring information on an ongoing basis to continually improve the knowledge base. â¢ Adopt a partnership approach so that stakeholders are able to make an informed contribution to urban water planning, including consideration of the appropriate supply/demand balance. â¢ Manage water in the urban context on a whole of water cycle basis. â¢ Consider the full portfolio of water supply and demand options. â¢ Develop and manage urban water supplies within sustainable limits. â¢ Use pricing and markets, where efficient and feasible, to help achieve planned urban water supply/demand balance. â¢ Periodically review urban water plans. The aim of these principles is to provide Australian governments and water utilities with the tools to develop plans to manage the supply/demand balance of a reticulated supply for an urban population. Therefore adoption of a portfolio water supply approach is a high policy priority for all the state governments in Australia. However, implementation of this approach depends on policies and regulations and encounters various impediments. From the literature related to urban water management, it is evident that while progress on the scientific and technical aspects related to IUWM has been admirable, there are significant institutional aspects that need equal attention. Our own studies on water governance in Australia (McKay 2005, 2007), particularly on urban water management (Keremane et al. 2011; Wu et al. 2012; Keremane et al. 2014), and other studies (e.g. MaksimoviÄ and TejadaGuibert 2001; Brown et al. 2006; Mitchell 2006) have identified a wide range of social and institutional barriers to adoption, including insufficient practitioner skills and knowledge, organisational resistance, the lack of political will, limited regulatory incentives and the lack of institutional capacity. Unlike other countries, in Australia the water reforms have led the state governments and their agencies to better align planning and development requirements with an integrated approach to the management of the urban water cycle, but a range of governance factors including regulatory conditions, management systems and institutional arrangements are impeding new practices. Furthermore, there are acute path dependency issues introspectively for each state and hence federal, state and private sector relations issues. According to Dovers (2008) water institutions in Australia generally operate within an institutional system that is consistent with past rather than present knowledge and imperatives. With regard to urban water management, âthe co-evolution of institutions and large-scale technological infrastructure generates an interdepen-"

In agreeing to the first round of water reforms, COAG 1994, the Australian government formally acknowledged that rivers, catchments and aquifers are not constrained by state boundaries and that water activities in one state could have impacts in other states (Chartres and Williams 2006). The second round of water reforms known as the National Water Initiative (NWI) recognised the continuing national imperative to develop an efficient and sustainable water use in Australia (Chartres and Williams 2006).

In essence, proponents of free markets and privatisation assume that the private sector is inherently dynamic, productive and dependable. They also hold the belief that private institutions are intrinsically superior to public institutions for the delivery of goods and services. They have the confidence that market efficiency is the appropriate criterion of social performance in virtually all spheres of community activity (see Barnekov et al. 1989; Castro 2007). Although the market economy is clearly the system of choice in todayâs global marketplace, there is significant debate regarding the amount of government intervention considered optimal for efficient economic operations in developing countries. Debates surrounding the applicability of free-market principles in developing countries intensified in the past few decades, especially with the failure of the socialist path to development in the late 1980s and the rise to prominence of neoliberalism as promoted by the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and their development partners (the so-called Washington Consensus). The major ideology behind neoliberalism is that economic, political and social relations are best organised through formally free choices of free and rational actors who seek to advance their own material or ideal interests in an institutional framework that, by design, maximises the scope for free choice (Coates 2000; Jessop 1997; Perkins et al. 2012). Economically, it promotes the expansion of the market economy and monetisation of exchange in as many social practices as possible. From a political perspective, it implies that decision-making should involve a state that has limited substantive powers of economic and social intervention and commits itself to maximising the freedom of actors in the economy to engage in economic transactions that they consider beneficial to their welfare (Jessop 2002). In most free-market economies, calls for the liberalisation and deregulation of economic transactions within national borders and beyond have prevailed to the point where even formerly social democratic political parties decline to challenge them. This has also entailed privatisation of state-owned enterprises and public services and application of market proxies in the public sector (see Hodgson 1992; Jessop 2002). Hoskisson et al. (2000) argue that as a political project, free-market economics seeks to actively promote rolling back of the state from its traditional and routine forms of intervention associated with the mixed economy and the welfare-oriented national state. It also involves a deliberate shift in public policy that leads to the roll-out of new forms of governance such as decentralised national planning and service delivery, privatisation and commercialisation of public services such as water and electricity supply. Presumably, these new forms of governance are more suitable for a thriving market-driven national economy (Stein 1994). This typically involves the selective transfer of state capacities upwards, downwards and sideways, as intervention is rescaled in the hope of securing conditions for a smoothly operating world market and to promote supply-side competitiveness on various scales above and below the national level (Jessop 1997). A shift also occurs from government to market forces and publicâprivate partnerships. This shift reflects the neoliberal belief in the probability, if not inevitability, of state failure and the need to involve relevant"
242,1152,0.983,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract This chapter provides concluding reflections from a set of nineteen case studies of transnational and intranational migration and mobility. It contrasts the âsedentary biasâ present in policy regimes and associated thought centred on nation-states, where movement is seen as exceptional, including normatively exceptional, with the centrality of movement in the processes of socio-economic change and evolution, particularly those promoted under capitalist systems of economic organization. While market capitalist and nation-state principles of organization differ, they combine in hybrid systems, such as those currently being elaborated in policy regimes for temporary migrant workers, to exploit migrant labour. Many of these arrangements mirror the indentured labour regimes of earlier eras. The chapter presents by contrast a perspective based on principles of human rights and human security that uses a global framework both for understanding and for evaluation and then adds an explicit gender-aware enrichment of that perspective, in order to do justice to the special vulnerabilities and exploitation of womenâs migrant labour. A human security perspective, in particular, helps to base concern for human rights in an awareness of bodily and emotional needs, of global interconnections, and of the intersecting circumstances in peopleâs everyday lives; but it requires, and lends itself to, gender-enrichment through partnership with insights from feminist theory, as illustrated in the bookâs various case studies. The systems of the nation-state, market capitalism, and gender power that are discussed in this chapter, that structure the experiences of migrant women workers, are very deeply established. The chapter suggests directions for possible re-cognition, to reduce and counter the invisibility and misframing of migration, and of women and their work; it also suggests priority areas for research and networking following the format employed for the book: linking researchers, policy practitioners and migrant advocates, South-South-North.

This was most visible in the institutions themselves, as Richard Keller has commented for the Maghreb, where well into the postcolonial era they ârepresented the only real resource for managing mental illnessâ.35 Shifting historiographical periodisation away from the artificial divide of colonial/postcolonial to decolonisation, which for a history of psychiatry should span the first moves towards Africanisation following the Second World War, to the political crises of many African states during the 1970s and 1980s, allows for deep analysis of continuities and divergences in psychiatric practices, not only in relation to colonial rule, but also between countries in Africa. As I show in this book, the capacity of psychiatrists to reform psychiatric practices, to contribute to international debates and to provide care for patients was tied to the changing social, political and economic contexts in which they worked. Some of the continuities, such as the ongoing concentration of resources and personnel in a single mental hospital, need to be seen as necessities, as psychiatrists struggled to convince newly independent governments to commit the vast sums required to reorganise mental health services. Many of the divergences, meanwhile, can be usefully framed as responses and contributions to the evolving needs and priorities of development, nation building, modernisation and manpower, as well as the ability to access funding and to travel. Yet all, ultimately, need to be linked to shifting periods of political stability, upheaval and crisis, which challenged the ability of psychiatry to successfully decolonise."
35,245,0.983,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Abstract The notion of the sea as a seemingly endless source of resources has long dominated marine governance. This is despite that different perceptions and valuation systems underlie the institutional structures that govern and manage marine systems. Socio-political considerations cover the whole range of stakeholders and their type of involvement in the establishment and operation of multi-use offshore systems. However, within the vast variety of regulations inside the EU, the EU Member States as well as in North America, their implementation for offshore multi-use settings is as yet incipient and examples of best practice in multi-use scenarios are needed. These need to combine different knowledge systems (e.g. authorities, decision-makers, local communities, science, etc.) to generate effective insights into the management of multiple uses of ocean space and to complement riskâjustiï¬ed decision-making. Pre-existing social networks can provide signiï¬cant political leverage for governance transformations as required for the move offshore. That said, a range of organizational and social challenges related to the collective use of a deï¬ned ocean territory have to be taken into account. For instance, the creation and compliance with deï¬ned responsibilities and duties or the introduction of cross-sectoral management lines, such as an offshore co-management, that integrates the different demands and practices of the involved parties within an operational scheme that is practical on a day to day manner are in case in point.

Besides the problems with the TAC management approach, our case study also deals with the shift towards results-based fisheries management and the role of marine regions, Member States and stakeholders in such outcome-oriented management systems. Results-based management has been intensively discussed in the context of the recent reform of CFP, finalised in 2013. The European Commissionâs 2009 Green Paper on CFP reform suggested an approach where strategic decisions on principles and standards should remain at Community level (CEC 2009b), whilst decisions relating to technical implementation be delegated to Member States ideally organising themselves at the level of marine regions such as the Baltic Sea region (CEC 2009a). However, it is still unclear how the concepts of results-based management and a shifting burden of proof will be implemented through a regional approach under the new post-2013 CFP (Linke and Jentoft 2013; Nielsen et al. 2015). In Wilsonâs publication The Paradoxes of Transparency, Science and the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management in Europe, he highlights the importance of changing future fisheries management (Wilson 2009). Results-based management is identified as a promising alternative to current regulatory processes, which are overcentralised and top-down: âThe CFP can in many ways be argued to take the form of a classical intergovernmentalist, state-centric command-andcontrol, top-down management systemâ (Hegland 2009: 8). The European Commissionâs Green Paper (CEC 2009b) also recognised that the current CFP takes a top-down approach and needs to give the fishing industry more incentives to behave responsibly. In Wilsonâs and otherâs views, a ânested results-based system, organised around both sets of economic activities and geographical areasâ (Wilson 2009: 276; cf. Raakjaer and Tatenhove 2014), is better suited for governing an unpredictable and complex system such as the Baltic Seaâs fisheries and essential for the implementation of EAFM. The role of stakeholders in CFP over the last 15 years is the other important topic taken up in this chapter. In particular, we look at how two main structures for stakeholder interaction within CFP â the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (ACFA), set up in 1971 and now replaced by several specialised advisory councils, and the more recent Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) â inform CFP. The key research questions dealt with in this chapter with respect to the governance changes described here are: How is uncertainty dealt with in the governance interactions between risk assessment and risk management (science and policy)? And how does communication between different actors address differences in the framing of the central issues in todayâs fisheries governance structures? These fundamental governance issues are analysed and discussed. Our case study does not however deal with how external factors such as climate change, eutrophication (e.g. hypoxic bottoms), environmental pollution, invasive species or spreading diseases might contribute to decreasing fish stocks. Although these external pressures do exist, we do not treat them as part of the ârisk of overfishingâ."
251,217,0.983,inter-Group Relations and Migrant integration in European Cities : Changing Neighbourhoods,"There are no well-developed immigrant organizations in the Sagrada FamÃ­lia neighbourhood. There is a Chinese Evangelical church, but it does not seem to interact much with the other organizations in the neighbourhood. There were some attempts to set up a Peruvian immigrantsâ association, but ultimately it was transferred to another neighbourhood. In a way, it is possible to acknowledge a sort of isomorphism in Sagrada FamÃ­lia: the relative low degree of immigrant participation in associations is similar to the relative low degree of native participation. However, some organizations have become meeting places for immigrants and natives alike. One example is the Multicultural Interaction Group (Grup dâInteracciÃ³ Multicultural, GIM),8 an organization located in a socio-cultural space called Espai 210 that seems to be the most prominent of its kind in the entire neighbourhood (see Photos Figs. 7 and 8). Its core activities include organizing cultural activities and fighting stereotypes. Immigrants of Latin American origin (Peruvian, Cuban, and Argentinian) are especially active in the organization. There is a space for newcomersâ integration in the neighbourhoodâs public library. But what seems particularly important and effective in promoting integration is the coexistence in one single building of a public library, a civic centre, the local market place, social services, an excursionistsâ club and other organizations which are all located side by side. In this building, one can gain access to cultural and educational services, free internet, a variety of organized activities and everyday basics such as shopping. The result is an area of encounter that fosters everyday interactions, albeit often superficial, between immigrants and natives. Furthermore, some of the activities (e.g. Chinese New Yearâs celebration) held in the Civic Centre seem to also have a significant and positive role in promoting immigrant participation.

169,407,0.983,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The European Water Framework Directive (WFD; European Commission 2000) introduced a new focus in river management by putting the protection and restoration of the aquatic environment as a key issue on the water policy agenda. This expanded emphasis on restoration activities reï¬ects global efforts to make river management more sustainable by better integrating policy and science to harmonize engineering, ecological, and social concerns in governing river basins. Over the last 20â30 years, several management frameworks such as Integrated River Basin Management (IRBM) or adaptive management (AM) have been developed in a series of separate, parallel experiments to achieve these goals. While speciï¬c details may vary, most of these management lineages converged on broadly common ways to sustainably manage natural resources and human activities in river basins in an integrated, interdisciplinary approach. The need to put restoration and conservation activities in a social context is increasingly considered mandatory in recent management programs (see Chap. 16). What Is Meant by Restoration? Various deï¬nitions illustrate how diverse restoration activities are perceived and implemented as ârestoration,â based on a different, partly contrasting understanding of the general objectives and the methods of restoring river ecosystems.

There are moves towards this outcome, but it is currently far from resolved. In recent years there have been attempts from different organizations to develop global frameworks. In 2012, the International Council for Laboratory Animal Science and the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences updated their International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals (CIOMS and ICLAS 2012). These principles incorporate the Three Rs and are intended to serve as a framework of responsibility for all countries, including those with emerging research programmes. â¢ In the absence of a global code of conduct, there will inevitably be variations in standards, regulations, legislation, scientiï¬c integrity, data validity and humane practices.

341,173,0.983,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Abstract Rapid urbanisation, growing urban populations, environmental issues and climate change all represent significant challenges for water resource management, the delivery of essential water and sanitation services and environmental protection. As a result, traditional approaches that have relied heavily on large-scale infrastructure development are making way for new approaches such as the portfolio-based approach to planning and management. In an urban context, this includes integration of all components of the urban water cycle, and most state governments in Australia have embarked on implementing this integrated approach by having a mix of water supply sources including demand management and conservation measures. However, effective implementation of this approach depends on policies and regulations and encounters various impediments. Accordingly this chapter focuses on the City of Adelaide in South Australia and explores the legal and policy challenges for implementing an integrated urban water management plan in Metropolitan Adelaide. Drawing on the results of governance studies carried out in Australia that included a literature review, stakeholder and community surveys, the chapter attempts to better understand the barriers to transitioning Adelaide to a water-sensitive city.

REDD is based on the idea that it is possible to reduce deforestation by offering economic compensation to forest users for not changing the use of forestlands. It is seen as a winâwin approach that would potentially address the trade-offs between forest conservation and economic development. Some analysts claim that REDD projects have the potential to generate enough money to end deforestation in tropical countries (Nepstad et al., 2009). Although originally presented as an âapoliticalâ technological ï¬x (cf. Li, 2007), REDD has encountered much criticism, and early proposals faced ï¬erce political resistance. The neoliberal idea of the commodiï¬cation of nature seemed repellent to individuals and even to countries, which fear that developed countries would use their economic power to increase or leave unaddressed their carbon emissions at the expense of developing countries. There were also fears that REDD would beneï¬t actors who have historically been responsible for deforestation, such as ranchers and large-scale farmers, while excluding the less privileged forest-dwellers, who cannot bear the transaction costs of carbon markets and do not even have the title to their lands (Boyd, Gutierrez and Chang, 2007; Blom, Sunderland and Murdiyarso, 2010). REDD proved to be much more complex than a simple carbon-market arrangement. Since it is a project âin the makingâ, it necessarily leaves room for bargaining and negotiations as to how forest and climate policies will take shape in speciï¬c contexts. As a result, REDD quickly moved from strictly carbon storage to having multiple objectives, including biodiversity conservation and the enhancement of local livelihoods (Angelsen and McNeill, 2012). This even more complex mechanism is not yet settled. There are important struggles at international, national and local levels to deï¬ne how REDD should be implemented. REDD can be seen as a multilevel project of environmental governance. By environmental governance we mean âa set of mechanisms, formal and informal institutions and practices by way of which social order is produced through controlling that which is related to the environment and natural resourcesâ (Bull and Aguilar-StÃ¸en, 2015: 5). Some decisions regarding REDD are taken at the global level, other decisions are taken at the national level and ï¬nally actions, projects and initiatives are implemented at the local level. This complexity might result in the hybridization of REDD, and, as the idea is appropriated by different"

While such result cannot be immediately achieved and nor could the very process be described as being tangible, the very membership of, communication, interaction, dialogue and exchange between developed and developing countries in international and regional multilateral development banks as well as on a bilateral basis can keep the relationship alive, improve it, restore it and move it to a next level once the conditions are right so that international standards may effectively resort effect within different regions. Before we discuss how such relationships within the AIIB can underpin the normativity of human rights and environmental standards within such regional setting, weâll briefly focus on how China in its domestic jurisdiction imposed a number of responsibilities upon the banking sector in incorporating labour and environmental rights in their ï¬nancial policies and activities. From 1995 onwards, the Peopleâs Bank of China and the State Environmental Protection Administration respectively issued their âAnnouncement on Credit Policy for Environmental Protectionâ and âAnnouncement on Making Use of Credit Policy for Promoting Environmental Protectionâ. In reality, the national economic growth targets however have often trumped those measures. Nonetheless, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Peopleâs Bank of China and the China Banking Regulatory Commission issued another statement in 2004, namely the âAnnouncement on Further Strengthening Industrial Policy and Credit Policy to Control Credit Risksâ. The annex to this document restricted and banned different polluting industries. In 2005 and 2006, the State Council respectively adopted the âRegulation on Accelerating Adjustment of Industrial Structureâ and the âAnnouncement on Accelerating Adjustment of Industrial Structure with Excess Capacityâ. They only restricted loans for those projects that suffered from heavy pollution. The ï¬nancial industry was not provided with any guidance nor imposed speciï¬c duties to assume due diligence in granting and monitoring loans and to identify environmental hazards.36 Nonetheless, the Ministry of Environmental Protection adopted in 2007 its ï¬rst real âGreen Credit Policyâ which accounted for environmental standards in bank lending. The China Bank Association further advanced such measures in its voluntary codes of conduct ever since 2009. Those âGuidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility for the Chinese Banking Sectorâ demanded from banks to assume social and environmental responsibility at a time when China was gearing its industrial policies towards innovation in the ï¬rst place.37 In terms of its international climate commitments, in September 2016âprior to the G20 Hangzhou meeting in the same monthâChina together with the US have also ratiï¬ed the Paris Agreement which was earlier on adopted within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2015.

395,48,0.983,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"Abstract Constructing rules for work that foster both health and safety and efï¬cient production entails, in many organisations, the introduction of procedures, tools and techniques implemented by specialists. The purpose of this is to combat the amateur practices and lack of expertise supposedly found not only amongst employees, but also in their managers. This chapter argues that, on the contrary, ï¬eld managers possess knowledge about working conditions and are actors who are necessarily involved in organising those conditions as well as the work of their teams. In so doing, they protect employees from or expose them to the real and varying circumstances of work. This is the role that needs to be reinforced in order for safety rules to become a real part of work cultures and working practices. However, the forms of power in organisations increasingly limit the recognition of this expertise in the work of managers. The chapter advocates the importance of giving managers power to set situated organisational rules, instead of making these the exclusive prerogative of central management departments.

126,355,0.983,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"The ICESCR (Covenant) constitutes a multilateral treaty committing State parties to work toward the granting of economic, social and cultural rights to individuals. It formally recognizes the human right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food, freedom from hunger and health, among other rights. The Covenant also speciï¬es the steps to be undertaken by all State parties in order to realize those rights. The Covenant has 164 State parties and is legally binding of all States signing and ratifying it. (The United States, along with Myanmar, for example, has signed but not ratiï¬ed the treaty.) Both Kenya and Ethiopia have signed and ratiï¬ed the ICESCRâ in 1972 and 1993, respectively. Those Articles of the Covenant most pertinent to the human rights noted above include the following. âArticle 1(2): In no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence. âArticle 2(1): âEach State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.â [Emphasis added. Note: âachieving progressively the full realization of the rights...â clearly implies no backsliding, or regressing.]. âArticle 11(1): âThe State parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. [Emphases added]. âArticle 12 (1, 2): âThe States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.â and The steps to be taken by the States Parties to the present Covenant to achieve the full realization of this right shall include those necessary for...âThe prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.â â¢ The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) was established in 1985 to interpret speciï¬c Articles of the Covenant and to monitor its implementation by States parties. Established by U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Resolution 1985/17, the CESCR has 18 independent experts assigned these tasks. All State parties are required to present regular reports to the CESCR regarding their compliance with the rights established by the Covenant, whereupon the Committee carries out a multistage process of evaluation and subsequent dialogue with member States. Critics note the lack of effective U.N. oversight, largely due to insufï¬cient funding and vulnerability to political pressures. A series of General Comments are issued by the CESCR, two of which have critical implications in a consideration of human rights violations in the transboundary region. â¢ The Right to Food: CESCR General Comment 12. The CESCR's General Comment 12, issued in 1999, was largely in response to member Statesâ requests following the 1996 World Food Conference for clariï¬cation of Article 11 of the Covenant concerning food. Follow-through meetings at the OHCHR and the FAO regarding the human right to food also contributed to the need for clariï¬cation. Most notable in the General Comment (GC 12) is the statement afï¬rming the normative content of the Covenantâs Article 11, paragraphs 1 and 2. ââThe right to adequate food is realized when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, have physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurementâ [Emphasis added.] Further interpreting Article 11 of the Covenant, General Comment 12 (GC 12) states, ââThe right to adequate food, like any other human right, imposes three types or levels of obligations on States parties: the obligations to respect, to protect and to fulï¬l... The obligation to respect existing access to adequate food requires States parties not to take any measures that result in preventing such access. The obligation to protect requires measures by the State to ensure that enterprises or individuals do not deprive individuals of their access to adequate food. The obligation to fulï¬l means the State must proactively engage in activities intended to strengthen peopleâs access to and utilization of resources and means to ensure their livelihood, including food security.â (Section 15; Emphases added.]"

181,339,0.983,Global Perspectives On Recognising Non-Formal and informal Learning : Why Recognition Matters (Volume 21.0),"Communicating Opportunities Presented by RVA to Stakeholders The generally low level of awareness and understanding of RVA is another challenge. Researchers claim that the concept and the opportunities it presents are still not well known among potential users and prioritised groups. Sometimes training providers are unable to classify knowledge acquired through formal, non-formal and informal learning adequately. Rather, as Germany reports, they should be able to tailor courses on offer and teaching methods to reflect previous learning. Appropriate teaching methods should be developed to promote the intended informal learning so as to create at the same time a systematic link between different forms of learning (Germany. National Commission for UNESCO 2011). The need to ensure that recognised learning is fully taken into account by providers rather than repeated by developing tailor-made courses has been highlighted by Norway. Denmark emphasises the need for greater awareness of recognition schemes and their benefits among potential users, including citizens, businesses and their employees, education and training providers, voluntary associations and social partner organisations in the labour market (Andersen and Aagaard 2013). Norway and Denmark advocate the development of a trusted RVA system based on the cooperation of sectors and stakeholders. Both countries seek to raise awareness of good practice among stakeholders. In Norway, although validation and recognition of non-formal and informal learning is implemented in the educational system, discussions with industry stakeholders and individuals who could profit from validation continue. Norwegian agencies showcase good practice in an effort to strike a balance between the ideals of validation and the traditional attitude that formal education is the best form of learning. Mauritius is focusing on a communication strategy to expose major stakeholders to international RVA best practice. South Africa will put in place a national co-ordinated strategy with the appropriate resources (Samuels 2013). This will be important to implement RVA on a massive scale in South Africa. Cultural barriers at the official level have been highlighted in several developing countries.

Apprenticeships and other work-based learning models could also play an important role. The expansion of these programs, through the replicating and scaling of apparently successful models, would once again need to occur mostly at the state and local levels. A variety of states are already moving in this direction, working with major employers to increase education and training options for work in their industries.34 The federal government could, once again, play a more useful role in this process. By distributing roughly $1 billion in funding to states and localities through the Perkins Act, the federal agencies already have a vehicle through which they can encourage the adoption of higher-quality CTE models with more universal appeal. Recently proposed reforms to Perkins (U.S. Department of Education 2012a) would help such an effort, though there is always resistance from the CTE community to implementing them.35 The Labor Departmentâs Youth Career Connect grants could also encourage this process. And the Obama administrationâs recent announcement of a grants program to encourage apprenticeship (Wilson 2014) could also be the first of a number of steps to expand them as well."
303,279,0.983,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"This is not necessarily the case. University teachers in Japan are often criticized for being insular and inward-looking. Some are even opposed to having students study abroad (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2012). Unlike in many other developed countries, where competition and deregulation have led to enormousâat times incredulousâchanges, today in Japan the notion of promotion based on seniority and lifetime employment, hinder greater openness and innovation (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2013a). Further, a lack of commitment by university leaders means that this trend will likely continue for the immediate future. Actively advertising internationally is one option, yet it requires a system in place to accommodate such talent as well as the ability for them to offer classes in, once again, English. Yet the creation of such a system is predicated on acquiring consensus and recognition among the Japanese populace that their country is now a multicultural society. This in turn requires an education system that actively acknowledges such a concept and educates accordingly. As a recent editorial in The Japan Times (2013) stated: Unfortunately, even when the curriculum is globalized and when broadening experiences like study abroad are undertaken, the teaching methods at most universities, as well as secondary schools, remain mired in one-way, teacher-centered approaches that do not help students acquire confidence, communication skills or a broader understanding that they need for engaging in international situations. In an effort to bring greater clarity to the needs of global jinzai, a number of reports have already been released. A mid-term report released by the LDPâs Financial Reform Group recommends doubling the present number of native English speaking teachers in Japan to 10,000 within three years, and to be able to send one to every elementary, junior, and senior high school in the country within ten years (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, 2013c). Similarly, as mentioned above, MEXT recommends increasing the number of foreign faculty in Japanâs universities (although no concrete plans or details have been made yet) in plans which resemble the oyatoi gaikokujin (hired foreigners) project of the Meiji era, and consequently the hope of it leading to lasting changes is remote. Once again, the focus is on English and the concern is about reforming universities and on general language skills in particular. In terms of systematic changes, a number of issues are pertinent. The development of global jinzai requires an international curriculum, and it is here too that the link with internationalization is again apparent."

A more specific external logic lay in the shape of the UK economy. Despite several years of relative prosperity, the UK is essentially a uni-nodal economy with a very strong concentration of activity in London and the South East. This is also reflected in scientific investment â the Golden Triangle mentioned above and most public and privatised government laboratories. Other cities have lacked economic dynamism and past generations of regional policy have failed to make any real impact. Greater Manchester has been seen as the main national success case in terms of regeneration, based on a highly coordinated strategy among local authorities working with business and professional leaders. Cultural and sporting institutions (including hosting the Commonwealth Games â a sporting event second only to the Olympics â and the world-brand of Manchester United Football Club more recently joined by Manchester City F.C.) have featured strongly in a shift from traditional industries to a service-based economy. The city region has been giving progressively more importance to placing science and technology and the creative sectors at the core of its economic development strategy. However, to pursue a strategy of a sustainable transition to a knowledge-based economy the city-region would need access to a world class academic institution, driving change through contributions from its research and training activities. In the light of these challenges a Joint Working Group was established by the leadership of the two universities. The Group was independently chaired by Dr John Beacham, a former ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) executive and government adviser with regional affiliations. There were four members from each institution. Its remit was âto consider various ways to develop a closer relationship between UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester in order to build on existing strengths, with the aim of achieving world class standing in research, scholarship and teaching across a broad range of disciplinesâ. The group was founded after informal discussions had taken place between the chairs of each of the universitiesâ governing bodies. It did not consult with wider groups of staff until after it had reported. The group considered several options for the way forward. The âstatus quoâ of no increased cooperation was regarded as a base case which was not acceptable in itself but would be used as a reference point against which to judge other options.4 The other options were: â¢ Grassroots collaboration: separate institutions but encouraging individual academics to collaborate in research or teaching.

International aid organizations, particularly multilateral development banks and major bilateral agencies, have for years held comparable enthusiasm for large dam and dam linked basin projects in Africa. The large size of loans extended for megadam developmentâwell into the billions of dollars when dam-enabled projects are included, as well as the conditions attached to themâprovide major donor countries and banks with opportunity for continued or expanded economic and political leverage in African nations along with major investment opportunities, access to natural resources and other beneï¬ts. Such developments are sometimes closely related to geostrategic objectives vital to donor country foreign policy. Finally, rapid and deï¬nitive regional economic âintegrationââa major objective in foreign aid policiesâcan be rapidly advanced by dams generating hydroelectricity, along with major new infrastructure construction serving new industrialization, agro-industry and expansion of extractive industry interests. Although most African river basins have been considered with reference to individual countries, a high proportion of them are actually transboundary in characterâfar more than the United Nations has ofï¬cially recognized. In addition to major rivers that flow across national boundaries in eastern Africa, numerous others terminate at the Indian Ocean where their altered character has profound impacts on the biophysical, ï¬sheries and other dimensions of coastal systems that extend across national boundaries. â¢ A major boom in river basin development unfolded within Africa in the post World War II yearsâone primarily under the auspices of international aid programs as the regionâs nations became independent from their colonial administrations. This boom in development was dominated by the United States for years, since its economy and domestic experience at the end of the war fostered strong incentive as well as potential to move its dam-building approach and expertise to Africa, Asia and Latin America. This dominance in African basin development lasted until a number of European nations also took on major roles in dam-building in the 1970s. The U.S. modeled its approach after its own Hoover dam and Grand Coulee dam (at the Nevada-Arizona border and in Washington state, respectively) and its Tennessee Valley Authorityâa U.S. government owned entity created by the U.S. Congress in 1933 to oversee river basin development.1 A highly controversial and centralized planning effort introduced as part of President Franklin D. Rooseveltâs New Deal, the TVA was broad spectrum in its roles which ranged among major dam construction, water and land policy coordination and management, and numerous other basin development initiatives, including agricultural ones. These developments were part of a new centralized planning under President Rooseveltâs New Deal that included elevating water resource policy to a key executive concern, with strong emphasis on âharnessingâ energy and promoting economic development. The rise of a new âtechno-managerialâ approach to water resources and river basin development emerged as a major fulcrum of economic expansion in a market economy. This new wave had clearly already swept up some of the most prominent water resource economists, geographers and other scientists and technicians.2 â¢ The most ardent critics of major dam and basin developments have long pointed to their major social and environmental problems and injustices, including the human rights violations that have accompanied them. Denial of U.N. recognized human rightsâincluding rights to water, health, livelihood, and freedom from forced relocation and political repression is widespread in river basin developments within Africa. In many ways, they parallel the many controversies occurring since the 1980s, in particular, between river basin developeers and their critics. However, these rights violations take an extreme form in the lowermost Omo River basin and northern Lake Turkana region, as detailed in the next chapters."

We know that in most African countries, men and women maintain separate budgets. However, women cannot always control their own monetary income and are required to use it more often for general family needs. As there is no uniform household welfare, women rely on extrahousehold cooperation and transfers (Laaser 2005; Wanzala 2001). It is important to consider special arrangements of how production and consumption units overlap and transcend the domestic unit. This is the case in polygynous families, for example, in which the economic relationships can be rather diverse. In most African countries, policies are still handling gender according to the classical âWomen in Developmentâ (WID) approach that looks at the ârole of womenâ and views them as housewives instead of producers. Thus, many opportunities and efficient economic policies are lost, including not only the typical âaccess to xyzâ approaches that ignore the typical link between the reproductive and productive sectors but also âincome generating activitiesâ, which seek to assist all women by means of microcredit schemes. The proponents of these projects stress that women are better when it comes to repayment. It can be assumed that one of the main economic problems in Africa continues to be how to overcome the disruption of the embedded economy caused by âmodernâ approaches (this corresponds to the Boserupian preoccupation). The term âwomenâs issuesâ might represent important gender specificities and concerns, but this makes us follow a dual instead of relational gender approach. Relations or interface/interaction between the subsistence-market, the reproductiveproductive sector, and the inter-household relations (apart from gendered intrahousehold relations), in short, the meso level, are needed to link micro and macro and understand the gendered fields of economic activity. The challenge is how to analyse all development fields in a dynamic, gendered way. When using an interface approach, attention is paid to interactions between different fields, groups, institutions, co-operation arrangements (e.g. in the field of technology), brokers, and the flexible organisation of work, as well as analyses of the concrete risks of market integration. This is true even if the markets are socially organised and follow very diverse logic (see e.g. women traders in Sudanese markets, Nageeb 2001; buyem sellem, the female vendors of food staff in Cameroon, Batana 2007). The social organisation of resource management and the allocation of resources in different sectors (in programmes and projects in the sphere of agriculture) are also interesting. In these sectors, women are often excluded but develop hidden strategies that then enable them to edge in and make use of new economic opportunities, such as collective forms of land tenure and collateral when taking credit (see irrigation schemes in Ghana, Becher 2001). Therefore, one can envision an approach starting from Womanâs Role in Development (Boserup 1970) to gender analysis to engendering development. Boserup considered the dynamics of transformation (Boserup 1965, 1981, 1982). This approach would be transformative with regard to examining processes and development policies (Kabeer 1994). The negotiation of underlying gender order(s) is studied in respect to changing gender constructs and relations, such as empowerment, in translocal arenas by various societal forces."

128,18,0.983,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"It remains to be said that 60 years of European integration have gradually established feelings of belongingness to the European community, enabled shared identification with European institutions, as well as European and cosmopolitan identities (Delanty and Rumford 2005; Beck and Grande 2007). Moreover, European integration has furthered cross-national experiences and contacts among citizens, as well as transnational trust between European peoples (Delhey 2007). Finally, public opinion polls show that, in the midst of the European crisis, a majority of respondents still agree that it is desirable to give financial help to other countries in the name of European solidarity between member states (see Eurobarometer 2011; Lengfeld et al. 2012). The same is true for the readiness of European citizens to support a fair burden sharing in regard to refugees, if this is necessary to uphold the achievements of the European Union, such as Schengen (de Vries and Hoffmann 2016). This book tries to systematically shed light into this debate by presenting findings of a population survey among citizens of eight European countries, namely, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The survey was conducted in the context of an EU-funded research project devoted to the study of European solidarity (âEuropean Paths to Transnational Solidarity in Times of CrisisââTransSOL). TransSOL aimed to increase knowledge about solidarity within the general population, organized civil society, and the media. The consortium consisted of members from the following institutions: the University of Siegen (Germany), the UniversitÃ© de GenÃ¨ve (Switzerland), the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques (France), the Glasgow Caledonian University (United Kingdom), the University Panepistimio Kritis (Greece), the University of Florence (Italy), the University of Warsaw (Poland), the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), the University of Sheffield (United Kingdom), and European Alternatives Ltd.

The aim of the survey was to build a comparative dataset that would allow us to measure levels of solidarity among the member statesâ citizenry and to help identify those social and political factors that might promote or inhibit solidarity both within the member states and across their borders.

As mentioned, it is strategically important to have a clear view on several issues related to the fulfillment of the third mission: â The strategic position and the values of the third mission within the university. â The respective weights of regional, national, and international societal interaction. â The priority of third mission fields and activities of the university. â Possible partnerships in third mission activities. â Measurement, assessment, and incentives for the third mission. Such issues can and should be regularly discussed with the IAB. In particular, an international board may usefully contribute to the analysis of the role of societal interaction in the process of the universityâs internationalization. In addition to strategic discussions, the IAB may offer help and support in identifying and locating suitable international partners and networks and worthwhile targets for service to foreign societies and mankind. One fundamental aim of the strategic plan of King Abdulaziz University was âto promote the Universityâs partnerships with distinguished scientific, research and industrial institutionsâ [10]. The IAB was appointed to support the university in this respect. An IAB is expected to, and should be expected to, have an impact on the discussions and developments of strategic issues, such as have been discussed in the present chapter. The IAB of King Abdulaziz University hopes that it has, at least to some extent, managed to fulfill the expectations of its host in this respect."
293,10,0.983,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","sending states in immigration and integration processes. In that sense, this book should be understood as a state-of-the-art volume that takes stock of and presents existing knowledge to assess the relevance of incorporating the sending states into analyses of immigrantsâ integration processes and policies. In line with recent approaches to the concept of integration, Chap. 2 by Penninx and GarcÃ©s-MascareÃ±as sets up an analytical framework for the study of integration processes and policies. The first part focuses on the concept of integration, introducing an open, non-normative analytical definition and identifying the main dimensions, parties involved, levels of analysis, and other relevant factors such as time and generations. The second part defines integration policies and proposes a distinction between policy frames and concrete policy measures as well as a shift from government to governance so as to account for the complex, multilayered and often contradictory character of integration policies. In the broader context of this book, the analytical framework proposed in this chapter leads us to a twofold conclusion: the concept of integration and integration policies is made dramatically more complex, in particular, by taking a disaggregated approach that considers not only multiple reference populations but also distinct processes occurring in different dimensions and domains. At the same time, immigrantsâ integration continues to be seen essentially as a two-way process involving the immigrants themselves and the receiving society. In Chap. 3, Van Mol and De Valk provide a general background to help us to understand the first key actor of the abovementioned binomial, that is, the immigrants themselves. In particular, the authors analyse the main socio-demographic changes in migration patterns towards and within Europe since the 1950s. Making use of secondary literature and available statistical data, they first describe the main phases in immigration, its backgrounds and determinants, depending on immigrantsâ origins and reasons to migrate and with regard to different European regions. In the second part of the chapter, the authors narrow the focus to the specificities of recent patterns of mobility within Europe. Analysing both migration flows and the residing migrant population across Europe, they distinguish different sociodemographic characteristics of migrants depending on countries of origin and destination. For instance, while Polish migration to Germany seems to be dominated by men aged between 20 and 50 years old, Polish immigrants in the Netherlands are significantly younger and more equally balanced in terms of gender. The analysis of intra-European mobility shows that in North-Western Europe (e.g., in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands) intra-European migrants account for more than the half of total immigration, meaning that a substantial proportion of new immigrants falls outside those categorized as target groups of EU integration policies. The subsequent three chapters focus on the second actor of the binomial, that is, the receiving society, particularly the characteristics and main developments of immigration and integration policies. In Chap. 4, Doomernik and Bruquetas-Callejo distinguish between different immigration and integration policy regimes in Europe. The first is that of North-Western European countries, which evolved from guest worker policies that considered immigrants only as temporary workers to national integration policies that recognize them as permanent citizens and, more recently, to"
221,257,0.983,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"This chapter examines selected case studies which represent âbest practiceâ vis-a-vis sustainable low-carbon transport policies, measures, technologies, and investments in India. The term âbest practiceâ is used contextually. The central idea for this chapter is not to look for a perfect blueprint of a policy or plan but to critically evaluate what has been or is being implemented and is proven to work. The key âbest practiceâ criteria considered in assessing the case studies are clear vision, assessment of delivered or demonstrated co-benefits of low-carbon choices, as well as their replicability and scalability. The case studies are selected, keeping in view the diversity of transport sector and the multiple interfaces of the sector with development and environment. The overarching transport policies are framed, mandated, and facilitated by the national government. The implementation in most cases involves subnational governments or sector-specific departments or organizations. The projects are implemented by agencies, including those operated under public-private partnership (PPP). The case studies are therefore selected belonging to both policy and project domains. Successful low-carbon integration between national and subnational governments is essential for successful implementation of policies which requires integration between national policies and subnational initiatives"

The process of the recognition of qualifications as well as language training is financed by the German Federal Government (OECD 2014: 9). The Federal Employment Agency, in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, has established the programme MobiPro EU, which seeks to attract young EU citizens to Germany. Of applicants in 2013, 60 % were Spaniards (RKW 2013, p. 4). The programme, started in 2013 and scheduled to run through 2018, and its website â Job of My Life5 â seeks to promote âvocational mobility of young EU citizens in the European labour market â¦ to contribute to a reduction in youth unemployment in Europe and to obtain and secure skilled workers in Germanyâ (BMAS 2014, no pagination). The programme covers German language training in the home country, an introductory internship in Germany and further language training â since increased â among other benefits (BMAS 2014; BÃ¶cking 2014). Effort is made, both on the German and migrant side, to achieve success in these migrations. As one migrant said, âWe have two apprenticeshipsâ â language training and the actual training â (BÃ¶cking 2014). It is unclear how many of the Southern European migrants have been recruited or have spontaneously migrated; exact records are not kept (SVR 2013: 95). The same mechanism which facilitates recruitment by German regions, cities, companies and trade and industry chambers, namely the free movement of workers within the EU, also facilitates spontaneous migration."

Lao employment agencies are relatively new actors in the emerging Lao migration regime, hence the empirical prevalence of migration through employment agencies remains low. Yet a focus on this particular intervention is justified by the important role attributed to such agencies globally and within the Lao Peopleâs Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). In addition, the Lao-Thai case fits the purpose of this chapter since it constitutes a case in which concerns about migrant safety are highly gendered, yet responded to in seemingly gender-neutral terms. Moreover, a focus on Lao PDR contributes to filling important knowledge gaps on migration research in the GMS, which has so far paid little attention to Lao migration. The few studies doing so typically focus on Lao migrants at their destination in Thailand without linking this to research at their sites of origin. The chapter is organized as follows. The next section briefly explains the methodology and data sources before moving on to a discussion of the emerging body of work on masculinities and migration and its relevance for the Lao case discussed here. This is followed by a multi-scalar analysis of the introduction of Lao employment agencies as situated in the emerging Lao migration regime. Having mapped the discursive and politico-economic architecture of the Lao migration regimes, the final sections of the chapter unravel the gendered working of employment agencies. This is done by focusing on the gendered construction of categories of migrants and legitimate migrant work, complemented with analyses of the lived experience of migrating through employment agencies."

Reforms in different countries have focused on different areas, and allowed different levels of autonomy. Some changes are substantial, while others are more procedural. Autonomous universities generally enjoy greater freedom in setting their own policies, managing ï¬nance and human resources, as well as determining academic structures, programs and courses. As the general trend of higher education reforms in all the SEA countries involves movement towards granting greater autonomy to HEIs, the discussion in this section focuses on the governance structures of the new forms of HEIs, and the scope and level of institutional autonomy. Four key areas of autonomy are discussed below with examples from different countries in the regionâgovernance structures, ï¬nance and budget, personnel management, and academic matters."

(2012) call for recognizing urban GI as an important category of EbA strategies that are specifically appropriate within cities worldwide. Similar to NbS, GI is also a broad concept as recent work has shown (Rouse and Bunster-Ossa 2013, Davies et al. 2015) but it has its roots in planning and thus adds a spatial perspective to the concepts of NbS and EbA. Its application to urban settings may be considered as an approach for strategic planning of NbS, which is founded in principles of multifunctionality and connectivity (e.g., Hansen et al. 2016). GI can thus help to integrate NbS, EbA and not least ESS into the realm of urban planning with its established repertoire of instruments. In turn, national policies, such as the US Clean Water Act, have proven to be strong drivers for mainstreaming the GI concept into urban development (Rouse and Bunster-Ossa 2013). Consequently, so-called âstormwater GIâ has become more and more widespread in the USA. Swedish policies for ESS, on the other hand, have been shown to drive the adoption of EbA at municipal level (Wamsler and Pauleit 2016). Furthermore, expanding governance-based approaches for GI may also advance the development and implementation of NbS via activities initiated by civil society at large (Buijs et al. 2016). In turn, GI may benefit from closely connecting it to the NbS and EbA discourses to re-emphasise the importance of biodiversity. From this, we argue that NbS and EbA can make a significant change to current practice of urban development but core principles of the concepts should be more clearly articulated. A mere re-labelling of business as usual under the new concept of NbS would risk to discredit these concepts, on the other hand (Reid 2016). Therefore, the rapidly developing body of theory and methods of ESS and GI as well as evidence from their application should be recognised in further developing NbS as a concept. Moreover, emphasising the links to GI as planning approach and ESS as an approach to assess natureâs benefits can promote systematic integration of NbS in urban development (Vierikko and NiemelÃ¤ 2016; Hansen and Pauleit 2014. Conversely, it has been suggested that the NbS approach complements the ESS framework because it promotes (and relies more on) biodiversity to increase the resistance and resilience of soci-ecological systems to global changes (Eggermont et al. 2015)."
97,379,0.983,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","todayâs ever more differentiated and diverse urban societies. How does one cope with different, diverging or even opposing wants and needs? How can different views on urban nature and green developments be integrated? Who defines what benefits, qualities, good and healthy urban life are at all? How does one cope with the uneven integration of people into participative and opinion-building processes? In the literature on UES, e.g., there are some studies that point to different perceptions, wants and needs of urban dwellers (e.g. Botzat et al. 2016; Gentin 2011) as well as their different opportunities to make use of or benefit from urban nature (Jones et al. 2009). There is a need to link the NBS or âgreenâ debate with (social science based) debates on urban diversity, inequalities, capabilities, and (in)justice. Existing studies on UGI, UES and NBS have so far a bias with regard to the views and perceptions of middle-class inhabitants and the needs and wants of specific (environment-minded) lifestyle groups; this largely by-passes the views of various precarious population groups including the unemployed, poor families, alternative subcultures, migrants, other minorities (see Berbes-Blazques et al. 2016). The ecogentrification debate, again, considers this fact, stating that ecological projects or solutions often designated for a bourgeois aesthetic (Dooling 2009) and that urban gardening and farms picture a niche or âglossy representations of sustainabilityâ (Steinberg 2015). By and large, the views of low-income groups or people not taking part in participatory events tend to be less considered when discussing on green developments, the potentials of UES or NBS as solutions for a sustainable neighbourhood development. If we really want to understand the potential of NBS for contributing to social cohesion, communication, empowerment, reduction of inequities etc., we must acknowledge the wide range of potentially opposing perceptions, wants and needs. The development of a more differentiated view and, as explored by Low (2013), the consideration of matters of distributional (Is there green space for all and a fair allocation?), procedural (Is there a fair access to green space?) and interactional justice (Does the green space allow for all to interact safely?) when creating and implementing NBS such as parks, playgrounds or other types of open space would be a large progress for the whole debate on NBS and would it make more than just a middle-class discussion. Solutions that directly address the needs of disadvantaged groups would offer an incentive for those people to get involved and would directly contribute to social inclusiveness. Particularly now, in a situation where most larger European cities are seeing new waves of in-migration and immigration including international migrants and (non-European) refugees, the question of how different parts of urban society look at urban nature and how this nature can be employed for different needs and wants, long-term or even temporary, seems to be crucial. It remains to be seen whether the NBS concept has the capacity to develop such a differentiated view. Thesis 5 NBS as they are discussed run the risk to get overloaded regarding their capacities to respond to societal questions and to be easily transferable."

At a fundamental level, this is a challenge to the traditional dynamics of NorthSouth models of collaboration. The global flow of ideas in the realm of health is by no means new, though typically only tacitly acknowledged when flowing in âreverse.â Given the ever-present community-academic and North-South imbalances, the Pan Institution Network for Global Health (PINGH)1 employs a participatory governance and research approach to bring a balance of power by featuring local stakeholders as content and context experts. First, PINGH has a rotating governance structure. Each university partner has a champion who represents his/her institution for all PINGH activities. Second, leadership rotates on a three-year cycle. Each institution takes turns leading PINGH initiatives as well as hosting the annual PINGH collaborative meeting, in order to offer an opportunity for all PINGH members to experience and gain insight on the institutional and local cultures of each PINGH member and to defray costs of hosting the meeting for any one institution. These activities also insure participation and contribution from all PINGH members in the global North and South. To promote inclusivity, we invite community stakeholders to our annual meetings to ensure that PINGH objectives are relevant to the local communities in which PINGH institutional members serve. Local NGOs, government policy makers, and other local stakeholders have attended PINGH meetings to help our partners reflect and strategize on how global health research and capacity building can be translated to local policy and practice. Our approach to community stakeholder involvement is discussed in further detail in this chapter."

However, the EEA remained largely in a âreviewâ position (e.g., around tariff proposals), subject to the Council of Ministers. The EPA was âupgradedâ in 2013, from a proposal by the Prime Ministerâ ofï¬ce, to become the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Forestry. The former head of the EPA became an advisor to the new environment minister. The former headâs statement to Reuters News in August of 2013 illustrated the EPAâs misinformation and lack of concern for human life and environmental conditions downstream from the dam when he asserted that major dam projects on the Omo River ââ¦will not cut off water supplies downstream nor worsen living conditions for local people.â In the present advanced phase of the Gibe III controversy, the situation regarding accountability of the GOE and development banks policies with respect to the lower Omo River basin remains unchanged. â¢ Reaction by civil society to the Gibe III project was swift and has expanded in recent years. Critics ï¬rst emerged following the GOEâs initiation of the project without any account of the downstream human population and environment, and stepped up their criticism after the GOEâs release of two allegedly âobjective,â or scientiï¬c impact assessments released two years after construction began (GOE 2009a, b). Criticisms and analysis emerged from a variety of non-governmental organizationsâprimarily international ones, given the politically repressive policies of the GOE. Among these organizations were Campagna per la Riforma della Banca Mondiale (CRBM), Survival International, International Rivers, a Kenya-based civil society organization closely afï¬liated with International RiversâFriends of Lake Turkana, Human Rights Watch and the Oakland Institute. Other critics emerging were researchers and policy focused individuals with established familiarity with the region. These included the world-renowned paleontologist and conservationist, Dr. Richard Leakey, Professor David Turton at the University of Oxford (and founder of www.mursi.org), this writer at the University of California, Berkeley, and other members of the Africa Resources Working Group (ARWG) in Africa, Europe and North America. Numerous organizations and individuals within Kenya, as well as in the Ethiopia diaspora have also questioned the project. Overt opposition to the Gibe III dam within Ethiopia is not politically feasible, given the high level of repression and retribution. Numerous reports by these organizations have detailed the major procedural violations and the dire consequences of the Gibe III dam for half a million indigenous people residing downstream from the dam, within Ethiopia and Kenya. Gradually, these concerns have percolated through international policy circles and have been raised periodically by government representatives in Kenya, Europe and the United States. U.S. and European nationsâ diplomatic support and international aid to the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments, however, have effectively precluded effective examination of the humanitarian and human rights disaster looming on the horizon."
78,113,0.982,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"To approach the social dynamic, I propose to refer to institutions viewed as relatively stable formal social structures that are intended to play a role in society. This definition of institutions is sufficiently vague to be discussed, but the purpose here is not to give a precise account of this concept. We just want to examine the social structures in charge of coordinating human activities such as family, school, university, police, justice, etc. Each of those institutions has a function, for instance, the family is concerned with reproduction, the school with education, the police with repression, justice with the punishment of law infringement, etc. To achieve these functions, institutions can be viewed as processors that have tasks at their disposal. For instance, schools provide teaching, justice considers breaches to the law and puts people in jail or makes them pay fines, the police arrest criminals, etc. In ancient times, when people were grouped in tribes, cities or small kingdoms, decisions were centralized in a unique place, the agora, the senate or the monarchâs palace. Using a computer metaphor, we can then assimilate institutions to single processors, eventually to multi-task processors, when the same institution, for instance the agora, has different functions. However, with the geographical extension of political entities, the increasing number of people and the multiplication of tasks, institutions cannot work undivided in one place. They need to split and work in parallel. Therefore, it is possible to analyze institutions as parallel processors."

242,267,0.982,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Abstract Since the late 1990s there has been a rising trend of Vietnamese women migrating to neighbouring countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and China) for marriage. Previous studies of such cross-border marriages have emphasized either issues of choice and agency for women, or their poverty and victimhood. This chapter analyses this trend along the lines of the debate on the East Asian model of welfare and family policy, with case studies in Taiwan and South Korea. It views commercially arranged transnational marriages (CATM) as an institution that connects changing gendered regimes of social reproduction at the sending and receiving ends. Mediated by a combination of asymmetrical relations â gender, class, age, ethnicity, and national belongingâ this institution operates in a transnational space through which material and symbolic resources are circulated. These in turn construct subjectivities and identities for participating actors. There is a dimension of trans-masculinity embodied in the practices of CATM and this requires further exploration regarding informed consent and the rights of its users. Beyond this, CATM should be further analysed in the context of changing family welfare and intergenerational care as gendered regimes, and such an analysis should also address how households adapt and devise new strategies to sustain and reproduce themselves economically, socially, and culturally. Such an understanding can help open the research agenda on social policy and rights and provide a regional perspective. Keywords: Transnational marriages, East Asian family welfare model, gender, social reproduction, care, social policy, ethnicity, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam."
99,129,0.982,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"A related matter to the role of the market in local welfare concerns the role of financial profit as well as for-profit organizations. Both the Social democrats and the Left party have taken a hard stance against financial profit in local welfare in contrast to the opposing right wing political parties, making the funding of social innovations restricted. Regarding the role of local welfare in the redistribution of resources, it would seem as if the Social democrats and the Left party construct the welfare system as primarily an equalizing tool (Social democratic party program 2012; Left party program 2012), whereas the right-wing parties focus more on using the local welfare system to motivate unemployed to enter the labour market (Conservative party program 2012; Liberal party program 2010). An example of the conflict over the redistribution of resources and the role of local welfare concerns the case of child care fees. When the Social democrats and the Left party decided to cut the fee for child care for the poorest households in MalmÃ¶, the opposition argued that lowered fees should not be distributed in such a fashion that they might conflict with motivation to enter the labour market. This example illustrates well the conflict over the role of local welfare in redistribution, as the opposition focused on the consequences for the level of employment in the area, whereas the majority focused child care as a tool for creating more equal living conditions. Moreover, the disagreement regarding redistribution of resources affects the possibilities for social innovations in general to develop, as no or very limited resources from the local welfare regime system were made available for the described three social innovations. We interpret the disagreements on the role of the market and the redistribution of resources in the local welfare regime as an unwillingness to change rather than an inability to change. As described in section 4.1 of this chapter, inability may be understood in terms of constraints related to and competition over scarce resources, established decision processes, and in the inability to perceive the possibility or"
73,268,0.982,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"Cities which protect their hinterlands are likely to be the most economically prosperous this century. The maintenance of physical attractiveness and natural resources will prove to be essential to continued economic innovation, and will make signiï¬cant contributions to wealth, health, personal identity and social harmony in both city and region. The retention of peri-urban agricultural areas will also contribute to the development of more resilient urban food systems. The level of successful interaction of these factors will deï¬ne a liveable and functioning community. Yet governments routinely separate economic, social and environment sectors and fail to use tools within the land use planning system to achieve integration. Governments also separate rural areas from towns, and urban hinterlands from metropolitan areas. Such spatial separation leads to sectoral policies which are as fragmented as the pattern of land ownership. Climate change, environmental degradation, regional population increases and a range of global, national and regional factors are expected to increase pressures on regional resources. Climate change is likely to reduce the resilience of human and natural systems leading to tolerance thresholds being exceeded and vulnerability increased. It is likely to particularly impact the natural systems that underpin food production. The result could be a greatly increased risk of non-linear change over a short period that is both catastrophic and irreversible. However, institutional and policy fragmentation is hampering the ability of governments at all levels to develop anticipatory policies which can assist the peri-urban region to adapt to rapid and fundamental change. In times of rapid change with unpredictable outcomes, the resources of periurban areas may increase in importance. It would seem prudent to maintain the values of peri-urban areas, at least in the short term, during times of increasing change and threat. Integrated regional planning is essential if reciprocal impacts of sectors are to be considered and such planning requires a strong role for governments. A range of subdivision practices based around commercial or residential uses is increasingly being employed in Australian peri-urban areas. However, a return to regulatory practice will need to consider readoption of planning techniques formerly used, included tenement controls, rural lot restructuring and strong subdivision and use controls."

But over the past generation or two, social capital has become more strongly related to human capital; that is, those with limited human capital are even more disadvantaged because they often lack necessary social capital, and those with more human capital tend to have the networks, norms, and behaviors that provide the most benefit in todayâs environment. Educational Testing Serviceâs Opportunity in America initiative defines opportunity as pathways to the development of human and social capital. Those pathways may be more or less open for individuals based on the circumstances into which they are born and the trajectory of their lives. The presence or absence of opportunities to develop human and social capital, as well as the choices individuals make to take advantage (or not) of those opportunities, translate into distinctly different life outcomes and, as the generational cycle continues, lead to differential prospects for their children. This transmission of opportunity from one generation to the next is driven by the dynamics of advantage or disadvantage, with one advantage building upon another for some children, while one disadvantage is compounded by the next for others. The result is diverging destinies that are increasingly defined by circumstances of birth. While birth circumstances have always impacted an individualâs life chances, todayâs children are being born into an America that is increasingly polarized along economic, educational, and social lines, an America where it is harder to make up for early gaps in opportunities to develop human and social capital. This is not in anyoneâs best interests. It not only impacts this generation and the next, but also the very quality of our society and, ultimately, our democracy. This volume is an important part of the ETS initiative, which is designed to advance the national conversation about opportunity in America, as it serves as the empirical undergirding for the other parts. The chapters address a number of topics and perspectives ranging from education and demography to economics and political science. The authors shed light on a variety of issues and challenges regarding inequality of opportunity, but they also offer insights into policies and practices that could help us think anew about how to move in a direction that is more in keeping with our national values and ideals. Of course, it is obvious that a single volume, no matter how rich, cannot hope to capture the full complexity of the current situation. There are multiple forces and policies acting at different levels: supranational, national, regional, and local. Supranational forces like globalization, the accelerating infusion of technology into different workplaces, the increasing power and reach of information and communication technology, and even cultural shifts are not easily tamed at the national level. But other forces are driven by policies adopted by various levels of government. They range from national economic and social welfare policies to state laws governing education funding, collective bargaining and right to work, and local zoning ordinances. These forces interact in complex ways over time that shape trends in opportunity. Moreover, the dynamics play out in systematically different ways depending on location, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Thus, we should always bear in mind that oft-cited national averages can conceal"
99,38,0.982,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"For analyses of how cities cope with current challenges and try to reconcile social and economic policies, urban sociologists nowadays turn to what is called an integrated approach to urban governance (DiGaetano and Strom 2003) that builds on different theoretical perspectives and combines distinctive methodological approaches (DiGaetano and Strom 2003; Kazepov 2005). In their seminal and widely cited article âThe European Cityâ, HÃ¤ussermann and Haila identify four theoretical traditions of urban sociology, each of which provides useful insights into urbanism. In particular, they refer to the work of Georg Simmel, the Chicago School, political economy and the âglobal cityâ perspective. However, they advise against trying to ground empirical urban studies in a single âabstract urban modelâ (HÃ¤ussermann and Haila 2005, p. 43) such as those developed by the Chicago or the Regulation Schools. Instead, in accordance with the work of Bagnasco and Le GalÃ¨s (2000), they underline the specificity of the European city. In the tradition of Max Weber, HÃ¤usermann and Haila argue convincingly that we must acknowledge the special features of European cities that make them distinct from cities in other parts of the world. The most important feature of the European city is its multi-faceted character. In the words of Bagnasco and Le GalÃ¨s, European cities are simultaneously âpolitical and social actors and [â¦] local societiesâ (Bagnasco and Le GalÃ¨s 2000, p. 3). Hence, in contrast to cities in other regions, European cities traditionally constitute stand-alone arenas for policymaking, although there are significant differences with respect to the degree of autonomy European cities enjoy from their respective national governments. In particular, since the heyday of industrialisation and urbanisation in the nineteenth century, the so-called social question has always been a central topic for European cities (Isin 2008, p. 273). In Europe, the welfare state began locally within internal city borders. Since then, the guaranteed provision of public services by city governments has emerged as a further key feature of the distinctiveness of European cities (Kazepov 2005, p. 13). Finally, citizensâ involvement in urban affairs, either through local self-governance or via civil society and its broad spectrum of organisations and initiatives, adds an additional facet to the specific character of the European city. But despite these distinguishing characteristics, European cities also display an impressive variety. Here regional differences and hence cultural"

The village of Pred Nai has successfully re-forested 1,920 ha of mangrove forests that were previously converted into shrimp aquaculture ponds in the mid1980s. The village has set up a community forest committee and a community resource use regulation and management plan in order to regulate, control, and manage the use of resources by community members. In the process of community mangrove forest management, local villagers have been encouraged to participate in every single step of forest management and planning. It is the active involvement of the local people together with the support of the relevant authorities and national institutions that makes the Pred Nai example a success. The article concludes by pointing out the key lessons learned from community-based mangrove forest initiatives in Pred Nai that can be applied in natural disaster risk management processes.

As this chapter has shown, taking a holistic and multidimensional ecosystem perspective requires decision-makers to account for hundreds of different factors. This can only be achieved through intense and ongoing exchanges with ecosystem stakeholders from the respective dimensions. The need for such bottom-up information and co-design of policies is especially pivotal in resource-scarce contexts, where a lack of knowledge of approaches that work in such contexts might tempt policymakers to copy generic policy prescriptions that âworked in the West.â In Kenya, many achievements in kickstarting the ecosystem were driven by practitioners themselves, who took the initiative to open technology hubs and other support institutions. Such stakeholders are an invaluable resource because they already have a good overview of the ecosystem. Policymakers therefore need to put processes in place that enable the engagement of practitioners in the design and continuous refinement of their ecosystem-fostering strategy. Examples for such processes include establishing an open-door culture for ecosystem participants to talk with policymakers as well as regular fixed-day meetings and roundtable discussions that bring together experts from all ecosystem dimensions. Once such processes are in place, policymakers can start launching ongoing rounds of intervention and feedback that facilitate the emergence of an environment that breeds high-growth technology entrepreneurship. 5. Anticipate the challenges and prepare to meet them A dynamic perspective acknowledges that ecosystems face different challenges at different phases and enables participants to prepare for what is coming next. Two challenges that nascent ecosystems may encounter on the way to maturation have emerged. First, the suggested early empowerment of a private sector enterprise to build embryonic telecommunication market structures may later lead to the presence of a powerful incumbent that stifles competition and entrepreneurial efforts. Policymakers should address this from the start, when, for example, negotiating licenses with such a corporation, and find ways to encourage the incumbent to interact with the ecosystem at later stages (also see GSMA 2014). Second, the inflow of foreign ecosystem participants leads to a culturally very diverse entrepreneurship scene. The research presented"

Implemented across seven districts of Uttar Pradesh with a geographical focus on the 300 km stretch of the Ramganga (Kalagarh to Hardoi) and the 900 km stretch of the Ganga (Bijnor to Varanasi), this program envisions Ganga and Ramganga as healthy river systems rich in biodiversity and aims to provide long-term water security to communities, businesses, and nature. This builds on WWF-Indiaâs work in the Ganga basin since 1997 with conservation of aquatic biodiversity and the Living Ganga Program (2007â2012), which developed strategies for sustainable energy and water resource management in a critical stretch of 800 km from Gangotri to Kanpur. To restore the ecological health of the rivers, the program works with a diverse range of stakeholders across academia, government institutions, policy makers, civil society members, local communities, and businesses to implement its multidisciplinary conservation strategy. The involvement of various partners, including religious leaders, government departments, and NGOs, in the project, the improvement in the livelihood of the local people, and the riverine habitat have provided additional acceptability for WWF-Indiaâs work. Awareness of the local community toward the environment has helped greatly in motivating the community to work for conservation and climate change adaptation. Studies on water availability and water quality in the Ganga and Ramganga Rivers are being carried out in order to understand the factors determining the ï¬exibility and resilience of ecosystems, including the habitat preference of species, river connectivity and quality, ï¬ow regimes, disturbances, and mortality of the aquatic biodiversity, especially of Ganges river dolphins, gharials, and freshwater turtles. Under the RfLLfR program, the development of a data base and research through GIS and remote sensing is an extremely valuable asset that will support further research and will help to formulate adaptation strategies where required, with the long-term goal to save the ecosystem. The lessons learned from WWF-Indiaâs intervention, particularly its strategy with regard to garnering support from the local communities, has been widely disseminated and accepted by the government and local people as a replicable model."
93,147,0.982,Nordic Mediation Research,"Declaration of Human Rights (UN), according to which: âEveryone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defenseâ. The fact that the laws are interpreted differently by mediators, police ofï¬cers, prosecutors and judges contributes to legal uncertainty for young offenders. Mediation can be considered as a complement to trial or punishment, as an alternative to punishment or as an alternative punishment. There is no common legal strategy. It is, instead, up to individual professionals to assess. It is not only the formal technical construction of the legislation that the act is constructed as a framework legislation that is problematic, there are also organisational problems. As described, since 2008, all municipalities are under the obligation to offer mediation to offenders below the age of 21. As also have been described, there are, however, a large variation in mediation activity among municipalities. The municipalities are free to organise mediation their own way. Some municipalities have mediation ofï¬ces, others buy these services from other municipalities, and some do not have any mediation services at all (Wahlin and Jacobsson 2017). There are also differences between mediation ofï¬ces, i.e. how they co-operate with other organisations. Some municipalities have given priority for mediation. They have mediators working full time and special mediation training programmes. Their mediators have time to create well-functioning activities, and co-operation with authorities, like the police, the social services, prosecutors and probation ofï¬ces. In other municipalities, social workers mediate as a part of their employment schedule. Other municipalities recruit laymen mediators when needed (ibid.). This means that several offenders, and victims as well, are not getting the chance to mediate at all. This causes legal uncertainty. One of the main reasons can be the absence of a national co-ordinator. This is something that has been brought to discussion. In the government commission (SOU 2000:105) that preceded the Mediation Act, there was a proposal that the National Board of Health and Welfare should be a national co-ordination unit and responsible for training, quality assurance and methodology development. But the National Board of Health and Welfare considered that mediation is just one of several methods social services can use to support offenders and victims and that it, therefore, should be included in the regular social services activities. Despite this fact, the Swedish government gave the National Board of Health and Welfare the task to be a supervisory authority, a mission that was reluctantly accepted. In 2012, the National Board of Health and Welfare made a review of the mediation services in Sweden. In their report, they concluded that mediation does not work as conceived and that there was a need for a co-ordinator at a national level. This was a statement that BRÃ already made when they ended their government assignment 4 years earlier. The National Board of Health and Welfare also underscored a lack of knowledge about mediation in the judiciary, and a climate of distrust reigning. In June 2013, the National Board of Health and Welfareâs responsibilities concerning mediation were replaced by the Health and Social Care Inspectorate (Inspektionen fÃ¶r vÃ¥rd och omsorg, IVO). The IVOâs responsibility is mainly to follow-up and check notiï¬cations and exercise risk analysis. When it comes to mediation, nothing"
242,622,0.982,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Martha Luz Rojas-Wiesner and Maria DeVargas At the societal level, the perception of migration as a âthreatâ to national security also generates anti-migrant sentiments among the local populations. For example, according to the National Survey on Discrimination in Mexico conducted in 2010, which involved a nationally representative sample of 13751 households, 25 per cent of respondents consider that the Mexican government should control migration; 76 per cent believe that immigration causes divisions in Mexican society; 27 per cent would not allow an immigrant to live in their house; 38 per cent said that âMexicans can build a great nation only if we have a similar culture and valuesâ (CONAPRED 2011: 84). The same source indicates that there is a general belief among the population surveyed that the migrantsâ presence has led to problems of insecurity because migrants often attract various types of criminals who attempt to kidnap or assault them. Long-time immigrants without a regular identity are affected by these attitudes in the communities where they work and live. There is a fear of denouncement that applies not only to their neighbours, but also to their employers, who want to evade responsibilities towards them. They also fear the mafias and criminals who can attack them, in addition to the fear of the consequences of being detected by the authorities as workers with irregular status. Despite the fact that Mexico has a significant proportion of citizens who are in favour of having foreigners in the country, testimonies from migrants who are Guatemalan, economically disadvantaged, indigenous, and/or migrants working in the agricultural and service sectors (as domestic workers and sex workers), have shown that they are often victims of âotheringâ and exploitation (CONAPRED 2011). This type of abuse also goes unreported due to fear of losing oneâs job or fear of being handed over to the immigration authorities. In conclusion, the survey emphasized that the discrimination and intolerance towards migrants revealed by the survey âdirectly confronts the discourse and imaginaries of a society that calls itself multicultural, hospitable, and generous to those coming from abroadâ (CONAPRED 2011: 7). Access to services and rightful treatment at work has become increasingly problematic for im/migrants in such a context. Although Mexicoâs Migration Law of 25 May 2011 states that immigrants have access to various services and rights regardless of their immigration status, these rights continue to be denied at the local level (Articles 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14).17 Several provisions of the new law on verification and migration control are already being implemented by the im-"

Furthermore, the expansion of cities across Africa is accentuating the clash between customary and statutory land tenure systems and cultures as noted in the preceding section. In most countries today, towns and cities are gradually swallowing up villages whose land development modes are still largely dominated by customary systems. As observed by some land experts, these village inhabitants presently do not see the need to apply for a formal land title since they believe the land belongs to them. The absorption into newly urbanizing areas of previously rural land thus engenders a clash in terms of perceptions of property rights that will cause future conflicts and complicate efforts to clarify land rights. The urban sprawling problem goes hand in hand with the lack of adequate infrastructure. African countries lag behind other developing countries in terms of infrastructure provision (Table 4.3). For instance, this infrastructure deficit is largest in access to electricity as well as water and sanitation services. For instance, only 43 percent of African households have access to electricity compared with 41 percent of households in low-income countries outside Africa. Even though the continentâs stock of paved roads and the populationâs access to pipe-borne water and sanitation have increased over the years, the continent still lags behind other developing economies when it comes to the provision of infrastructure and basic services. Moreover, in many countries, the overstretched infrastructural network"

On the one hand, we focus on areas where solidarity expresses itself as a process, whether at the individual level of empathy with the vulnerable or at the political level through partaking within the republican community. On the other hand, we also consider the instances where solidarity expresses itself through one-off actions carried out by individuals at a specific time and place. In particular, we are attentive to the very varied nature of the repertoire of actions carried out by different individuals (Teorell et al. 2007), including when they act as part of a group (Tilly 1978). Our dual focus on solidarity as an input and as an output thus enables us to distinguish between various âtrajectories of solidarityâ and thereby to better understand the way certain individual variables (such as self-identification and proximity) combine with political variables (like voting, an interest in politics, or the reading of newspapers) in very different ways, to produce different configurations of solidarity actions in each of the three fields of vulnerability considered here. Our first major goal in this chapter is to provide a detailed analysis of the way solidarity actions vary within and across the three fields of vulnerability analysed here. The second, more ambitious, goal of the present chapter is to search for the broad causes that could help to explain these variations in the nature of the solidarity actions carried out. In this specific instance, the distinction we establish between individually based and politically based solidarity trajectories makes it possible for us to determine whether solidarity actions are propelled more by self-identification and by a great degree of proximity between individuals in the private sphere, or whether they are the outcome of the republican process of transforming the âgeneral willâ into specific policies and laws through the mediation of public institutions. The chapter starts by presenting the three fields of vulnerability that are the focus of our analysis, and it outlines the theoretical foundations for choosing these groups in particular. We also focus on the difference between various solidarity actions (and thus on solidarity as an output) and on the two main trajectories that lead to this type of actions, one centred on the individual and one on communal republican processes (here solidarity is understood as an input). The following step consists in focussing on different degrees of solidarity and on the various forms solidarity takes across all three fields of vulnerability (section âThe Different Repertoires of Solidarity Actionsâ), before moving on to examine the two main trajectories that inform solidarity actions (section âExplaining the Dynamics of Solidarity: Individual Closeness Versus Republican Citizenshipâ). Finally, we sum up our most important findings"
140,189,0.982,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Rummel conceptualized ânonviolenceâ in its most elementary wayâthe lack of violence, and the use of alternatives to war that are not violent. For example, he expects that democracies in disagreement with one another will negotiate, since such forms of conflict resolution are deeply embedded in the culture, social expectations, and practices of democratic societies. He expects democratic leaders to eschew overreaction to domestic political oppositionâand to avoid mass killings. He does not, as far as I can tell, conceive of nonviolence as the active promotion of nonviolent contentious action, or as an active and coercive method of conflict in itself. Around the same time Rummel was completing his thesis, for example, a series of scholars such as Thomas Schelling, Gene Sharp, and Adam Roberts were writing about civilian-based defenseâa sort of nonviolent deterrent to foreign occupation where civilians would train in civil disobedience so as to make any foreign occupation too costly and therefore unlikely (see, for instance, Roberts, 1969)."

According to this act, in their implementation of the WFD the German federal states must adopt their state water laws to encompass water protection and to formulate the roles for cities, municipalities and water authorities, who bear the concrete responsibility for implementing measures. In the case of North Rhine-Westphalia, the responsibility for developing the river basin management plans lies with the Highest Level Water Authority which is the North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry for Environment and Nature Protection, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. Plans are adopted in consultation with the High Water Level Authorities (District Councils) and the responsible committee of the North Rhine-Westphalia regional parliament (Landtag). Responsibility for implementation lies with lower level public administration, such as districts and cities. Further actors such as nature protection organisations, water associations and regional councils should participate in the planning and particularly in the implementation process.

376,966,0.982,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","et al. 2006; Niamir-Fuller 1999; Perramond 2010, Schloeder and Jacobs 2010; Turner et al. 2014; Zoljargal 2013). There is more variation with respect to the economic importance of range-related exports (Williams and Spycher 2003). Range livestock generate very significant proportions of national export revenue for Ethiopia (Desta et al. 2006), the Sahel (Zoundi and Hitimana 2008), and Afghanistan (Schloeder and Jacobs 2010). Such exports are relatively less important at the national scale, however, for Mongolia (World Bank 2013a), Mexico (Peel et al. 2011), or for nations that share the Altiplano (Valdivia 1991). On the Altiplano, fiber from alpaca and vicuÃ±a is locally important for artisan or textile industries, and there has been a surge in smallholder dairying in the agro-pastoral sector in response to increasing demand for milk among urban residents at high elevations (Valdivia 1991). Markets for range livestock have grown overall during the past two decades as the global economy has expanded, stronger consumer countries have emerged, personal incomes have increased, rates of urbanization have accelerated, and trade barriers have been reduced (Meyers and Kent 2004). This bodes favorably for pastoralists over the long term, but producers living in remote areasâor subject to trade monopolies or intense competitionâoften remain isolated from market opportunities. This isolation is often related to poor infrastructure, inefficient marketing networks, and lack of progressive policies. Road construction and rehabilitation are currently common across the rangelands of eastern Africa, spurred to a large extent by investors such as the Peopleâs Republic of China (Zafar 2007). Livestock marketing in general is a major priority in regional development initiatives concerning improvement in food security for the Greater Horn of Africa (Knips 2004) and the Sahel (CRCM 2013). Trends to improve rural infrastructure have also been observed for Mongolia (primarily stimulated by mining development), northern Mexico [primarily related to NAFTA and neoliberal policies including privatization of communal land (Perramond 2008)], and the high Andes (primarily related to international trade, especially in the Lake Titicaca region). Government decentralization has shifted more development funds and attention to the local level for some marginalized rangeland communities, with notable progress observed on the Bolivian Altiplano. Impact from decentralization has also occurred in southern Ethiopia (Coppock et al. 2011). Improvements in rural infrastructure, overall, are rare in the Sahel (Hesse et al. 2014) or Afghanistan (Mohmand 2012). Public service provision for rangeland dwellers remains as a major obstacle for progress. Poor nations typically do not have the resources to make development investments in remote locations. There are two distinct subpopulations emerging in the rangelands of the developing world: one consists of traditional, mobile pastoralists still largely dependent on livestock, while the other consists of sedentary or semisedentary residents of growing rangeland towns and cities that have more diversified livelihoods. The latter group includes agro-pastoralists, former pastoralists, sedentary pastoralists, and immigrants from other sectors. Sedentary pastoralists may have households where some members are fully settled and have wage employment, with other members traveling to distant locations as they herd the familyâs livestock."

The ï¬nal section on transition highlighted anew that a view of students as a diversiï¬ed group, which has diverse needs for support, must continue throughout the higher education process. That is to say that it should not stop, for instance, at widening access to higher education. Since the diversity of students will be different and students will be studying within a different study framework in each country, and within a country in each type of higher education institution, it is very hard to conceive a supranational policy drive to support this. Developing indicators on the social dimension of higher education would entail a thorough assessment of the students participating in the higher education system with regard to their abilities and characteristics. As discussed earlier, both quantitative expansion and efforts to create inclusive higher education systems have led to a more diversiï¬ed student population, who are in many cases balancing work, studies, and other life duties. These changes are also driven by demographic change in many countries, where the typical age group of 18â24 years old is declining in the general population (Orr 2010). While the characteristics of the students body participating in higher education is changing, at the same it must be noted that the nature and extent of these changes differ between countries and also by higher education institutions. These differences demand a clear deï¬nition of different student groups for each country, and a distinction between âregularâ and ânewâ student groups entering and participating in higher education.

230,675,0.982,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"of cases below show that international initiatives have not yet been transposed into national management schemes; or where they have there is a lack of enforcement, insufficient implementation, insufficient penalties to deter violators, or a lack of clarity in legislation leaving room for interpretation. These all represent major obstacles to the effective control of marine litter. For instance, the UNEP (2009) pointed out that at the national level, only the Wider Caribbean and Northwest Pacific regions have countries with specific national legislation addressing marine litter. The revised MARPOL Annex V has not yet been transposed into national law in countries such as Germany (UBA 2013) and thus there is no legal footing to implement this revised Annex V at the national level. The IMO Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) shows that there are numerous reported cases of alleged inadequacy of reception facilities.47 In the US, as of 1995, <10 % of cases put to trial under MARPOL Annex V have resulted in penalties48 and each of the penalized cases was fined an average of â¬4,560, an amount far too low to serve as a deterrent (Gold et al. 2013). In Taiwan, no penalties exist for the violation of the Annex V. The EU PRF Directive is vague at defining the fee/cost recovery system. The transposition of the directive into national legislation leaves room for different solutions on how to introduce incentives for waste delivery at ports. The use of different waste-fee systems by EU ports creates confusion among ship owners and operators (EMSA 2012; ÃhlenschlÃ¦ger et al. 2013). â¢ Poor cooperation and insufficient participation of states in international/regional initiatives Despite the fact that numerous international and regional initiatives already exist and provide a platform for cooperation and coordination of marine debris issues, a few cases indicate that cooperative action on marine litter has lagged behind, or the participation of states in these initiatives was insufficient. This would leave a loophole in the global/regional efforts, given the fact that marine debris is a transboundary issue. For example, there are no legal instruments in place dedicated to the management of marine litter as yet in the Black Sea, even though the Bucharest Convention49 contains several articles pertaining to marine debris (Interwies et al. 2013). Some regional seas do not even participate in the UNEP Global Initiative, such as west central and southern Africa, northeast Pacific, Pacific and the ROPME50 sea area (UNEP 2009). Countries bordering these regional seas might lack appropriate waste-management schemes because of economic constraints, although a number of African countries have recently banned the use of plastic bags."
334,192,0.982,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"demonstrative protest forms in both Austria and Switzerland. At the same time, the involvement of potential deportees as main actors appears to have somewhat declined. The level of demonstrative protest forms and the participation of activists and individuals without personal ties were higher in Switzerland in the 1990s than in Austria with its rather moderate protest culture. In Germany, on the other hand, both individuals with and without personal ties were more likely to be involved in antideportation protest in the 1990s, a decade of higher protest frequency compared to the 2000s. Potential deportees are particularly common as main actors in Germany, and they are responsible for the clear increase in protest frequency and the use of confrontational protest forms in 2012 and 2013. The clear differences and changes over time suggest that protest against the deportation of rejected asylum seekers is strongly influenced by local and especially national particularities and the situational context, such as to what extent a broad actor constellation forms (across cleavages) in a specific (local) context. Hence, political opportunity structures for protest against the deportation of rejected asylum seekers vary between the three countries and offer a plausible explanation for differences in protest. With only three countries and stability in many of the indicators over time, we have refrained from a formal analysis of how political opportunity structures shape protest, but rather examined anti-deportation protest in view of the general political culture of the three countries. Our empirical findings show that trajectories in anti-deportation protest reflect the general mobilization of each country, and that differences in actors, repertoires and claims are related to each protest and participation culture. The overall higher level of demonstrative protest forms over the period of investigation emphasizes the status of Germany as a âmovement societyâ (Roth and Rucht 2008, 10). While the participating actors, their repertoires and the focus on specific deportations and individual solutions reflect Austriaâs more moderate protest culture, the strong focus on policy-oriented claims in Switzerland can be embedded in its tradition of direct democracy. At the same time our findings show that in Austria and Switzerland protest frequency is disconnected from the legal adaption of migration and deportation policies. Only in Germany during the 1990s was protest aimed at the adoption of more restrictive policies. While country differences seem to dominate, we also notice similarities: Both repertoires and claims are associated with the actor type. Demonstrative protest forms are much more common for individuals and communities with and without personal ties. Moreover, NGOs, church-related actors and politicians, potential deportees have a high probability of engaging in confrontational protest. Likewise, potential deportees and individuals with personal ties to the affected asylum seekers are more likely to focus on the specific deportation, while NGOs usually seek policy reform. Put differently, the same kind of actors use the same kind of repertoires and demand the same kind of claims across countries. These aspects of protest against the deportation of rejected asylum seekers are relatively constant over time and across countries, and are likely to characterize this kind of protest more generally."
266,177,0.982,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Technological Interventions for Community Participation and Engagement The use of the UNITY mobile app as a means of community engagement, the primary case study discussed later in this chapter, is far from the first instance of ICTs being used to bridge gaps between communities and the statutory and non-statutory organisations that offer support to particular problems. A prominent example comes from the âNational Ugly Mugsâ (NUM) scheme1 designed to support sex workers in the UK. The scheme, born from the UK Network of Sex Projects, allows users, primarily sex-workers themselves, to anonymously report dangerous individuals that a believed to pose a risk or threat. Information reported through the scheme is then shared with other sex-workers. The same information is then passed on, providing the user consents, to the police. The project has been recorded as a success in both providing immediate protection to sex-workers and as a valuable resource to enrich the policeâs intelligence picture on crimes against them (Laing et al. 2013). Despite this, tensions between sex-workers and police remain high as sex-work remains illegal in the UK, despite widespread support for decriminalisation from some quarters (Grenfell et al. 2016). While the NUM scheme has been a relative success in circumventing the tradition of mistrust between the sex-work community and the police, there is still a visible divide between the two, and the reporting of violent and serious offences to the police by workers is still extremely patchy. This is often as a result of increases in law enforcement activity targeting the sex-work community, including raids on known premises and strict solicitation legislation that is present across some areas of the UK. Furthermore, the varied nature and scope of sex-work means the scheme is mostly used by indoor workers, with those engaging in street based solicitation, often considered to be some of the most at-risk individuals, missing out as a result of low levels of digital access, itself a consequence of their own socio-economic and socio-cultural precarity (Kinnell 2008).

This limits its potential to ï¬ll niches in areas where there are no interesting market opportunities and no suitable tasks for the public sector. If there is less diversity of services offered to the users, certain demands in the population will be unsatisï¬ed. As Scandinavian societies become more socially and culturally heterogeneous, distinctive alternatives to choose from are also important for the legitimacy of a welfare model funded by taxes. In addition, a small nonproï¬t sector also limits its potential as a corrective to the for-proï¬t services in areas with information asymmetry between users and service providers. It also limits the potential for innovation in reducing inequality and solving common problems in society, promoted by stakeholders that are dedicated to a mission statement and the common good and have other priorities than proï¬ts. Finally, our case studies indicate that the nonproï¬t welfare providers may promote active citizenship when given adequate frame conditions and government regulations. A certain share of nonproï¬t sector welfare employment would therefore be important for balancing the Scandinavian welfare goals within an increasing system of user choice. However, this is not what is happening in Sweden, with growth only in the for-proï¬t sector. The Danish case shows that with parallel governance systems it has been possible to regulate the share of nonproï¬t and for-proï¬t providers under such conditions. These choices are important for the ability to reach the deï¬ning welfare goals within a system where core services are funded by the government and, consequently, for the existence of a Scandinavian welfare model in the future."

However, according to the Irrawaddy news service, Japanâs deeper participation in the peace process has been hampered by opposition from China, which has been against the inclusion of Japanese and Western actors into the ceasefire negotiations (Aung Zaw 2015). Switzerland In keeping with Switzerlandâs venerable foreign policy of neutrality, which had been in place for centuries and had been codified and internationally recognised after 1815 (Church and Head 2013), the country has sought to play a peacebuilding role in Myanmar through programs oriented towards arbitration and education. Switzerland has been active in the current preparations for the Myanmar elections by developing activities through the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and other parts of the Swiss government to assist with voter preparation and education. Switzerland has called for ongoing dialogue between all major actors in the electoral process, including political parties, election officials, the media, and civil society organisations. In conjunction with the government of Germany and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Switzerland has also been teaching vocational skills in Myanmar, including in areas of industry and tourism. Myanmar peacebuilding projects undertaken by the Swiss government have included drafting a Code of Conduct (CoC) in October 2014 for all participating political parties, (estimated to number about ninety by August 2015), in the November 2015 elections, educating voters and parties on"

The inclusion of the information gathered during the interview with the FGG Elbe representatives is not an end in itself, but an aid in the comparative method (Lijphart 1971) we are utilising to investigate the practical considerations in establishing CMAs in South Africa. Our argument is that this could provide a better understanding of the establishment of a river basin organisation in other parts of the world. The intention of the FGG Elbe interview was not to identify so-called best practices, but to gain a deeper understanding of motivations and context in establishing river basin organisations. For the face-to-face interviews in South Africa, not only did we target individuals from the two existing CMAs, we also conducted interviews with government officials that are closely involved in the establishment of the remaining seven CMAs in South Africa, most notably, the Vaal CMA and Pongola-Umzimkulu CMA. The latter includes a lived experience from the current establishment phase through attendance of the steering committee meetings. During the interviews we asked stakeholders to reflect on the establishment process thus far. We also made a number of observations during the three stakeholder meetings. Through these observations we identified a number of processes that were deemed important by the interviewees for consideration in establishing the remaining CMAs. We then grouped the issues identified in the interviews into five categories, namely, structures of rule, not including stakeholders, finances and public administrative processes, the difference between the main and trading accounts of DWS and the management of stakeholder relations. Before discussing these practices, we will give a rendition, by way of a historical account, of the CMA establishment process to date."

Particularly, concerns have been raised in respect of the standards adopted by those new banks in screening, evaluating and monitoring projects/proposals and granting funds for certain investments in Asia. Therefore, environmental benchmarks and labour conditions would be seen as compromised. Conversely, the Westâs international standards and conditionalities would better protect the livelihood of national and local communities instead. Nonetheless, such attitudes can be an overture for a broader dialogue between those established and new ï¬nancial development institutions to gradually negotiate and internalize common standards especially given the mixed membership of the AIIB.2 Besides such potential grounds for cross-fertilization of human rights norms and strengthening of cooperation agendas across those different development banks, the protection of socio-economic and environmental rights by Chinaâs development banks must be conceived in light of its understanding of the developing countriesâ right to development in the ï¬rst place. In addition, Chinaâs commitment to pursue its rule of law reforms domestically has immediate repercussions upon its international image as well as its resolve to abide to international law in particular in the ï¬eld of human rights and development. Yet, such adherence has to be contextualized and, as a result, the implementation of human and environmental rights by virtue of the ï¬nancial practice of Chinaâs development banks overseas will be progressive.3 This paper will examine those various human rights concerns in Chinaâs new multilateral development banks operating within Asia and beyond. It will ï¬rstly address how those ï¬nancial institutions have been justiï¬ed from the Chinese perspective. It will particularly focus on how the so-called right to development has given legitimacy to Chinaâs New International Economic Order by means of the establishment of its own ï¬nancial development institutions. Secondly, it will contextualize and scrutinize Chinaâs past and present contributions to existing multilateral development banks and evaluate howâin spite of its promises towards complementarity of its new institutionsâwhether such contributions may effectively advance a multilateral and cooperative approach towards ï¬nancing development in Asia. Thirdly, this paper will examine the prospects for the respect of environmental and social standards in the ï¬nancing of development initiatives through Chinaâs new multilateral development institutions and the possibilities to further coordinate with other regional and global development institutions in the creation, development, interpretation and application of such human rights benchmarks that are ï¬t to guide the ï¬nancing of development efforts in Asia."
242,196,0.982,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","By sending women to Spain for the picking of strawberries as part of a temporary migration scheme, the Spanish and Senegalese governments hoped to offer them a job in Europe as well as finding cheap labour for agricultural enterprises. Due to harsh working conditions and low wages which were misaligned to their profiles and expectations, some Senegalese women preferred to abandon the fields for other Spanish cities where they joined other Senegalese working in domestic service. Without regular residence permits, some of these women found themselves in precarious situations reducing their statutory and contractual rights. They encountered abuses such as overtime being rarely paid, extremely variable working hours, and sometimes even verbal, physical, and psychological violence. Domestic workers with legal status also face difficulties such as the downgrading of skills, isolation, and not being allowed to change employers or become pregnant for a certain number of years. From the findings presented here, we can draw conclusions and policy implications for both temporary (agricultural) work schemes and for the situation of female migrant domestic workers in Spain, all of which revolve around labour market issues, questions of regulation, and unforeseen outcomes in terms of social (in)justice. In documenting the process of transition from one sector to another, we have also seen that while choices are limited as a result of the restrictive migration regimes and economic adverse conditions, agency remains important (Van Nieuwenhuyze 2009: 195). The findings on the temporary agricultural work scheme show that policies which fail to understand the temporary migrant workersâ lives â that many are well educated, that they are not merely pairs of harvesting hands, that they have networks in Spain, that allocation of places in temporary migration schemes will in Senegal inevitably be partly on the basis of patronage â can never obtain their objectives. As for the findings on migrant domestic workers presented here, they illustrate very clearly the special characteristics found in the domestic work sector, namely âthe intimate character of the social sphere where the work is performed; the social construction of this work as a female gendered area; the special relationship between employer and employee which is highly emotional, personalized and characterized by mutual dependencyâ (Lutz 2008: 1, cited in Dobner/ Tappert 2010: 8; see also GutiÃ©rrez-RodrÃ­guez 2010)."
193,81,0.982,UKrainian Migration To The European Union : Lessons From Migration Studies,"for Economic Cooperation and Development, FRONTEX and the Fundamental Rights Agency of the EU include data on how the legal framework influences migration flows and stocks (including irregularity), but they are generally based on statistics and short qualitative descriptions, and lack the detailed consideration of causes and consequences that is of interest to migration researchers (see e.g. FRONTEX 2015; ICMPD 2013). Comparative policy-oriented studies, such as those prepared annually by the European Migration Network, often omit the migrantsâ perspective, only providing information on particular migrant groups with regard to whom very specific programmes or policy tools are mentioned. National or local case studies on, for example, migrantsâ adaptation, mobility patterns and participation in the labour market provide some academic evidence of the role and implementation of migration regulations. Ukrainians appear in wider categories of foreigners, such as third-country nationals in the EU context, citizens of ex-USSR countries or the CIS region, or nationals of countries participating in the Eastern Partnership programme, making it difficult to identify factors specific to them. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the literature mostly discusses those legal instruments or policies that are thought to have the greatest impact on Ukrainiansâ mobility patterns, including the visa facilitation process, regularization programmes and specific programmes admitting migrants from Ukraine to the labour markets. Most studies focus on admission policies and policy towards irregular migrants in a broad sense, since these are regarded as the most relevant for the context of Ukrainian nationalsâ mobility, and are important factors both increasing and decreasing migrant opportunities. Literature on the legal aspects of Ukrainian mobility in the EU context can be divided into two main categories. First, there are comparative international studies that usually refer to specific issues, for example how regularization programmes or guarantees of fundamental rights shape patterns of mobility. Such studies refer to Ukrainian migrants only when they constitute a significant immigrant group to which particular legal instruments apply (e.g. Kupiszewski and Mattila 2008 with regard to policies controlling the legality of employment and addressing informal employment; FRA 2011 for the fundamental rights of irregular migrant domestic workers). The second category is represented by numerous case studies in which the legal status of Ukrainians functioning in particular EU3 states or even economic sectors is featured, but is not the main topic of analysis (e.g. Antoniewski 1997; Antoniewski and KoryÅ 2002; Drbohlav et al. 2008; GrzymaÅa-KazÅowska et al. 2008; HosnedlovÃ¡ and Stanek 2014; NÃ¤re 2011; Nikolova 2014). A comparative study on the irregular employment of foreigners (Kupiszewski and Mattila 2008) considers why the informal employment of foreigners is common in some countries and what policies or lack of policies contribute to migrantsâ participation in the informal economy. In both Poland and Hungary undocumented work by Ukrainians was linked to the relatively easy access to those countries and Some case studies were also conducted in the pre-accession period of the 1990s or early 2000s in relation to the future EU-8 states, where immigration from Ukraine has always constituted a significant share of the migratory landscape."
212,158,0.982,Life Cycle Management,"Abstract Although Life Cycle Management (LCM) is becoming commonplace in larger corporations it is far from mainstream. To achieve sustainable production and consumption patterns, LCM needs to be taken up by whole supply chains that include small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). From a business perspective, this represents a competitivity issue, as these SMEs are increasingly under pressure from clients and legislators to provide more information about the environmental impacts of their products, and to take responsibility for them both up and down the value chain. Therefore a sector based and regional approach is needed to foster the implementation of LCM in SMEs. This has been done in Northern France, where professional support organizations, including clusters, business federations and Chambers of Commerce, have come together under the auspices of the [avniR]"

When a context of collaboration spans several fields and jurisdictions, such as in Barnahus, the collaborative processes are made more complex (Phillips et al. 2000, 30; Johansson 2013, 116). By viewing the interests of organisations as institutionally shaped, and the organisations as governed by different logics of action, it is possible to understand the conflicts and dilemmas that can arise in interorganisational collaboration and the collaborative work in Barnahus more specifically. Collaboration in the particular context of Swedish Barnahus is located in an area of contention between two regulatory fields, criminal (procedural) law and social welfare law. In relation to collaboration in Barnahus, the tension between justice and welfare, and more specifically the criminal law-oriented and treatment-oriented logics, is the most central, although there are also âinternalâ tensions such as those between the crime victim and the suspect on the one hand, and between child protection and family support on the other hand (Johansson 2011a, b). The parallel investigations (i.e. the criminal and child welfare investigations), related to the criminal and child welfare regulatory fields, represent conflicting institutional interests and logics of decision-making. The Swedish Barnahus collaboration and coordination of the parallel investigations thus require that interests be balanced. This balancing is not undertaken by a single professional actor but through negotiations among the collaborative actors involved. The professional actorâs authority and legitimacy are then based on their ability to argue in line with their respective logics, which creates frameworks for handling issues and making decisions that are addressed and negotiated in collaboration (Scott 2008b).1"

This is why the transition to a bio-based economy, which serves the goal of providing the public good âworld climateâ in a sustainable quality, will not happen without government support. Common-Pool Goods In the context of environmental protection and sustainability, the group of so-called commonpool goods plays an important role. These are goods which are rival in consumption, so that their quality is diminished when they are consumed (i.e., the marginal utility of consuming them is the smaller the more people are consuming them), while nobody can be excluded from utilizing them. Because of this combination of rivalry in consumption and the failure of the exclusion principle, rational individuals will consume as much as possible of such a good as fast as possible. The dominance of this consumption strategy will lead to what Garrett Hardin (1968) called the âtragedy of the commonsâ, i.e., a fast overuse of such resources which will lead to their premature extinction, if the government does not intervene. Examples of common-pool goods suffering from this kind of market failure are fish stocks in the open sea where everybody can catch as much as he desires, but also groundwater aquifers, rivers, or lakes which are exploited by different private parties or different countries, rain forests in countries where no government regulation for their exploitation is enforced, etc. Without strict utilization regimes which are enforced by governments, these resources will be lost within a short time. Besides setting up strict utilization schemes for such goods, the government can support their preservation also by encouraging the provision of alternative commodities serving the same purpose as the common-pool goods. In the case of endangered fish stocks, the government can, e.g., support financially the development of new kinds of marine food like algae-based nutrition. This branch of the bioeconomy has been flourishing over the past years, but this development has been possible only because of government subsidies. Therefore, the bioeconomy depends on government intervention also with respect to"

Their accumulation has been difficult to manage and the situation is far from being stabilised. The gains that have been made over the years could be lost as the sector is still prone to wide policy swings with respect to the links between the universities, the research organisations, the grandes eÌcoles and both the national and regional authorities. Stronger institutional leadership is emerging but it remains to be seen if it will be able to motivate staff and students and provide incentives for change in an unfavourable economic context. In addition, leadership is a necessary but not sufficient condition. University leadership is exercised in an arena that includes multiple actors â staff and student and their unions, âgrandes eÌcolesâ, research organisations, national and regional authorities â and these will not be necessarily pushing in the same direction. The historical tendency toward centralisation and fragmentation might once again prevail unless good university leadership is combined with the capacity of the central state to change and adapt and if the regional authorities resist the siren call of increased power.

378,189,0.982,The Great Mindshift : How a New Economic Paradigm and Sustainability Transformations Go Hand in Hand,"supply chain interruptions when transport or credit in one part of the chain is hampered. Meanwhile, sustainable communities, according to Hopkins, do not subscribe to a culture of consumerism but seek to link âsatisfaction and happiness to other less tangible things like community, meaningful work, skills and friendshipâ (Hopkins 2012: 20â21). Here we ï¬nd a direct connection with ï¬ndings on human well-being and its origins. It was insightful to see that some workshops of the Transition Town movement were using Max-Neefâs human need matrix to discuss a diversity of strategies for a high quality of life beyond âhavingâ things. This also ties back to the criticism of ecological economists like Paul Ekins and Robert Costanza in Chap. 3, who state that the social utility gained through the human interactions during production processes should get much more attention when assessing productivity. Meanwhile, many resilience researchers also emphasize the importance of trust as a core ingredient to well-functioning, adaptable communities and individual perceptions of well-being. The 2012 High Level Panel on Global Sustainability did not get this far in its report to the UN Secretary-General before Rio+20. Resilient People, Resilient Planet: A Future Worth Choosing describes the world system as volatile and uncertain, and suggests that the panel start their recommendations with a call to âempower people to make sustainable choicesâ as a response to this. It does not seek to empower people to build their own communities though, but rather focuses on how the social safety nets of governments are set up so they can be resilient in times of structural change, and how disaster risk reduction and adaptation programs could be improved (United Nations Secretary-Generalâs High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2012: 46â47). The Transition movement, on the other hand, makes these self-empowerment processes the essence of its existence and adapts them to systems or communities of any size, not just towns. Its mission is summarized as follows: âto inspire, encourage, connect, support and train communities as they adopt and adapt the transition model on their journey to urgently rebuild resilience and drastically reduce CO2 emissions.â The seven principles for guiding such processes in towns are set out by Hopkins and Peter Lipman on the Transition Network website (transitionnetwork.org) and can be summarized as follows: 1. Positive Visioning: Campaigning for rather than against something. 2. Help People Access Good Information and Trust Them to Make Good Decisions: Raising awareness and hearing many opinions lies at the core of rational decision-making. 3. Inclusion and Openness: Banning âthem and usâ thinking and reaching out to all subsystems in the town, early in the process. 4. Enable Sharing and Networking: Acknowledge everything, including stories of failure. 5. Build Resilience: With the primacy of environmental resilience, change food, energy and economic systems in the town and across governance levels."

Adequate levels of trust and promoted norms and values are shared by all members of the association, especially the ones practicing volunteer work. In that way, the contribution to social capital multiplication has been made, as a basis for social innovation in the association and beyond. âMobilisation and organising around a shared vision of changeâ (Moulaert and Mehmood 2013, p. 448) is an added value of this innovation. In this case, social change is visible in an area that used to be the area of privacy and the space of few government services. It was a framework for social innovation that strengthened the social cohesion in general public. RODA has passed their knowledge and skills to the organisations in South East Europe, in Sarajevo, Belgrade and other cities. However, it has been impossible to implement such a programme in these countries, as there is neither willingness nor need for volunteer work. So in this case, it can be clearly stated that social innovation emerged from civil engagement and volunteer work of citizens, as a kind of collective action (Habisch and Loza Adaui 2013), making effort to protect and promote their interests."
245,259,0.982,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"As part of recent national policy for optimizing and rationalizing Kazakhstani government institutions, the roles and functions of state institutions are in a process of change, and this extends to those institutions related to internationalization of higher education: The CBPAM; the CIP; and the National Academy of Education. For example, the current CBPAM work on academic mobility scholarships is reportedly to devolve to the CIP (Engberg et al. 2014). Moreover, there is discussion of shifting the CBPAM responsibility for verifying overseas diplomas to the National Academy of Education (personal communication 29 August 2014). These institutional changes, and others that may become manifest through 2015, will certainly have implications for IOs in their work within institutions and with national-level institutions. These institutional shifts provide strong argument for greater IO capacity for Bologna-related work. One mitigating factor in developing this capacity seems to be the current division of labour between the IO and the Bologna Ofï¬ce working within institutions. An important ï¬rst step in strengthening IO capacity for the Bologna Process was cited by the IO interviewed above, who sought, but could not provide her staff with, Bologna Process training and information. This IOâs perspective is consistent with that of Telegina and Schwengel, who cited among challenges to implementing Bologna Process goals the âlevel of understanding of the Bologna principles and practicesâ (2012, p. 46). As the demands on IOs for Bologna-related work increase, Kazakhstani ofï¬cials and institutional leaders will need to explicitly address the professional development needs of IOs for that work."
278,389,0.982,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"Whether âsolidaristicâ enterprises would be more receptive to such efforts and more adept at embracing such resource exchanges remains to be seen and would be an interesting area of future research. Another field of inquiry would be to ascertain to what extent companies already involved in symbiotic relations also embody social and solidarity values. Chertow and Ehrenfeld found that âone of the most distinctive elements of industrial symbiosis is that, while all industrial actors seek to reduce private costs and increase private benefits, those in the symbiotic networks that have been studied also participate in the creation of public environmental benefitsâ (2012: 18). Here, the SSE can contribute through an analysis of the profit structure, governance system, societal aims and, more generally, in better understanding the culture and values within such systems. Two other fields of inquiry involve the consideration of âsolidaristicâ crowdfunding as an opportunity for abating economy-wide rebound effects through the promotion of more socially just and environmentally sound investments; and finally, the potential for complementary currencies to work towards industrial ecology aims, such as reducing global carbon emissions. One of the weaknesses of the social and solidarity economy has been that of scale: although various institutions exist at the level of cities, countries and regions to federate activities across sectors, the actors within the SSE typically operate on a more micro scale. Over the past few years, there has been increasing attention to macroeconomic thinking in the industrial ecology and ecological economics community, questioning notions of wellbeing and prosperity, the inadequateness of current models and the need for transformative investments in the future (RÃ¸pke in Cohen et al. 2013; Jackson 2009; Victor 2008). As Tim Jackson put it âThe truth is that there is as yet no credible, socially just, ecologically sustainable scenario of continually growing incomes for a world of 9 billion people.â (2009: 86). The social and solidarity economy is not a magic wand solution and operates at the margins of the dominant capitalist economy, yet it is well underway and expanding, in research and practice. Reflecting on how the SSE and industrial ecology community might come together towards more macro-level perspectives would be a worthy exercise. One main outcome of this analysis is that transactions and exchanges are important flows, but more attention should be placed on the underlying values holding together our everyday practices and put forward in our economy, workplaces and society as a whole â including social and environmental values that are not always aligned.

The current programme shows that there is a strong demand for micro-loans, especially in the countryside and smaller communities/ border regions. Implemented micro business projects provide jobs, create new ones, raise incomes for microenterprises and their families. Thus, these kinds of public support have positive economic as well as social effectsâ. The Polish MA stated in the questionnaire that their programmes were aimed at supporting enterprises during the economic crisis. The SEE Support Programmeâs main goals are: support of SEE development (increasing incomes and/or skills of employees), creating a revolving financing system. The start-ups support projectâs main goals are youth entrepreneurship development and creation of new employment opportunities. The MA from Slovenia (Maribor) indicated that âMicro-loans are dedicated to micro and small enterprises. The product prevents financial exclusion of micro and small enterprises. The eligible costs are: material investments and working capitalâ. The MA from Ljubljana stated that the instruments activated were very helpful as they allowed SMEs to access financial sources and simplify the business environment. The MA from Sicily clarified that âThe micro-credit programme for families under art. 25 of the Regional Law No. 6/2009, as subsequently amended and modified, is a useful instrument to prevent families facing economic difficulties from falling prey of loan sharks and usuryâ. The MA from Apulia provided a much more articulated answer to the question. In fact, it pointed out that âa significant obstacle hindering the economic development of our region lies in the difficulty to access credit for the local micro-enterprises, which, unlike their bigger competitors, are being affected by an increasingly scarcity of credit sources. In recent months, the problem has reached a critical point, to the extent of jeopardizing the very own existence of several businesses as well as generating severe impacts on their capability to retain their workers (for entrepreneurs and self-employed subjects alike). Even bigger is the impact on employment, with specific regard to youth. The impossibility to access credit, in fact, prevents companies from making new investments and, consequently, from hiring new workers. Demand for lowamount loans is high in the region, especially by small-sized businesses. An effective policy to support credit can help promote a new model of social and economic development in the region based on high human capital intensity and low environmental impact, with a specific focus on the role played by female and young entrepreneurs. Such policy will support entrepreneurship and the innovative and sustainable"

99,240,0.982,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Costa 2013). Whatever the case, it can be stated that this experience has numerous shortcomings. Firstly, on the public land granted by the municipality (land that is extremely scarce in the city) very few affordable dwellings have been provided, especially if one considers the housing emergency in Milan. Secondly, this innovation is especially oriented to test social, functional, and tenure mix, while the housing emergency especially affects very-low-income citizens, who crowd the long waiting list to access the municipal housing stock. After 3 years of the new municipal government, however, it is not possible to find other significant social innovation schemes in this strategic policy area. Numerous rhetorical discourses on the capacity of housing sociale to deal with housing needs have presented private actors and mixed ones (like the ethical funds) as a panacea for the cityâs housing problems. In fact, local difficulties are also represented by the resignation of the deputy mayor for housing policy in 2013 (who now represents the centre-left alliance in the regional council, governed by the centre-right), who tried, while in the municipality, to work on some important issues: among them, a new governance system for the municipal housing sector (with more responsibility for management of the stock given to the municipal government); the correct allocation of many vacant public dwellings; and experimental regulation of the private rental market. Instead, the main expectations for the future are now placed in the new Piano di Governo del Territorio (the urban planning instrument adopted in Lombardy cities), which imposes a very modest share of affordable housing units for new housing projects. However, it is quite probable that, owing to the critical situation of the construction sector in the city, few social housing units will be provided in the coming years. To sum up, while a social innovation approach in housing policies is widely recognized in the case of the FHS by both the social innovators and the policy community at the local and the national level, we would highlight some general conditions that make policy innovation especially difficult to implement and spread in Milan. According to Moulaert et al. (2005), social innovation is driven by history and the social context. This is partly structural, partly institutional determination. In regard to the institutional dimension, Milan has a legacy of social pluralism and multiple power centres, which has always engaged the municipality in constant confrontation with an array of economic interests and social issues. This fragmentation has hampered the capacity of the local administration to affirm an integrative and inclusive vision connecting the multifaceted networks of actors in Milan. Some argue that this lack of strategic governance capacity and the traditional weakness of formal government are offset by innovative capacities in the economy and civil society (Bolocan Goldstein 2009). On the other hand, the lack of strategic governance and a poorly developed âpublic realmâ within which the opportunities and challenges created by all these inventive actions can be retained generates the continuing neglect of many social issues and the ignoring of major future problems. Furthermore, multiple innovation and bottom-up initiatives tend to compete and clash with each other (Healey 2007)."

According to the discussions above, inadequate incentive mechanisms are part of the root causes of the deleterious outcomes generated in terms of housing development. However, this situation also provides an opportunity for the main stakeholders to take necessary actions to reverse the patterns. This would require strong commitment of the major stakeholders and actions to be taken on several fronts. This section will discuss briefly some of the recommendations geared toward getting the incentive mechanisms right. More substantive and detailed discussions on the critical issues are provided in each of the subsequent chapters of this book.

The fact that their working places are within the slum or well connected to the slum makes it difficult for them to move out of the slum. This explains why it is very common that slum dwellers displaced to some remote areas without economic opportunities tend to come back to their original settlements (see Chap. 6). It is noted that the inefficiency of the governance and spatial planning systems as well as the infrastructure inequalities inherited from colonial administrations created slums together with opportunities for postcolonial political and economic entrepreneurs to develop power and patronage networks, and take advantage of rent-seeking opportunities (Fox 2013). This situation exposes slum dwellers to rent seekers including the landlords or economic entrepreneurs who own the land and are renting it out to slum dwellers. During our field visits in different countries,4 it was evident in our discussions that the owners of land where Kibera, the largest slum in Africa, is sitting include medical doctors, some civil servants, political elites, and some other wealthy individuals who have their housing elsewhere in town and use that piece of land as a source of additional revenues. Besides, it is important to note that the political and economic elite taking advantage of those at the bottom of the pyramid do not have incentives to stop slum development, knowing that there is little chance that they will get back their land and put it to productive use. They are aware of the fact that for political reasons, the unpopularity and costs related to taking displacement measures, and the resistance of slum dwellers to moving out of slums, it will be very difficult and costly in terms of timing and procedures to get back that piece of land and put it to a use that will generate the same kind of revenues. The trade-off for those landlords is therefore straightforward: they would keep the slum dwellers as tenants and pocket their rents, rather than embark on tedious and lengthy procedures of eviction that will only generate costs to bear without any assurance that they will reap some benefits in the near term."

Furthermore, the municipal Social Service works from the perspective of proximity to and the prevention of social problems and has developed a territorialised âcommunitarianâ approach that aims to reinforce social cohesion.25 As a result, a multitude of actors constitute a labyrinth of local welfare organisations, mostly non-profit organisations. Aware of the overlapping public services between the canton and the city, the current cantonal government has decided to disentangle its duties from those of its 45 municipalities (Mabut 2014; Moulin 2014), a task that it wants to complete in close cooperation with the Association of the Municipalities of Geneva and its representatives. A first technical report has just been published (Groupe de travail technique (GTT) 2014), whose purpose is to assess the current situation. According to this report, there are 12 main areas in which there is significant overlap, including social services, where it is not always clear which duties belong to the municipalities and which to the canton because âthe distinction between these two fields of public action is difficult to make, because every community social action aims finally to improve the social and economic situation of individualsâ (Groupe de travail technique (GTT) 2014, p. 8).26 Our interviews with 12 local stakeholders and two focus-group discussions have shown a relatively clear consensus in the political arena regarding the necessity of keeping a strong local welfare state and on the view that it is the responsibility of the state (and e.g. not the private sector) to help vulnerable people. We may assume that this state-oriented welfare mix27 is specific to Geneva in Switzerland, which is known to correspond to a hybrid conservative-corporatist model with liberal tendencies, according to the classical typology of Esping-Andersen (1990, pp. 74â77), or to constitute a âcompromise between Liberalism and Socialismâ (MÃ¶ckli 1988, p. 27). Indeed, for a long time the Swiss welfare state has been considered a welfare laggard (Bonoli and Mach 2000, p. 140), especially regarding health insurance (which only became compulsory in 1996), family policy and long-term unemployment benefits. But this welfare laggard reputation has to be taken with a grain of salt. Indeed, MÃ¶ckli (1988, pp. 24â25) has shown the pioneering character of some social and political laws, for instance, laws regarding the social protection of children in factories (1815)28 and the first Swiss factory law of 1877, which introduced"
35,277,0.982,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"The omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has, more often than not, contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Krause et al. 2015). Therefore, the analysis and documentation of who the relevant stakeholder groups are is important for achieving a good planning process. This may include assessment of their legitimacy and power (Buanes et al. 2004). The design and execution of the planning process for aquaculture, or for the broader MSP process, is important both for the efï¬ciency of the process and for the social sustainability of the outcomes. Qualities like transparency, representativeness and fairness matter for i.e. the legitimacy and support for the outcome (Buanes et al. 2004), for the wider trust in authorities, for development/maintenance of democracy, and for sustainable development (Krause et al. 2015). Who to include in the planning process, and how, can be difï¬cult to decide upon, balancing the ideals above with the ambition for an effective planning process, which typically also is embedded in a larger governance system. Whilst addressing the interactions and feedbacks between issues (e.g. economic, social and environmental consequences) in a MSP context, it becomes evident that many of these play out over time (i.e. in past, present and future contexts) and space (i.e. at local, regional and ecosystem/global scale)âthese are referred to as âcross-scaleâ or âmulti-scaleâ processes (Krause et al. 2015). What time-scale to consider in the planning process, and thus also what geographical scale, is also something that must be decided. Discussions of the availability, usefulness and ease of use of knowledge is also important, e.g. on aquacultureâs value creation and its distribution (Isaksen and Mikkelsen 2012). For example, with the development of feed-aquaculture turning to more land-based production of feeds, agriculture can also be seen as a new emerging stakeholder in aquaculture production (Costa-Pierce 2010). Indeed, when new groups of stakeholders are included in planning processes they may often bring"

It was also highlighted in the formal procedures of the communal council as well as the ideological discourse surrounding them. In order to form a communal council, the community had to elaborate a written overview of the social genealogy and cultural characteristic of that area. The explicit purpose was that through capturing popular history and making peopleâs common identities and histories explicit, the communal identityâa key factor for making the communal council workâwould be strengthened. Moreover, a central task for a newly constituted communal council was to elaborate what was called a diagnostico social (social diagnostic) and a diagnostic communitario (community diagnostic). This implied making a survey of populationâtheir demographic profile, how many people resided in each house and under what conditions, what special needs they might have (medical or otherwise), the communityâs housing conditions, and so on. It also implied making an overview of the infrastructural characteristic of the community and the availability of services and recreational areasâor lack thereof. They also recorded available human resources in the community, such as laborers and professionals that could participate in developing or executing projects. In order to elaborate the diagnostic, the voceros and voceras of the communal council walked from door to doorâpreferably on Saturday afternoons or Sundays when people often are at home. Consequently, the diagnostic formed the basis for developing projects according to the communityâs most pressing needs and joint priorities."

One exception might be the ofï¬ces investigating serious and ï¬nancial crime where the support and assistance of EULEXâs top experts is still welcome. If this is to happen, vast ï¬nancial resources should be invested in the judiciary in an attempt to attract and engage the most competent foreign judges, prosecutors etc. to work for EULEX. If only the âsecond bestâ international experts can be recruited, downsizing the mission might be a better option than having not so well qualiï¬ed and trained experts among the EULEX staff. At this point, we already touched on the (supposed) equality of the EU member states which do not want to stay out of any important decisions and selections for CSDP positions. Further strengthening of Kosovoâs judiciary could occur by properly addressing certain known cases of mismanagement or even illegal activities of Kosovoâs elites, making further efforts to complete legal procedures within a reasonable time and by ensuring that the laws and EU best practices are fully applied in practice. As noted speciï¬cally by the locals we interviewed, in one decade of its functioning EULEX has often regarded political stability within the country as sacrosanct, even if this has occasionally compromised the effectiveness of its operations. While looking at Kosovo in terms of preventing conflict or destabilisation, we may conclude that a relatively stable environment has been maintained. However, EULEX has only partly contributed to this âstabilityâ within the framework of the international actorsâ streamlined efforts. It should also be noted that these international efforts brought about greater stability for many people, but not all. We can nevertheless conclude, based on several interviews and observations by other authors, that this âstability-above-all mantraâ has sometimes been achieved by compromising the missionâs fundamental objective of strengthening the rule of law in Kosovo. Drawing from this, the following recommendation is offered: EULEX (or any other similar civilian CSDP mission) aiming to establish the rule of law in a post-conflict society should press the member states, which have the ï¬nal say in CSDP decisions, to provide the wherewithal to fulï¬l the missionâs mandateâeven if, like in Kosovo, this may sometimes challenge the stability argument. In other words, it is not enough for EU member states to only provide funding for CSDP missions and operations, which is perhaps the easy part, and then claim the EU is wholeheartedly committed to building peace, while simultaneously questioning whether changes in a particular post-conflict society are occurring as fast as expected. On the other hand, if the stability argument prevails at the expense of the unwavering implementation of reforms at the EU level it is better for the mission or operationâs leadership to explicitly state the mandateâs objectives cannot be met in such circumstances where full support is lacking. If this is the case, the CSDP mission or operationâs leadership should require the mandate to be changed or suggest it be closed and withdrawn from the post-conflict society. One of the fundamental challenges unlikely to be resolved in the near future is EULEXâs relationship with the issue of Kosovoâs recognition. As noted by experts, the EU has somehow adapted and learned to live with the fact that ï¬ve EU member"
198,574,0.982,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"Abstract Brazil has historically coped with drought, a phenomenon that especially impacts the semi-arid lands of the Northeast. To deal with the various impacts of a current multi-year drought (2010-ongoing), the Government of Brazil, led by the Ministry of National Integration, partnered with the World Bank (WB) on a technical assistance program to foster proactive drought policy and management. The program works across sectors (climate/meteorology, water and sanitation, agriculture, environment, and disaster risk management) and levels (local, riverbasin, urban, state, regional and federal) in relation to the outcomes and stakeholders it aims to engage and influence, and trough the integration of WB Global Practices and programs. Inspired by successful models and lessons from other countries, the program aims to contribute to greater climate change resilience and reach a broad community of beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, partners convened to (1) build a Northeast Drought Monitor; and (2) pilot drought preparedness plans across Northeast. This chapter showcases the program and highlights key-milestones and direct and indirect outcomes identified by 2015. The institutional change process was assessed using qualitative analytical tools that integrate Outcome Mapping, the Capacity Development Results Framework, and Outcome Harvesting. Strengths, challenges, and outcomes (institutional changes) were identified, by tracking the programâs contribution throughout its duration and at its completion. The evidence shows that the initiative was able to convene key-regional and federal level multi-sector stakeholders at a decisive moment, resulting in an unprecedented bottom-up and regionally-led collaboration.

The regulations allow the entry of small-scale private enterprises to certain sectors such as finance and agriculture, but large organisations with systemic importance remain state-owned and hence state-controlled. In other sectors, such as HE and extractive industries, no direct private sector participation is permitted.

293,88,0.982,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","independence. These members of the middle classes felt uneasy under their postcolonial governments or expected a more secure future upon resettling in Europe. Although at some point these European countries of destination imposed restrictions on such resettlement, it was generally understood that these migrants belonged to the nation and that the nation had a moral obligation towards them. Even though migrants still arrive from these countries as family migrants today, postcolonial migration was predominantly from the 1950s to the late 1970s. In the 1960s, employers in countries including Belgium, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands recruited labour from abroad. Unskilled and semiskilled workers were brought in for the service industry, construction, and manufacturing to meet the growing demands of the booming economies. At the same time, such jobs lost their attraction to native workers, whose educational levels were on the rise. The intention was to hire such workers on a temporary basis. With the exception of France, governments had no ambition to develop settlement policies (Martin and Miller 1980, 316). The term âguest workerâ was used to underline this stance. Once demand for guest workers ebbed as a result of the recession following the 1973 oil crisis, facts and conceptions took diverging paths. Further recruitment was haltedâin Germany by lawâand the guest workersâ return home seemed a logical consequence of the economic downturn. Yet a large share remained. Despite the recession, demand for their work remained sizeable (ibid., 320; Castles 1986, 765). Moreover, these workers themselves preferred to stay, as their countries of origin likewise were going through hard times. For their part, âhostâ governments were unable or unwilling to force their erstwhile guests to go home. Welfare arrangements and entitlements were an additional disincentive for return migration. As a consequence, many guest workers became immigrants. Because this gave cause for spouses and children to join them, the end of the guest worker era actually meant the beginning of substantially larger migration flows. As a rule, governments did not applaud this ongoing migration of family members, but their ability to curb arrivals was restricted by humanitarian, economic, and legal obligations. The example of the Netherlands illustrates this. Some 74,000 Moroccan and Turkish workers lived in this country in 1973, but ethnic communities ten times this size arose over the next 40 years (Doomernik 2011, 73). In Germany the rise was less steep. While in 1973 the country had 910,000 Turkish inhabitants, in 2012 some 3 million German residents had a Turkish background.1 Over time, some governments acknowledged that continuing migration produced ongoing challenges in terms of integrating the newcomers into mainstream society. In no small part, this was a result of the nature of the recruitment policies, as they had been biased towards poorly educated migrants (Castles 1986, 773). The bias towards those with little formal education also put migrantsâ children in a disadvantaged position in education and, subsequently, the labour market (Crul and Doomernik 2003). This situation, in conjunction with an increased politicization of migration, brought about a growing interweaving of migration controls and integration requirements in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands (from the late"

Ltd 1977:1). The government in 1971 also established regional planning authorities to develop cross-sectoral planning for the environmentally signiï¬cant inner peri-urban areas of the Dandenong Ranges, Upper Yarra Valley and the Mornington Peninsula. The resultant policies, plans and statutory measures were interventionist, seeking alternative futures to path-dependent trajectories associated with trend analyses. They restrained urban development, controlled rural subdivision and prevented the introduction of urban related uses into rural areas in order to protect rural land uses, including agricultural practice, landscapes and environmental features. Land fragmentation and future development were identiï¬ed as the main threats to maintain rural landscapes. The Upper Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges Authority, for example, severely limited future subdivision and dwelling development on the 62 % of 17,272 rural lots and the 42 % of 43,334 urban lots without dwellings (Loder and Bayly 1980). This removal of development expectations controlled land speculation, protected environmental qualities and increased the capacity of agriculture to persist by maintaining comparative rates of return and the potential to innovate. This kind of regional planning is rare. More recently, the 2002 plan, Melbourne 2030, implemented new regulatory rural planning zones and a legislated urban growth boundary for the Melbourne green belt and developed a strong policy approach aimed at protecting hinterland resources. The State government had previously altered planning policy to control the proliferation of rural-residential subdivision in rural areas in 1992, and in 1996 inserted provisions for the retention of productive agricultural land in the State Planning Policy Framework (SPPF). Further amendments to Ministerial Direction No. 6 in 1997 and 2006 required an application for rural-residential development to be consistent with a range of requirements including the need to locate any such development close to existing towns and urban centres, not to encroach on productive agricultural land or adversely affect environmental resources. Ministerial Direction No. 6 was revoked in May 2012. In 2013, the State government also reduced the level of regulatory controls in most rural zones allowing further subdivision or non-farming related commercial uses to be introduced over much of the peri-urban area. These changes signiï¬cantly weakened the rural zones by increasing the capacity for dwelling construction on separate lots and allowing a wide range of"

Venezuela and French Guyana do not participate in any REDD initiatives under the United Nations or the World Bank. In 2013, Norway was the single major ï¬nancial contributor to the UN-REDD Programme, FCPF, the Brazilian Amazon Fund and the GRIF. Norway contributes 82% of the total budget of the UN-REDD Programme, 44% of the total budget of FCPF, 87% of the total budget of the Amazon Fund, and 100% of the GRIF.4 The country is one of the major players in deï¬ning REDD at the global level and has some inï¬uence on the way in which REDD is advancing at national levels. The incorporation of the phased approach launched by the Meridian report in the UNFCCâs Cancun agreement contributes to stressing a particular way of prioritizing the activities necessary for the implementation of REDD. This particular approach is being reproduced in national contexts because its proponents believe in the technical superiority of the approach and because it promotes comparability and compatibility between countries, but not necessarily a solution to the problem of deforestation (Fairhead and Leach, 2003). As it might seem obvious to most, the driving forces behind deforestation vary enormously, as do the political and economic settings in each country, the interests and alliances among different actors, and the roles played by the state and non-state actors.

309,241,0.982,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"as the Farmerâs Union and local government authorities (Scott et al. 2009, 82). The question of driving forces behind organic sectors also reflects in civil society5 involvement and public discourses about organic food and its production. The wider spectrum of actors such as within alternative agriculture movements both in Thailand and in Indonesia have resulted in debates around corporate control of the organic sector in these countries (Scott et al. 2009, 84). In Thailand there is an established local food sovereignty initiative which utilises organic farming and local marketing also as a means of resistance against structural dependencies and ecological destruction as a consequence of industrialised agriculture (Heis 2015). In Vietnam, where the organic sector is mostly shaped by corporate and foreign influences and according to the logic of the market, such critiques of corporate control or the establishment of grassroots organisations striving for food sovereignty are weak or non-existent (Scott et al. 2009). Despite issues of environmental pollution (see Pham Binh Quyen et al. 1995; Pham Thi Anh et al. 2010) and even though the effects of climate change on agriculture are beginning to be noticeable (Fortier and Tran Thi Thu Trang 2013), widely formalised environmental movementsâof which organic advocacy could be an elementâhave not been established in Vietnam. Of course, this must also be seen in the socio-political context of tightly controlled formal civil society organisations (Wells-Dang 2014). While civil society action against environmental pollution certainly exists (see Tran Tu Van Anh 2017), an occurrence in 2016 made obvious the often restricted space for organised politicised expression of opinion. After a mass of fish dying on Vietnamâs central coast related to a Taiwanese steel factory and people in major cities going to the streets against the slow government response towards this pollution scandal, the initiating protests were suppressed (Radio Free Asia 2016). Meanwhile, there could be a change in direction in the attention organic farming is receiving from the government: at an international forum on organic agriculture in Vietnam in 2017âco-organised by MARDâPrime Minister NguyÃªnÌ XuÃ¢n PhÃºc presented the increasing demand for organic products as a chance for development of organic farming in the country. PhÃºc thus called for the adoption of global organic standards in Vietnam, seeing the target groups among highincome domestic groups as well as in global organic markets. At the same"

This large number of refugees was expected to evoke conflict. Extensive research on refugees and expellees was an answer to this problem, elaborating various issues that would later become relevant for the âAuslÃ¤nderforschungâ of the 1970s and 1980s (Angenendt 1992: 186). The research was closely oriented to policy and political applicability due to a âfear that political radicalisation might spread among these migrant groups under the severe social conditions of the immediate post-war period, i.e. a lack of housing, employment, food and clothesâ (Bommes 2010: 128).

27,153,0.982,Limits To The European UnionâS Normative Power in a Post-Conflict Society : Eulex and Peacebuilding in Kosovo,"Another reason is the poorly communicated essence of the rule-of-law concept that is consistent with the publicâs general dissatisfaction with EULEXâs role in the judiciary and the rule-of-law reform process (Interview 18 2016p). The EUâs wider role in Kosovo is complex, having gradually developed from its initial function as the fourth pillar of UNMIKâdealing primarily with economic reconstruction and developmentâto todayâs much broader engagement (ZupanÄiÄ et al. 2017). The EU is nowadays present in Kosovo chiefly through the EUSR and the European Union ofï¬ce in Kosovo (2017). Parallel to this, EULEX is dealing with the rule of law. The complexity of this engagement is difï¬cult to communicate to the local public (Interview 20 2016r). Combined with the poor public image, this explains why the mission has never really been perceived as part of local society and not constituted an integral part of local life (Interview 19 2016q). On the other hand, as Mahr (2017) notes, the EU as an institution remains a relatively well-trusted actor in Kosovo. Despite this, the mission is often still perceived as foreign, perhaps even imposed on the local environment. Certain political parties, most notably VetÃ«vendosje (Self-Determination), build their programmes and political actions on insisting that EULEX and other international organizations should withdraw from Kosovo, as international actors only prolong the dependence of Kosovo and block its independent development. Thus, local actors have often been reluctant to cooperate, or worse, worked hard to make it impossible for EULEX to prosecute someone from their ranks.7 The latter is a main reason for the local contestation seen among Kosovo Albanians (Mahr 2017). Second, local judges, prosecutors and politicians have often been âhiding behind EULEXâ and pointing the ï¬nger at international actors to deflect attention from their own inefï¬ciency, mismanagement or lack of capacity. The excuse âthis is a task for EULEXâ is commonly heard and a prime example of the limits of local ownership. Such a combination of internal protectionism and excuses of local actors"
234,17,0.982,Mobile Professional Voluntarism and international Development : Killing Me Softly?,"FROM âAIDâ TO GLOBAL HEALTH These kinds of anxieties, about the effectiveness of AID, fuelled by political correctness about the use of the term âdevelopmentâ have led to new concepts to capture the investment dimension and focus on longer-term systemic change. The Tropical Health and Education Trust is one of a growing number of intermediaries funded by the UKâs DFID and focusing on âcapacity buildingâ and âsustainabilityâ. Locating itself within the âglobal healthâ agenda, THET describes its mission as building long-term resilient health systems to promote improved access to essential health care as a basic human right (THET 2015). At the centre of this strategy is the concept of âhuman resources for healthâ or âHRHâ. The global health agenda has usefully shifted attention from the havesâhave nots and donorârecipient binaries referred to before, talking instead, somewhat hopefully, of partnerships and âwinâwinâ relationships. Lord (Nigel) Crisp has pushed this agenda forward arguing quite forcefully that the UKâs National Health Service has as much to learn from low-resource settings as vice versa. Focusing again on health systems (rather than poor people per se), Crisp suggests that the concept of global health âembraces everything that we share in health terms globallyâ (2010: 9). Crispâs approach rest on two ideas. First, that health systems in high-resource settings are facing (growing) challenges in terms of resources and sustainability and, second, that globalisation is itself creating complex mobilities (both human and microbial) and interdependencies that effectively challenge the autonomy and resilience of nation states: we are all increasingly connected, whether we like it or not. The growing mobility of health workers or the spread of Ebola are prime examples. It is interesting also to see how Crisp and THET have started to slip the word âinnovationâ alongside development, although they shy away from the language of competition in this ï¬uffy consensual world. In the context of global health, at least the growing emphasis on human resources has usefully shifted the debate from one about providing âtop-downâ cash injections in the form of national or international"
334,32,0.982,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"expressions of protest underscores the mechanism of protest waves, namely that protests intensify and spread from one site to another. This observation draws on the argument that controversy itself creates further opportunities for controversy (McAdam et al. 2001). Closely related to this is the view that protest diffusion, feedback and learning take place and can, to a certain extent, explain protest development (Tarrow 2013). Finally, there is a driving force for protest which is described as neither exogenous nor endogenous: protest as a resource for institutional politics. Protests evolve due to structural grievances at an individual/subjective level, facilitated or hindered by national contexts and frameworks. However, besides grievances, fear and anger over structural transformations, unfair distribution or injustice in an individual case, the source of protest can also lie within the political power situation and dynamics within configurations of political actors. Several chapters in this book address this dimension and show that protest is not purely a meaningful response by citizens to humanitarian crises and social transformations. Protest also has a political basis and contains components of political conflict between actors within a parliamentary setting and party politics. Della Porta and Diani (2006, 19) consider social movements as part and parcel of the political system. Protest is politicsâor, more precisely, protest is a resource for institutional politics (Lipsky 1968; Goldstone 2003). This observation applies to right-wing protest against asylum seekers, where (local) institutional actors join protest activities and turn to protest repertoires (marches, town meetings, etc.) to resist political decisions taken at regional or federal levels."

Major increase in overgrazing and ecological deterioration throughout the dryland plains of the Ilemi Triangle, due to a large influx of people fleeing hunger conditions along the Omo River and around Lake Turkana (Fig. 5.5). 2. Immediate escalation of existing patterns of interethnic armed conflict due to overcrowding by ethnic groups and competition for vanishing pasturage and water. Traditional patterns of interethnic conflict remain, but with greater inclusiveness as stresses on all groups within the region increase. For the Dasanech, conflicts are primarily with their Nyangatom, Hamar, and Turkana neighbors, but also with the Toposa in the Ilemi region and the Gabbra along the eastern shores of Lake Turkana. For the northern Turkana, hostilities most frequently erupt with the Dasanech and Nyangatom. For Turkana ï¬shers camping along the lakeâs eastern shoreline, hostilities with the Gabbra also occur. 3. Rapid geographic spreading of armed conflict in the cross-border region and internally within the three nations concernedâ an inevitable outcome in view of rampant arms availability in the region. AK-47 rifles and other types of weaponry are ever expanding through Kenyan arms merchants and multiple sourcesâmilitary and otherwiseâin the region. Many of the regionâs residents and outside observers regard the national governments as tacitly supporting the arming of âtheir ownâ ethnic groupsâas âproxy forcesâ in the contested Ilemi region, where oil and gas exploration is also active (Appendix A). 4. Increased militarization in the region by both the Kenyan and Ethiopian governments. This process accelerates as governments react to interethnic conflicts and as they, together with domestic and international investors, advance plans for âdevelopment,â with de facto assertion of control over the regionâs resources. 5. Cross-border livelihood collapse and conflict (Fig. 5.4)."

From the policymakersâ perspective the production of such knowledge is not necessarily a purely academic affair. We have observed repeatedly that, as the area of migrant integration has become more politicised, governments become more selective in the types of research they use and support, while they also prefer to produce their own data more often. In specific cases this may lead to a dissension of opinions when it comes to generating and using comparable data on migrant integration at the European level. Not surprisingly, the EUâs efforts to develop common indicators for integration have been only partially successful so far (see Chap. 3)."
341,122,0.982,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"As an analytical concept, the âdevelopmental stateâ has been described variously as one that places economic development at the top of government policy priorities and which is able to design effective instruments to promote such a goal (see Mkandawire 2001; UNECA 2013a). Some of the instruments often referred to include the establishment of well-functioning formal institutions, weaving of formal and informal networks of collaboration among citizens and government officials and the utilisation of new opportunities for trade and profitable production (see Fakir 2007; UNECA 2013b). According to Radice (2008), in contrast to the conventionally polar models of liberal free-market capitalism and the state-socialist planned economy, the developmental state is seen as a distinctive political economy that combines elements of market and plan, linking a mixed economy to a politicalâideological approach that combines authoritarian technocracy with a relatively egalitarian distribution of income and wealth. The developmental state has also been characterised as a state that promotes macroeconomic stability, as well as establishing an institutional framework that provides law and order, effective administration of justice and peaceful resolution of conflicts, ensuring property rights and appropriate infrastructure investments and advancing human development (Dadzie 2013; Ayee 2013). It is seen as a state that is determined to influence the direction and pace of economic development by directly intervening in the national development process, rather than relying on the uncoordinated influence of market forces to allocate economic resources (Johnson 1982; Taylor 2002). Elsewhere, the developmental state has been described as one that authoritatively, credibly, legitimately and in a binding manner, is able to formulate and implement its policies and programmes. In other words, it is a state that is capable of deploying the requisite institutional architecture and mobilising society towards realisation of its developmentalist project (Edigheji 2010; UNECA 2013a). UNCTAD (2007) points out that the literature on developmental states has focused their characterisation on two major features, namely, a developmental ideology and a structure pertaining to the requisite institutions, norms and standards that can support the development process. Therefore, their raison dâÃªtre is building"

Migration studies that focus only on trajectories of departure and remittance do not capture many of the human implications and interconnections. She shows how large-scale migration to other parts of Mexico and especially to the USA brings major changes in a community of origin, especially for women, for they receive new and expanded duties; but that this occurs within an evolving continuity of tradition, male dominance, and female subordination. Based on years of research into an indigenous Zapotec locality in Oaxaca state in southern Mexico, her study looks at transformations and continuities in the local economy and society. Most migrants remain culturally rooted in their community of origin and intensely connected to it, maintaining frequent communication and revisiting regularly, often as the prelude to eventual return. This pattern operates with particular intensity in the locality observed by Serrano Oswald because of the strength of indigenous identity and organization and the opportunities provided by tourism and the related growth of woodcarving, which have made seasonal international migration-and-return very common. The pattern has a special impact on women, who are expected to remain behind (or return and settle after they have children) and to maintain the community, the children, the culture, the elderly, the homes, the cherished agricultural base, and the local physical and organizational infrastructure, as well as to support the comings and goings of the migrants and the additional demands of the new economic activities, and often to bear a new child after a return visit home by their husband. The impact on the children of such migration is also intense, with an absent father and a severely loaded mother. Local women today work on average twenty to twenty-five hours extra per week when compared to their male counterparts, and the discrepancy is higher for women whose husband is away. Yet migrant men retain de jure authority and exercise it de facto, directly or through their blood relations. The role assigned to wives is as subordinates and as mothers, for whom all sacrifices for their family are mandatory. In exploring this sort of social terrain, Serrano Oswald demonstrates the relevance of a combination of: first, critical ethnography, that allows local people to express and present themselves within long-term studies that provide space for the researcher to become aware of âsilences, omissions, and processes of invisibilityâ; second, social representation theory, which examines the systems of ideas used to define, characterize, and legitimate roles; and third, Nancy Fraserâs"

The US SilvaCarbon program manages the Capacity Building component of GFOI in collaboration with FAO/UN-REDD. SilvaCarbon implements capacity building efforts at both national and regional levels. At national levels, it works with countries to develop country-speciï¬c work plans ranging from technical assistance to intensive technical training sessions, workshops, and study tours. They are provided by experts from the U.S. SilvaCarbon institutions, and often in collaboration with other GFOI organizations and afï¬liated partners from industry and academia. The regional work plans are developed to reach out to a larger number of countries that share some common attributes or interests (e.g. in Central America, the Andean Amazon region, Central Africa and South/Southeast Asia). They typically include activities such as hands-on or showcase workshops on a range of topics related to monitoring and managing forest and terrestrial carbon in the regions. FAO, through UN-REDD, supports national REDD+ readiness efforts in partner countries through direct support to the design and implementation of UN-REDD National Programs, as well as through complementary support to national REDD+ actions through common approaches, analyses, methodologies, tools, data, and best practices. Both SilvaCarbon and FAO have an active presence in partner countries and are well positioned to serve as links between countries and the other components of GFOI as they relate to capacity building needs. Both use and promote the GFOI MGD in training events and in turn provide comments and feedback from country representatives to the MGD team. There is also close cooperation with the Data Coordination component, to report user needs to CEOS space agencies and data providers, as well as to prepare and provide satellite data for training and NFMS development."
282,16,0.982,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"The Political Declaration of the WSSD in Johannesburg, which was so instrumental in promoting the concept of partnership by including it as an official, âtype IIâ, outcome of the summit, contains no more than the following: We recognize that sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As social partners, we will continue to work for stable partnerships with all major groups, respecting the independent, important roles of each of them. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002a, Â§ 26) The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation that was adopted along with the political declaration is slightly more detailed in that it specifies the involvement of âmajor groupsâ in partnerships. At the same time, it constricts the definition to include only cooperative arrangements focusing on policy implementation (rather than policy definition, for example) in the area of sustainable development. [T]he implementation should involve all relevant actors through partnerships, especially between Governments of the North and South, on the one hand, and between Governments and major groups, on the other, to achieve the widely shared goals of sustainable development. As reflected in the Monterrey Consensus, such partnerships are key to pursuing sustainable development in a globalizing world. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002b, Â§ 3) This definition of partnerships and the subsequent work of the UN are, however, based on a more detailed description of criteria for partnerships. The criteria were developed in the run-up to WSSD and endorsed in the decision of the eleventh meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Like the definition proposed here, they recognise partnerships as voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiatives. But they only focus on initiatives designed to contribute to the implementation of internationally agreed development goals and include a range of normative criteria, such as that partnerships should pursue an integrated approach to sustainable development, display a sectoral and geographical balance and be designed in a transparent and accountable manner.5 The WSSDâs focus on cooperation in order to achieve a public policy goal is echoed in the political science literature, for example, in BÃ¶rzel and Risse, who focus on partnerships that transcend national borders: Transnational PPPs [public-private partnerships] would then be institutionalized cooperative relationships between public actors (both governments"
376,482,0.982,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Rangelands around the world operate under a broad array of governance systems and property rights regimes. Thus far the SES concept has been used far more effectively to analyze past and present situations than in providing clear steps for future work. Future research should go further in determining how these different components are linked, and further suggest policy improvements that might better support ranchers, pastoralists, and rangeland managers. The effect of large-scale economic and political forces on local environments lends itself well to SES analysis. For example, in the USA, zoning laws discourage conversion of private rangeland to other uses within certain geographical areas, but ranch conversion is not otherwise prohibited and ranches are rarely the most profitable land use. Alternatively, many European countries have national laws that ban the conversion of certain agricultural landsâincluding dehesaâto nonagricultural uses. In the western USA, there is growing interest in conserving âworking rangelandsâârangelands that produce ecosystem services as well as commodities. Yet there has been little research to date comparing the effectiveness of various national land policies on maintaining working rangelands or supporting their active management at the household scale. Comparing the effects of land-use policies on the ecology of working rangelands would provide needed policy-relevant information. At a recent national workshop on âusable science,â participants, including scientists, livestock operators, and land managers, ranked 142 identified issues proposed by five working groups (water, animals, vegetation, soils, and socioeconomics). The number one-ranked issue overall came out of the Socio-Economics Working Group: understanding and managing for variability (climate, drought, fire), adaptation, and recovery (Brunson et al. 2016). This topic is admittedly broad, but the SES approach is a good fit for analyzing key components: ecosystem change, adaptive capacity, and resilience in rangeland systems. Rangelands are subject to high variability of climate, vegetation, and market influences of livestock and feed prices, and dealing with such variability is a constant challenge for livestock operators and land managers. SES frameworks might productively be used to increase the resilience of working rangelands by identifying beneficial ecological traits but also by constructing social and economic support systems for livestock operators and land managers. Research exploring the use of SES frameworks to help practitioners and managers anticipate and manage variability and change in environment and society is a needed contribution. Trade-offs and synergies among the various goods and services derived from rangelands need more attention in general. On public lands, agency interventions on specific allotments could have impacts on entire landscapes: examining these crossscale effects, and the trade-offs among them, requires greater attention. Designation of a park or preserve may be of great benefit in meeting conservation and recreation needs, but might have devastating effects on individual livestock operators, and lead to a transformation in nearby communities with various ecological and social outcomes at diverse scales. SES analysis could help anticipate these effects, providing a fuller picture of the opportunities and trade-offs of the change. This type of research is hampered, however, by the difficulties of cross-disciplinary research. SESs are inherently interdisciplinary, but different disciplines use different research"
371,342,0.982,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"From this perspective, it is noteworthy to point to some dysfunctional features of the European Union, which limit mobility and discourage many potential migrants from moving abroad, or which favour mobility remaining in the shadows. Too often, national level institutional settings regulating the labour market contribute to the configuration of a rather rigid and fragmented European labour market. In addition, legislation regulating access to welfare and health care is not designed to suit the needs of migrant workers. A lot of work remains to be done by European institutions in order to ease these shortcomings. Bilateral agreements between EU Member States could contribute to easing the controversy regarding access to welfare by EU migrants. Reforming labour markets in the South and facilitating mechanisms to avoid âbrain wasteâ while such reforms remain to be fully achieved should also be considered another priority for the near future of the EU Member States."
376,817,0.982,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Box 15.2: Collaborative Management as a Means to Minimize Climate Risk: Mongolian Plateau, China Inner Mongolian rangelands can be environmentally challenging for people and the primary industry of raising livestock. The climate of Inner Mongolia is cold; average annual temperatures vary between 1 and 2.5 Â°C. Precipitation is low and erratic with the majority occurring during three summer months. Winter storms can be harsh and frequent drought is associated with wind erosion. The culture had adapted to this harsh climate using strategies based on three core components: mobility, cooperation, and reciprocity (Dalintai et al. 2012). These strategies helped to sustain the resilience of this tightly connected socioecological system. For drought, these strategies included otor and surug. In otor, herds, through kinship relations, were moved to better grasslands in response to drought conditions; surug was a system in which herder leased a core number of their young female animals to herders in areas not as affected by drought. When the conditions in the original herdersâ area improved, they took back their livestockâthis short-term leasing provided a way to maintain the core of their herd by matching forage production with animal demand. The social setting in this area of China has seen a continual change since the 1950s with collectivization between 1950s and mid-1980s and then market reforms in the early 1980s. These changes affected many of the tight connections in the socio-ecological system. Collectivization strengthened production but weakened the mobility component by encouraging seminomadism. Market-oriented reforms emphasized rights of ownership by individual households, attempting to incentivize herders to use their grasslands rationally and sustainably. However, these changes eroded the strategies to adapt to the harsh climate. Mobility of herders was limited; consequently grasslands were overgrazed. Further, government structures assumed the role of providing services, weakening the kinship-based social structure of cooperation and exchange. At the start of the twenty-first century, a top-down effort by the government was initiated to address the degradation of grasslands. Grazing management strategies included restrictions on where and when grazing could occur, thus making it difficult for herders to migrate herds. Grass planting occurred and the government instituted a supplemental feed program. Herders were also moved away from the grasslands. These changes exacerbated the herdersâ poverty. However, degradation continued; Dalintai et al. (2012) suggest that the policy aimed at protecting the grasslands and improving herderâs living standards proved ineffective because these most recent changes were implemented in a top-down manner. Essentially, over all of these social and economic changes, the vulnerability of the socio-ecological system to drought and winter storms increased. A project was implemented to address issues of poverty and environmental degradation and to help preserve the traditional culture in the Sonid Left Banner area of Inner Mongolia, located on the south-eastern part of the (continued)"
329,16,0.982,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"In the chapter on changing government policies we will explain in greater detail why this is the case, but the simple answer is that within the Asian context, there is far less appetite to fund efforts that publicly criticize government. Although there has not been perfect harmony between the views of government and private businesses or individuals, they have often worked in tandem on aligned agendas related to economic growth. While that is true to an extent in other parts of the world, we will see throughout this book that there are important differences between Western civil society and Asian civic engagement. What are the roles of philanthropic and non-governmental, SDOs in Asia? The primary role is to help others in need because it is possible to do so. Helping others is an integral tenet of what it means to be human and has been promoted through the ages in civilizations around the world. The premise and intent are clear. More difficult to determine are the differences in definition and motivation between charity and philanthropy. Are they alike? Charity is the act of giving money, food, or other kinds of help to people who are poor, sick, or need other types of help. Philanthropy is an active effort to promote human welfare. In other words, philanthropy is a formalized and systematic process of being charitable. This book deals with organizations and organized, systematic approaches to helping those in need. The context for such efforts necessarily includes government. Individual and corporate philanthropy is on the rise, but it is a small amount compared to public spending. In the United States, with the largest and most active philanthropic sector in the world, American foundations together spent about $375 billion on all programs and sectors, compared to $3.8 trillion in federal spending for 2015. Of that federal money, more than $1 trillion went to health and human services. Private donations remain much smaller. This means that even in the United States, with the largest and most robust philanthropic organizations, private funds equal only a small fraction of the financial resources spent by the government. As a result, one effective use of philanthropic investment is in areas not ordinarily underwritten by government. This thinking results in pilot projects, basic research, riskier ventures in a variety of sectors, and much of the support for arts and humanities. Our research shows that in Asia, there is an implicit social contract at work. As will be described in greater detail later in the book, Asian philanthropy tends not to go to advocacy organizations, but is in line with"

Most, if not all, stakeholders in research are well aware of thisâand many have tried and continue trying to improve the way partnerships are created and maintained, and how benefits (and costs) are shared more equitably. This applies to research collaboration between high-income countries as much as to collaborations between high- and low-income countries. The evidence-base of publications, guidelines, practical tools and even international legal instruments, like the Nagoya Protocol (United Nations 2010), is increasing (see, e.g. RFI-COHRED 2017). The EU recently funded projects, such as TRUST, aimed at ensuring that international collaborative research using EU funding does not exploit populations in third countries (http://trust-project.eu, 2017). Similarly, the funding of the current CAAST-Net Plus project is anchored in improving policy dialogue to facilitate research collaboration between Europe and Africa in health, food security and climate changeâwith potential for much wider application of the projectâs results (https:// caast-net-plus.org, 2017). CAAST-Net Plus has been searching for ways in which the project can deliver outcomes and impact that can survive the funding limit (December 2017). In this regard, it was in 2016 that CAAST-Net Plus took the decision to adopt a partnership compliance tool under development by project partner COHRED. The RFI is a unique tool to gradually and systematically improve the way research partnerships are constructed, managed and maintained, with an emphasis on supporting low- and middle-income countries to develop their own national R&I systems. The RFI does not invent new standards. Instead, it is a reporting tool that every major stakeholder in research should use to report on how they will behave and want partners to behave in joint research programmes. RFI Reporting Organisations (RROs) are required to provide responses to questions about the 15 most essential aspects of fairness and effectiveness in research partnershipsâdivided over the three phases of research collaboration: fairness of opportunity (before), fair process (during) and fair sharing of benefits, costs and outcome (after). The RFI does not ask for reports on each individual contract or partnership. It focuses on the conditions, policies and practices that RROs put in place to optimise R&I partnerships in which they are or will be involved (see http:// rfi.cohred.org, 2107)."

Similar conclusions can be drawn from a study of Ukrainian teachers working abroad in low-skilled jobs, according to which the most popular reasons for choosing a particular destination country were âhaving relatives/friends abroadâ and âbetter employment and/or income opportunities compared to other countriesâ, followed by âknowledge of language of that countryâ and âgeographical/cultural proximity of the country to Ukraineâ (Kupets 2013). At the same time, quite important reasons also reported by over 20% of respondents were the relative ease of gaining visas, work/residence permits and irregular entry to the country of current destination. A growing number of policy studies on Ukraineâs path toward a visa-free regime with the EU2 suggest that visa issues are quite important for the choice of destination country, the economic performance of Ukrainians abroad and the consequences of the migration experience for both sending and receiving countries. In one sociological survey3 that only partially supports this statement, an absolute majority of Ukrainian respondents did not consider the visa regime with Europe to be a significant barrier to their emigration or labour migration, and reported their lack of financial means to be the major obstacle (Kipen and Avksentiev 2011). An interesting study by Weinar et al. (2012) that looks at the Schengen visa regime as a tool of labour migration policy and assesses the potential impact of liberalization of the visa regime on migratory movements between Ukraine and Moldova and the EU finds that the current Schengen visa regime has not been particularly successful in protecting labour markets in the destination countries from the flow of immigrant workers from Ukraine and Moldova. Szulecka (Chap. 4) discusses the impact of visa regimes on Ukrainian migrants in detail. Such a regime restricts the development prospects of the countries of origin by limiting circular migration, intellectual capital circulation and business exchanges. Fedyuk (Chap. 5) provides a critical analysis of the so-called social costs of Ukrainian labour migration."

A mature richness in terms of quality and a vision that seeks QOL is not confined to certain regions or countries, cities or countryside, or outlying islands. However, specific ways to achieve such a vision or initiative differ with each area. In looking at areas across Japan, there are many examples to be found that exhibit various kinds of resourcefulness and clever ideas. Areas experiencing certain problems may be able to get some hints by looking at how other areas with a similar problem handled it. By exchanging each otherâs ideas and knowledge, it may be possible to come up with something even better. Joining hands with each other will lead to a bigger movement giving them the power to demand legal and social reforms. From this kind of idea, the Platinum Network Society was launched in August 2010 by its 46 founders. Even if social reforms are known to be necessary, all of society moving together as one is not a reality. So, first of all, the frontrunners need to go ahead and increase the number of supporters. Then, when critical mass is reached, everyone can move together. The people gathered here are the frontrunners who can make a move before others. More than 6 years have passed since the Society was launched. The Society has grown into a large organization and as of September 2016, the Society has 84 corporate members, 154 local government members, 56 special members, and 6 members from outside of Japan, making a total of 300 altogether. As mentioned earlier, the Platinum Network Society conducts various activities such as developing various educational programs for fostering human resources, publishing the Platinum Society Handbook, holding symposiums, establishing individual working groups for health management, and holding discussion meetings to generate ideas (Fig. 6.15). Amongst such undertakings, the Platinum Vision Award, inaugurated in 2013, has been often mentioned in the media and is credited with making Platinum Society ideals better known. Recipients of the Platinum Vision Award include local governments, corporations or organizations that have created a new industry through some kind of innovation, or are aiming to resolve regional problems by ingenious measures. Through their efforts, these governments, corporations, and organizations represent a society that is aiming to become a platinum society."
98,13,0.982,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","This lack of recognition, common identity and awareness has consequences for the visibility and political legitimacy of the third sector at both the national and European levels, and is both a symptom and a cause of the knowledge gaps that afflict this sector. Although official statistical procedures have been developed at the international level to generate systematic comparative data on key features of the scale, scope and impact of at least one of the main components of the third sectorâ that is, nonprofit institutionsâand volunteering, Europeâs statistical agencies have been slow to adopt these procedures and, therefore, slow to assess the contributions of even these major components of the third sector to Europeâs economy and society. Additionally, in spite of the importance of the third sector in Europe, limited awareness exists about the barriers that hinder the operation and impact of third sector organizations (TSOs) or about the steps that could be taken to eliminate or reduce them. The project out of which this report emergedâthe EU FP7-funded Third Sector Impact Projectâmobilized the collaborative efforts of 12 European research institutions along with dozens of stakeholders and external advisors in an ambitious effort to fill these knowledge gaps. In order to make headway on this task, it was first necessary to clarify the concept of the third sector in its European manifestations. As noted in Chap. 2 of this book, like other social science concepts before it, such as âdemocracy,â âthe stateâ or the âbusiness sector,â the concept of a third sector is a contested one, with numerous competing terms and definitions in circulation and serious questions in some quarters about whether it is even possible to think of this collection of entities and activities as a definable sector at all (Dekker 2004; Evers and Laville 2004). One reason for the confusion surrounding this concept is the enormous diversity of entities potentially embraced by it, and the wide variety of terms used to depict it. Included here are organizations variously referred to as voluntary organizations, nonprofit organizations, nonprofit institutions (NPIs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), associations, civil society, social economy, solidarity organizations, cooperatives, mutuals, foundations, civil society and, more recently social enterprises (Salamon et al. 2004).

The current retirement age threshold should thus be increased; in addition, actuarial adjustment of pensions should be introduced to reflect the life expectancy of people who retire earlier, while actuarial rewards should apply to those who continue to work and pay pension contributions after meeting conditions for full retirement, regardless of whether they receive pensions or not. In order to support entrepreneurship, specific programmes targeted at reducing informal employment should be pursued more vigorously and with reference to experiences of other European countries. Self-employment is supported by the National Employment Service (NES); this assistance takes the form of a one-off non-repayable grant and some in-kind support, provided that the beneficiary regularly pays contributions and taxes for at least the following 2 years. On average, some 3,000â5,000 people per year become self-employed through this programme: NES staff estimate that most of them merely formalise their informal businesses. It is interesting to note that evaluations of such âlegalisedâ entrepreneurs show survival rates greater than for those who started their businesses without previous experience in the informal sector. Microlending is also a measure that facilitates the establishment of legal businesses, especially for categories of people who cannot rely on their own funds or commercial credit, but is as yet virtually non-existent in Serbia due to an inadequate statutory framework. Inspection Oversight The Labour and Market Inspectorates are responsible for tackling informal employment and undeclared and illicit transactions, whilst the Tax Administration is responsible for preventing tax evasion. In addition to the lack of equipment and appropriately qualified staff, one of the key problems in the operation of these institutions is the absence of sufficient co-ordination and integration with other inspection and oversight services. Closer integration is therefore required between the various inspectorates, either through an Inspectorate-General, or, in less demanding form, by means of a co-ordinating body such as a Commission to Co-Ordinate Inspection Oversight. A framework Inspections Law should be adopted, harmonised with European Union regulations, to at least ensure better mutual co-ordination of inspection oversight and to better delimit the powers of the various inspection services, at the same time closing the loopholes in the powers of inspection bodies that have made it possible for the shadow economy to flourish and have hindered the implementation of activities designed to combat it. The advantages of an integrated inspections approach are particularly obvious in the area of the authority of the Market and Labour Inspectorates. A unified database of offenders and offences, accessible to all inspection services, the Tax Administration, the Customs Administration, and the police, would improve the efficiency of the fight against the shadow economy. The integration of powers would mean that inspections that uncover an unregistered or unreported entity or person engaging in an activity under the remit of another inspection would be both authorised and required to order any deficiencies to be remedied and to notify the Tax Administration of the infringement and the measures taken."
242,975,0.982,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","The main administrative bodies involved in migrant management in Thailand are the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and the Ministry of Labour (MOL). The MOI manages the regularization of migrants through civil registration and issues a thirteen-digit identification (ID) number, which grants migrants a temporary residence. The MOIâs primary concern has been to protect national security, and therefore it has supported strict migrant policies, from confining migrants to the employers with whom they had registered to restrictions on their freedom of movement (Pollock/Pearson/Kusakabe 2009: 3â4). The MOI introduced policies that assumed that the need for migrant labour in Thailand was temporary. Consequently, migrant workers are âworking migrantsâ who will eventually return to their countries of origin. The MOL is responsible for issuing work permits, which will allow migrant workers to legally obtain employment in Thailand. The primary concern of the MOL is the demand for migrant workers to meet the countryâs domestic labour shortage, and since the Ministry works directly with the domestic labour market and business sectors, the MOL recognizes the importance of migrant workers and the prospect that"

The chapter does not purport to compare two systems which present speciï¬c characteristics, but rather to show how the protection of human rights, and in particular womenâs rights, can beneï¬t from a dialogue between regional experiences. We will therefore support the trend toward âregionalisationâ in the protection of womenâs rights, encouraging, at the same time, a dialogue between the systems themselves. Despite differences in societies and cultures, discrimination against women does present a common trend, and, in order to eradicate it, States must undertake speciï¬c actions of prevention, protection, and, where relevant, prosecution. We will suggest that the Council of Europe Istanbul Convention should constitute a model for further regional legal instruments on the issue, and that non-Member States of the Council of Europe be encouraged by international bodies, such as the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women, to ratify it.14 With regard to ASEAN, we will assess the important step undertaken by member States with the adoption of the ASEAN Convention against trafï¬cking. Nonetheless, we will stress one limit, namely the fact that the text reproduces the provisions enshrined in the 2000 Protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafï¬cking in persons especially women and children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against transnational organized crime,15 without taking into account the peculiarities of the phenomenon in ASEAN countries.16 The boundaries of our research should be clearly declared at the outset. The ï¬rst boundary is geographical. We will focus on the Council of Europe and the European Union, on the one hand, and on ASEAN countries plus Japan, on the other hand. It means that other regions of the world, including Southern Asia, will be excluded from the analysis. The second boundary is âgenderedâ.

The same space can have both functions at the same time, but in different contexts. For the prevention of conflicts, frameworks of rules that are jointly agreed upon are essential. The two functions of space as well as the high relevance of the rules for the use of space were found with regard to housing and the use of public places: housing as such, depending on how it is arranged, carries the potential of bringing people together and fostering interaction, but it can also be the object of conflicts, as analyzed in the case study of Werderau. We find that the rules on the use of space, as a result of social productions and perceptions, are more relevant for the actual use of public spaces than the existence and availability of these spaces as such. The extent to which the connecting potential of public spaces can be taken advantage of depends much on the rules of their usage. Clear and joint agreements on these rules as well as their communication to all people concerned are necessary to prevent potential conflicts. The case studies of Werderau and Langwasser illustrate that conflicts over space can turn into ethnically framed conflicts. The overlapping of length of stay and ethnic belonging as well as external interference, e.g., by right-wing groups and biased media reportage, are identified as enabling factors of this ethnic framing and as enforcing factors for boundary-making. Mediation activities are often an effective tool to ease ongoing conflicts."

Some ideas have proven valuable in the long term. This led several international actors to ensure their institutional development regarding peacebuilding also incorporated these ideas by encompassing âtraditional knowledgeâ, built on the experiences of international organisations in the ï¬eld, statesâ interests, bureaucratic tendencies, and resource limitations (Call 2015, 3). These âgood practicesâ are multi-faceted and include a commitment to establishing military, legal, political, economic, social, cultural and psychosocial conditions in a post-conflict society able to promote a culture of peace. They seem to be transformative in terms of changing the relations into sustainable partnerships. Thus, some authors (Lederach 2000; Pugh 2000; Stover and Weinstein 2004; Barnes 2006) contend that such actions should be contextual, meaning they take particular cultural and conflict contexts into account and that local civil societyâs participation and representation in the peacebuilding processes is vital. Hence, in theory the current prevailing view is there is a need for âa transdisciplinary mind-setâ that encompasses lessons and insights from many perspectives (multidimensionality and inter-disciplinarity) and creates a more contextual, inclusive and holistic peacebuilding theory, with practical applicability (Lambourne and Herro 2008). However, as Barnett et al. (2007, 53) point out, the problem of the conceptâs multidimensionality is that while all peacebuilding actors might support the idea of building peace, âthey will operate with considerable differences of interpretation regarding the meaning and practice of peacebuildingâ, since they will all adopt a meaning, activities and policies of peacebuilding that is consistent with their interests, worldviews and mandates. This may suggest that all international peacebuilding cooperation is inherently political and that different peacebuilding actors will act according to various strategies for achieving durable peace in a given post-conflict society that are not necessarily solely based on âbest practicesâ arising from experience. This indicates peacebuilding could ultimately be a political accomplishment that âmight be settled by bureaucratic and political powerâ (Barnett et al. 2007, 54). Moreover, the lack of a clear deï¬nition of the concept or accompanying strategy could produce an outcome which âcan be challenged by efï¬ciency, coordination and sustainability issuesâ (Duke and Courtier 2009, 4)."
72,174,0.982,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Innovations in regulations and rights Creating flexible forms of ad hoc support that meet newly emerging risks Increasingly, patterns of working and living are changing and becoming less continuous, and the zones of transition between life situations and life stages are becoming more complicated (Bovenberg, 2008). Traditional services cannot always cope with these complexities. This may mean being out of school but not yet in a job or on the track back to employment but without access to somewhere to live. Often this coincides with other acute problems that may require immediate help. What some have called ânew social risksâ (Bonoli, 2005) cannot be dealt with using the manual of standard risks that typically shape the range of social services and transfer-systems of post-war welfare states. Innovative ways of offering a quick fix, often provisionally, may well be the critical missing link when it comes to providing living and working arrangements that keep people âin the gameâ. Quite a number of the social innovations studied in the WILCO project involved establishing this kind of short-term, time-limited, ad hoc support. One telling example was the âWelfare Foundation Ambrosianoâ in Milan, Italy (Evers et al., 2014, p. 182), that aimed to support individuals and families with a quick supply of credit who were temporarily in need for various reasons (redundancy, illness, and so on), regardless of their previous or current type of employment contract and country of origin. âSocial contractsâ with individuals and groups Traditionally, most public welfare services have the status of rights that are unconditional insofar as they usually simply require a set of material preconditions to be fulfilled. A new tendency in welfare arrangements, particularly in the field of workfare, has been for clients to enter a form of contractual relationship where the preconditions for support concern their future behaviour. These types of contractual relationship involve the clients taking exclusive responsibility for themselves."

Can they influence their own situation at the institution through individual, day-to-day contact with staff or through participation in user boards? Is there participation in municipal decision-making, either through representatives or mediated by civil society organisations? The active citizenship approach focuses on dimensions that enable users to deal with quality problems in relation to the staff, and the administrators, and local politicians at the municipal level. Our ï¬ndings indicate that administrative systems, real opportunities for choice, and participative structures matter for active citizenship. These are aspects of the welfare system that policymakers may change through normal tools of governance. The combined insight from the case studies reported in Chaps. 4â6 is that we ï¬nd the best conditions for active citizenship when there is a real opportunity for users to choose between institutions, and the service providers have room to create distinctive services. This situation typically occurs when there is a right to establish new service institutions, depending on approval on the national level rather than tight regulation at the local level. There must also be some excess capacity in the welfare system to create flexibility between the public and private providers. Active citizenship is less likely to occur when the municipality assigns users to the different institutions, there is insufï¬cient capacity, and public regulation allows little room for distinctiveness. Then the users tend to be more passive both when it comes to seeking adaptation to their particular needs and in participation in decision-making at the institutional level. The power is shifted from the users to the service providers. These conditions for active citizenship have more to do with regulation, funding, and norms than with whether the providers belong to the public, for-proï¬t, or nonproï¬t sector. However, the distinctiveness of services and empowerment of users through formal arenas is most prominent in nonproï¬t service providers, to the extent that they have operative autonomy from public regulation and external owners with privileged steering rights. The comparative case studies in schools and nursing homes presented in Chaps. 4â6 show that there are considerable differences between the two service areas with regard to active citizenship. As we elaborate below, two key features are decisive for explaining similarities between nursing"

Furthermore, many stakeholders in Myanmar also expressed interest in learning about Pancasila, the formal philosophical foundations of the State of Indonesia, particularly the idea of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika (âUnity in Diversityâ), the official maxim of Indonesia, since the two countries have shared almost similar challenges with ethnic diversity and associated periodic political tensions. While there has been some internal criticisms of the Indonesia government to be late when it comes to reaping the benefits of its early political investments in Myanmar, to some extent there is an interesting finding that such âunfortunateâ situation has somehow situated Indonesia in a better position compared to other actors, such as China, India and Japan, which have expanded their economic interests in the country (Chachavalpongpun 2010). Indonesia has been able to secure more trust to play a role of peace-builder, which will be elucidated in the next section, due to its relatively low-key presence in terms of business or economic activities in Myanmar so far. Role in Peacebuilding/Peace-Related Areas Indonesiaâs governmental role in peacebuilding in Myanmar is unique, in the sense that it has been directed more towards larger and more highlevel contexts, including projecting democracy as the basic foundation to create sustainable peace. Here, Jakarta has been focusing itself to share its experiences in democratic transitions, including on how to manage with the âmessyâ side effects of such processes. What makes it different is the emphasis on the usage of âdemocraticâ methods that are different from what the traditional actors, mainly Western countries, used to apply. It is certainly not an easy task to grasp how the Indonesia policymakers define the term peacebuilding. When directly asked about their understanding on the term, most of them relate it with the UN definition, in which peacebuilding is a set of activities conducted after peace has been relatively achieved through the sigining of peace agreement between the conflicting parties. Within this context, then, some argued that peacebuilding itself is relatively a new experience for Indonesia and the country has just started to learn the process during the Aceh peace process which taken place after the Tsunami disaster severely hit the province in the end of 2004. As stated by one general, âPeacebuilding is also something new for Indonesia. We learn it in the case of Aceh. There is no template, we just"

From this perspective, with an eye on a number of some consolidated microfinance and microcredit experiences, this study represents a first attempt to affirm microinsurance not simply as a phenomenon catering exclusively to the most vulnerable strata (or the totality, in some cases) of the population, often far away (not only geographically) from the âdevelopedâ countries, but also as an âalternativeâ form of providing insurance services, which, following proper operational and regulatory adjustments, could be applied also to advanced economies in order to meet the demand and needs of those subjects traditionally excluded from the âconventionalâ insurance circuit. Obviously, several obstacles may hinder the full-scale development of this new model of providing insurance. As already mentioned, first of all there are regulatory obstacles, which may considerably prevent potential microinsurance providers from entering this market; to this must be added operational hurdles, including strictly technical problems (e.g., the creation of pools of insurers allowing for an effective management of the risks undertaken) as well as strategic issues (assessing, e.g., the opportunity â besides the mere economic convenience â of entering the microinsurance business), commercial (e.g., the"

These insights are crucial for our context. Popular politics and state reforms in the ChÃ¡vez era were taking place within a highly conflictive terrain, with a variety of actors and interests both within and outside the realm of the state. In addition, the government built up a host of new institutions and structures, exactly in order to âby-passâ the pre-existing structures that they knew were extremely difficult to reform and gain control over. This produced an additional fragmentation and âzonificationâ of the state that made the enactment of government reforms a challenge. Indeed, an inquiry into the Venezuelan bureaucracy to a certain extent debunks the popular myth that ChÃ¡vez and his government wielded excessive power over the state bureaucracy. The Venezuelan state is historically imbued with ânon-Weberianâ dynamics in the sense of being a site of personalized and highly fallible bureaucratic practices. These practices became even more complicated as the Venezuelan state under ChÃ¡vez became a conflictive site for new and old networks of power, some resisting and some reproducing entrenched state practices, and all of them intensely competing for power. These insights provide a clearer picture of why political reforms enacted from above were so difficult to enact. It also helps us understand why popular sector activists insisted on popular struggle as the key to the advancement of the Bolivarian process. The Venezuelan state would not transform itself on its own. It could only be transformed through sustained pressure and popular struggle from below in a prolonged Gramscian war of position as well as war of maneuver."

These lessons, as well as the countryâs status as a European Union candidate, a committed NATO ally, and a buffer state for the West, heighten Turkeyâs role in the facilitation of peace in the region and reinforce its image as a bridge between geographical and cultural divides. As a Western-oriented, secular state with a majority Muslim population, Turkey is increasingly regarded as a pivot in effectively addressing both humanitarian and security aspects of the entrenched conflicts in Syria and the greater Levant. Turkey hosts approximately 2.8 million Syrian refugees (UNHCR, February 2017). At the same time it provides support for opposition forces in Syria and allowed members of the anti-IS (Islamic State) coalition, such as the USA to use its airbases. For much of its history, however, Turkey has been plagued by rampant insecurity and economic and political instability. It has experienced four military coups and a 30-year armed insurgency. As such, Turkeyâs recent activities may be supported by economic and international shifts in power, but its conceptualization and approach to peacebuilding is very much informed by the countryâs experiences of insecurity.1"

Within this context, the MI requested the World Bank to support a process to shift the paradigm from reactive to proactive drought management. Specifically, MI requested: (i) to help with an âinstitutional upgradeâ through structuring and facilitating a more permanent institutional approach and response to drought, and improving integration within and between federal and state institutions; and (ii) to help with a âtechnical upgradeâ through developing concrete drought monitoring tools and preparedness plans/protocols.

According to Tardif (2005, p. 25), the approach is based on the notion of the emergence of social innovation: As a localized process initiated by different actors who seek to change the interactions taking place between themselves as well as with their organizational and institutional environment â the whole with the aim to counteract the impact of crises while attempting to reconcile the different levels of individual interest, public interest and common good. The statistical analysis of data will make it possible to move from a micro to a meso and macro approach to studying social innovation. The assumption is that there are objects of study of relevance for social innovation that are not observable at the micro scale. At the meso level of analysis, such a database will allow for a new reading of social innovations in terms of the mechanisms, configurations, evolution and modes of dissemination in time and across locations and sectors of activity. The approach will, moreover, make it possible to focus on phenomena hitherto little studied in the QuÃ©bec context, such as the emergence and dissemination of innovation clusters, including their patterns and paths of institutionalisation or even their configuration into an innovation system, and to examine their impacts on social transformation, in particular with regard to the QuÃ©bec development model. This framework, once applied to QuÃ©bec, may be extended to other areas in order to conduct international comparisons. There are, indeed, times and territories where social innovations tend to multiply, taking the form of innovation clusters, especially at the onset of crises or in economies with plural tendencies (Klein et al., 2013). Innovations are, then, oriented along emerging socio-technical paradigms, such as new representations of problems and possible solutions or experiments that were successfully carried out in organisations and local communities. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s in QuÃ©bec, when the crisis of Fordism and the welfare state became apparent, social innovations arose in the areas of labour, people services, collective enterprises, public policies and local development (the areas that CRISES focuses on). Using the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, it will be possible to trace the dynamics of the emergence of these innovations as well as their spread into clusters and their wider impacts on society. For example, a researcher might study the proximity effect, which is a phenomenon that promotes collective dynamics with the potential to modulate or reject the dominant forms of social control or"

Such an isolated expertise is not, however, desirable, nor in the longer term sustainable. It is clear that international organizations in general derive substantial authority through possessing or providing distinctive expertise; it is, simply put, an âauthorityâ that derives from the ability to make âauthoritativeâ pronouncements in a particular area, drawing on forms of specialized technical or professional knowledge (Barnett and Finnemore 2004, pp. 24â29). The ability of forms of international organization to assume such authorityâirrespective of the (non-) existence of formal institutional arrangementsâhas perhaps been most influentially captured in Peter Haasâ widely cited (and, in some respects, over extended) concept of âepistemic communitiesâ. Such communities, as Haas deï¬nes them, are âgroups of professionals, often from a variety of different disciplines, which produce policy-relevant knowledge about complex technical issuesâ (Haas 1992, p. 16). The more that such groups are able to achieve a consensus in a given area, encompassing both substantive and causal beliefs as to the nature of good or effective policy, the more they may be able to set the agenda at the relative expense of more diffuse political concerns. The international organization of expertise may, in other words, displace the locus of decision-making from broad political to more technical fora, with the relative merits of policy solutions as viewed within the expert community correspondingly establishing the prevailing policy templates. The BP clearly has elements of such an epistemic community. The process, in speciï¬c areas such as quality assurance or the development of qualiï¬cations frameworks, is invested with a speciï¬c technical competence. More widely, it can be seen to have created an expert community, possessed of its own thick âcoordinative discourseâ (cf. Schmidt 2006), allowing for the specialist discussion of policy issues. The development of such areas of expertise and governance technologies is, moreover, a substantial strength of the process. It does, in the terms set out above, allow for the making of authoritative claims on the basis of specialist knowledge, which carry authority relative to political actors. This, in turn, serves to legitimate particular policy templates and to delegitimate others, substantially on the basis of the consensus that has emerged in the group. The limits of such a âdepoliticizationâ also, however, have to be recognized; an isolated expertise, turned in on itself and concerned only with relatively subsidiary questions of policy instrumentation, is likely simply to atrophy over time. On the one hand, if such a community is to exercise an influence, it must maintain clear channels of communication to the wider policy process and constellations of concerned actors (cf. Dunlop 2012). On the other hand, such a community must also itself remain open to wider influences, and in particular stay attuned to the evolving policy agenda. In the present context, this focuses attention on two sets of crucial connections. At a macro-level, it is important that the work of the Bologna Follow-Up Group (BFUG) continue to be connected to a wider political process, as embodied in the (now) triennial ministerial conference, such that the linkages between detailed reforms and wider political agendas are not lost. At a micro-level, it is similarly"

Hybrid institutions can be addressed from different theoretical perspectives. Instrumentalist approaches assume that actors are political and social entrepreneurs who actively use their social capital to build institutions that strive for optimal resource management. It is usually claimed that, to use social capital appropriately, institutions must be properly embedded in the cultural and social context from which the norms to support purposive decision-making are drawn (Ostrom, 1990). However, it has been claimed that concepts of embeddedness foster a functional and static conceptualization of culture and tradition that obscures the complex dynamics of institutional construction and evolution (Cleaver, 2001). Cleaver (2002: 17) claims that âthe evolution of collective decision-making institutions may not be the process of conscious selection of mechanisms ï¬t for the collective action task (as in Ostromâs model) but rather a messier process of piecing together shaped by individuals acting within the bounds of circumstantial constraintâ. In her studies of institutions for common property resource management in Tanzania, Cleaver (2001, 2002, 2013) develops the concept of âinstitutional bricolageâ as a process by which people consciously and unconsciously draw on existing social and cultural arrangements (rules, traditions, norms, roles and relationships) to shape institutions in patch-together institutions to change situations (Cleaver et al., 2013). In this dynamic, the resulting institution is a mix of modern and traditional, of formal and informal practices. Institutional bricolage offers a compelling approach to understanding the way in which hybrid institutions can be the result of a complex and dynamic assemblage process where contexts, conï¬icts, needs, scales, actors, and formal and informal institutions come into play to produce a particular hybrid institution. Environmental Justice Movements (EJMs) Latin American anti-mining movements and organizations played a central role in the emergence and spread of consultations.

Most policy and research concerning migration presents a prototype of the labour migrant as a unit in the macroeconomic theory of exchange, and focuses on financial gains and losses rather than on the realities as lived by migrants. More attentiveness and openness to how life actually is for people on the move across borders, and to the patterns of their inclusion in and exclusion from societies, is crucial for an effective approach to their right to health in line with international human rights law.4 Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) is a relatively new field of inquiry in migration research. Here, we take a holistic approach and explore how a combination of forms of institutional discrimination that are interconnected can affect how SRH problems are solved for migrant domestic workers. First, the concept of SRH is set out as a normative framework, and this is followed by a discussion on the concept of structural vulnerability to ill health that has been introduced in medical anthropology and applied to the situations of marginal labour migrants. This concept is then adjusted for the analysis of SRH situations faced by domestic workers from the Philippines in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Qatar. Data compiled on the experiences of migrant women domestic workers during their years of employment in these destination countries are presented, and the variations discussed.5 The conclusion proposes new avenues for SRH advocates to take on board the needs of mobile populations in a globalized world and to cooperate with mi-"
395,264,0.982,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"15.3.1 Professionalization Is (also) a Matter of (Group) Identity As Jan Hayes describes in her chapter, professionalization is more than simply a matter of training; it is ï¬rst a matter of identity. Be it communities of practice, craft groups or tradesâ¦, we have seen the importance of having professional groups sharing practices and producing safety rules which are not of the same type as rules written by experts. These groups share, and build together a common identity, strongly based on the type of activities performed: âwhat we doâ is âwho we areâ. In this respect, as illustrated by Hayes, storytelling is a key component of social learning, as discussions on past events are full of learning material for peers. Trust is therefore of the greatest importance in order to create a favourable climate to make these discussions possible. This, again, emphasizes the need for spaces for debate. In short, many employees in industries have a (shared) professional identity, emerging from social interactions. This identity remains largely unrecognized by organizations; yet, professionals ensure mutual recognition through various informal processes, all leading to professionalization processes. This identity, in turn, questions the role of power in the relations between different organizationâs entities."
99,251,0.982,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"managerial and still another where concerns of autonomy, participation and pluralism prevail (Evers 2010). Berlin has always been characterized by competing concepts of âa better cityâ that were not exclusive but coexisted and stimulated each other. In other words, they all left their mark on the urban landscape. For instance, in the field of housing and urban revitalization a plurality of discourses has long meant that large-scale programmes, such as those to promote âcareful urban renewalâ, pursued by the city government were challenged (or even subverted) by various citizen initiatives such as the squatter movement (Holm and Kuhn 2011). Similarly, alternative concepts for childcare (e.g. so-called Kinderladen pursuing an anti-authoritarian upbringing of children in West Berlin) and concerning working life (e.g. rejecting the use of âstate doshâ for alternative projects in the field of social work) emerged from Berlinâs counterculture. â¢ The impact of history: Practices and values that guide action and politics have been very much affected by the historical developments and experiences that make up the âmulti-layered historicity of the presentâ (HaggrÃ©n et al. 2013). A tableau of coexisting values and policy orientations and reasoning about its possible changes can only be created when one takes account of these historical underpinnings. Thus Berlin, and in particular its local welfare policies, can only be understood against the backdrop of the changing history of the city. For instance, average rents in Berlin are still relatively low compared to other major German cities (e.g. Hamburg and Munich) because the housing supply was heavily subsidized by the federal state until the 2000s. Nevertheless, the steady rise of rents and its effect on the social mixture within inner-city districts has today become Berlinâs most controversial issue. Likewise, developments in the field of employment may be misinterpreted without a healthy dose of historical evidence: While some regions in southern Germany (e.g. in some regions in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg) are heading towards full employment, unemployment in Berlin is still in the double-digit range. One reason for this is the inherited structural weakness of the local economy that is service based but lacks jobs in traditional industries (Allon 2013, p. 289). With regard to childcare and family care, Berlin remains a divided city (despite a process of gradual convergence) due to different policy legacies: In East Berlin (where childcare policies were characterized by a âwork-centred approachâ during German Democratic Republic (GDR) times), childcare coverage (and supply) for children aged 0â3 is significantly higher than in West Berlin, where traditionally there was part-time care for children aged 3â6 in kindergartens. â¢ Differences between policy fields: It is not only the difference between old and new, and left and right orientations that can be observed but also the specificity of discursive constellations in policy fields constituted by ââhorizontalâ and âverticalâ componentsâ (Kendall 2003, p. 7), i.e. local and federal competences to change politics. While there may often be a kind of overarching narrative, shaped by national politics and dominating local coalitions, due to a number of factors, situations in policy fields may vary quite considerably. Moreover, innovative ideas, while backed by the community of experts in a policy field, may often be restricted by the locally prevailing general discourse or vice versa."
98,72,0.982,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","To be self-governing, the organization must bear full responsibility for the economic risks and rewards of its operations. The need for this defining feature arises from the interconnectedness of various institutional units through legal ownership. Following SNA procedures, we distinguish between legal and economic ownership and put the emphasis on the latter rather than the former. While a TSE organization may be created by a corporation, it is not considered to be controlled by that corporation so long as it retains full responsibility for the economic risks and rewards entailed in its operations. Entities that assume the economic risks and rewards for their operations are âself-governedâ and thus institutionally separate from other units that may legally own them. Such selfgoverned units are allocated to economic sectors based on their own economic activities rather than those of the units that may legally own them. Thus, a for-profit business that is fully responsible for the economic risks and rewards of its operations is not in-scope of the TSE sector even though it is legally owned by a unit that is in-scope. Likewise, a TSE unit that is fully responsible for its economic and risks and rewards is still treated as in-scope of the TSE sector satellite account, even if it is legally âownedâ by a for-profit corporation. 3. If receiving government funding determines significant aspects of the general policy or program of the organization; A TSE organization may be mainly financed by government and still not controlled by government if the organization is able to determine its policy or program to a significant extent; 4. If an organization must seek the approval of government before assuming risk or voting itself out of existence or if it is controlled by government or depends on government to shield it from risk. A single indicator could be sufficient to establish control in some cases, but in other cases, a number of separate indicators may collectively indicate control. A decision based on the totality of all indicators will necessarily be judgmental in nature. Borderline cases include organizations created by political processes but that operate quasi-independently of the agencies that established them (so-called GONGOs) as well as organizations that implement government-created responsibilities to oversee certain areas of economic or professional activity, such as regulating who can practice a profession, arbitrating labor-management relations, and so on. Such organizations may operate in close relationship with government authorities such that it may be difficult to decide whether they are institutional parts of government. The ultimate test is whether the leadership of such entities can dissolve the units on their own authority. If not, the entities are out of scope of the TSE sector as defined here."
341,346,0.982,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"Accountability is a powerful entry point to improve water integrity and thus water governance. However, external support agencies face multiple challenges in their support to accountability. Experience shows that approaches financed by external actors can run the risk of remaining externally owned at least in the short to medium term. A critical condition for effective aid-funded activities is to analyse the incentive structures for accountability in order to identify and manage risks and opportunities in the political and administrative landscape and understand the societal demands and work through or in close contact with reform-minded top public officials. Another major challenge is to avoid a situation where accountability interventions substitute civil society initiatives to failing state capacity, which can lead to even more disorganisation of the service delivery framework. The support provided by external support agencies often tends to focus on participatory approaches. However, evidence confirms that without the threat of effective sanctions (and resulting impacts), citizen mobilisation is difficult to sustain in the long run. Similarly, as noted by the general literature on anticorruption, anticorruption reforms should not only target law enforcement, but rather public officials should be part of broader changes on how they interact with the public (Rose-Ackerman and Carrington 2013). For external support agencies to tackle these risks and to achieve sustainable results, there is a need to broaden the scope of efforts. One first useful step is to ensure that support to accountability targets both social accountability mechanisms, aimed at increasing citizensâ voice, and traditional accountability mechanisms, such as investigations, inspections and audits which can impose formal sanctions. Civil society organisations play a key role in demanding accountability, but weaknesses of the NGO sector in many aid-dependent countries can constrain the effectiveness of external support agency interventions. Many NGOs rely on external assistance while at the same time they need to develop credibility, local legitimacy and independence from the government. Donors will need to provide long-term support in a balanced way, without undermining the necessary commitment to local improvement while aiming at developing self-sustainable organisations. An associated challenge to these processes is the long-term need to see reforms make changes on the ground, for users but also for politicians who want re-election and for external support agents who need to show short-term results to their constituencies. The next generation of accountability support will require a more politically informed understanding of the national context, more flexibility and patience"
282,75,0.982,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"guidelines and codes of best practiceâ for developed markets that includes over 100 such codes (Gregory, 2001). For non-profit organisations, the NGO Independent Sector publishes a compendium of standards, codes and principles that lists over 60 examples applicable in the US.58 These codes are published by intergovernmental organisations, governments, professional associations and social groups and vary significantly in scope and strictness.59 The application of these codes is usually voluntary. Nevertheless their number and spread shows that the normative consensus that âgoodâ organisations need accountability mechanisms is widespread. Earlier in the chapter stakeholder theorists were criticised for using these laws and emerging regulations to support their claim that all stakeholders should have the right to participate in determining a companyâs future. In what way, then, is the argument made here different? Firstly, the claim here is that there is a normative consensus that organisations need appropriate accountability mechanisms, not that all groups should be allowed to participate in decision making. What exactly counts as âappropriateâ will be analysed in greater detail at the end of this chapter. Secondly, a closer look at the exact requirements made by law and voluntary codes reveals that only those stakeholder groups that are principals, that is, those who delegate some form of authority to an organisation, are included in accountability arrangements. To illustrate this, letâs return to the example of a public company. An operating company has various forms of authority delegated to it. Investors delegate the right to manage their money to the company. Local communities or governments authorise it to operate on their territory. Employees give it the authority to determine under what conditions they work. Consumers, finally, by buying the companyâs products, authorise it to take over a specific segment in the division of labour. Laws also protect the rights of other groups. Competitors, for example, are shielded from unfair competition by anti-trust and anti-dumping legislation. But only the groups delegating authority to the company are recognised to have a right to accountability. Thus most governance codes are concerned with issues that enable shareholders to control managers. Local communities are included in the planning process, workers have the right to unionise or sit on the companyâs board and consumers at least get some rights to information so they can take informed decisions. Competitors, suppliers or non-local communities that are affected by the companyâs activities, by contrast, are not granted any rights that would enable them to hold the company to account. Accountability mechanisms, then, are designed to prevent the abuse of authority and protect the rights of principals. Appropriate accountability arrangements are therefore an integral part of what constitutes a âgoodâ institutional set-up. This is the normative core of the concept of accountability and the main reason why we cherish accountability as something good. The argument leaves one potential loophole. What if people are not as fallible and corruptible as James Madison and the political thinkers following"

169,539,0.982,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"18.4.3 Prior Notiï¬cation and Consultation Mechanisms As it has been mentioned already in the previous subchapter, the obligation not to cause signiï¬cant harm to co-riparian states is a key element of international water law. It is not only embodied in global conventions and regional agreements (such as the SADC Protocol on Shared Watercourses 2000) but also in a considerable number of basin-speciï¬c treaties.3 Its implementation is, however, challengingâas is its enforcement. In order to ensure that measures taken in one riparian country do not have negative transboundary effects on other riparian countries, countries potentially affected by such measures have to, ï¬rst and foremost, be informed about the respective measures and be enabled to evaluate its potential impacts. This is done through prior notiï¬cation and consultation mechanisms. Such mechanisms are foreseen in some basin-speciï¬c treaties4âalthough the majority of treaties remain silent on this rather complex matter. This is largely due to the fact that the establishment of a prior notiï¬cation mechanism is often perceived as a signiï¬cant limitation to unilateral national development interests, since it implies the inclusion of other statesâ interests in the planning and development of water resources development projects. Most often, treaty provisions follow general guidance provided by international conventions, the adjudication of international courts, and, more generally, customary international law. The process then consists of a ï¬rst notiï¬cation about a planned measure, the provision of relevant information (such as the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and related documents), a certain time frame during which a potentially affected state can respond to the information received (6 months according to Art. 13 of the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention), and a response by the respective state, potentially leading to consultations and negotiations or any other following action. The process does, however, not imply a veto right for the potentially affected state. While international- and basin-speciï¬c agreements already provide detailed guidance on the process of prior notiï¬cation, its implementation remains challenging"
266,44,0.982,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"Service Design Canvas for Community Policing During the Unity project, team at the Police University College (Finland) developed on the basis of business model canvas a strategy tool named a Service Design Canvas for Community Policing (SDCCP).3 The tool is for addressing and prioritizing the needs of communities and citizens, setting goals while recognizing how various resources, activities, partners and channels may have an effect on the outcomes. Service Design can be used as an overall strategy tool, or as a more specified tool that suggests actions or programs to solve the individual problems identified by the SWOT analysis or by some other means. In the case of Puhos, this tool was used e.g. to find the added value of CP and to identify the key partners and channels of communication. There are nine elements in the SDCCP template. It can be filled by the police or, preferably in collaboration with the community partners, as was the case in Puhos. The first five elements are about the operational environment of CP. At the beginning, the participants should define who are the Key Customers of CP? Which communities, individuals, or neighborhoods will be the key beneficiaries? To whom CP is creating value through solving security problems and increasing safety? This requires thorough discussion and judgement, because customers are known by their problems, but not all problems are police issues. Next phase requires imagination and innovation. The participants of the local problem solving process, that is, the police and stakeholders alike, should put forward a Unique Value Proposition of CP. What kind of added value are CP activities providing for the communities, neighborhoods or particular individuals? What kind of security or safety needs and expectations should CP meet? The proposed solutions or programs should be accepted by the community, neighborhoods or citizens who will be the recipients of the services. Therefore, it is important that they are also given a voice, directly or indirectly, in the service design process. The third element in the SDCCP is the identification of the main Communication and Contacting Channels with the Key Customers. Through which channels do"
364,246,0.982,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"The incidence of food insecurity can be viewed as the ultimate effect of several inter-related biophysical and socio-economic factors that comprise the main hazards and risks. Environmental degradation, for example, may be caused by a combination of manâs interaction with physical resources and naturally occurring hazards. It is evident in all the sites that the declining land resource base is adversely affecting farm and fishery householdsâ incomes and livelihoods, resulting in the threat of food insufficiency for the poorest. Across sites, households perceive that continued occurrence of climatic and other natural events in the years to come will have a major impact on their incomes, family health, food security, and the circumstances of the community as a whole. With these issues in mind, the following technical and policy concerns should be taken into consideration to develop a research agenda that would facilitate the creation of a plan for managing watersheds and implementing related strategies. 1. Developing an integrated approach to watershed management that covers both land and water resources entails convening the major stakeholders to: (1) develop and agree on a common vision, goals, and objectives for managing the watershed and lake resources (e.g., improved water quality for a given period of time); (2) identify issues and problems that may hinder the fulfilment of the vision, goals, and objectives; and (3) prioritize and develop an agreed action plan for dealing with the identified problems and/or constraints. 2. In trying to address issues relating to soil and land degradation, it is important to determine whether the causes are anthropogenic or geogenic, since the potential solutions would be different. For example, many problems related to soil and land degradation can be traced to watershed management practices that are dictated by stakeholdersâ socio-economic circumstances. Of research interest, therefore, are studies on the appropriateness of different technologies given different physical and biological conditions of the soil. Technologies that address different bio-physical and socio-economic conditions among farmers might include re-vegetation, erosion control measures, water conservation, agroforestry systems, organic farming, and use of organic pesticides. 3. When developing plans for the watershed areas, addressing poverty and providing the means to make a living at the household level should be a major consideration, given our understanding of the relationships between land and water resources"

232,4,0.982,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"The consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in March 2011 sparked a debate about the nuclear safety. While releases of large amounts of radioactive materials resulted in no casualties due to radiation, the impact particularly on local communities is substantial and manifold. Although local communities want to be ensured that effective actions are being taken to allow them to go back to their normal life as early as possible, the lack of understanding for the transport of radioisotopes in the environment and eventually the uptake in humans as well as in the biological effects of low dose radiation has made it difï¬cult for various stakeholders to develop concerted efforts to accelerate recovery. These challenges are compounded by the eroded public trust for government and operators. To address this need, a multidisciplinary initiative is carried out by scientists at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), MINES ParisTech, and Tokyo University to provide the necessary guidance for effective assessment and remediation efforts and to provide trusted, unbiased, and nuclear-industry-independent perspective to build trust with local and global communities. Based on such on-going initiatives, there are two emerging questions: (1) how integration between understanding for natural scientiï¬c processes and understanding for a society at different scales and regions can be achieved for the objective of accurate monitoring, and then ultimately (2) how such accurate monitoring and public participation can and should be integrated in decision-making processes for achieving a resilient society. To address such questions and to develop a research plan, we hosted, in March 2015,2 a two-day international workshop in UC Berkeley. In this workshop, ï¬rst, we share various observations about âdamagesâ in a severe nuclear accident and"

Such an approach, while intended to ensure that things are done correctly, is criticized by both Turkish officials and Somalis interviewed, for being too slow and bureaucratic. For example, Turkish diplomats apparently felt frustrated when they attempted to collaborate with AMISOM on training Somali soldiers in 2013. Their plan was met with resistance from some AMISOM partners such as the USA (Wasuge 2016). Frustrated with the lack of progress, Turkey decided to start working with the Somalia National Army bilaterally. Similarly, with the exception of a brief hiatus in 2013, Turkey has provided direct budgetary support to the Federal Government of Somalia. The payments have ranged from $4.5 million to $6 million in recent years (Olgan Bekarâs speech, Rising Powers Conference 2016). This is an aspect of the New Deal that other donors have failed to do, citing concerns with transparency (Hearn 2016). Some respondents noted that traditional donorsâ overly bureaucratic approach, with multiple offices, systems, and officials to work with, often overwhelmed and stifled the functioning of the recipient countryâs fragile state institutions.3 Bilateral engagement seems to be more manageable for recipient states. However, the bilateral model also brings out a number of serious coordination problems, especially in the areas of personnel deployment (level of expertise and personnel insurance packages), absence of a reliable monitoring and evaluation model and language constraints. Turkey, nonetheless, remains acutely aware of the international analysis of global dynamics but prefers bilateral development assistance arrangements."
126,144,0.982,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"Cross-Border Conflict and Diminishing Resources: The Ilemi Triangle Ingredient â¢ Localized conflicts in the transboundary region have been escalating in recent years. This is primarily due to worsening resource deterioration and poverty conditions throughout, continued dispossession fueled by government policies, prolonged droughts and disease outbreaks. Climate change, while likely to be a major factor of increased vulnerability of the local population to the impacts of the looming dam and irrigated agricultural development, has not been responsibly studied in the region. Finally, rampant arms trafï¬cking continually expands throughout the region and contributes to the upward spiral of violence. â¢ Most destructive among government policies are the Ethiopian governmentâs large-scale, forcible evictions of indigenous communities along the lowermost Omo River (as well as upstream in Mursi/Kwegu/Bodi territory) in order to make way for large-scale, irrigated commercial agricultural schemes. Major irrigation infrastructure construction brings further expropriation and destruction of resources necessary for local residentsâ survival, as well and creates major blockages to mobility of herd animals. â¢ The Kenya governmentâs present acceptance of the Gibe III dam and irrigated agricultureâat least by the time of this writing, and the Kenyan governmentâs active partnership in the transmission of electricity from the Gibe III to Kenya and beyond are additional major destructive policies. Rising tensions over dwindling grazing resources and watering points has intensiï¬ed long-established interethnic tensions and conflicts, major locales for which are shown in a map below. These stresses have also weakened the extensive regional system of food related exchangeâa system important to the survival of all groups (Fig. 1.6). Similar impacts on social exchange have been noted for comparable pastoral regions by Abbink (2000, 2009), Teqegn (2003), and Hendrickson et al. (1998a, b). The numerous âhot spotâ conflict localities where conflict is already intensifying and can be expected to spike even more sharply as the Gibe III dam and agricultural enterprises are allowed to operate, are indicated in a map in Chap. 5.

395,194,0.982,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"11.2.3 Formal Teams Versus Professional Groups and Communities In the managerial/bureaucratic approach, professionals are supposed to work collectively in formal teams. These teams are determined by the way work has been divided in the organization. By contrast, professional groups refer to communities that donât always ï¬t the structure of formal teams and departments. A professional group is a group that makes sense for its members. It is often described as a âcommunity of practiceâ where members share the same practices and discuss them well beyond the organizational frontiers. Discussions are not necessarily consensual, they can be very challenging and take the form of debates and professional arenas where professionals compete and show off their skills. Internal relationships in such communities are both co-operative and competitive to produce shared professional norms and rules. It is the community within which the members ï¬nd the resources to be a real professional. A professional group is also a political group that promotes the interests of the professional it represents. In HRO, safety is based on auto-organized groups that emerge unexpectedly from collective action to quickly respond to a problematic situation. This is based on the âheedful interrelationsâ that practitioners develop among themselves to stay constantly aware of the situation, but also to mind and to care about colleagues who could potentially need help and support (Weick and Roberts 1993)."
72,183,0.982,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Germany (Evers et al., 2014, p. 137). This is an example of one of many municipalities in Germany that had opted for local responsibility rather than being part of an integrated centralised service system. Upgrading the community component in mixed welfare systems Given that the community sphere was often subsumed within the third sector of voluntary associations in society, excluding family relationships and informal neighbourhood-communities, it was all the more important to see that a major aspect of many social innovations was developing innovative forms of community. A good example of combining the public and community spheres and sharing the responsibility for care between these two was the âChildren CafÃ©sâ in Lille, France, which opened up the tasks and concerns of family life to the community. Another example was from Amsterdam (the Netherlands), where a housing corporation decided to support community organisations (âNeighbourhood Management Companiesâ) in their housing as it was being reconstructed (Evers et al., 2014, p. 80; p. 203). It should certainly be noted that many social innovations were, in various ways, challenging traditional interpretations of welfare, in which community, building on a shared sense of duty, was seen as a rather parochial element to be gradually substituted by more state-public, professionalised and completely voluntary elements. Integrating economic and social logics In contrast to the previous point, the integration of social and economic logics is much better established as a concern in the debates on the profile of future welfare systems. The creeping economisation of all spheres of life, and an increasingly productivist attitude that evaluates all social actions and relationships primarily with respect to their quantifiable economic effect, is just one side of the coin. The other side can be found in the debate on the welfare state as a âsocial investment stateâ (Morel et al., 2012) that advocates modernising public welfare through an approach that stresses the positive economic effects of social policy interventions in education, family support, and occupational and social integration. In urban regeneration, those social innovations that sought to combine the active participation of people as co-producers and co-decision-makers with public and private investment could be seen as part of this perspective on social investment as a means of societal development. Integrating welfare and urban politics Policy fields that are usually excluded from the welfare system, such as environmental policy or cultural activities, played an important role in"

197,96,0.982,Energy Poverty : (Dis)Assembling Europe's Infrastructural Divide,"social policy in addressing its causes is widely acknowledged, the Commission continues to legislate and project within the bounds of its constitutional asymmetry, elevating the consumer and the proper functioning of the IEM as the focus of policy. Though the changing economic environment has elevated the need to protect vulnerable members of society, social, health and welfare policy remain largely national responsibilities, leaving the EU to tackle issues such as energy poverty from one sideâlegislating on the internal market and consumer protection while leaving social policy remedies to the Member States. To get around this imbalance, the EU supplements this well-established internal market and consumer legislation with a vast body of soft law. In 2007, the Commission established the Citizensâ Energy Forum (CEF), a platform designed to implement and enforce consumer rights in the energy market, bringing together national consumer organizations, industry, national regulators and government authorities. Initially working on issues such as smart metres, user-friendly billing and switching suppliers, the CEF established a new working group in 2011, commencing activities in early 2012, to examine the policy framework for the protection of vulnerable consumers. This Vulnerable Consumers Working Group (VCWG), established by DG Energy in close collaboration with SANCO, has had a number of aims and objectives, including to review factors that impact consumersâ energy poverty, to assess the drivers of vulnerability, to develop key characteristics of vulnerable consumers and what differentiates them, to consider energy policy and non-energy instruments that can address vulnerability. The VCWGâs activities have included collecting and assessing illustrative existing practices, reviewing data and generating recommendations for action. For the most part, Member States have supported this emphasis upon voluntary collaboration. The Council has endorsed the use of benchmarking and exchange of best practice as appropriate mechanisms for coordination, commonly calling on the Commission to presents âreviewsâ or âreportsâ rather than legislative solutions. Crucially, Member States agreed in 2015 to the systematic monitoring of key indicators for an âaffordable, safe, competitive, secure and sustainable energy systemâ (European Council, 2015). This presents a potential foundation for ongoing monitoring of the core factors affecting energy poverty from within the energy sector, to complement current data sources related to income, social housing provision and âat risk of poverty or social exclusionâ status."
10,263,0.982,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"With an integrated central vision for Flanders, drought management could be integrated in different environmental and related policies and could lead to a multi-objective planning of VMM but also a guidance for collaboration between Flemish Ministry of the Environment and Nature and other relevant ministries such as the Flemish agricultural ministry. Furthermore, mainstreaming into private actorsâ activities is missing in Flanders. Based on risk communication to private actors, the aim could be for a voluntary agreement or code of best practices for drought adaptation within and between sectors. The willingness of some actors seems to be possible. A requirement of drought contingency planning could initiate a process in the water-relevant economic sectors. Companies of these sectors could be required to prepare contingency plans for their operations during drought periods, thus increasing preparedness and reducing economic damage during drought periods."

First, in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, where a rule of law exists on paper but not in practice, citizens protect their position through wasta, or connections. Where there is no proper civil citizenship provided by the government, people use social citizenship to protect their positions. Second, while Bosniak argues that it is those who are excluded from the community (migrants) and those who are excluded from the public community (women and children) who suffer from diminished civil citizenship, it is also migrants, women and children who, in general, have fewer connections and less social citizenship. Finally, according to interviewees, social control was largely enough to enforce norms in the past. However, now that people in the Arabian peninsula have moved from villages to cities, government organizations have become necessary for the enforcement of norms. In other words, the effectiveness of social citizenship has diminished due to industrialization, which has made civil citizenship necessary. However, the two governments have not properly developed the rule of law, and by extension civil citizenship, and this leads to destructive effects for those with the least social citizenship. Therefore, because migrants and women have less social citizenship, as they have less access to the community and less access to the public community respectively, they are most in need of a protective government: they are the ones in need of civil citizenship and of the rule of law. Inversely, as migrants and women suffer from diminished civil citizenship, they are the ones most in need of social citizenship. In the two countries researched, a large number of domestic workers have taken on the largest share of household tasks. In this light, the concept of khulwa, or seclusion of women to the private sphere of the house, makes no sense. However, in a country without the rule of law, which is particularly the case in Saudi Arabia, where women lack civil citizenship, social citizenship could compensate for that seclusion by offering other means of protection. Therefore, in those instances where Saudi or Emirati women have little to do at home, it is the connection between the concepts of civil citizenship and social citizenship that actually explains the strong adherence of men to the concept of khulwa, of seclusion of women to the private sphere of the house, for it will prevent womenâ domestic workers and wives and daughters alikeâ from developing any protection against the men in the house."
341,239,0.982,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"In this chapter, we discussed how international human rights instruments in general and the CESCR General Comment No. 15 on the human right to water in particular provide a robust normative system that is well able to address end goals of human well-being across the key mandates of the water sector, namely, infrastructure development and water resource allocation. Moreover, the recognition of the indivisibility and interdependency of human rights applies exceptionally well to water resources. Water is key to many dimensions of human well-being and ill-being. Secure access to water is especially important for the agrarian livelihoods of the rural and peri-urban poor. While the recognition of a justiciable and enforceable right to water for drinking, personal and other domestic uses and sanitation has been an important milestone in closing the disconnection between the state as duty bearer for human rights and the state as investor in water infrastructure and regulator, we argued that this has only been a very partial interpretation of the underpinning General Comment No. 15 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The same Comment also indicates priorities in other freshwater governance domains to realise the substantive rights to livelihoods, food, health and an adequate standard of living. This has concrete implications for the stateâs infrastructure-based water services. Poor peopleâs productive water needs should be fully recognised and met in a nondiscriminatory manner. The definition of a core minimum should not be assumed to be for domestic uses only, but should include water for small-scale productive uses at and around homesteads as well. This priority for multiple basic uses is already widespread practice, but often still seen as âillegalâ by sectoral professionals who design single-use infrastructure. An inclusive people-driven planning process for infrastructure services will spontaneously identify such multiple priorities. A concrete implication of a rights-based approach to the stateâs authority and responsibility in water allocation is that water should be available for such basic uses to meet the right to food, health and an adequate standard of living. Priorities in allocation should safeguard such minimum volumes. This should not only be defined in policies and regulations, but also operationalised in the legal instruments to allocate water. Licence systems in particular should be redesigned to prioritise"
282,57,0.982,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"to account is not widely supported. More importantly, though, the distinction itself cannot be justified when stakeholder theory is taken to be noninstrumental and normative. If stakeholder theory demands accountability mechanisms out of respect for the rights of others, why should powerless actors be less worthy of protection than powerful ones?17 The alternative is to distinguish stakeholder groups on the basis of the degree of influence an organisation wields over them. This version is much less problematic on a normative level. At the same time, however, it can only justify convincingly that the level of stakeholder involvement should vary with the degree of being influenced. Why, though, should customers, for example, mainly exercise their right to accountability through consumer choice and access to information, communities through their right to set binding rules and regulations and employees through direct representation in decision-making organs? Stakeholder theory, then, convincingly argues why individuals â including managers â have moral responsibilities towards the people they influence. But it is contested whether they have a duty to actively promote the interests of all those they influence and whether their responsibilities should translate into accountability mechanisms.18 In addition, even differentiated versions of stakeholder theory cannot account for why different stakeholder groups should get access to different kinds of accountability mechanisms. 3.1.3 Power and the democratic deficit In the political realm, demands for accountability are also often based upon power or influence. Usually, though, the argument does not refer to stakeholder theory but is linked to the concept of democracy. Take, for example, the claims articulated by Woods and Narlikar. They demand more accountability for the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank on the following grounds: [D]ecisions and policies taken at the international level are increasingly affecting groups and people within states. Where previously these people could hold their national governments to account for policies, they must now look to international institutions where the decisions are being made. The question therefore arises: to whom are these institutions accountable and are they accountable to those whom they directly affect? (Woods and Narlikar, 2001, p. 569) The argument thus is that influence has shifted from national governments to international institutions and that this creates a legitimate demand for more accountability. In the wider academic debate, two schools of thought have developed this argument in greater detail: democratic theorists and researchers concerned with global governance."
10,304,0.982,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"process and thereafter drought resilience was ï¬rmly positioned on the agenda. Until then âwater shortageâ was to a large extent seen in relation to the huge need for freshwater in the polder areas in the west of the Netherlands, which regularly need to be flushed to prevent intrusion of salinity. The manifesto a/o. stated that 45 % of Dutch agricultural value is in fact produced on the higher grounds. In response to an invited advice from the national Advisory Committee on Water on freshwater supply, by 2013 the responsible Minister of Infrastructure and Environment emphasized that the system that supplies and distributes the water from source to user extends from the estuaries of big rivers all the way back to the capillaries of the regional water system. The steering of the fresh water supply should take place at all levels and scales: from the cross-boundary international river catchments up and to the local scale of individual users of stakeholder organizations. The main question is not at which level steering needs to take place, but which responsibilities are at which level and whether between those levels there is good collaboration. In the Netherlands the implementation of drought policy is thus seen as a matter of needed cooperation between various organizations, both public and private, at various levels. This is in fact not just the case with drought policies but with other water policies as well. Perhaps it is typically Dutch to interpret the necessary coherence as a matter of cooperation rather than coordination by a powerful central actor (compare OECD 2014). However, the complexity and dynamics of the water system itself make a governance context that facilitates good cooperation by all stakeholders with their various interests very valuable. Also there is a need for productive boundary spanning between an inspiring long-term vision and short-term opportunities to realize parts of it. While the Netherlands has been recalibrating its water policies in an enormous multi-stakeholder exercise called the Dutch Delta Programme, âfresh water supplyâ has become one of the main issues (sub-programmes). Droughts and water scarcity issues are not the same problem but they are actually highly related, while the water scarcity issues typically become most urgent in periods of drought. In the partial Delta programming on âFresh water supplyâ, the present and future policies are developed and implementation guided. In the Delta Decision 2015 some attention is given to the problematic of the âHigh Sandy Groundsâ, the areas in the east and south of the Netherlands that are often not able to receive water from the main water system, and thus depend on rainfall and rain fed small rivers and creeks for fresh water supply. Drinking water companies, food industries, other industries and farmers use often deep and shallow groundwater for their production processes. It is recognized that these areas (including Twente) suffer from droughts for dozens of years and that climate change can worsen these problems further, causing dry creeks and damages to human uses and nature. The preferred strategy to combat these developments consists of the following guidelines: 1. Keep the water longer in both the ground and the surface waters. No efforts will be made to enable major water transport to these areas. In the short run, the"

Secondly, asking questions that prompted communities to think about what it means to be more resilient, is not only a way to ascertain how the project has helped improve understanding, but is also key to enabling this resilience. And thirdly, by asking communities âwhat else is needed?â beyond project activities to date helps to inform the details of subsequent activities, and also helps to inform how and what changes to look out for as measures of community-defined success. This example also illustrates that there are practical limits to the âidealâ evaluation process but that it is possible to usefully draw on key principles to inform the approach to evaluating a CCA practice. There were practical limits to full application of a right-based approach, and the extent to which children themselves are included in the development of the approach and the analysis and articulation of learnings. There were also limits to what âcan be known or found outâ through an evaluation about causal relationships between activities and outcomes, when there are a myriad of interacting factors at play. It was nevertheless particularly useful to use the projectâs general theory of change to guide the evaluation, but allowing flexibility for the specific links and relationships â such as how knowledge, combined with formal and informal communication activities would assist communities to advocate for change and influence practice and policy â would emerge. In practice, we developed strong team and organisational partnerships between the NGOs and research organisations involved in the evaluation and the project, which proved particularly valuable given the type of project and the project context. Whilst not âdevelopmental evaluationâ to its full extent â researchers were not embedded in the team on a continuous basis â the approach was far from the âconventionalâ end of the research spectrum where external groups of academic researchers seek out an existing applied project in order to test or calibrate a model or theory. The process involved joint learning and reflection from both implementing and research organisations throughout the project. The project was adjusted in real time to integrate lessons learned from the evaluative research; concurrently, the evaluative approach itself evolved to reflect lessons from the projectâs activities on the ground. Embedding research within practice â in the inherently uncertain context of supporting a community to adapt to climate change â provided new pathways for realising and sharing learnings from the ground, to achieve better adaptation outcomes.

As a delegated authority it cooperates with the different ministries responsible. In the case of integration of immigrants it cooperates with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and in the case of refugees it cooperates with the Ministry of Interior. The institutional setting is recognised as quite complicated (for a deeper analysis see: LesinÌska et al. 2010) and what is most striking is that the responsibilities are dispersed. The Ministry of Interior strongly emphasises that although it coordinates migration policy, the integration issue is beyond its competence. For the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the integration of immigrants is low on the agenda. The Department of Labour in the same ministry also emphasises that its competence is restricted to labour regulations. The issue of integration of immigrants can therefore be characterised as a âhot potatoâ â units of central government try not to have it included among their tasks."
169,492,0.982,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"The primary substantive rules are the governing rules of âequitable and reasonable utilizationâ of water resources and the âobligation to take all measures necessary not to cause signiï¬cant harmâ to other basin states or to their environment. Principle of Equitable and Reasonable Utilization This principle entitles each basin state to a reasonable and equitable share of water resources for the beneï¬cial uses within its own territory. It rests on the principle of shared sovereignty and equality of rights. âEquitableâ utilization does not necessarily mean an equal portion of the resource or equal share of uses and beneï¬ts. The UNECE Water Convention includes this principle in Article 2.2c; the UN Water Convention stipulates the equitable and reasonable utilization of an international watercourse in Articles 5 and 6. Compared to the UNECE Water Convention, the UN Water Convention provides more guidance on the factors for assessing the equitable and reasonable utilization of an international watercourse (Tanzi 2015). Obligation Not to Cause Signiï¬cant Harm No state in an international drainage basin is allowed to use the watercourses in their territory in a way that would cause signiï¬cant harm to other basin states or to their environment, including harm to human health or safety, to the use of the waters for beneï¬cial purposes, or to the living organisms of the watercourse systems. This principle is speciï¬ed in Articles 2 and 3 of the UNECE Water Convention, and included in many Articles of the UN Water Convention, but is particularly addressed in Article 7. More precise and coordinated guidelines and advanced standards of conduct on the prevention of transboundary impact are included in the UNECE Water Convention (Tanzi 2015). To properly realize the substantive rule of equitable and reasonable utilization and the obligation not to cause signiï¬cant harm, certain procedural rules are necessary, including the prior notiï¬cation of planned measures, consultation and negotiation, and the principles of cooperation and exchange of information. Principles of Notiï¬cation, Consultation, and Negotiation Every riparian state along an international watercourse is entitled to prior notice, consultation, and negotiation in cases where the proposed use by another riparian of a shared watercourse may cause serious harm to its rights or interest. The UNECE Water Convention regulates the obligation for consultation among riparian countries in Article 10; the UN Water Convention includes provisions as regards notiï¬cation concerning planned measures, consultation, and negotiation predominantly in Articles 11 to 19. Principles of Cooperation and Information Exchange It is a responsibility for each riparian state along an international watercourse to cooperate and exchange data and information regarding the state of the watercourse as well as present and future planned uses along the watercourse. The need for information exchange is speciï¬cally addressed in Articles 6 and 13 and the principle of cooperation in Article 9 of the UNECE Water Convention; the general obligation to cooperate and the regular exchange of data and information are speciï¬cally enshrined in Articles 8 and 9 of the UN Water Convention."
99,94,0.982,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"The housing field also reflects the cityâs dominant discourse structure: Housing policy is mainly seen as an instrument for growth. The investment frame is again the dominant frame whereas social aspects play a minor role. Because of MÃ¼nsterâs political culture, important decision-makers have always been vigilant about prohibiting developments that might seriously endanger the social balance in the city. This argument leads to a request for a more âsustainableâ growth (prevention of market failure) and a call for caution about endangering the cityâs attractiveness through social cleavages. Since it is agreed upon that disrupting the cityâs social balance should be avoided, the need to improve the situation in already neglected neighbourhoods with reactive measures is relatively undisputed in the political arena and the general public. In this context, several experts refer to âhealthy mixesâ, understood as a mixture of different social groups inhabiting an area. They assume that if there is no such mix, people will be less likely to identify with their neighbourhood and owners will not invest in the housing stock as it may not pay off. âSustainable neighbourhood developmentâ, a preventative âspatialâ social policy, does not seem to be heavily disputed within the city context. A general need for sustainable neighbourhood development, a âhealthy mixâ of inhabitants and the need for affordable living spaces seem to be widely acknowledged by all actors involved, although the means to reach these goals are not agreed on since they are based on different problem analyses. In consequence, the question of how the lack of affordable housing shall or could be countervailed is clearly the main line of public political dispute in the field. With regard to local political actors, the controversies run along traditional party lines, between investment and social perspectives. The administrationâs role is criticized since it sides with market proponents, emphasizing that public housing cannot create enough affordable accommodation (VÃ¶lker 2011).13 Local authorities think it is more âuseful to support lower income tenants with accommodation allowances.â14 The strength of the market thus remains the dominant line of argu-"
243,426,0.982,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"Health Department of the municipality of Bologna was in charge of the e-booking project even though it did not have the professional competences and the organizational capabilities to manage booking centres. The departmentâs institutional mission was healthcare policy implementation on the one hand, and policy monitoring and supervision on the other. A similar lack of competences and organizational capabilities also characterized USLs. Nevertheless, USLs were used to managing paper-based booking systems and so were the natural candidates for running booking centres. Nevertheless, a different decision was made. USLs, as public bodies, were subject to restrictions in workforce management typical of the public sector of that time. The relocation of personnel from one booking office to another, or the extensive use of part-time staff to deal with peak times and long office hours (7.30â 18.30), were not possible in the public sector, only in the private sector. Staff training was also necessary. The public sector was heavily unionized and lengthy negotiations would be required to reach an agreement on training and changes to tasks. There were time constraints for the project and this option was not considered feasible. Finally, the three USLs were largely independent units and the service would involve personnel coming from three distinct organizations, creating coordination problems. At this point, the decision to establish a new company was made. Bologna could be considered the capital of the cooperative movement and a large number of cooperatives were present in sectors like catering, mass distribution, logistics, building and construction. According to the International Alliance of Cooperatives, âa co-operative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity (ICA 1995, p. 3â4).â The new company was part of a group of cooperatives in the software sector provided with technological and organizational capabilities developed in the cooperative environment, which shared the political orientation of the municipality of Bologna at that time. Turning to the cooperative movement meant establishing a link with a large business entity in the local context and promoting specific values in order to compete, in some sense, with traditional public bureaucratic organizations such as hospitals and health centres. Against this background, SYNWARE was formed. Its activities were supported by weekly training sessions involving top management, five coordinators and on occasion the entire staff. The training content supported, among other things, the adoption of new software, the introduction of new laboratory examinations and the management of critical issues encountered in everyday practice. The weekly sessions were the context in which organizational solutions were conceived. From the detailed analysis of practices and the direct engagement of operators, it was possible to figure out how to improve service provision. The continuous solicitation of operators created an environment favourable to open debate of continuously emerging issues. This was considered the only way to deal with the innovative nature of the service and the lack of experience of those"

However, many challenges to realizing the goal of full inclusion remain reflecting, in many cases, gaps in implementation of the law, due also to economic constraints. Even in more advanced inclusive system, most laws have yet to be fully implemented. While it is considered perhaps the most inclusive education system in the world,62 Italy serves as an important reminder about the many challenges of translating the language and values of law into practice. Article 24 of the CRPD calls for an inclusive education system which should be flexible to meet the special needs of people with disabilities. Adjustments are especially needed to address ASD pupilsâ needs, for whom education cannot rely on centrally-determined curricula and teaching methodologies and, therefore, an individually tailored educational plan based on a set of individualized objectives should be provided. Qualified by the OHCHR has a good example of support measures consistent with Article 24 (2) (d) of the CRPD, the Individual Educational Plans (IEPs) take into account the needs of the individual child and his/her family, and require to adapt the childâs schedule and educational environment, both in and out of the classroom. In order to meet the needs of pupils with ASD, such plans should be intended as a global plan including didactic, rehabilitative, social and welfare aspects, like the PEI in Italy and the EHC plans in England. There will be some pupils with ASD whose autism is so severe that they will need a specialist support, but it does not need to be in a segregated setting. The best model is where the child with autism belongs to his peer group teacher but has the support of staff with expertise and a âhavenâ in which to recover when needed.63 There is still a role for specialist schools, but to be consistent with Article 24 of the CRPD they must have a better reason for their existence than that they pick up those who âfailâ in mainstream schooling. As it is occurring in Europe, specialist schools should be centres of excellence, pioneering new ways of working with ASD and dealing with the most extreme cases. They should be centres of research as well as teaching and have a role in working alongside mainstream schools to bring about more effective inclusion. However, special schools must be seen more as supports for an inclusive system rather than an alternative to it."
61,54,0.982,Mergers and Alliances in Higher Education : international Practice and Emerging Opportunities,"Shortly afterward, an initiative, accompanied by financial incentives, to boost regional partnerships was launched: this was the PoÌles de recherche et dâenseignement supeÌrieur (PRES), which joined a set of similar regional initiatives such as the ReÌseaux theÌmatiques de recherche avanceÌe (RTRA) and the Centres theÌ matiques de recherche et de soins (CTRS). These initiatives were part of a general effort to decentralise and devolve power to regional and local actors (Laperche and Uzunidis 2011) â a process that had started already in the 1980s with the âUniversiteÌ 2000â plan. As in other parts of the world, Silicon Valley was the model that central and regional actors wanted to emulate. This was a far cry from the traditional French approach to industrial development that had been centrally driven, with the state defining the overall approach (say, the development of nuclear power) and deciding the local applications (in this case, the location of the nuclear plants). Such centralised planning was guided by the notion that, to the extent that it is possible, there would be a harmonious development across the country. The code words for this equalising treatment are lâameÌnagement du territoire (or regional development). The new funding instruments were conceived in a selective and competitive way. Thus, the PRES funding was supposed to be concentrated on ten sites but, by 2012, there were 26 PRES. According to Aust and Crespy (2009), the university presidents who were most successful at promoting a PRES had a similar professional profile: for the most part, they were scientists who led scientific universities and whose professional trajectory included an advisory or expert role to the ministry in Paris, their regional authorities and the European institutions. In the process of driving their change agenda, these promoters adopted a top-down approach and excluded from the initial discussions important sections of the university community and the decisionmaking bodies, including the staff and student unions and the faculty deans (Aust and Crespy 2009). This would come back to haunt them a few years later. The main objectives of the PRES have been to increase critical mass and improve international visibility. Thus, typical activities include the coordination of doctoral education (via common doctoral schools), shared policies for the acquisition, use and maintenance of scientific equipment and facilities; common internationalisation strategy (promotion, exchanges, agreements, etc.); joint initiatives for knowledge transfer and joint signatures on scientific publications."

In sum, six mainstreaming strategies operate at the three levels (local, institutional and interinstitutional).7 They are illustrated in Fig. 15.1 and Boxes 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4. The first two (Strategies IâII) focus on the local or household level and relate to the way the four risk-reducing approaches (outlined above) are included in on-theground initiatives (either integrated or added on). Three strategies focus on the institutional level and address issues of internal organization (Strategy III) and cooperation (Strategy IV), together with policies and regulations (Strategy V). For example, it is crucial to ensure that organizational procedures and routines foster, rather than hamper (cf. Uittenbroek 2016), the implementation of nature-based solutions. The sixth strategy (Strategy VI) focuses on the interinstitutional level, external cooperation with other organizations (local, regional, national and international) and citizens. It addresses sector work, professional training and society in general. At the institutional and interinstitutional level, mainstreaming involves both targeted and implicit integration. At the institutional level, municipalitiesâ mainstreaming strategies can include the development of standalone adaptation strategies, the creation of interdepartmental working groups for climate change adaptation, and the integration of adaptation objectives into sectoral policies and instruments (e.g. green structure plans), comprehensive or detailed planning (cf. Wamsler 2015a; cf., Boxes 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4). Strategies addressing the interinstitutional level can include municipal participation in regional innovation platforms that aim to create new business and cooperation models for financing nature-based solutions for climate adaptation, or the creation of city-citizen collaboration (cf. Wamsler 2015a). Unlike other mainstreaming frameworks that address targeted and implicit integration separately (cf. Uittenbroek 2016), the framework that is presented here includes both since related actions and processes are fluent and mutually supportive. Politics and power must be explicitly addressed at all three mainstreaming levels, as they are a potential root cause of risk and represent avenues (or barriers) to transformation (cf., Boxes 15.1 and 15.4). The analysis of power (relations) is thus a precondition to sustainable change and to understand how transformation can be achieved or be hindered (Daly 2005; Digeser 1992; Partzsch 2015). This should include an evaluation of shared power (power with, cooperation and learning), the exercise of power (power to, resistance and empowerment) and power over others (coercion and manipulation) in potential mainstreaming approaches and strategies (cf. Allen 1998; Verloo 2005). Issues related to power need to be fundamentally challenged whenever and wherever modernity and globalization lead societies down an unsustainable road (Manuel-Navarrete 2010)."

99,241,0.982,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In this chapter, we have described the transition of the ongoing welfare policies governance system in Milan over recent decades. Milan as a case study yields understanding of the barriers that local governments, especially in the countries most affected by the recession, face in promoting a system of governance oriented to social innovation, and in which social policies (even if weak) are supposed to play an important role in promoting local development. After many years of profound changes, Milan has currently reached deadlock in terms of policy innovation. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the city was highly dynamic in terms of welfare provision, given that the municipal government was a central actor in designing and providing social services as tools for economic and social development. From the 1990s to 2011, the municipal government instead played a weak role as director of a system of governance in which welfare was residual and was based on the involvement of non-profit and private organizations, but only as providers. During those two decades, the right-wing coalition governing Milan adopted a basically market-oriented style of governance (Molotch and Vicari 2009). The period was dominated by the rhetoric that creation of a âgood business climateâ was an effective way to foster growth and innovation but also to eradicate poverty and to deliver, in the long run, higher standards of living to the mass of the population (Harvey 1989). However, those years were marked by a huge increase in the social inequalities characterizing the social structure of the city (DâOvidio 2009). In 2011, municipal elections rewarded a new coalition proposing a style of governance more oriented to a âsocial innovation approachâ. However, the difficult financial situation inherited by the municipality from the past, and austerity measures imposed by the national government, have reduced the ambitions of the current municipal government in regard to social policies. In this chapter, we have highlighted that values expressed in the welfare plan have not yet been translated into effective actions. According to this document, for example, welfare measures are important investments for local development âthat the rhetoric of the economic crisis is not supposed to limitâ (Municipality of Milan 2012, p. 5). However, the efforts to respect the Stability Pact have greatly restricted welfare investments. Moreover, the municipal government has been pressurizing the national government to redesign the Stability Pact so that it was able to afford the public costs of the forthcoming International Expo 2015, while pressures to support welfare services have been weaker. Indeed, also the new municipal government regards this event as the main chance for the cityâs future economic and social development. Within the dimensions proposed by Cattacin and Zimmer in Chap. 2 of this volume, we can argue that Milan has been following a pattern of local development based on a concurrence of public investment in economic or social initiatives, while the rhetoric and values of the electoral campaign and the coalition programme have been more oriented to governance of social innovation."

As a result, the principle of sovereign equality, mutual beneï¬t and peaceful coexistence can be read together and, accordingly, must govern the relationship so that cooperation and process in this important ï¬eld can be achieved over the course of time and in space. Respect for those fundamental principles can facilitate on the long-term the restoration of trust in the conflictual relationship between developed and developing countries. Indeed, one the basis of mutual beneï¬t, China has repeatedly argued that such is a prerequisite in its economic and political relationship with its economic and strategic partners. On its turn, this can bring the right to development again to the foreground since it will focus on its policy application rather than human rights connotation in order to establish economic relationships in the ï¬rst place. Yet, an opening towards a rule-based governance approach remains possible and desirable once the content of the right to development has been properly deï¬ned on the basis of sovereign equality too. In this respect, the meaning of the right to development, from the Chinese perspective, is derived from the relationship between the respective international/regional actors that can give content to its ruleâboth in its collective and individual dimensions. Since that meaning still differsâdepending on developed and developing countries, a principle-based approach may transcend such fundamental differences and give sufï¬cient room for trust to gain ground once developing countries are ready to advance individual human rights entitlements in the socio-economic realm.14 This approach of relational governance has been clearly manifested in Chinaâs 2003 position on establishing a New International Political and Economic Order. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should constitute the basis for cooperative relationships between developed and developing nations. Differences between the national conditions should not be an obstacle to establishing inter-state relationship nor constitute a reason for intervention in the domestic affairs of states. Instead, countries âshould cooperate with one another on the basis of equality and mutual beneï¬t to realize common development. The old irrational international economic order should be reformed to serve the rights and interests of the countries of the world, especially the numerous developing countriesâ.15 Paradoxically enough, irrational and nationalist claims for protectionism across Western nations have similarly been denounced by the Chinese leadership, in particular recently by President Xi Jinping, since it would deny that a relationship could no longer be fostered whenever there is collision or a divergent opinion on socio-economic policies amongst the diverse members of the international community.16"
299,233,0.982,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Sociologists used to hold that modern society arose as people shifted from being members of small communities (i.e. villages), in which people knew each other personally and had a strong sense of mutual obligationsâto a society that encompasses millions, a so-called mass society (i.e. cities), in which all act like free standing individuals, each pursuing their self-interest. They refer to this thesis as a shift from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft (TÃ¶nnies 1955). Initially this shift was considered as enhancing human values as villages were considered oppressive and cities as liberating. However, communitarians pointed out that when people cut off their social moorings, they felt isolated and bereft, and acted out in anti-social ways. In response, communitarians called for a restoration of communal bonds, albeit much less encompassing and overpowering than the traditional ones. To the extent that this renewal of bonds has been achieved, most often not as a result of some kind of sociological analysis, but out of people yearning for social bonds, people have been content. The most telling example in American society of the role of social bonds in supporting a sense of obligation to the less endowed members is that of ethnic groups. Typically, immigrants to the US are absorbed by communities with people of their own kind, in neighborhoods (such as Chinatown, South Boston, Spanish Harlem, Little Havana) and associations (such as Jewish charities, Catholic charities, and many others). Members of these groups shared resources with the new immigrants, provided welfare, housing, work, and otherwise shared some of their goods. (These immigrants gradually acquired other affiliations and memberships, which protected them from being dominated by any one group.) The same holds for many other kinds of communities, including those based on faith, gender, missions, among others. It follows that the more people in the post-affluent society become more communitarian (in the sense of forging new communities or strengthening or renewing their bonds to one community or another), the more reallocation of wealth can be expected."
224,392,0.982,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"14.2 The âGenderGAPâ ProjectâAn Austrian Case Study The on-going structural change in Austrian agriculture, with its implications for ecology (e.g., land use, material and substance flows) and society (e.g., regional development, food and crops, cultural landscapes), is one of the well analysed and documented long-term socioecological changes in Austria (Krausmann 2008; Rammer 1999). In âGenderGAPâ, we asked how the industrialisation and restructuring process that has been occurring in rural regions since the Second World War, and especially under the conditions of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform in 2003, can be analysed from a socioecological perspective (Fischer-Kowalski and Erb 2006; Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007). What can we learn about the possible pathways to sustainable development if we study the interaction between social and ecological aspects of agricultural production? How can we create knowledge that can support social systems on their way to more sustainable solutions? We use the term âsustainable agricultureâ, meaning a spectrum from an ecologically friendly type of agriculture, which is characterised by farms using less fertiliser and other artificial inputs than allowed by the EU subsidy scheme, to certified organic production without any non-organic inputs. Within this spectrum, we do not further differentiate the degree to which production is ecologically friendly. We choose building a model as a way to use scientific knowledge and the knowledge of agricultural experts and farmers to develop future scenarios and regional strategies for sustainable agricultural development. As Austrian agricultural development is highly influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy of EU, in 2005, we began the project âGenderGAPâ with the following questions: â¢ What are the ecological, economic and social implications of the EUâs CAP reform of 2003? â¢ Are women and men on farms affected differently by the CAP reform? â¢ How can scientists, farmers and stakeholders create and use an agent-based model to work on future scenarios and strategies for a sustainable development of Austriaâs agriculture? The CAP reform adopted in June 2003 by EU agriculture ministers led to a profound transformation of the support mechanisms for the common agricultural sector. In particular, Brussels decoupling of the subsidies (which were previously bound to area use or livestock numbers) from the production volume had the intention to support a long-term perspective for sustainable agriculture. Austrian agriculture produces much of Austriaâs food and feed despite its Alpine environment. As a main player in the task of shaping the cultural landscape, agriculture is one of the touristic and ecological assets in these mountain regions (70 % of national area). Approximately 45 % of the national area is used as agricultural area and is worked on by only 5 % of the total people employed. Off the fertile lowlands, agriculture is characterised by small-scale family farms that produce dairy products"

In an international comparison, Charismatic Christianity and urbanization are hardly odd bedfellows. In Sweden, however, this form of Christianity has been far from an exclusively urban phenomenon. The Pentecostal Movement, for instance, has had a strong standing in smaller cities and rural regions as well as in the larger cities (see Alvarsson 2007, 341â344). On the national level, Charismatic urbanization obviously has the effect of draining small- and medium-sized cities of young Charismatics, which in turn concerns rural Charismatics (Dagen 2014). It is also worth noting the attitudes to organization among todayâs practitioners, particularly urbanized young Charismatics and immigrants. These groups are highly mobile, tend to disregard denominational boundaries and labels, and have a consumer-oriented approach to religiosity and affiliation; they visit, join, or drop out of churches depending on the churchesâ ability to cater to their preferences and needs for the moment (Moberg 2013a, 187â188, 199â212)."

Where remittances and investments are involved, the link is fairly clear (albeit dependent on how these financial flows are utilized), but given that some authors (Levitt and Glick Schiller 2004; Vertovec 1999) view transnationalism as both âways of beingâ and âways of belongingâ, the developmental aspect is less obvious. The fact remains that further research is sorely needed on the relationship between integration (and its multifaceted elements) and engagement in homecountry development. Shifting understandings of what integration actually is, and what policies should be applied along the spectrum from multiculturalism to assimilation, serve only to complicate the M&D relationship. Critics of multiculturalism argue that it has proven detrimental to economic integration, leading instead to cultural and religious separatism, which threatens national identity. The widespread view that multiculturalism has somehow âfailedâ leads many countries to adopt more assimilationist-oriented policies towards immigrants. What implications this has for the developmental potential of migration is not clear. There is the argument, advanced by Castles et al. (2014, 80): [I]mmigrant-receiving governments can increase the developmental potential of migration by lowering the thresholds for immigrationâ¦ and through favouring the socioeconomic integration of migrants by countering discrimination and racism on the labour market and giving them access to housing and education as well as residency and (dual) citizenship rights."

It has been running since 2006 and includes systematic monitoring, taking into account specific needs of parents with small children and people with disabilities. Public places such as railway and metro stations, public offices, and transportation hubs are regularly evaluated. The results of the project include the publication of Warsaw Friendly for Parentsâa handbook directed to local authorities and formulating standards, which should be met by parents- and children-friendly architecture and infrastructure. Other examples of similar awareness-raising projects are âHorror storiesââa campaign about mothersâ rights as employees; âBoys donât payââa campaign emphasizing problems with fathers, who avoid paying alimony; a campaign focused on problems of pregnant women and lone mothers in urban space (including photo contests âMum speaks now!â or âBellybuttonâhub of the universeâ). Also, MaMa Foundation voices concerns about the rights of women who do not work professionally but are stay-at-home mothers and wives. In recent years, two projects regarding this issue were implemented: âList of domestic tasksâ and âWarsaw Housewivesâ Clubâ. As for the first project, in cooperation with a group of experts, the organization has formulated recommendations for the Polish Parliament emphasizing the economic value of work performed by women at home: âWe show and calculate it precisely that housework performed by women (â¦) is quantifiable and it is possible to calculate its precise value in money. (â¦) It is not all about paying women for doing housework, but about actually seeing this work, being able to notice itâ (MaMa Foundation representative). The project âWarsaw Housewivesâ Clubâ included workshops aimed at increasing awareness of women in terms of partnership-based division of tasks at home and providing the participants with specific tools that could help them in negotiations with their husbands or partners. The workshops, trainings and legal advice offered by MaMa Foundation address women getting back to work after maternal leave, mothers, who organize initiatives supporting other mothers, as well as female refugees and victims of domestic violence. Apart from that, since 2007, the Foundation inspired the establishment of local momsâ clubs in different Warsaw districts. They all provide free workshops for mothers, local leaders and representatives of local authorities and create friendly space for meetings and exchanging experiences. One such local momsâ club is located in one of the most deprived areas in WarsawâTargÃ³wek district. When the club was closed due to the end of the project, the group of its former participants decided to set up their own independent organization called Momâs Power Foundation, which, to some extent, continues the activities of the club by offering free services for parents from the district. This case shows how MaMa Foundation triggers other local initiatives and inspires similar projects all over Warsaw. Another example of MaMaâs initiatives was the âMomsâ Cooperativeâ innovative training project, which was aimed at creating a new, independent social cooperative, giving employment to unemployed mothers. Its main goal was to support women who are threatened with social exclusion, in terms of their education, integration into the society and their future chances on the labour market.

However, the Dutch Small to Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) sector in particular, where the majority of the graduates of universities of applied sciences ï¬nd employment, is insufï¬ciently prepared for the worldwide knowledge economy. SME companies experience intercultural and language barriers when they operate abroad. International investments by Dutch SME-companies remain behind the EU-average, revealing numerous lost opportunities. Moreover, a study by the research group âInternationalisation and the International Professional Fieldâ at the Hanzehogeschool Groningen mentions the lack of intercultural competencies of Dutch SMEsâ staff, their insufï¬cient knowledge of foreign countries and markets, and inadequate linguistic skills as important impediments for this sector (HanzeConnect 2008). In contrast, in terms of student diversity, second-tier Dutch institutions are quite diversely integrated. In 2010, 14 % of their student population hailed from other cultures; notably however, in the cities of Western Holland, at institutions like the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, this statistic is considerably higher. Indeed, in addition to the requirements from the professional ï¬eld, such student diversity also yields consequences for the management of intercultural and international competencies. Hence, this situation offers a challenge, but also an opportunity for internationalization. Ultimately, the main obstacles to internationalization at second-tier Dutch higher education institutions comprise a lack of a teaching staff that can prepare students for a more international and intercultural career, lack of opportunities to develop joint and double degrees, ambiguity regarding the identity of their peers abroad, lack of access to research funding, and lack of a clear vision on internationalization as a sector. In contrast, opportunities for the sector to enhance internationalization are diverse, including its rich experience with internships, its strong relationship with the professional ï¬eld, and its diverse student population that enables virtual exchange and mobility. In developing these opportunities, the sector can build on the experience of several of its institutions, which have managed to overcome the obstacles and the lack of support from the sector. However, in order to realize these opportunities, instead of following in the footsteps of the research universities and/or relying upon Education Ministry initiatives, as two recent documents (Coelen 2014; VSNU and Vereniging Hogescholen 2014) reveal to be the case at present, the sector must develop its own targeted internationalization strategy."

The Mauritius government signed agreements to attract investors from China through joint ventures with local companies resulting in export-led growth and quick knowledge transfer (UNDP 2015: 11).

The target group is claimed to be challenged, inspired, and educated, and motivated by the Coompanion Incubator to set up their own business, be it private or organized as a cooperative. Only young and unemployed people registered with and directed by the national employment office are eligible for support, however, and it is the officer at the national employment office who decides whether or not a young unemployed person should be offered the support. The incubator could also offer the service of acting as an employer and managing mundane administrational tasks, enabling the individual to focus on the business idea. The combination of two features could be argued to function as the innovation in this example: the greenhouse service and the focus on a particular target group, young and unemployed people. Finally, the employment and empowerment project, Yalla Trappan, is described as a labour-integrated social enterprise. The idea behind the project derives from an initiative financed by the European Social Fund that focused on womenâs entrepreneurship, integration, empowerment, education, and equality, and was later made permanent in the shape of Yalla Trappan. Today, the overall aim of the project is to provide work for women who otherwise would have had severe difficulties entering the labour market. In terms of activities, the project provides the local community with a conference centre, a coffee shop, a restaurant, a design and craftsmanship studio, and catering and cleaning services. The target group is offered employment and employment training in the various activities organized by the project in addition to Swedish tuition and education in health care. The project is organized as a cooperative enterprise. In terms of innovative features, the main contribution to the field of social innovations could most likely be linked to the focus on a particular, previously ignored, target group in combination with the project being organized as a cooperative enterprise. The three highlighted social innovations in MalmÃ¶ address social problems of political interest: stagnation, unemployment, and segregation. Common features across the three social innovations include training, entrepreneurship, empowering individuals, and collaboration among various actors and organizations. Portrayed in in this way, the three social innovations could be argued to represent new ideas and new ways of addressing social problems in the local context of MalmÃ¶ (Nordfeldt and Carrigan 2013). Using the framework developed by Evers et al. (2014), these innovations could also be seen as focusing on the strengthening of individuals by, for example, investing in capabilities rather than targeting deficits, and by bridging the gaps between professional services and peopleâs life worlds. At the same time, when approached from the perspective proposed in this chapter, it could be argued that these innovations have developed in clearings, rather than being the outcome of certain enterprising individuals or being embedded within and supported by the legal and administrative framework of the overall welfare regime of MalmÃ¶."

More and better participation, and a substantial improvement in training, are a priority for all governments. This aspect was particularly stressed at Rio+20. Environmental governance of the land, patrimonial accounts, environmental assessment of investment projects, evaluation of environmental impacts, strategic environmental assessments and so forth are emerging as important alternatives. According to ECLAC (2010:140), âTerritorial heterogeneity in Latin America calls for selective and targeted strategies. Local development, understood as a bottom-up process, mobilizes endogenous potential to build territories that are better able to create and drive their own capacities.â The objectives of the National Environmental Governance Project in each country must reverse the process of poverty generation and, in turn, give more momentum to tasks already under way to directly improve the situation. Habitat improvement and policies to combat environmental degradation are systematically integrated with the possibility for a better life. In addition, the use of unusual environmental policies in Latin American countries â such as tax policies, credit, tariff or integration â all signify that there is a long way to go. While these ideas are technologically plausible, and are also key for the sustainability of the planet, it is worth reiterating critical doubts that arise from both historical experience and theory. They question the ability of the current model of accumulation and the political regime of domination to advance socioeconomic and environmental sustainable development, without signiï¬cant changes. The historical scenario seems to prolong an insurmountable contradiction between the interests to produce, distribute and consume, and the need to ensure social and environmental human life. Therefore, a greater organization and activity of environmental social movements emerges as a possible alternative. An organizational form for sustainable development within environmental governance involves a holistic view, a direct relationship between research and action. It is a combination of the short, medium and long term, and of a generally high level of participation among civil society and social movements. It proposes implementing the necessary changes and taking actions that can lead to more successful forms of environmental governance and a better quality of life. Economic understanding must be open to all necessary actors, which requires reformulating the conditions for recovery and reproduction of capital with ecological, economic, social, technological and political implications. Only then do the desired reduction of poverty and reconciliation with nature truly begin."
144,576,0.982,25 Years of Transformations of Higher Education Systems in Post-Soviet Countries : Reform and Continuity,"Another thought-provoking phenomenon apparent in the most recent legislative changes is a tendency for policy makers to blame academic staff for poor implementation of the changes and a corresponding resentment of academic staff towards the government for not creating sufficient legal and system-wide provisions to enable the implementation processes. For instance, although universities are allowed in principle to hold their own bank accounts, the legal and procedural details of this change have not yet been implemented, making it impossible for universities to take advantage of this opportunity. These conversations appear to be happening at cross purposes and much gets lost in translation (e.g. Fedorchenko 2016; National Aviation University 2015). On the positive side, there is evidence of dialogue between the power and the people, which had previously been suppressed. In addition to the most obvious stakeholders in HE, government, academic staff and university administrators who find themselves in strenuous and difficult relationships with one another, the discourse of comparison and critique also pervades the minds of students, many of whom prefer to study abroad and often fail to return to Ukraine after completion of their studies. This creates a problem known as âbrain drainâ or âbrain wasteâ (Semiv and Hvozdovych 2012). At the time of writing, this exit appears to be the primary if not the only mechanism accessible to students to communicate their views on the state of the national HE system. Employers are equally dissatisfied. According to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report (2011), despite relatively comprehensive higher education coverage (8th place out of 142 countries), Ukraine takes the 51st place in terms of perceived quality. According to the survey, employers complain about the lack of important employability skills, including critical analysis, emotional, technical and even basic mathematical skills. Despite this documented dissatisfaction, the Federation of Employers in Ukraineâs involvement in higher education reforms remains minimal. In stark opposition are the views of rectors on the quality and state of higher education in the country. According to a survey conducted by the Ukrainian Democratic Initiatives Foundation, most rectors report high quality of education in their institutions and raise concerns around poor funding and disinterested students (Democratic Initiatives Foundation 2015). One may conclude that the views and opinions of various stakeholders on the state of quality of the HE system in Ukraine are akin to those of the fabled blind men touching an elephant, though most agree on the notion of crisis.

Indeed, the first boost of neoliberal thinking and specifically the privatization of social service production opened windows of opportunity for TSOs. In many European countries, particularly in the UK and in the still-developing welfare states of the Mediterranean and post-socialist countries in the South and East of Europe, TSOs became core partners of governments in social service production (Gidron et al. 1992; Salamon 1995). However, nowadays, in the midst of the second wave of privatization, governments are no longer opting in favor of TSOs; on the contrary, the private commercial provision of public services is increasingly challenging service provision through TSOs (Henriksen et al. 2012; Salamon 1993). This is not to say that the third sector is of rapidly decreasing importance in Europe. However, the distinctiveness of TSOs might be at risk. Also, the societal function of the sector might increasingly be jeopardized. Because of their organizational culture, governance and revenue sources, TSOs belong neither to the efficiency-driven market nor to the authority-driven state. To be part of this sector is to be different from the market and the state in terms of governance, resources, organizational culture as well as mission and vision. It also means to be based significantly on sentiments of solidarity. If TSOs are losing these very special qualities due to external pressures, Europe would be very different from today, without the broad and encompassing variety of TSOs and their contribution to democratic governance, improved service provision and the quality of everyday life of the European people. Whether and to what extent officials in Brussels are aware that an important cornerstone of Europeâs identity might be jeopardized if TSOs are hindered from getting the most out of their potentials is difficult to assess. The findings of our research indicate that there is rather limited awareness of the sectorâs capacity and its potentials."

In South Africa, an estimated 40 percent of available land parcels is still under customary land tenure. In many parts of the continent, land governance frameworks are weak and are often restricted by the complexity of land systems. Attempts to achieve greater efficiency and equity in land markets have resulted in the nationalization of land for public good in some countries, such as Ethiopia and Mozambique. However, very few governments that have chosen the path of nationalization have achieved equitable and transparent land distribution, particularly for the benefit of poor households and marginalized groups. Our fact-finding field visits revealed that even for those countries where land belongs to the state de jure as stipulated in the countryâs Constitution (e.g., CÃ´te dâIvoire), in practice, the existence of a customary land regime in parallel makes the law null and void. There is a de facto dual land regime which complicates the land governance system. Processes for obtaining formal land rights and individual titles remain onerous, expensive, and inefficient for the majority of households. Merging the systems of customary and formal land rights is a major challenge faced by most African governments today. In subsequent sections, we discuss efforts made to strengthen and enforce land rights in Africa while highlighting the impediments induced by the existence of a dualâland tenure regime."
371,46,0.982,South-North Migration of EU Citizens in Times of Crisis,"exported the heated debate on possible restrictions to freedom of movement rights to all member states. What seemed a pro-mobility coalition between the new member states and the Scandinavian states collapsed with the arrival of the so-called ârefugee crisisâ in the summer of 2015. Central and Eastern European countries have shown antagonistic attitudes towards the freedom of circulation of refugees and asylum seekers. Some of the new member states refuted EU quotas for refugees and sought to seal off their borders as a way of preventing asylum seekers to enter. In reply, European Council President Tusk rang the alarm: âLet there be no doubt, the future of Schengen is at stake and time is running out. The clock is ticking, we are under pressure, we need to act fastâ (Tusk 2015). Ironically, by threatening to quit the principle of freedom of movement for refugees and asylum seekers, the new member states put under risk the mobility of EU citizens including that of Central and European citizens who have been the main protagonists of intra-European mobility over the last decade. Nonetheless, the strongest contestation of freedom of movement for EU citizens comes from the Northern European countries. For instance in the UK, in anticipation of the elections for the European Parliament as well as general elections, David Cameron declared that âfree movement in EU needs to be less freeâ (EUActive 2013) (for a full discussion on the UK, see Chap. 10, this volume). The Dutch Socialist Deputy Prime Minister, Lodewijck Asscher, used the colour codes used to announce weather calamities and called for âorange alertâ in anticipation of EU labour migration (EUObserver 2013). The Commission replied arguing that the member states raised concerns about welfare tourism including abuses but have not submitted evidence to support its existence. Instead, the Commission replied by taking a technical fact-checking approach and commissioned an independent study (ICF GHK 2013) which suggested a set of actions seeking to help the member states combat welfare tourism and make the most of freedom of movement (EC 2013). The GHK report (2013) found minuscule numbers of EU citizens who do not work, who are not economically active but who receive benefits from another EU member state. They represented less than 1 % of all such beneficiaries (of EU nationals) in six countries studied (Austria, Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Malta and Portugal) and between 1 % and 5 % in five other countries (Germany, Finland, France, The Netherlands and Sweden). Data obtained by The Guardian on unemployment benefits found that a similar number of EU citizens receive them as Brits in other EU countries (19 January 2015). Calls for more control on freedom of movement is not new. Previous episodes in which freedom of movement has been contested were of lower intensity and, more importantly, they came from individual member states rather than a consolidated block of hardliners. Yet, I argue that they paved the way for the first serious challenge that freedom of movement faced since its introduction. For instance, the eviction of Roma effectively limited the rights of Roma EU citizens and led to their repatriation from Italy in 2008 and France in 2010 â a practice that continues to the present day. Freedom of movement was challenged also from the left for it"
98,259,0.982,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","The introduction of NPM has had a decisive impact on third sectorgovernment relations, and particularly on the modes of financing. Funding for TSOs is increasingly acquired through competitive grants and contracts. As a result of the new funding environment, third sector bureaucratization has developed into a major obstacle impacting negatively on TSOs. The accountability requirements accompanying procurement have increased significantly during the last decades all over Europe. This translates into a situation in which TSOs have to allocate more and more resources to complying with the administrative requirements of applying, reporting and evaluating grants and contracts instead of devoting time and energy for âdoing the right thingâ and supporting the community. Urgently needed at every level of governance in Europe are new modes of procurement that take the specificity of TSOs into account. Again, TSOs are not proxies for commercial enterprises. Modes of procurement have to be reevaluated and ideally homogenized throughout Europe. They should also incorporate a so-called social clauseâgiving priority in public procurement to TSOs having a social impactâthat will ease competition between TSOs and for-profits; they should provide modes for cooperation between governments and TSOs that are tailored toward the needs of TSOs; they should specify tasks and functions for both sides in order to enhance cooperation instead of creating a culture of surveillance; and finally, without losing attention to accountability, they should simplify monitoring and evaluation procedures. The need to"
73,307,0.982,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The Horsley Park urban farming precinct is largely fallow, unmanaged lots. The spread of noxious and environmental weeds, mainly blackberry, is rife across the precinct. Noxious weeds are plants that are controlled under the Noxious Weeds Act 1993 in NSW which is enforced by the Local Councils. Control actions will vary depending on the risk to primary production, cost to undertake the control and the ultimate beneï¬t. They include actions such as complete removal and suppression through to restrictions on sale or propagation. The majority of weeds in the urban farming precinct are class 4 weeds, meaning they are a serious threat and widespread. As such, the cost to control them is prohibitive so the legislated control measure for most of these species is limited to restricting propagation or sale. This highlights the reason for the spread of these weeds, that is, there is no forced control. The impact for the Trust is that many lots are not suitable to take to the market without large capital investment in the removal of weeds. Many of these species will take many years and control attempts before they succeed. To counter this issue the Trust has embarked on a program of crash grazing. Lots are offered free of charge for short term grazing. Agistees are required to erect fencing to contain the animals and manage all access issues. There has been considerable success in the reduction of African Olive using cattle and some limited impact on the spread of Blackberry. The Trust is in the process of seeking other livestock, such as goats, that may help remove the Blackberry."
98,225,0.982,"The Third Sector As a Renewable Resource For Europe : Concepts, Impacts, Challenges and Opportunities","Poland and Croatia exemplify the power of path dependence in shaping a pattern of third sector development highly influenced by past realities (LeÅ et al. 2016; BeÅ¾ovan et al. 2016). Like other third sectors exhibiting the classic features of the statist pattern of civil society development, Eastern European third sectors were subject to an authoritarian state that pursued modernization and social control from the top, and was eager to avoid disruptive third sector elements raising objections from below. TSOs in the realm of the church, sports and TSOs in the social economy, such as cooperatives, were partly able to survive. In addition, the state organized its own third sector-type entities, particularly in the professions and labor, but these were most likely controlled by the state and therefore outside the kind of definition of the third sector identified in Chap. 2 of this report. Conjointly, support structures for the third sector were brought under state control. Reflecting this, the third sector in Poland and Croatia remains fragmented and relatively small compared to the third sector particularly in the welfare partnership countries. Also, the societal embeddedness of the sector in terms of volunteering and giving is still very limited compared to Western European standards. The majority of TSOs are expressive organizations working in the areas of leisure and sports. In both countries, cooperation with government in the social service domain is still in its infancy. Funding continues to be a difficult issue for TSOs in the region and has deteriorated due to the financial crises and austerity measures put in place by government. If there were no EU-support, many TSOs in Poland and Croatia would probably be forced to stop operating. Although the two countries share many commonalities, there are also striking differences that again are linked to history. It is worthwhile to"
