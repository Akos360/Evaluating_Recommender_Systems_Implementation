The stranding of sea turtles is caused by many factors, including incidental capture in shrimping and fishing operations, entanglement, ingestion of marine debris, boat strikes, disease, storms, and hypothermic stunning. The STSSN was established in 1980 to collect information on and document strandings of live and dead sea turtles along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The area includes the coasts from Maine through Texas, as well as portions of the U.S. Caribbean (STSSN 2012). As part of STSSN methodology, the United States coastline was divided into statistical stranding zones. Zones 1 through 21 include the Gulf coast from the Florida Keys through Texas (Figure 11.50).

34,683,0.715,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Until 1890, the sea turtle fisheries in Florida occurred in eight counties, but by 1897 they were concentrated in four: Monroe, Levy, Franklin, and Escambia counties on the Gulf coast. The total production in 1897 alone was 287,857 kg (634,616 lb), with 86 % coming from Monroe County at the southern tip of Florida (Townsend 1899). However, an unspecified portion of the total production came from the YucataÌn coast because turtles were already becoming scarce in Florida; by 1897, most of the turtles came from the YucataÌn coast. Apparently, the decrease in the sea turtle populations along the Florida Gulf coast was due not only to the harvest of juveniles but also of eggs, as these were sought after eagerly by local people (Townsend 1899). Indeed, although few records of egg exploitation exist, it is believed that a large number of eggs were collected throughout the entire rim of the Gulf of Mexico (Hildebrand 1963; Witzell 1994). Turtles were so scarce by the late 1800s that Townsend (1899) called for the protection of the turtles and their eggs during their breeding season. The sea turtle fisheries continued through the early and mid-1900s on the Florida Gulf coast, though at a much lower rate (Figure 11.4), presumably due to decreases in the turtle populations (Rebel 1974). The landings records for Florida indicate a preference for green turtle meat (Figure 11.4). In the 1900s, imports of live turtles into the United States were significant prior to the 1978 listing of sea turtles under the 1973 U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The total live sea turtle imports into the United States from 1948 through 1976 amounted to 8,099,950 kg (17,857,334 lb), with a peak in 1951 and a decreasing trend to a minimum of 1,814 kg (4,000 lb) in 1975 (Figure 11.5) (Cato et al. 1978). The imported species of sea turtles included the green, olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), loggerhead, and hawksbill, with the former two species being the most imported (Cato et al. 1978). These imports came from over 40 countries and demonstrate the demand for live sea turtles that existed in the United States until the"

During all seasons, juvenile and adult green and Kempâs ridley sea turtles used eastern Gulf waters extensively. Low numbers of hawksbills also used the eastern Gulf of Mexico, while leatherbacks were found in the eastern Gulf during the spring and fall as they migrated through to preferred feeding and nesting grounds (Teas 1993). The western Gulf of Mexico provided year-round habitat for juvenile loggerheads and for hatchlings to adult Kempâs ridleys. Throughout the year, juvenile green turtles used western Gulf of Mexico waters (Teas 1993). During the summer and fall when prevailing currents carried them into the western Gulf, hawksbills ranging from hatchling to juvenile were common. Leatherback sea turtles migrated through the western Gulf during the spring and fall (Teas 1993). Surveys were conducted in 1991 and 1992 to establish relative sea turtle abundance and seasonality in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Braun-McNeill and Epperly 2002). The study was based on surveying fishermen along the Gulf coast from Louisiana to southern Florida year-round regarding the sighting of sea turtles. The surveys indicated that sea turtle abundance along the Gulf coast was seasonal, with turtles migrating northward in the warmer months and then migrating south in the colder months. This seasonality was in agreement with historical information obtained from turtle fisheries in the Gulf States (Stevenson 1893; Carr and Caldwell 1956). The study also demonstrated that the number of turtle sightings was significantly higher in the Florida Keys than in any other location and that, throughout the study area, most turtles tended to be located within 506 km (314 mi) from the coast (Braun-McNeill and Epperly 2002). An analysis of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) aerial survey data for September, October, and November of 1992, 1993, and 1994 was conducted to determine sea turtle spatial dynamics for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (McDaniel 1998). The results of the study indicated that sea turtles were observed at much higher rates along the Florida Gulf coast than in the western Gulf, and the highest density of observed sea turtles occurred in the Florida Keys region (0.525 turtles per square kilometer [km2] or 0.203 turtles per square mile [mi2]) (McDaniel et al. 2000). These results are similar to those obtained by Fritts et al. (1983a) discussed above. Various hypotheses were proposed to explain the higher numbers of sea turtles observed in the eastern Gulf as compared to the western Gulf of Mexico; these included the following: more suitable sea turtle habitat in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the reduction of turtles by the intense shrimp fishery in the western Gulf of Mexico, low oxygen levels off the Louisiana coast, sea turtles being attracted to shrimp vessel bycatch, and more turtles inhabiting nearshore areas compared to areas offshore (McDaniel 1998). In the same study conducted by McDaniel et al. (2000), sea turtle abundance decreased significantly west from Florida toward the north-central Gulf of Mexico and increased 20-fold in south Texas as compared to other areas surveyed in the western Gulf, ranging from no turtles up to 0.10 turtles/km2 (0.04 turtles/mi2) (McDaniel et al. 2000). This is consistent with an earlier week-long aerial survey conducted in the fall of 1979 in the same south Texas area that reported a mean sea turtle density of 0.0196 turtle/km2 (0.0076 turtles/mi2) (Reeves and Leatherwood 1983). Interestingly, a small peak around the Chandeleur Islands in Louisiana was observed (McDaniel et al. 2000); this peak around the Chandeleur Islands is important because Louisiana waters are known foraging grounds for post-nesting Kempâs ridleys (ChaÌvez 1968; Pritchard and MaÌrquez-M. 1973; Ogren 1989). In aerial surveys conducted along the U.S. Gulf Coast from September through November during 1992 through 1996, Kempâs ridleys were sighted primarily in inshore waters and most commonly occurred in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Epperly et al. 2002). During the same surveys, loggerhead sea turtles were sighted throughout the Gulf but had a very low occurrence in offshore waters of the western Gulf. Green turtles occurred offshore and primarily were"

Japan was historically the major importer of tortoiseshell or bekko from the Caribbean (NMFS and USFWS 1993). They agreed to stop importing bekko in 1993 (USFWS 2012). Although the volume of international trade has declined significantly in the past 20 years, it remains active, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas (Mortimer 2008). In Southeast Asia, the extensive practice of selling whole, stuffed hawksbills is a relatively new threat (Mortimer 2008). Hawksbills are the most tropical of the sea turtle species and typically nest at low densities throughout their range (NMFS and USFWS 1993, 2007e). In the past, hawksbill sea turtles were considered to be naturally rare and to have a more dispersed nesting pattern than the other sea turtle species (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). However, the dispersed pattern currently observed is now believed to be the result of overexploitation of previously large colonies (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Hawksbill sea turtles are often associated with coral reefs (Meylan 1988; Meylan and Redlow 2006). There are many gaps in the understanding of hawksbill sea turtle biology, and the oceanic phase of the post-hatchlings remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of hawksbill life history (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Because of an almost total lack of long-term trend data at hawksbill foraging sites, nesting beach data are the primary information source used to evaluate trends in hawksbill populations. Few data are available on the at-sea mortality of hawksbills in fisheries (NMFS and USFWS 2007e)."
34,866,0.682,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","et al. 2009; Kot et al. 2010; Bolten et al. 2011; Finkbeiner et al. 2011; Ponwith 2011). Despite the data gaps and limitations associated with specific datasets, the current conditions of the five species of sea turtles that occur in the Gulf of Mexico have been described qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively. Kempâs Ridley Sea Turtles. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Kempâs ridley sea turtle has made a remarkable recovery from the brink of extinction (Heppell et al. 2007; Crowder and Heppell 2011), although the current nesting populations remain far below historical levels. The increased abundance and nesting of Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years is most likely a result of many activities that affect all Kempâs ridley life stagesâconservation and education efforts in both Mexico and the United States, the Kempâs Ridley Recovery Program, the Kempâs Ridley Head Start Experiment, the elimination of direct harvest of eggs and adult turtles, nest and hatchling protection, TED use, shrimp fishery closures, and the reduced Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawling effort in both the United States and Mexico (Shaver and Wibbels 2007; NMFS et al. 2011; Crowder and Heppell 2011). Despite the partial success story, there are threats to Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf that could cause significant impacts to the population and affect its continued recovery, particularly the incidental bycatch. The future of Kempâs ridleys is optimistically bright, and nesting numbers at Rancho Nuevo and PAIS continue to increase; however, because of their mass nesting at a single site in the western Gulf and their restricted Gulf of Mexico distribution, a significant event or the synergistic effects of multiple threats in the Gulf could have catastrophic effects on the recovering Kempâs ridley population. Loggerhead Sea Turtles. The life history, distribution, and abundance of the loggerhead sea turtle is probably better understood than all other sea turtle species that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico (Bolten and Witherington 2003; USFWS and NMFS 2011). While the loggerhead is distributed globally, the goal of this chapter was to describe contemporary conditions of Gulf sea turtles; information for populations that occur in the Gulf of Mexico during some portion of their life cycle was the focus. These populations included the Peninsular Florida, northern Gulf of Mexico, Dry Tortugas, and Greater Caribbean subpopulations of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (USFWS and NMFS 2011). The annual nest counts from 2001 through 2009 on Florida Gulf coast and Atlantic beaches showed a decreasing trend, but in 2010 and 2011, loggerhead nest counts on surveyed Florida beaches were back to numbers similar to those recorded in 2000, indicating that the population of nesting females may have stabilized. Given the lack of a long historical record, it is not known whether these types of fluctuations are common or if the recent temporary decrease observed was caused by an acute factor. A recent analysis of annual loggerhead nest counts for the northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation indicated a significant declining trend; however, a longer time series of nesting data is needed for an adequate evaluation (NMFS and USFWS 2008). More years of data are also needed in order to detect a trend in loggerhead nest counts for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation. Nesting for the Greater Caribbean subpopulation appears to be stable; however, a trend analysis is challenging because standardized surveys are few, survey efforts have changed, and low-level nesting occurs in many locations (NMFS and USFWS 2008). High cumulative anthropogenic threat levels were estimated for oceanic and neritic juveniles and adults of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS during the most recent loggerhead status review (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011). The loggerhead mortalities associated with these high threat levels resulted primarily from fisheries bycatch. Significant loggerhead mortality occurred in longline fisheries, bottom and mid-water trawl fisheries, dredge fisheries, gillnet fisheries, and pot/trap fisheries that occur not only in U.S. waters (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011; Ponwith 2011), but also in the Azores, the Mediterranean, on the Grand Banks, in Canadian waters, and in other locations throughout the range of the northwest Atlantic Ocean"
34,786,0.655,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","2006). Low numbers of leatherback nesting also occur along the southeast Atlantic coast of the United States, from central Florida through North Carolina (Figure 11.35). In the Gulf of Mexico, leatherback sea turtles nest at low levels along the Florida, Alabama, and Mexican coasts (Figure 11.35). Leatherback nesting was reported as early as 1962 on a beach near Destin along the Florida Gulf coast (Yerger 1965). As indicated by reports from local residents, leatherbacks may have nested on Texas beaches in the 1920s and 1930s (Hildebrand 1963). One leatherback nest was recorded at PAIS in 2008 (NPS 2013d). Leatherback sea turtles that forage in and travel through the Gulf of Mexico originate from many different nesting beaches. For example, leatherbacks that were tagged while nesting on the Florida east coast and St. Croix were later recaptured along the Mexican Gulf coast (Eckert et al. 2012). In addition, leatherbacks that nest on Gulf of Mexico beaches migrate to and forage in waters outside the Gulf, and many satellite tracking studies have shown that leatherback sea turtles that nest in the western Atlantic migrate to Western Europe and West Africa (Eckert et al. 2012). Therefore, using data from nesting beaches of leatherbacks known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico to evaluate the population of leatherback sea turtles that use the Gulf is extremely challenging. However, to determine trends in leatherback nesting in the general western Atlantic Ocean area, data from two important nesting beaches in the area with longterm monitoring were evaluated: the Florida east coast and Tortuguero, Costa Rica. In addition, recent investigations have suggested that the Gulf of Mexico may be a significant year-round foraging ground for leatherbacks that nest along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, as well as Panama (Evans et al. 2007; Fossette et al. 2010)."

34,827,0.634,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed, often leading to the destruction of hawksbill nesting habitat (Mortimer and Donnelly 2008). For example, critical hawksbill habitats are quickly being impacted by the development along the Gulf coast of the YucataÌn Peninsula (GardunÌo-Andrade et al. 1999). Beachfront development and the clearing of dune vegetation significantly affect hawksbill sea turtles because they prefer to nest under vegetation (Mortimer and Donnelly 2008). Global climate change may affect sea turtle nesting beaches in several ways, including sea level rise, higher ambient temperatures, and changes in hurricane/cyclone activity (Hawkes et al. 2009; Witt et al. 2010). Higher water levels associated with sea level rise will gradually and directly decrease the availability of suitable nesting sites (Witt et al. 2010). Increasing temperatures may open up areas that were previously unavailable for nesting (Witt et al. 2010), but recent studies have suggested that up to half of the currently available sea turtle nesting areas could be lost with predicted sea level rise (Fish et al. 2008). Sea turtle nesting is significantly affected by temperature, and incubation temperatures can affect incubation success, duration, and the sex of hatchlings (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980; Witt et al. 2010; Valverde et al. 2010). Therefore, increasing temperatures have the potential to change current nest incubation regimes, as well as to skew sex ratios (Hawkes et al. 2007a). Changes in the global climate are predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of hurricanes (Webster et al. 2005), which can significantly affect the reproductive success of sea turtles. On Gulf of Mexico beaches, predation of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings can be significant. Known predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings include raccoons, ghost crabs, coyotes, foxes, armadillos, domestic dogs and cats, feral pigs, skunks, bobcats, badgers, gulls, fish crows, and larval insects (Witherington et al. 2006a; NMFS et al. 2011). Invasive fire ants are also significant predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings on Gulf coast nesting beaches (Witherington et al. 2006a; NMFS et al. 2011). Invasive plant species are known to invade and desiccate eggs, trap hatchlings, interfere with nest construction, and lower nest incubation temperatures because of shading (Conant et al. 2009). For example, the invasive Australian pine has caused shading of beaches, lowered sea turtle nest incubation temperatures, limited accessibility to suitable nest sites, entrapped nesting turtles, interfered with nest construction, and caused sea turtle nesting activity to decline on a remote nesting beach in Everglades National Park along the Florida Gulf coast (Davis and Whiting 1977; Schmeltz and Mezich 1988; Reardon and Mansfield 1997; Hanson et al. 1998). The hurricane season for the Gulf overlaps closely with the sea turtle nesting season (Magnuson et al. 1990). While sea turtles have evolved to deal with erosion, flooding, storm surges, and other disturbances caused by hurricanes and other severe storms by laying large numbers of eggs and distributing their nests spatially and temporally, hurricanes can affect the reproductive success of sea turtles, since they rely on specific beaches for reproduction (Carr and Carr 1972). In addition, the effects of hurricanes vary by species (Pike and Stiner 2007). For example, in the southeastern United States, leatherback turtles nest the earliest, and most hatchlings emerge before the hurricane season starts, while loggerhead turtles nest intermediately, and only nests laid late in the season would be at risk. However, green turtles nest the latest, and their entire nesting season occurs during the hurricane season; therefore, their developing eggs and nests are extremely vulnerable to hurricanes (Pike and Stiner 2007). In 1989, the effects of Hurricane Gilbert were documented on the Kempâs ridley nesting beach in Mexico. When debris was deposited, the beach was eroded, and coral rock was exposed along the central portion of Rancho Nuevo. About 20 % of the Kempâs ridley nesting activity was displaced to the north that year (MaÌrquez-M. 1990). Hurricane Andrew, a Category 4 hurricane that hit south Florida on August 24, 1992, provided an opportunity to quantify the impacts of a major hurricane on six beaches where"

This phase may involve long-distance travel carried by surface gyres, with eventual recruitment to neritic foraging habitat (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Hatchlings entrained in the Loop Current could be expected to remain in the Gulf of Mexico for differing periods of time, depending on which branch of the Loop Current they enter (Meylan and Redlow 2006). Both newly hatched and early juvenile hawksbills have been found in association with Sargassum and floating weed in the Atlantic and Caribbean (Table 11.5) (Carr 1987; Mellgren and Mann 1996; Musick and Limpus 1997; Meylan and Redlow 2006). No post-hatchlings but six juvenile hawksbill sea turtles, with an average size of 20.6 cm (8.1 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated, surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean from 2005 through 2011; some of these hawksbills were large enough to be on the cusp of recruitment into the neritic zone, most likely to foraging habitat in the Florida Keys (Witherington et al. 2012). Weedlines in the Gulf of Mexico likely serve as habitat for posthatchling hawksbills from nesting beaches in Mexico and Central America (NMFS and USFWS 1993). Between 1972 and 1984, 77 strandings of post-hatchling and juvenile hawksbills were recorded in Texas, with most occurring near Corpus Christi; these turtles most likely originated from nesting beaches on the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico (Amos 1989; Bowen et al. 2007). Limited tagging data indicates that some post-hatchling hawksbills from the western Gulf of Mexico disperse into the Atlantic Ocean, most likely through the Florida Straits, and move northward along Floridaâs east coast (Meylan and Redlow 2006)."
34,826,0.617,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, beaches are cleaned by mechanical raking, scraping with large machinery, hand raking, and picking up debris by hand. These activities can directly and indirectly affect sea turtles (NMFS et al. 2011). Driving is permitted on many Gulf of Mexico beaches. Nesting sea turtles have been run over and killed by vehicles, and vehicles have crushed emerging hatchlings (NMFS et al. 2011). Because the Kempâs ridley has only one primary nesting beach in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and a secondary nesting colony at PAIS in Texas, it is particularly susceptible to beach disturbance, alteration, and destruction by natural and anthropogenic events. Beach cleaning has been documented to affect Kempâs ridleys. For example, 12 Kempâs ridley hatchlings became trapped by a sand ridge created by heavy equipment cleaning the beach on North Padre Island, Texas in 2002 and were later crushed and killed by passing vehicles (Shaver 2004). The presence of artificial lighting on or near the beach adversely affects both nesting and hatchling sea turtles (Witherington and Martin 1996). Mortality from misdirection by artificial lighting on both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of Florida kills thousands of loggerhead hatchlings each year (Witherington 1997). The proportion of all emerging loggerhead hatchlings that died because of beach lighting was estimated in the early 1990s to be as high as 5â10 % (Witherington et al. 1996). Loggerheads abort nesting attempts at a greater frequency in lighted areas. Artificial lighting also deters females from emerging from the ocean to nest (Witherington 1986, 1992). Hatchling orientation of nests located at 23 representative beaches in six Florida counties was surveyed in 1993 and 1994, and approximately 10â30 % of nests showed evidence of hatchling disorientation by lighting (Witherington et al. 1996). Similar to other nocturnal nesting sea turtles, nesting leatherbacks and hatchlings can be disoriented by artificial lighting on the beach (NMFS 2011b). A significant negative relationship was found between sea turtle nesting density and distance from the nearest of 17 ocean inlets (Witherington et al. 2005). Beach instability from both erosion and sand accretion may discourage sea turtle nesting, since the effect of inlets in lowering nesting density was found both updrift and downdrift of the inlets. When sea turtles emerged to nest in the presence of armoring structures, more returned to the water without nesting compared to turtles that emerged on nonarmored beaches (Mosier 1998; Mosier and Witherington 2002). Fewer sea turtles made nesting attempts on beaches fronted by seawalls than on adjacent beaches where armoring structures were absent (Mosier 1998). In addition, sea turtles on armored sections of beach had a tendency to wander great distances as compared to turtles that emerged to nest on adjacent natural beaches (Mosier 1998). Since oil exploration and production occurs south of Tamaulipas and Veracruz in Mexico and at PAIS in Texas, the Kempâs ridley nesting beaches, as well as the nesting turtles, eggs, and hatchlings, could be impacted by oil spills and related activities (NMFS et al. 2011). For example, in 1979, the Ixtoc I oil well blew out and caused a fire in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico. The nesting beach at Rancho Nuevo was affected by the Ixtoc I well blowout, and large amounts of oil were released daily into the Gulf of Mexico for several months. However, the oil reached the beach after the nesting season, and nesting females were not present. Also, a loaded supertanker, the Mega Borg, exploded near Galveston, Texas in 1990, causing more than 121,000 barrels of crude oil to be released into the Gulf of Mexico; sea turtles covered in oil were found after this spill (Yender and Mearns 2003). Oil spills have affected loggerhead nesting beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. In August 1993, approximately 350,000 gal of fuel oil spilled into Tampa Bay and washed onto nesting beaches in Pinellas County, Florida (Conant et al. 2009). Impacts to loggerheads resulting from the spill included 31 dead hatchlings, 176 oil-covered nests, and 2,177 eggs and hatchlings exposed to oil or disturbed by response activities (FDEP et al. 1997)."

The Gulf of Mexico provides critical spawning grounds for many highly migratory fish and shark species of great ecological, commercial, and recreational importance. Only a small fraction (4.6 %) of finfish is endemic to the Gulf of Mexico, although some fish species of commercial and recreational importance can complete their entire life cycle within the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Almost half of finfish species in the Gulf of Mexico are omnipresent and can be found throughout the Gulf; the other half is limited to parts of the Gulf of Mexico."

Sex is determined by incubation temperatures prevailing during the middle third of the incubation period for all sea turtle species (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980; Wibbels 2007). Each species has a pivotal temperature, which is the temperature at which the sex ratio is one to one. Nest temperatures higher than the pivotal temperature produce mostly females, and lower temperatures produce mostly males (Witherington et al. 2006a). Immediately after emerging from the nest, sea turtle hatchlings begin a period of frenzied activity. During this period, they move from their nest to the surf, swim, and are swept through the surf zone (Witherington 1995; Conant et al. 2009). The hatchlings use a progression of orientation cues as they crawl to the water, swim through the surf, and migrate offshore (Lohmann and Lohmann 2003; Lohmann et al. 2012). Once they reach the oceanic zone, hatchlings spend a number of years growing and developing. Some sea turtle species return to the neritic zone as juveniles (e.g., Kempâs ridleys, loggerheads, greens, hawksbills), while others stay in the oceanic zone (e.g., leatherbacks) (Figure 11.1). Adults of some species remain in the neritic zone their entire lives (e.g., Kempâs ridleys), and some move back and forth between the neritic and oceanic zones (e.g., loggerheads). Some sea turtles spend their entire lives in the oceanic zone (e.g., leatherbacks), with the exception of females nesting in the terrestrial zone. While differences exist between and within species, adult females typically return to nest in the general vicinity of the beach where they hatched from eggs many years earlier and often nest at the same beach throughout their reproductive years. For example, while most loggerheads return to nest at the same beach from which they were hatched, individual loggerhead sea turtles have been known to nest on both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of Florida (LeBuff 1974). Green turtles typically nest on the same beach where they hatched (Bowen et al. 1989; Allard et al. 1994)."

In the Gulf of Mexico, information regarding the distribution and abundance of leatherback sea turtles, which is summarized in the following paragraphs, is incomplete. However, adult leatherback distribution in the Gulf of Mexicoâwhether in deep-sea, pelagic waters, along the continental shelf, or in nearshore watersâhas historically been associated with dense concentrations of jellyfish (Leary 1957; Fritts et al. 1983a, b; den Hartog and van Nierop 1984; Lohoefener et al. 1989; Eckert et al. 1989a, 2012; Houghton et al. 2006). In the 1950s, Florida fishermen reported occasional sightings of leatherbacks off the coast of Sarasota and claimed they had been seen occasionally in the area since at least the 1930s (Yerger 1965). A leatherback carcass was found in Copano Bay, Texas in 1951 (Gunter 1951). In 1956, 100 leatherbacks were reported only 75 yards from the beach in Port Aransas, Texas. This group of leatherbacks appeared to be associated with a large abundance of jellyfish in the area (Leary 1957). Multiple sightings and captures of leatherbacks occurred along the Florida Gulf coast during the early 1960s (Yerger 1965). In fact, leatherbacks were once reported to be seasonally abundant off the coast of Panama City, Florida (Pritchard 1976). In 1975, leatherbacks were observed off the coast of Alabama (Mount 1975). In 1979, aerial surveys of the Texas and Florida Gulf coasts reported more than 97 % of all turtle sightings to be in Florida, four of which were leatherbacks (Fritts and Reynolds 1981). Aerial surveys conducted in the Gulf of Mexico from May 1980 to April 1981 reported a total of 47 leatherbacks across all areas (except off the coast of south Texas), and found leatherbacks to be most common off the coast of Florida (Fritts et al. 1983a, b). During the survey, leatherbacks were more conspicuous on the continental shelf than in adjacent deeper waters (Fritts et al. 1983a, b). Between 1988 and 1990, NMFS aerial surveys in the Gulf of Mexico reported infrequent sightings of leatherbacks, with most sightings occurring in July through November 1989 (Lohoefener et al. 1990). A survey of sea turtles in southeastern Louisiana in 1988 reported that the only evidence of leatherbacks in the area was one report from a diver in July 1988 (Fuller 1989). During the summer of 1989, six leatherback sightings were reported in south Louisiana, five of which were by divers most likely diving offshore at oil platforms (Fuller 1989). During a 1989 cruise in the Gulf of Mexico by the University of West Florida to the head of De Soto Canyon to collect neuston and Sargassum, eight leatherbacks were sighted near a coastal-subtropical water mass boundary region that contained high densities of jellyfish (Collard 1990). Beginning in 1992, the U.S. Geological Survey performed a 3-year aerial and ship survey of the entire northern Gulf of Mexico. The study estimated an overall abundance of 168 leatherbacks in the continental slope area and also estimated leatherbacks to be 12 times more abundant in the winter than in the summer (Davis et al. 2000). Aerial surveys by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center during the fall of 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1996 sighted a total of three leatherbacks in the western Gulf of Mexico and eight in the eastern Gulf; only two of the turtles sighted were in water less than approximately 18 m (59 ft) deep (Epperly et al. 2002). In CMR studies, the low recapture rate of leatherbacks, compared to other species of sea turtles, is likely due to their highly pelagic lifestyle and uncommon occurrence in coastal waters. However, captures and tag returns of leatherbacks have indicated that adult females use the Gulf of Mexico as a foraging ground. From 1970 to 1973, researchers in Suriname and French Guiana tagged more than 2,000 nesting female leatherbacks. Two of the turtles that were tagged on French Guiana beaches in 1970 and 1972, respectively, were recaptured in western Gulf of Mexico waters in 1973 (Pritchard 1976). Also, a nesting female tagged on the Costa Rican coast in 1985 was captured a year later by a shrimp fisherman off the Mississippi"

The females typically left the vicinity of the nesting beach within 24 h of nesting, and movements were usually highly directed. The post-nesting females took up residence in well-defined, relatively small (median size of 2,000 km2 [772 mi2]) areas on the continental shelf adjacent to Florida, Texas, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba within a few weeks of departing from the nesting beaches (Foley et al. 2008). Sixty percent of the turtles (22 of 38) from both nesting assemblages took up residence off the Florida Gulf coast between the Dry Tortugas and Cape San Blas. The distribution of resident areas of female loggerheads from both nesting assemblages overlapped off the western coast of Florida, the western and northern coast of the YucataÌn Peninsula, and the northern coast of Cuba (Foley et al. 2008). Migrations of 28 post-nesting loggerheads from nesting beaches in Sarasota Countyâtheir most important Gulf of Mexico rookeryâwere tracked between May 2005 and December 2007 (Girard et al. 2009). Post-nesting migrations were completed in 3â68 days. Five different migration patterns were observed and included the following: six turtles remained in the vicinity of their nesting site; nine migrated to the southwestern part of the Florida Shelf; two migrated to the northeast Gulf of Mexico; five turtles migrated to the YucataÌn Shelf in the southern Gulf of Mexico, Campeche Bay, or Cuba; and six loggerheads migrated to the Bahamas. Loggerheads moved along rather straight routes over the continental shelf but showed more indirect paths in oceanic waters. Smaller turtles remained on the Florida Shelf, and larger individuals showed various migration strategies, staying on the Florida Shelf or moving to long-distance foraging grounds (Girard et al. 2009). Hart et al. (2012a) recently completed a study that identified shared regional at-sea foraging areas for female loggerheads, which was the first study to consolidate tracking data from three different nesting subpopulations in the Gulf. Ten females from nesting beaches of three subpopulations (St. Joseph Peninsula for northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation, Casey Key for Peninsular Florida subpopulation, and DTNP for Dry Tortugas subpopulation) in the Gulf of Mexico were satellite tracked in 2008, 2009, and 2010. All turtles migrated to discrete foraging sites in two common areas located off southwest Florida and the northern YucataÌn Peninsula, located 102â904 km (63.4â561.7 mi) from the nesting beaches. Within 3â35 days, turtles migrated to the foraging sites, where they all displayed high site fidelity over time. The results of the study indicated that different nesting aggregations of loggerheads in the Gulf of Mexico use common at-sea foraging areas, and these important areas should be protected (Hart et al. 2012a). In a study of nearshore waters of Gullivan Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, that was conducted from 1997 through 2004, few loggerheads (15 turtles averaging 65.5 cm [25.8 in] SCL) were captured, possibly because they prefer deeper waters (Witzell and Schmid 2004, 2005). During surveys conducted at Key West National Wildlife Refuge (KWNWR) from 2002 through 2006, more than 470 loggerhead sea turtles were sighted, and 182 neritic juveniles and adults, ranging in size from 36.4 to 98.1 cm (14.3 to 38.6 in) SCL and averaging 75.5 cm (29.7 in) SCL, were captured, demonstrating the importance of this area as a foraging site for these size classes (Eaton et al. 2008). A long-term study of Florida Bay demonstrated that this area provided year-round resident foraging areas for large numbers of juvenile and male and female adult loggerhead sea turtles (Schroeder et al. 2003; Eaton et al. 2008; Conant et al. 2009). From 1990 through 2006, 902 loggerheads were captured; they ranged in size from 33 to 98.7 cm (13 to 38.9 in) SCL, averaging 77.7 cm (30.6 in) SCL. Multiple recaptures of juvenile and adult loggerheads over periods of up to 10 years indicated some strong site fidelity within Florida Bay. Genetic studies have demonstrated that more than 80 % of the adult loggerheads that forage in Florida Bay are from the Peninsular Florida subpopulation, while about 10 % are from the Quintana Roo, Mexico nesting population (Heppell et al. 2003)."

Fifteen juveniles were fitted with transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast from 2004 through 2007. Their movements were restricted to the continental shelf from Matagorda Bay, Texas, east to waters offshore Timbalier Bay, Louisiana, and during most or all of the tracking period, the juveniles remained primarily in waters less than 5 m (16.4 ft) deep (Seney and Landry 2011). While movement patterns varied among years, the juvenile Kempâs ridleys were tracked primarily during the warmer months and preferred tidal passes, bays, coastal lakes, and nearshore waters. In addition, this investigation suggested that the preferred habitat of juvenile Kempâs ridleys may differ among years and could be related to the locations and abundances of specific prey items (Seney and Landry 2011). The movements of juvenile Kempâs ridleys in an understudied region of the Kempâs ridley rangeâthe north-central Gulf of Mexicoâwere studied by satellite tracking 12 turtles that were captured incidentally by recreational fishermen on piers or stranded live in Mississippi and Alabama, and rehabilitated and released (Lyn et al. 2012). Six turtles were released in Mississippi waters, 3.2 km (2 mi) south of East Ship Island, in November 2010, and six were released near documented feeding grounds off the Cedar Keys in Florida in April 2011. The turtles released in Mississippi migrated to warmer waters offshore (when the water temperatures decreased) and stayed in the general area of Mississippi Sound and adjacent Louisiana waters. However, within days of being released, most of the turtles released in Florida quickly began swimming up the coastline toward Alabama and Mississippi. One of the turtles released in Florida, a newly mature male, was tracked all the way to Rancho Nuevo, Mexico; it remained in this area for 2 weeks in March before returning north to waters along the Texas/Louisiana border. The results of this study indicated that releasing turtles near their hooking/stranding location is preferred over releasing them in known feeding grounds (Lyn et al. 2012). A number of in-water tagging studies have characterized sea turtle distribution, abundance, use, and ecology in nearshore waters along the Florida Gulf coast. Nearshore waters that have been studied include Apalachee Bay (Rudloe et al. 1991; Campbell 1996), Deadman Bay (Barichivich 2006), Cedar Keys/Waccasassa Bay (Schmid and Ogren 1990; Schmid 1998; Schmid et al. 2002, 2003), Tampa Bay (Nelson 2000), Charlotte Harbor Estuary (Schmid 2011), and Ten Thousand Islands/Gullivan Bay (Witzell and Schmid 2004, 2005). Details of these investigations are presented in the following paragraphs. However, information gaps still exist since the Florida Gulf coast is extensive, and long-term, in-water studies are needed to monitor the status of juvenile sea turtles at key foraging areas (Eaton et al. 2008). Rudloe et al. (1991) conducted a tagging study of post-oceanic juvenile Kempâs ridleys that were incidentally captured during shrimp trawling, gill netting, or fish seining in the coastal waters of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, including Apalachee, Levy, and Dickerson bays, from 1984 through 1988. A total of 106 turtles, ranging in size from 20.3 to 57.9 cm (8 to 22.8 in) SCL (mean 36.7 cm [14.4 in] SCL), were collected over a 97 km (60 mi) stretch of the Florida Gulf coast from Shell Point, Wakulla County to St. George Island, Franklin County. While turtles were collected every month, the highest numbers of turtles were collected during May and December. Turtles obtained during December, January, and February were significantly larger than those collected in June, July, August, and September (means of 40.4 cm [15.9 in] SCL and 30 cm [11.8 in] SCL, respectively). Kempâs ridleys were collected from seagrass, sand, and mud bottom substrates at depths ranging from 0.3 m (1 ft) inshore to 32 m (105 ft) 9.7 km (6 mi) offshore, with the smallest turtles collected from depths of less than 2 m (6.5 ft). Since turtles were only recaptured within a season, the results of the study indicated a transitory Kempâs ridley population along the northwest Florida Panhandle coast. In a netting study"
347,134,0.549,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"There are a number of definitions of alien species, invasive species and invasive alien species. If not stated otherwise, within this chapter we concentrate on IAS. The most common definition of IAS is the one proposed by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; COP 6 Decision VI/232), namely, âalien species whose introduction and spread threatens ecosystems, habitats or species with economic or environmental harmâ. The process of IAS invasion is referred to as bioinvasion (or biological invasion). There are several routes to IAS introduction, both natural and man-made, but ballast waters used in maritime transportation are currently seen as the main source of the problem because of the fact that maritime transportation has increased enormously not only worldwide but also in the Baltic Sea region (HELCOM 2009a, b; Olenin et al. 2010). Within the Baltic Sea, despite its relatively small size, ship traffic is one of the densest in the world, both in terms of ship numbers and tonnage. Based on information from the HELCOM AIS (Automatic Identification System) database, more than 50,000 vessels cross the Danish straits per year, and at any time, approximately 2,000 vessels can be found in the Baltic Sea.3 Therefore, according to the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare 2012), the Baltic Sea is one of the sea basins with the greatest environmental pressure due to shipping activities. Globally, IAS is considered to be one of the greatest threats to marine biodiversity, entailing both direct and indirect consequences for ecosystems with various"

Nesting surveys along the Texas coast, which have increased in recent years, have been extremely challenging due to the hundreds of kilometers of beaches that must be searched, limited resources, and logistical difficulties, and because of the nesting characteristics of Kempâs ridleys (e.g., nesting during the day on windy days) (Shaver and Rubio 2008). Eggs from nests found on many of the Texas beaches are moved to incubation facilities or protective corrals. While fewer than ten nests were recorded each year (for years for which data are available) prior to 1997, the number of nests on Texas beaches began to increase in 1998. Since 2006, more than 100 Kempâs ridley nests or at least 40 nesting Kempâs ridleys have been recorded for Texas beaches each year (Figure 11.12). In 2010, 141 nests were recorded along the Texas coast, and 199 nests were recorded in 2011 (NPS 2013a). A record number of 209 Kempâs ridley nests, representing about 84 nesting females, was recorded along the Texas coast in 2012 (NPS 2013b), and 153 nests were recorded during the 2013 nesting season (NPS 2013a). With increased productivity on the nesting beaches and improved survival at sea because of reductions in fishing mortality, conservation efforts boosted the current population of Kempâs ridleys from 7,000 to 8,000 breeding females nesting at multiple sites from Padre Island, Texas, to Veracruz in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico (Crowder and Heppell 2011)."

The Fulton cannery was the largest and operated between 1881 and 1896; in 1890, this cannery alone processed 900 green turtles (41.7 % of the turtle catch in the state) totaling 110,223 kg (243,000 lb) and produced about 40,000 0.9-kg (2-lb) cans (Doughty 1984). The green turtle cannery located in Rockport was founded around 1886. During its first 6 months of operation, the cannery processed about 3,856 kg (8,500 lb) of green turtle meat (True 1887). Green turtles caught and processed in Texas were presumed to feed in the seagrass beds located between Matagorda Bay and Laguna Madre (Hildebrand 1982). Rapid depletion of green turtle populations in Texas and elsewhere occurred because the fishery targeted juvenile turtles, a highly vulnerable stage in the life cycle of this slow-growing, late-maturing species (Crouse et al. 1987; Witzell 1994). While the green turtle fishery in Texas developed very quickly, it declined abruptly after 1892 and ended shortly thereafter, presumably due to the scarcity of turtles and to a deep freeze along the Texas coast (Hildebrand 1982). A small turtle fishery in Louisiana remained open through the early 1970s (Figure 11.2). Prior to 1860, green turtles caught on the Florida east coast, particularly in the Indian River Lagoon, were exchanged for goods with various merchant vessels; in later years, agents purchased the catch and then shipped it mainly to New York (True 1887). By 1887, green, loggerhead, and hawksbill turtles were hunted as far north as Beaufort and Morehead City, North Carolina, where green turtles in particular were a delicacy and consumed locally (True 1887). There was no mention of Kempâs ridley sea turtles being harvested in the early records, even though this species surely was present in Florida at the time (Carr 1957). The omission appears to have occurred because Kempâs ridleys were sold as loggerheads for years (Rebel 1974; Cato et al. 1978). Two locations on Floridaâs west coastâKey West and Homosassaâappear to have supported the most abundant in-water populations of green turtles in the entire Gulf of Mexico in the late 1800s. Captured turtles weighing between 18 and 45 kg (40 and 100 lb) were kept alive in small Kraals (Dutch for corral) or seawater-filled holding pens until ready to be shipped to New York (True 1887). Estimates indicate that about 50 18-kg (40-pound) turtles per week were brought to Key West throughout the year (True 1887). The green turtle fishery in the Cedar Keys area presumably arose around 1878. Fishing was concentrated in an area 32â48 kilometers (km) (20â30 miles [mi]) north and south from the main Cedar Keys port, with the shallow foraging grounds being the most productive (True 1887). Large boats brought between 1,361 and 2,268 kg (3,000 and 5,000 lb) of green turtles to port; whereas, small boats brought in only 23â363 kg (50â800 lb). Interestingly, the largest green turtle recorded at the time weighed an impressive 544 kg (1,200 lb) (True 1887). The reported weight of this turtle was questioned by Carr and Caldwell (1956), who indicated that green turtles landed in the Cedar Keys fisheries in the 1950s were no larger than 52 kg (115 lb). Alternatively, it is possible that the discrepancy reflects the impact of the decades-long turtle fishery in the region, leaving no large adult turtles in the population. Overall, statistics show that the Florida west coast produced about 81,647 kg (180,000 lb), Louisiana about 13,608 kg (30,000 lb), and Texas approximately 24,494 kg (54,000 lb) of green turtle meat in 1880, though apparently an unspecified amount of freshwater turtle meat was also included in these records (True 1887; Rebel 1974). No mention is made of significant sea turtle fisheries for any other Gulf coast state prior to 1880 besides Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. By 1887, the most important sea turtle fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico were those of the Cedar Keys area and around Key West (True 1887; Townsend 1899). Figure 11.3 shows statistics of turtle landings on the Florida Gulf coast between 1880 and 1897 for the years for which data are available (Townsend 1899), and provides a perspective of turtle demand in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico."

Environmental conditions including water temperature, salinity, and turbidityâin conjunction with the life cycles of many of the species that inhabit the Gulfâall contribute to availability. Species availability, in conjunction with those economic conditions that determine whether a trip will be profitable, including the price received for the harvested product and the cost of inputs used in the harvesting process, provide signals to the harvesting units as to whether a trip will be financially viable. This viability along with the multitude of regulations that can also govern fishing patterns influences fishing effort, and ultimately the catch. Considering this, landings of a specific year cannot be descriptive of Gulf fisheries from either a biological or economic viewpoint. For this chapter, the 20-year period from 1990 to 2009 was chosen as inclusive of (1) pre- and post-management agency changes, (2) active tropical storm periods, (3) challenging production cost situations, and (4) high and low points in the national economy. This approach acknowledges that a speciesâ stock level and economic conditions of inputs and demand play roles in landings levels. This perspective conveys a need to avoid reference to beginning-year and end-year comparisons. Rather, a 3-year average was used to depict landings and associated value as the beginning and end focus of comments. There is a distinction between location of landings and location of catch. This is particularly the case for the shrimp fisheries and most finfish. Location of catch is best documented for Gulf shrimp fisheries by offshore zones east to west across the Gulf and by inshore versus offshore. When data are available to differentiate landings from catch, that data is reported in the sections dealing with key species. Data by state are also reported in the key species sections."

34,373,0.533,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Many fish species in the Gulf of Mexico experience inshoreâoffshore movement in response to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., thermal habitat) and/or needs of life-history processes (e.g., spawning). Fish species differ widely in their ability to adapt to changes in the biotic and abiotic environment in the Gulf of Mexico; omnipresent species are the most robust in adapting to changes in habitat. There is large spatiotemporal variability in key life-history parameters (e.g., growth and maturation) for many Gulf of Mexico fish species. Many fish species in the Gulf are often considered a unit fish stock, which implicitly assumes adequate Gulf-wide mixing for fisheries stock assessment and management, even though evidence suggests complex stock structure within the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., existence of meta-population or local populations as a result of spatial isolations). A wide variety of short-term and long-term anthropogenic and natural stressors, such as rapid coastal development, pollution, heavy fishing, climate change, and natural disasters, have reduced the resilience and robustness of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem with respect to human and natural perturbations. Different fish species tend to respond to fishing and changes in habitat in different ways. Some species are more sensitive, and others are more robust with respect to changes in fishing mortality and habitat. High fishing pressure and degraded environment have changed key life-history parameters of important fish species in the Gulf of Mexico, e.g., reduced size at age and earlier maturation, reduced stock reproductive potential, increased temporal fluctuation of recruitment, and impaired ability of fish stocks to recover from low stock abundance."

Satellite tracking studies have indicated that post-nesting female Kempâs ridleys travel along coastal corridors (typically shallower than 50 m [164 ft]) along the rim of the Gulf of Mexico basin, extending from the YucataÌn Peninsula to southern Florida (Byles 1989; Byles and Plotkin 1994; Renaud 1995; Renaud et al. 1996; Shaver 1999, 2001a, b; Morreale et al. 2007). Many of these turtles settled in resident feeding areas for up to several months after migrating, which demonstrated that Kempâs ridley post-nesting migrations could also be considered foraging migrations to fixed destinations (Byles and Plotkin 1994). Between 1997 and 2006, the movements of 28 turtles (17 wild-stock and 11 head-started) that nested on North Padre Island or Mustang Island, Texas, were monitored using satellite telemetry to obtain habitat use and movement information for Kempâs ridleys that nested in south Texas (Shaver and Rubio 2008). Internesting residency was documented off south Texas, and post-nesting residency occurred in Gulf of Mexico waters from south Texas to the southern tip of Florida. After nesting for the season was complete, most of the Kempâs ridleys left south Texas and traveled, parallel to the coastline, to the northern or eastern Gulf of Mexico. This study demonstrated the importance of nearshore Gulf waters to post-nesting Kempâs ridleys, and the results were used to develop a regulation to close nearshore south Texas waters seasonally to shrimp trawling (Shaver and Rubio 2008). The inshore and continental shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico along the upper Texas coast were recently demonstrated to serve as migratory, internesting, and postnesting habitat for adult Kempâs ridleys (Seney and Landry 2008, 2011). Six female Kempâs ridleys were fitted with satellite transmitters after nesting and tracked during 2005 and 2006 (Seney and Landry 2008). In a second investigation, seven adult females (six nesting and one trawl-caught) were fitted with transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast during 2004 through 2007 to characterize their movements, migration patterns, and foraging grounds in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (Seney and Landry 2011). During both tracking studies, the females remained in the Galveston region and in the vicinity of the upper Texas coast during their internesting intervals and moved eastward along the continental shelf (20 m [66 ft] isobath) to offshore foraging areas of central Louisiana upon entering the post-nesting stage (Seney and Landry 2008, 2011). The importance of nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters, specifically off the Louisiana coast, as critical foraging habitat for post-nesting Kempâs ridleys was recently demonstrated by Shaver et al. (2013). Satellite telemetry and switching state-space modeling was used to track 31 turtles after nesting at PAIS and Rancho Nuevo for 13 years from 1998 through 2011. Multiple turtles foraged along their migratory route before arriving at their final foraging sites. Nearshore Gulf of Mexico waters served as foraging habitat for all turtles tracked in the study, and final foraging sites were located in water less than 68 m (223 ft) deep and a mean distance of 33.2 km (20.6 mi) from the nearest mainland coast. The wide distribution of foraging sites indicates that a foraging corridor exists for Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf of Mexico (Shaver et al. 2013). In the spring, mature female Kempâs ridleys undertake annual migrations to the western Gulf of Mexico and gather along the coast of Tamaulipas near the village of Rancho Nuevo to nest on the many kilometers of almost continuous sand beach (Pritchard 2007a, b). Reproductive females begin to arrive offshore Rancho Nuevo in March and April, with most arriving during May and June, and remain in the vicinity through the nesting season (Table 11.1) (Rostal 1991; Seney 2008). About a month before the nesting season begins, females and males aggregate to mate in nearshore waters near the beach at Rancho Nuevo (Pritchard 1969; Mendonca and Pritchard 1986)."

The Atlantic blue marlin is the most tropical of the billfishes and is a blue water fish that spends most of its life in the open sea (Tables 9.18 and 9.19). They rarely aggregate in schools and are usually found as scattered single individuals. Their distributional areas range from about latitude 45 N to about latitude 35 S (Table 9.20). Blue marlin are less abundant in the eastern Atlantic, where they mostly occur off Africa between the latitudes of 25 N and 25 S (NMFS 2009b). The distribution and movement patterns of Atlantic blue marlin within the Gulf of Mexico tend to vary among individuals. Some may spend considerable time within the Gulf of Mexico for feeding and spawning, while others move seasonally between the Gulf of Mexico and tropical areas, such as the Bahamas. A tagging study with pop-up archival transmitting tags in the Gulf of Mexico suggested that most tagged fish remained in the Gulf of Mexico, with some fish exhibiting egress into Belize (Caribbean Sea) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (Kraus et al. 2011)."

For some species, there are estimates of current population sizes, and perhaps trends in populations. From this review, however, it is clear that even for the key indicator species or groups, current data on population sizes for the entire Gulf are usually sparse. No Gulf-wide surveys are taken at the same time using the same methodology. However, even if sufficient surveys of populations for key species were available, this information does not necessarily provide a picture of the health of the system, predict emergent ecosystem problems, or predict future trends. This is especially true for the Gulf of Mexico because of both short-term (storms, hurricanes, tides, pollution, habitat loss, human disturbance) and long-term stressors (habitat loss, subsidence, global climate change, sea level rise). Detailed information about trophic levels, food web interactions, energy flow, and forcing functions are needed to predict emerging ecosystem change (Brown et al. 2006). This information is not available for the Gulf ecosystem, although the chapters in this series begin to bring together some of this information. However, sufficient information is available to support an integrated weight of evidence evaluation of the health of avian populations in the Gulf of Mexico. The available database includes (1) natural history information (age of first breeding, clutch size, incubation period, parental-care period, and life span); (2) status and trends for key indicator species or species groups; (3) effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors on habitat use, and; (4) effects of social interactions (predators, competitors) on habitat use. These factors provide information on whether populations can recover quickly or not. Information on long-term recoveries is available for the species that were devastated during the plume-hunting days of the late 1800s to the early 1900s (herons, egrets, terns), or by exposure to pesticides (Osprey, Brown Pelican), which provides insights into recovery potential. Finally, the long-term sustainability of bird populations in the Gulf is a matter of"

Later, Shane compared her Aransas Pass work with the results of a new study in the 1980s off Sanibel Island, Florida, almost precisely east of her former study area in Texas (Shane 2004). The Wells studies have continued and expanded and spawned several 100 publications resulting in one of the best-known cetacean populations in the world. A summary of the major findings from this set of studies is included in the section devoted to bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf. The first systematic offshore efforts to describe marine mammals in parts of the northern Gulf of Mexico occurred during the Fritts Surveys, 1979â1981 aerial surveys led by T. H. Fritts (Fritts et al. 1983). These surveys established that several dolphins of the genus Stenella occur off continental shelf and slope waters, but these early surveys (originally designed for sea turtle and sea bird assessments) suffered from small cetacean sample size, precluding abundance estimates, and some unfortunate misidentifications. For example, they did not distinguish between the two species of spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata and Stenella frontalis), now known to have quite different distribution patterns in the Gulf; at times the surveys confused spinner and Clymene dolphins (Stenella longirostris and Stenella clymene, respectively), and sometimes they misidentified either Clymene or pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) as short-beaked common dolphins. Common dolphins do not presently occur in the Gulf, nor are there verified historical records. The NMFS conducted a series of aerial surveys in continental and coastal waters (continental shelf aerial surveys, 1983â1986; red drum aerial surveys, 1986â1987) and established some estimates of numbers of the predominantly sighted cetacean, the common bottlenose dolphin. Since 1989, aerial and shipboard surveys have been conducted (albeit not in every year) in both coastal and deeper oceanic U.S. waters, commencing with Keith Mullinâs 1989â1990 continental slope aerial surveys that for the first time properly documented distribution and abundance of oceanic cetaceans in waters off Louisiana and Mississippi (Mullin et al. 1994; Jefferson and Schiro 1997) (Figure 13.2). In the 1990s, NMFS and Texas A&M University coordinated dedicated aerial and boat surveys in concert with descriptions of physical and"

The only other turtle that is larger than the green turtle is the leatherback sea turtle (Witherington et al. 2006b). The green turtle was named for the green cartilage found under its shell (Witzell 1994); other names given to this turtle include edible turtle and soup turtle (Hirth 1997). The green sea turtle has been studied for centuries (Pritchard 2010). They were the first species for which a conservation and research program was established; this occurred in Tortuguero, Costa Rica, in 1955 and was the first of its kind in the world (Carr et al. 1978; Carr 1979). The Tortuguero program, which was started by the Caribbean Conservation Corporation (now known as the Sea Turtle Conservancy), continues today. Much of what is known about the biology of green sea turtles, as well as other sea turtle species, has been learned on the beaches of Tortuguero."

Juvenile Kempâs ridleys in the oceanic zone feed mostly on pelagic invertebrate prey associated with the Sargassum community (Table 11.1). No post-hatchling Kempâs ridleys were collected from the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast from 2005 through 2011 as part of a study to determine the importance of the pelagic Sargassum-dominated drift community to young sea turtles (Witherington et al. 2012). Hatchlings are typically around 4 cm (1.6 in) SCL in size (Table 11.1); the smallest Kempâs ridley collected by Witherington et al. (2012) was 17 cm (6.7 in) SCL. Witherington et al. (2012) sampled only in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from May through September, and post-hatchling Kempâs ridley would most likely occur in the western Gulf of Mexico off the principal nesting beaches. Thirty-eight juvenile Kempâs ridleys, ranging in size from 17 to 28 cm (6.7 to 11 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from 2005 through 2011 (Witherington et al. 2012). These turtles were estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old. Because they were similar in size to the lower size range observed in nearby neritic habitats (Schmid 1998; Witzell and Schmid 2004) and because most of these turtles were not found within currents that would transport them out of the Gulf, they were hypothesized to be on the cusp of recruiting into coastal habitats of the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico. Similar to what was proposed by Collard and Ogren (1990), these data suggest that an important recruitment pulse occurs primarily in the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico, marking the end of the oceanic juvenile stage and the beginning of the neritic juvenile stage and suggests that the open waters of the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico are of unique importance to Kempâs ridley sea turtles (Witherington et al. 2012)."

34,1023,0.508,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Much of the focus in this chapter and by state and federal agencies, scientists and others, deals with birds that concentrate along the coasts. It is far easier to census birds nesting there than it is to study pelagic seabirds. However, many seabirds mainly use the open, pelagic zones of the Gulf of Mexico. Seabirds do not simply migrate over or around the Gulf, but instead use the open waters of the Gulf for wintering and foraging. The Gulf waters also provide foraging habitat for more tropical-nesting species, some of which use the Campeche Banks for breeding (Tunnell and Chapman 2000), such as frigatebirds and boobies, and for North Atlantic-nesting species, such as Northern Gannet (see section below). Of all the birds considered, the distribution and behavior of pelagic species are the most affected by prey availability and oceanic features (Hunt 1990; Schneider 1991; Ribic et al. 1997; Schreiber and Burger 2001a, b; Zuria and Mellink 2005). In the Gulf of Mexico, the Loop Current and eddy systems greatly affect distribution of seabirds in the northern region (Ribic et al. 1997). Prey is not evenly distributed over the open ocean; individual prey patches are often small and interspersed (Hunt and Schneider 1987). Foraging seabirds can search for prey by (1) looking for the presence of feeding birds (plunge-diving) as a signal of prey availability (Simmons 1972; Gotmark et al. 1986; Gochfeld and Burger 1982), (2) looking for other seabirds flying in the same direction, presumably toward a prey patch, (3) watching birds that return to a colony with food (Gaston and Nettleship 1981), (4) searching for particular oceanographic conditions, and (5) returning to known foraging areas. Whether or not to associate with marine mammals is another decision foraging seabirds make (Burger 1988b, c). Foraging with mammals (whales, dolphins) can make prey fish more available and identify large expanses of zooplankton; it can also result in competition or interference foraging (Pierotti 1988a). Marine birds and mammals can interact in at least five ways: (1) birds can have passive associations; (2) birds can be attracted to the same resource; (3) birds can be actively drawn to marine mammals because they drive prey to the surface; (4) birds can be attracted to marine mammals to scavenge on by-products of mammal foraging; and (5) birds can actively avoid marine mammals that might prey on them; for example, Orcas eat diving birds (Pierotti 1988b). Seabirds often forage over schools of prey fish that have been forced to the surface by predatory fish, such as bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) or tuna (Safina and Burger 1985, 1988;"

A number of non-Passerine species (N Â¼ 93) occurred in all 12 sectors of the Gulf of Mexico (Table 12.4). Only the non-Passerines are listed because they are more typical of the species that inhabit the coastal and marine areas. The non-Passerines that are distributed throughout the Gulf include ducks, grebes, loons, boobies, pelicans, herons, egrets, ibises, spoonbills, storks, rails, shorebirds, gulls, terns, skimmers, and a kingfisher. As might be expected, shorebirds (N Â¼ 31 species), ducks (N Â¼ 10 species), herons and egrets (N Â¼ 10), and gulls and terns (N Â¼ 13) are the most diverse groups. Scientific names in Table 12.4 are not repeated in the text that follows this section. While the non-Passerines are normally considered the key avian component of the Gulf, Passerines are important because millions migrate around or over the Gulf each spring and fall, and others reside in the coastal environment (e.g., Seaside Sparrows, Moore 2000b). Although Gallardo et al. (2009) lists Passerine species found throughout the Gulf, their list is necessarily incomplete because the marsh, shrub, and forest habitats are continuous landward, and it is difficult to draw a suitable line for which species to include. Moreover, the distribution of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants along the southern Gulf of Mexico may be less well known than the distribution along the northern Gulf coast.

231,172,0.502,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"There are over 200 species of ï¬sh in the North Sea and their total annual productivity has been estimated at 1.8 g C mâ2 (Daan et al. 1990). Cushing (1984) reported a large increase in the abundance of gadoids such as whiting Merlangius merlangus, haddock Melanogrammus aegleï¬nus, cod Gadus morhua and Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii accompanied by a decrease in herring Clupea harengus in the 1960s, commonly referred to as the âgadoid outburstâ. Overall, demersal ï¬sh and their size composition have declined in the North Sea since the start of the 20th century (Pope and Macer 1996). The commercial ï¬shery was heavily exploited in the 1960s, when landings peaked and then declined following a ban on herring in 1977 from a change in EU ï¬sheries policy. The ï¬shery reopened in 1981 and landings increased until 1988 followed by a record low in the 1990s. Of the roughly 10 million t of ï¬sh and shellï¬sh biomass produced each year in the North Sea, around 25 % is removed by the ï¬shery, 50 % is consumed by predatory ï¬sh species, and the rest is consumed by birds and mammals or lost to disease (Daan et al. 1990). About 2.3 million t of ï¬sh and shellï¬sh were landed in the North Sea in 1999 (FAO 2003). Fish catches over the past 60 years seem strongly related to levels of primary production (Chassot et al. 2010). Pelagic species such as herring and mackerel are the most important in landings, as well as smaller species such as sardines, and anchovy. Demersal landings include cod, haddock, whiting, saithe Pollachius virens, plaice and sole. Detailed statistics of ï¬sh landings are available from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES 2008; FAO Annual reports; see also Chaps. 8 and 12). The sedimentary environment of the North Sea contains up to 5000 species of macrobenthic and meiobenthic invertebrates (Heip and Craeymeersch 1995). Total macrobenthic biomass decreases northward from 51.5Â°N while biodiversity and density increase (Heip et al. 1992). Rehm and Rachor (2007) also showed benthic biomass to decrease with distance from the coast. According to Heip and Craeymeersch (1995), northern species of the macrobenthic community extend southward to the northern slope of Dogger Bank and southern species extend northward to the 100 m depth contour. They also found the separation between northern and southern species to disappear at around the 70 m depth contour in the central North Sea."

In 2010 and 2011, 683 and 970 nests, respectively, were recorded for northern Gulf of Mexico loggerheads, and a high of 1,750 nests was recorded in 2012 (FFWCC FWRI 2012; Share the Beach 2013). The Dry Tortugas subpopulation is the smallest loggerhead subpopulation of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (Figure 11.17) (TEWG 2009). This subpopulation is important not only for its genetic distinctiveness but also because it is isolated from many of the threats facing most sea turtle nesting areas (van Houtan and Pimm 2007). Loggerhead nesting activity is unevenly distributed among the seven islands within Dry Tortugas National Park (DTNP). About 90 % of loggerhead nests are laid on East Key and Loggerhead Key each year; the remaining 10 % of nesting activity occurs on Bush Key, Hospital Key, and Garden Key, and virtually no nesting occurs on Long Key and Middle Key (van Houtan and Pimm 2007). Annual nest counts for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation of loggerheads from 1995 through 2001 consistently exceeded 200 (about 40 nesting females) with a high of 340 nests recorded in 1995 (Figure 11.20). About 200 nests were also recorded for the Dry Tortugas in 2003 and 2009. A longer time series of nesting data for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation is necessary in order to detect a trend (NMFS and USFWS 2008). The majority of nesting for the Greater Caribbean subpopulation of loggerhead sea turtles occurs in Quintana Roo, Mexico. The loggerhead nesting aggregation in Quintana Roo is the third largest in the western north Atlantic (Figure 11.17) (Ehrhart et al. 2003; TEWG 2009).

Over the period 1985 to 2006, species richness increased from around 60 species to almost 90 and the increase is positively related to the increase in sea-bottom temperature (SBT) during that quarter, which rose by an average of 0.7 Â°C decadeâ1 (Fig. 8.7). The increase in species richness is consistent with both the earlier observation that rate of advance of leading edges of distributions is more rapid than the retreat of trailing edges and with the generally higher species richness of warmer areas. The apparent persistence of cool-temperate species during the Mesolithic warm period suggests that the effect is not just a transient one.

These species range from reef-dependent snappers and groupers, to highly migratory tuna and billfish, to coastal pelagic menhaden and mackerel, and coastal demersal drums and jacks (Hoese and Moore 1998; McEachran and Fechhelm 2005). They differ greatly in their ecological roles, life histories, habitat needs, and contributions to commercial and recreational fisheries. As described earlier, 13 representative species have been selected from ten families for evaluation in this chapter: red snapper; menhaden, including Gulf menhaden, finescale menhaden, and yellowfin menhaden; red grouper; Atlantic bluefin tuna; Atlantic blue marlin; Atlantic swordfish; Atlantic sailfish; red drum; tilefish; king mackerel; dolphinfish; striped mullet, and greater amberjack (Table 9.3). Because of their ecological and fisheries significance in the Gulf of Mexico, snapper and grouper species were also evaluated as families for their distribution, life history, fisheries, and habitat needs."
34,146,0.477,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","All menhaden species are estuarine-dependent and marine migratory species (Anderson and McDonald 2007). In general, spawning usually takes places in the offshore marine environment during winter (Table 9.9) (Gunter 1945; Simmons 1957; Dahlberg 1970; Houde and Swanson 1975). Egg hatch and early growth of larvae usually occur when currents from offshore spawning grounds transport them to low-salinity estuary nursery grounds (Minello and Webb 1997). This process usually takes 1â2 months. The transported larvae enter estuarine bays, sounds, and streams and metamorphose into juveniles. Menhaden juveniles inhabit estuarine areas until the following fall or early winter, when they migrate offshore (Table 9.10). Adults are usually distributed in large schools in nearshore oceanic waters and large estuarine systems. Because the Gulf menhaden has a similar life-history process and is much more abundant and widely distributed than the other two menhaden species, the following discussion is focused on Gulf menhaden. The spawning season estimated for the Gulf menhaden differs among studies, varying from December through February and October through March (Table 9.9) (Suttkus 1956; Combs 1969; Christmas and Waller 1975; Shaw et al. 1985a, b). This might reflect impacts of environmental conditions, which vary from year to year (SEDAR 27 2011). Gulf menhaden are multiple and intermittent spawners with ova being released in batches over a protracted spawning season (Combs 1969; Lewis and Roithmayer 1981). Spawning can occur from nearshore to 60 miles offshore along the entire U.S. Gulf coast (Table 9.9) (Christmas and Waller 1975).

The netting surveys were conducted primarily at Sabine Pass, Texas, and at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, as well as secondarily near the Mermentau River, Louisiana, from April through October 1993 through 2002. During the 10-year study, 600 Kempâs ridleys were captured, ranging in size from 19.5 to 66.3 cm (7.7 to 26.1 in) SCL; all annual mean size values were between 30 and 40 cm (11.8 and 15.7 in) SCL. Of all Kempâs ridleys captured during the study, 77 % were between 20 and 40 cm (7.9 and 15.7 in) SCL, about 20 % were between 40 and 60 cm (15.7 and 23.6 in) SCL, and 2 % were larger than 60 cm (23.6 in) SCL (Metz 2004). The size of Kempâs ridleys at Sabine Pass ranged from 19.5 to 64 cm (7.7 to 25.2 in) SCL, and no turtles larger than 55 cm (21.7 in) SCL were captured after 1998. Turtles captured at Calcasieu Pass were significantly larger and ranged in size between 22.4 and 66.3 cm (8.8 and 26.1 in) SCL. Most likely in response to rising water temperatures and seasonal occurrence of blue crab prey, the overall monthly Kempâs ridley catch per unit effort (CPUE) peaked from April through June during the 10-year study in northwestern Gulf of Mexico nearshore waters (Metz 2004). The annual mean ridley CPUE across all study areas peaked in 1994, 1997, 1999, and 2002, which suggested a 2- to 3-year cycle in abundance that could be related to temporal patterns in clutch size or hatch success at the Rancho Nuevo nesting beach resulting from variability in nesting female fecundity and the remigration interval (Metz 2004). However, there was no significant relationship between Kempâs ridley CPUE in nearshore Texas and Louisiana waters and the number of hatchlings leaving the nesting beaches at Rancho Nuevo. In fact, juvenile ridley CPUE remained relatively constant or decreased slightly, even as the number of hatchlings released from Rancho Nuevo increased exponentially. Assuming that post-hatchling mortality rates did not increase during the study period, juvenile Kempâs ridleys may have been recruiting to coastal locations outside of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico study areas (Metz 2004). The annual declines in strandings in Texas since 1994, along with the subsequent increases in Florida strandings since 1995, suggested that a shift in Kempâs ridley distribution from the western to the eastern Gulf of Mexico may have occurred in the mid-1990s, which could have been related to fluctuations in circulation patterns. Significant declines in turtle CPUE at Sabine Pass since 1997 coincided with a concurrent reduction in blue crab size; however, a similar trend was not seen at Calcasieu Pass. When evaluating various biological and abiotic factors, nesting dynamics and prey availability appeared to have had the most influence on the nearshore occurrence of Kempâs ridleys (Metz 2004). Hook-and-line captures data, stranding and nesting records, satellite telemetry, and diet analyses were used to characterize Kempâs ridley population dynamics and movements along the Texas coast from 2003 through 2007 (Seney 2008). The results of the analyses confirmed that Kempâs ridleys use the upper Texas coast and northwestern Gulf of Mexico throughout their life and that the region was used seasonally as developmental and nesting habitat, as well as a migration and foraging corridor. Recreational hook-and-line captures, which did not include oceanic juveniles or adults, made up about one-third of non-nesting encounters along the coasts of Galveston and Jefferson counties in Texas. Juveniles demonstrated a preference for habitat type or benthic prey concentrations, rather than specific locations, in the northwestern Gulf and were found in nearshore waters along the upper Texas coast primarily during the warmer months (March through October). They also entered inshore areas, such as bays and coastal lakes, along the Texas and Louisiana coasts (Seney 2008). Adult females that nested along the upper Texas coast occupied the region during the nesting season (April through July). Juvenile and internesting adults occurred in relatively shallow Texas state waters, and postnesting females subsequently migrated through deeper, federal waters (Seney 2008)."
241,1116,0.476,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"19.2.3 Open-Sea Benthic Communities The benthic community of the open Baltic Sea is a mix of species with marine, brackish water and limnic origins. Their latitudinal distribution and species diversity are limited by the gradient of decreasing salinity towards the north (Elmgren 1989; Rumohr et al. 1996; Bonsdorff and Pearson 1999). Spatial studies of species turnover (Î²-diversity), in the transition zone between the North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat and the Belt Sea (Josefson 2009) and along the salinity gradients of the Baltic Sea (Laine et al. 1997; Bleich et al. 2011; VillnÃ¤s and Norkko 2011), all demonstrate the key role of salinity in the distribution of macrobenthic animals. The distribution of benthic species is also driven by strong vertical gradients: shallow-water soft bottom communities have higher habitat diversity and thus more species than the sub-halocline communities (e.g. Andersin et al. 1978)."

231,431,0.473,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The Wadden Sea, fringing the coast of the south-eastern North Sea, is the largest coherent tidal flat system of the temperate world. Its outstanding geological and biological importance makes it a world nature heritage site (Reise et al. 2010). The Wadden Sea is the result of the intricate interplay of tidal forces, sediment supply and moderate sea-level rise (Reise 2013). Since its beginning some 8000 years ago, the Wadden Sea has been increasingly affected by humans (Lotze et al. 2005). Around 1000 years ago, coastal people started to transform the coast, ultimately embanking about half of the original Wadden Sea (Reise 2005). Owing to this coastal squeeze, hydrodynamic forces increased leading to a loss of ï¬ne material (Flemming and Nyandwi 1994). Accelerated sea-level rise may also have contributed to increased hydrodynamics and a loss of mudflats (Dolch and Hass 2008). Also, the estuaries intersecting the Wadden Sea have dramatically changed due to diking and dredging (Reise 2005). The Wadden Sea receives large amounts of riverine fresh water, either directly as (branches of) rivers debouch into it (e.g. IJsselmeer, Ems, Weser, Elbe, Eider, Varde A) or indirectly (especially from the Rhine and Maas). River water from the Rhine and Maas is transported to the Wadden Sea along with residual North Sea currents flowing predominantly anti-clockwise around the North Sea. Thus, nutrient and contaminant loads can be imported into the Wadden Sea and large amounts may be present. Given this background, three interacting aspects of environmental quality are addressed in this section: SPM, nutrients and contaminants."

Variations in the strength of the Gulf Stream cause variations in the âtiltâ of the ocean surface, and thus the height at the coast. A strong Gulf Stream tilts the surface away from the coast, and some estimates predict a slowing of the Gulf Stream. The slowing would result in enhanced sea level rise along the coast. There are systematic variations of sea level in Norfolk associated with internal modes of variability in the atmosphere, for example, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Sea-level rise sits in context with internal variability and other causes of relative sea-level change, which is typical of many applications. Partly because the increase in flooding is widely obvious and interferes with commerce and day-to-day life, sea-level rise has received much attention in what is generally a politically conservative region. Residents, businesses, cities, and the military are all active in developing sea-level-rise policy and plans. Local universities have performed research quantifying the different causes of sea-level rise and contributing to communication of what has happened, framing vulnerability, and what is likely to happen. Many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with different focuses represent particular interests ranging from conservation to social justice. In the mid-2000s, the need to address sea-level rise and climate change became so apparent that a regional focus started to emerge, with the local Intergovernmental Pilot Project being formalized in 2014.9 This organization strives to coordinate the sea-level-rise preparedness and resilience planning of federal, state, and local government agencies and the private sector and take into account the perspectives of the regionâs citizens. Though sea-level rise projections are often viewed as highly uncertain, the convergence of observations, peopleâs perception of vulnerability, effective communication, and concern for the viability of the region stand as motivation to take action. With planning periods focused on the next few decades, building standards, zoning, and codes are being modiï¬ed. There is recognition that at the end of this planning horizon, sea-level rise will not be stable, but likely to be increasing. Therefore, sustained, future-looking planning and design will be required. Climate model results provide a range of estimates of possible future states to inform this process (though they may be uncertain; see Chap. 11). However, climate change effects on sea-level rise are only one part of the planning process (see Chap. 12)."
34,1430,0.471,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","14.5.2 Birds Birds need to adopt a strategy optimizing the use of energy for activities like reproduction and host defense. This strategy requires a âtrade offâ of physiological choices for both the host and pathogenic agents to maintain genetic fitness. For example, during one season or one year, a bird or group of birds may be in poor nutritional health and therefore have to direct all resources to staying alive with little or no ability to mount a defense against parasites or to grow or to reproduce. During another time of year, this same bird may have enough resources to effectively resist parasites, grow, and reproduce (Wobeser 2008). An example of a heavy infection of helminths in a group of 45 lesser scaup ducks comprised almost one million individuals, including 52 different species (Bush and Holmes 1986). Each helminth species has a life cycle with multiple hosts, making infections problematic to fully understand without knowing the complete cycle. Additionally, chicks may become infected with numerous large adult nematodes from regurgitation by parent birds. Fagerholm et al. (1996) suggest this based on observations of patent specimens of Contracaecum magnipapillatum in adults, chicks, and dead chicks in the breeding habitat of the black noddy (Anous minutus). Interactions among two or more species might be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic, resulting in host mortalities, and little is known about these or even effects of high numbers of single species in wild birds. Even though studies have focused on a few dead birds killed by parasites (see Atkinson et al. 2008), rarely do parasitic infections result in âpiles of dead birdsâ because highly pathogenic ones tend not to impact a host population, since rapid mortalities would limit transmission to others. Populations are more detrimentally affected by the sublethal effects of chronic infections mediating reduced fecundity (Hudson and Dobson 1997b). One should also expect true seabirds, those that derive all food from the sea, defecate in the sea, and die at sea, to suffer less than coastal birds from microbial, protozoan, and probably helminth agents (Lauckner 1985). Table 14.4 lists avian mortalities in the Gulf from 1999 to 2010, and most cases result from bacterial, fungal, and viral infections as well as toxicants. The book edited by Thomas et al. (2007) explains the agents in detail. Tropical Storm Arlene moved through the Gulf into Breton National Wildlife Refuge in June 2005 at a time when birds were vulnerable as reflected in the table. Vargo et al. (2006) summarized beached bird surveys in Pinellas County, Florida, mostly reporting mortality resulting from brevetoxin. The harmful effects of red tides on birds were discussed earlier, including an informative report by Forrester et al. (1977)."

The eggs of Gulf menhaden are planktonic and drift with prevailing currents for almost 48 h before hatching. Early larvae also drift with the current and feed on phytoplankton. Currents transport Gulf menhaden larvae into low-salinity estuaries for early growth (Minello and Webb 1997). This transportation from spawning grounds to estuarine nursery grounds is critical for the survival of Gulf menhaden larvae. As they grow larger and become able to swim, they shift their diet to zooplankton. After developing gill rakers, they filter-feed on plankton, typically near the surface. In fresh and brackish estuaries and rivers, they grow rapidly in spring and summer, and by fall, they migrate to high-salinity offshore waters no deeper than 100 m (328 ft). No eastâwest component of annual migration was found for Gulf menhaden in tagging studies (Kroger and Pristas 1975; Pristas et al. 1976); however, Gulf menhaden from the eastern and western extremes of their ranges tend to move toward the center of their range with age (Ahrenholz 1991)."
241,559,0.469,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Because of its elongated shape, semi-enclosed conï¬guration and presence of shallow bays exposed to the direction of strong winds, storm surges occur frequently on exposed coasts of the Baltic Sea. In contrast to tide-dominated basins, extreme sea levels in the Baltic Sea are mainly due to wind (wind set-up). Other contributors include the inverse barometer effect, standing waves (seiches) and the propagation or ampliï¬cation of remotely generated long waves. Winds affect sea level in two main ways (e.g. Samuelsson and Stigebrandt 1996; Ekman 2007). First, wind may build up a sea level slope within the Baltic Sea, resulting in the strongest deviations at the âendsâ of the Baltic Sea (in the Belt Sea and the gulfs of Finland, Bothnia and Riga). Second, when a strong persistent wind from the south-west or north-east is blowing over the Baltic Sea and its entrance, water is transported into or out of the Baltic Sea, thereby raising or lowering sea level in the basin as a whole. Although the amplitude of such events is normally less than 50 cm, they can provide preconditions for much larger localscale storm surges when combined with short-term storm winds during cyclones (Hupfer et al. 2003). All over the sea, both extreme high and low sea level events tend to occur in the meteorologically more variable winter months (e.g. Sztobryn et al. 2009; Suursaar 2011). Owing to the large meridional extent of the Baltic Sea, the required forcing conditions, as well as storm surge risks, may vary strongly in different parts of the basin. As a general rule, in the eastern section near the coasts of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Russia and Finland, strong easterly winds tend to lower sea level, and westerly winds to raise it (Suursaar et al. 2002, 2006a). This applies for short-time variations, as well as for low-frequency variations through the corresponding changes in the Baltic Sea sea water volume. The lowest recorded sea level in the Gulf of Riga (â130 cm at Riga, â125 at PÃ¤rnu) occurred in December 1959 after a month"
34,343,0.468,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","The Atlantic sharpnose shark is mainly distributed in waters from the Bay of Fundy to the Straits of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 13 2007). Even though no genetic differences were found (Heist et al. 1996), based on tagging and life-history studies, a two-stock hypothesis has been proposed: an Atlantic stock distributed from North Carolina to the Straits of Florida and a Gulf of Mexico stock from the Florida Keys throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Little mixing was found in tagging studies between these two stocks (SEDAR 13 2007), suggesting that the two stocks are rather independent. However, large differences have been observed in the life histories between samples collected from the two areas, which might have resulted from differences in the sampling times, locations, and habitats. Most catch of this species is from the Florida east coast, and a single working stock was assumed for the assessment (SEDAR 13 2007). The Atlantic sharpnose shark is the most common shark in the northern Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 13 2007). They tend to engage in seasonal inshoreâoffshore movement, leaving the coast in October and November for warmer offshore waters and returning in March and April. Most adult females tend to be found just offshore in deepwaters. It appears that there is sex and size segregation in the distribution of the population in the Gulf of Mexico (Parsons 2006). Young-of-the-year, juvenile, and adult Atlantic sharpnose sharks prefer sandy and seagrass bottoms, but also can be found on muddy grounds (Bethea et al. 2009). The shallow waters in the extensive barrier islands of the northern Gulf of Mexico are important Atlantic sharpnose shark pupping and nursery grounds. Age and growth of the Atlantic sharpnose shark in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico have been based on vertebral age analysis (Parsons 1983; Branstetter 1987; Carlson and Baremore 2003). The Atlantic sharpnose shark has a maximum length of about 107 cm (42.1 in.) and a maximum age of 11 years (Loefer and Sedberry 2003). Tagging studies, however, suggest that the maximum age should be 12 years. Nearly all females and males become sexually mature at the age of 2.5 years in the Gulf of Mexico and at age 3.5 in the South Atlantic. Peak mating activity occurs in June and July, and the gestation period is 10â12 months. Reproductive periodicity is annual for both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Fecundity is 4.1 pups per year, with pupping occurring in June. The annual survival rate is about 0.7 for age-1 sharks and slightly higher (around 0.75) for adults (SEDAR 13 2007)."
34,1047,0.466,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","12.7 DISCUSSION 12.7.1 Management While this chapter does not address management specifically, management actions are discussed throughout as one of the factors affecting birds in the Gulf of Mexico. Management, however, is a complex mix of actions (dredging, hydrological control, diking, wetlands for aquaculture) aimed at improving the coastal environment for people, actions to improve ecosystem structure and function (e.g., terracing), and actions to aid particular species groups (burning for waterfowl habitat). There are management programs to restore large ecosystems in place as part of the larger Gulf of Mexico system. For example, a massive federal and state effort to restore the Everglades ecosystem features many of the prominent Gulf of Mexico species, such as White Ibis, Roseate Spoonbill, and other colonial-nesting species (Ogden et al. 2003, 2005; Frederick and Collopy 1989; Gawlik 2006). Managing for birds is difficult because it often involves trade-offs whereby a given action is positive for one species, but negative for another. Several examples have been provided in this chapter: (1) differences in salinity (affected by water control) favor some marsh species over others; (2) vegetation removal is positive for bare-sand nesting species, but not for those requiring some sparse or dense vegetation; and (3) large expanses of bare sand may encourage larger terns to nest, forcing smaller terns (e.g., Least Tern) out of otherwise optimal habitat. Many agencies and organizations are devoted to protection and conservation of birds in general, and of coastal waterbirds in particular (e.g., SE U.S. Regional Waterbird Conservation Plan, Hunter et al. 2006; U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan, USFWS 2004; U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan for Lower Mississippi/Western Gulf Coast, GCPWG 2000). There are plans for particular species, such as the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Recovery Plans and 5-year reviews for the Piping Plover (USFWS 1999, 2003, 2009b), and the Whooping Crane Recovery Program (USFWS 1986, 2012c). Canadian provinces also produce plans for species of concern, such as the Piping Plover (White and McMaster 2005). Status reports have been developed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for groups of birds, such as seabirds (Fritts and Reynolds 1981; Fritts et al. 1983), waterfowl (USFWS 2011), and waterbirds (Anderson et al. 1996). There are also status reports for individual species, such as Red Knot (Niles et al. 2008), American Oystercatcher (Clay et al. 2010), and Black Skimmer"
34,348,0.466,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","9.4.4 Large Coastal Sharks Group Currently, the Large Coastal Sharks group consists of 11 shark species that are widely distributed throughout the world (SEDAR 29 2012). In the western Atlantic Ocean, they can be found from along the U.S. Atlantic coast all the way to the south of Brazil. All of the Large Coastal Sharks can be found in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). They are considered either as part of the South Atlantic stock or as an independent stock in the assessment and management. Most species of Large Coastal Sharks use the inshore shallow waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico as their spawning and nursery grounds. They tend to move into the inshore shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico during the spring to give birth to their offspring. The inshore shallow waters provide refuges for their newborn offspring from potential predators (usually large sharks). The young sharks spend summers in the inshore waters for feeding. The preferred bottoms range from sand to mud to seagrass. Young-of-the-year sharks tend to occur more frequently in shallower water with higher temperatures, lower salinities, and more turbid conditions compared to the habitats for juveniles and adults. Small and young sharks may select these habitats as a refuge from larger and more active predators (Bethea et al. 2009). Most sharks move into warmer offshore waters in the fall. Compared to species of Small Coastal Sharks, most of the Large Coastal Sharks tend to become sexually mature at a later age. The Large Coastal Sharks group supports several important commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). Although most species are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, most stock abundances have been reduced over time. The catch quota for the Large Coastal Sharks stocks has been reduced continuously over time since the 1990s but has become relatively stable since the mid-2000s (Figure 9.75), perhaps reflecting a stabilized Large Coastal Sharks group. Sandbar and blacktip sharks are two of the most abundant and most commercially and recreationally important shark species in the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 29 2012). They both belong to the Large Coastal Sharks group and are widely distributed in the Gulf of Mexico. As top predators that are abundant in Gulf of Mexico coastal ecosystems, sandbar and blacktip sharks play an important role in regulating the ecosystem dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico; therefore, they were selected as representative species for evaluation."

These birds may be moving their wintering ranges farther north with global warming (Niven et al. 2009). Several species with winter ranges south of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast also declined (Eared Grebe [Podiceps nigricollis], Wilsonâs Plover, Long-billed Curlew, Western Sandpiper, Red Knot, Black Skimmer and American Bittern [Botaurus lentiginosus]). Remarkably, these were mainly shorebirds, reflecting a general decline in shorebirds worldwide (Withers 2002; Morrison et al. 2006). Surprisingly, Canada Geese showed the greatest decline. While a 2 % per year increase or decline may not seem significant in terms of overall population dynamics, it is when an average of 2 % per year change for 40 years. Second, although there are methodological and interpretational difficulties with Christmas Bird Count data, the results are both consistent and robust over a long period of time. And finally, the changes make sense in terms of possible effects of global warming, and threats to birds that use coastal beaches (habitat losses, erosion, human disturbance, pets, and pollution)."

Given the susceptibility of many of the species to overfishing in conjunction with their popularity by the commercial and recreational sectors, the GMFMC is considerably involved in the management of reef fish species. Management of reef fish species with respect to the commercial sector has historically included sector quotas, size and trip limits, closed seasons, limited entry, and, more recently, the introduction of catch shares (previously called individual fishing quotas). The introduction of catch shares, as discussed in more detail below, constitutes a major shift in management regime and one that is likely to become more prevalent over time. Following the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan (GMFMC 1981) and related amendments, Gulf of Mexico reef fish can be broadly classified into six groups: snappers, groupers, tilefish, jacks, amberjacks, and triggerfish.

Menhaden, brown shrimp, white shrimp, oysters, and blue crab combined accounted for 94 % of landings in the 2007â2009 period. NOAA Fisheries in its annual publication Fisheries Economics of the United States identifies Gulf key species additionally as crawfish, groupers, red snapper, mullets, stone crab, and tunas. The focus of this chapter being the northern Gulf (i.e., Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) means there was no need to include crawfish and stone crab claws. The former is a freshwater species of wild and aquaculture origins found in Louisiana. The latter is overwhelmingly a Florida fishery. Like stone crab, the vast majority of Gulf striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) catch is Florida based; representing over 70 % of the Gulf total. Alabama and Louisiana basically account for the remainder with Alabama the larger. Total Gulf landings averaged ten million pounds of striped mullets in the most recent period. This was down from the initial 1990â1992 period average of 26 million pounds. Dockside value fell from the initial periodâs level of $26.4 million to $5.7 million. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) landings in the Gulf for 2007â2009 increased to 35 % of the United States. The increase did not result from increased landings compared to elsewhere in the country. Rather, Gulf landings decreased (69 %) but landings other than the Gulf fell 78 %. Prices were favorable during 1990â2009 by almost doubling nationally. Gulf yellowfin prices followed the increase by the lesser amount of 50 %. The distribution of Gulf landings was very narrow. Louisiana received 77 % of the catch in 2007â2009, which represents an increase from the 46 % share in 1990â1992. The harvest of red snapper and grouper are subject to increasingly constraining catch regulations of the GMFMC and cooperating states. Management of commercial effort by seasonal, gear, area protections and quotas with share assignment has the near-term effect of constraining catch. Additionally, these key species have been highly prized by anglers throughout the Gulf. Commercial red snapper average landings were essentially unchanged on the basis of an initial-period versus end-period measure at 2.6 million pounds. The 1995â2006 period average was 4.5 million pounds. Location of landings changed among the states between initial and end periods. Northern Gulf states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi experienced a 50 % decrease. Texas and Florida west coast benefitted with the 1990â1992 average of 1.2 million pounds, increasing to 1.9 million pounds by 2007â2009. Gag (Mycteroperca microlepis), red (Epinephelus morio), and warsaw grouper (Epinephelus nigritus) landings have consistently been attributable to Florida west coast ports. Thus, there are landings of some groupers in the northern Gulf, but these cannot be considered important compared to previously reviewed species."

The local BSI includes all four regimes and thus better describes sea-level pressure variability over the Baltic Sea rather than the NAO alone. Changes in the general wind conditions over the Baltic Sea lead to changes in upwelling. In a statistical study of upwelling based on satellite data for the period 1990â2009, Lehmann et al. (2012) analysed location and upwelling frequencies along the Baltic Sea coast during the thermally stratiï¬ed period of the year. The most frequent upwelling occurred along the Swedish east coast (up to 40 % of the time) and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Finland (15â20 %). Generally, there was a positive trend in upwelling frequency along the Swedish coast of the Baltic Sea and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Finland and a negative trend along the Polish, Latvian and Estonian coasts (Fig. 7.7). This is in line with the warming trend of annual mean SST derived from infrared satellite images (1990â2008) presented by Lehmann et al. (2011). The smallest trends occurred along the east coast of Sweden 0.3â0.5 Â°C per decade compared to 0.5â0.9 Â°C per decade in the central part of the Baltic Proper. The authors suggested that the decrease in the warming trend along the coast was due to increased upwelling connected with a shift in the dominant wind directions. The trend analysis of favourable wind conditions derived from wind station data for May to September over the period 1990â2009 supports this (Lehmann et al. 2012). There is a positive trend of south-westerly and westerly wind conditions along the Swedish coast and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Finland and a corresponding negative trend of north-easterly and easterly winds along the east coast of the Baltic Proper, the Estonian coast of the Gulf of Finland and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. September contributes most to this trend, whereas in June and August a partial reverse of the trends occurs (see also Chap. 4, Sect. 4.3).

Dinospores swarmed toward and attached to the skin, actively feeding on and denuding fish of their epidermis and killing them by micropredation (Vogelbein et al. 2002). Some dinoflagellates produce a toxin harmful and even deadly to humans and marine mammals, but not recognized as causing fish kills. One of these toxins is saxitoxin (STX) puffer fish poisoning, which can also on occasion include paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The signs of eating toxins accumulated in puffers progress from tingling and numbness of the mouth, lips, tongue, face, and fingers; to paralysis of extremities, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia; to decreasing breathing and possibly to death by asphyxiation. The toxin occurs in the Gulf of Mexico as determined by Landsberg et al. (2006) and Deeds et al. (2008). The toxins can be produced by Pyrodinium by means of the shellfish, Alexandrium cohorticula, A. minutum, A. ostenfeldii, Gymnodinium catenatum, and some freshwater cyanobacteria, all of which occur in the Gulf of Mexico, but verified cases caused by the toxins in the GoM come from the bioluminescent Pyrodinium bahamense. Within all puffer species, they are stored in the skin, muscle, and viscera with an emphasis on ovary, making those structures a risk for human consumption. The toxin in the southern puffer (Sphoeroides nephelus) from the Gulf side of Florida is much less in quantity than in fish from the Atlantic side, where it can remain not depurated for over a year. However, one should realize that toxin produced by one strain of a species often does not represent that production for the species. For example, the toxin for PSP produced by 17 strains of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense had a wide range in the amount based on mouse bioassays. Furthermore, 15 sub-strains taken from one of those strains also had a considerable range in the amount, and that toxin from two different strains differed in the derivatives produced (see Thessen et al. 2009). The golden alga Prymnesium parvum occurs worldwide, but it is best known from inland waters of Texas and estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. Under certain environmental stresses, it produces massive fish kills, including kills of mussels and clams. Even though the alga has been identified from many locations, it often does not cause mortalities. Allelopathy has been shown to be one reason. That is a biological phenomenon by which an organism, in this case a concurrent cyanobacteria (a prokaryotic phytoplankton that has bacteria-like cellular features such as lacking a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles), produces one or more substances that influence the growth, survival, or reproduction of another organism. James et al. (2011) showed that one substance, the cyanotoxin microcystin-LR, inhibited growth of P. parvum, but the necessary concentration could also kill a number of other aquatic organisms. Another non-dinoflagellate alga that attracts attention is a complex of diatoms responsible for âamnesic shellfish poisoningâ (ASP). Most diatoms constitute highly proactive phytoplankton in estuaries, supporting both planktonic and benthic food webs, but the colonial Pseudonitzschia spp. produce a domoic acid toxin (DA) that causes ASP. The toxin accumulates in bivalves, but ASP is most common along the Pacific Coast in upwelling systems where seabirds and marine mammals die from it, and, consequently, marine resource management agencies both along the Pacific Coast and the GoM close shellfish beds when DA levels are high because ASP causes loss of memory in humans. Diatoms in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia occur frequently in the northern Gulf in offshore and estuarine plankton, on sediments, and in both shellfish tissues and seawater in Mississippi Sound as well as in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas (Dortch et al. 1997; Macintyre et al. 2011). Although not all species of this genus are toxic, and no case of human ASP has been reported from the GoM, when counts of the diatom and concentrations of DA in oyster tissue exceed federal guidelines, oyster reefs are temporarily closed. However, because DA occurs in GoM shellfishes, because it is produced by several species in the genus, and because it imposes a major human threat, it is presently being investigated in some detail. Even though the disease is"
34,1043,0.456,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","edited books deal with neotropical migrants, including DeGraaf and Rappole (1995), Kerlinger (1995), Rappole (1995), Able (1999), Moore (2000b). Greenberg and Marra (2005), and further, Jahn et al. (2004) provide a system-wide approach to new world migration that is particularly applicable to the Gulf. Migrants have three choices for flying between North America and Central/South America: (1) a circum-Gulf route through eastern Mexico and Texas, (2) a trans-Gulf route to the YucataÌn Peninsula and the Mexican coast, and (3) a circum-Gulf route through Florida and West Indies (Stevenson 1957; Langin et al. 2009). Since migration takes place over a relatively small time scale, but a large spatial scale, different factors affect migration patterns. On a small spatial scale, habitat (amount and quality, prey availability) is critical, while on a broader scale, weather and winds become critical (Moore 2000a). Wind patterns are generally favorable for birds to migrate across the Gulf in the spring, usually determined by studies with radar (Gauthreaux 1971, 1999; Gauthreaux et al. 2006). Migration patterns are not static, but shift from year to year and season to season, depending upon prevailing winds (Barrow et al. 2005). Analyzing data from 10 radar stations from Key West, Florida to Brownsville, Texas, Gauthreaux et al. (2006) showed that in the spring: (1) northbound migrants approached the northern Gulf Coast at between 1,000 and 2,500 m above ground; (2) the longitudes of peak arrivals were similar over the 4-year period (near longitude 75 west, northern Texas/western Louisiana); (3) wind trajectories over the Gulf of Mexico had relatively little influence on the longitude of peak arrival; (4) the longitude where the greatest density of trans-Gulf migrants arrived on the northern coast was relatively constant from year to year; and (5) on occasion, strong winds or storms displaced migrants, but migrants seemed to have a preferred route they followed. These conclusions suggest that conservation efforts should concentrate on the preferred routes and landing locations. These findings are intriguing and suggest the potential to develop conservation priorities for suitable habitat for northbound Nearctic-Neotropical migrants, especially when coupled with data from birds fitted with geolocators. Neotropical migrants face several decisions with respect to the Gulf of Mexico, including which route to follow, when to migrate, where to make landfall before crossing the Gulf, where to make landfall after crossing the Gulf, and how long to stop at stopovers on either side of the Gulf. Passage across the Gulf is long, and birds often arrive in the Louisiana northern Gulf Coast with little fat (Yong and Moore 1997), making coastal lands critical for increasing fat stores and continued survival. Peak numbers of spring Passerine migrants occur from mid-April to early May, and radar studies indicate that nearly all the Passerine migrants arrive from directly over the Gulf of Mexico (Gauthreaux 1971). A bad storm or hurricane can kill 40,000 migrants on one day, if it occurs during a peak time when migrants are arriving from their northward flight across the Gulf (Wiedenfeld and Wiedenfeld 1995). The coastal habitats used by migratory Passerines are extremely important because estimates suggest that most Nearctic-Neotropical migrant Passerines are unable to reach northern breeding sites in a single flight without stopping (e.g., thrushes) (Yong and Moore 1997). Passerines that are lean upon arrival often remain longer before departing for breeding grounds farther north (Moore and Kerlinger 1987). Length of stay in Louisiana after a transGulf flight is related to fat-depletion upon arrival; lean birds (Parulinae warblers) remained longer than fat ones, but if weather is favorable, birds continue to migrate (Moore and Kerlinger 1987). For migrant Passerines using the northern Gulf Coast, suitable stopover habitat is a critical feature. Migrant densities were most strongly related to forest cover within a 5 km radius; this feature influenced where migrants made landfall (Buler et al. 2007). Indeed along the coast of Mississippi, northbound songbirds made landfall in resource-rich habitats within 18 km (11 mile) of the coastline (Buler and Moore 2011)."
34,807,0.455,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Most of the adult life history information available for hawksbills in the Gulf of Mexico is for the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico (Table 11.5). Most hawksbills have slow growth rates, which vary within and among populations (NMFS and USFWS 2007e); growth rates of 2â4 cm (0.8â1.6 in) per year are typical for the Caribbean (Boulon 1994). Adult hawksbills may reach up to 1 m (3.3 ft) in length and weigh up to 140 kg (308.6 lb); however, they typically average about 0.75 m (2.5 ft) in length and weigh around 80 kg (176.4 lb) or less (USFWS 2012). Recent satellite tracking studies conducted to determine the migratory patterns and feeding ground locations for hawksbills nesting on YucataÌn Peninsula beaches have indicated that turtles remain in Mexican waters (Cuevas et al. 2008, 2012). In 2006 and 2007, three postnesting females were tracked for up to 510 days from three of the major nesting beaches in Campeche; two migrated to foraging grounds off the coast of Campeche, and one migrated to the Mexican Caribbean (Cuevas et al. 2008). Ten post-nesting hawksbill sea turtles were tracked from nine different nesting beaches on the YucataÌn Peninsula in 2006 and 2007; turtles that nested on the western side of the peninsula migrated to the east, while those that nested on the eastern side migrated to the west (Cuevas et al. 2012). In a second, similar study conducted in 2011, tracked hawksbills also stayed in Mexican waters; however, one female migrated north to the border of the continental shelf, while a male stayed close to the nesting beaches (Cuevas et al. 2012)."
231,178,0.454,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.5 Fisheries The North Sea ecosystem is overï¬shed (Cury et al. 2000; FAO 2012). Bottom and beam trawling are a major threat for marine organisms because they damage the seabed and alter mature benthic communities. Based on long-term data, Fock et al. (2014) stated that the age, volume and size composition of commercial ï¬sh stocks has shifted since 1902. As a result, species composition has shown signiï¬cant changes in recent decades. For example, slow-reproducing ï¬sh such as sharks and rays declined and may only be encountered in areas with low ï¬shing density. With beam trawling, the benthic community structure has changed from long-lived species (e.g. sharks and rays) to short-lived opportunistic and scavenging species (e.g. crabs and shrimps). Seagrasses declined along the Dutch, German and Danish coasts as a result of bottom trawling ï¬sheries and an epidemic of wasting disease in the 1930s. Exploitation of North Sea ï¬sh stocks has increased since 1945 as shown by trends in ï¬shery mortality among all groups of exploited ï¬sh species (Daan et al. 1990). As a result of measures to allow ï¬sh stocks to recover, total catches have declined since the late 1960s (Fig. 1.37). Even though pollution and overï¬shing in the North Sea (CabeÃ§adas et al. 1999) have resulted in major changes in species composition and shifts in species distribution, species richness based on International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) data has increased over the past 30 years (ICES 2008); see"

241,1105,0.453,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Increase in sea surface temperature is projected to change seasonal succession and induce dominance shifts in phytoplankton in spring and promote the growth of cyanobacteria in summer. In general, climate change is projected to worsen oxygen conditions and eutrophication in the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland. In the Gulf of Bothnia, the increasing freshwater discharge may increase the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water and hence reduce phytoplankton productivity. In winter, reduced duration and spatial extent of sea ice will cause habitat loss for ice-dwelling organisms and probably induce changes in nutrient dynamics within and under the sea ice. The projected salinity decline will probably affect the functional diversity of the benthic communities and induce geographical shifts in the distribution limits of key species such as bladder wrack and blue mussel. In the pelagic ecosystem, the decrease in salinity together with poor oxygen conditions in the deep basins will negatively influence the main Baltic Sea piscivore, cod. This has been suggested to cause cascading effects on clupeids and zooplankton. Keywords"
34,732,0.451,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","While the site of release affected the movements and distributions of head-started turtles, overall, head-started Kempâs ridleys dispersed widely from release areas and were reported throughout the natural range and in habitats of wild-stock Kempâs ridleys (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). Growth and diet information obtained from recaptured and stranded turtles indicated that head-started ridleys adapted to feeding in the wild. Mortality rates were likely high for both wild-stock and head-started ridleys before the mandatory use of TEDs began in U.S. offshore waters in 1990, as indicated by the continued decline of Kempâs ridleys throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In addition, because Kempâs ridley mortality was so high during the 1980s, survival to adulthood was unlikely for most turtles (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). Although factors, such as insufficient monitoring of the nesting beaches and turtle tag loss, have affected the collection of head-started Kempâs ridley nesting data, some head-started Kempâs ridleys have nested on beaches of PAIS, North Padre Island, Mustang Island, Galveston Island, and Bolivar Peninsula in Texas, as well as in Tamaulipas, Mexico (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). The first head-started Kempâs ridley nests, laid by turtles from the 1983 and 1986 year classes, were documented at PAIS and Boca Chica Beach, Texas in 1996 (Shaver 1996; Fontaine and Shaver 2005; Shaver and Wibbels 2007). The Kempâs ridleys that have nested in Texas since 1996 have been a mixture of head-started and wild-stock turtles. However, since 2002, the majority of nesting in Texas has been by wild-stock Kempâs ridleys (NMFS et al. 2011). For example, of the 42 Kempâs ridley nests documented in Texas in 2004, 13 were from head-started turtles (Safina and Wallace 2010). Tracking studies have demonstrated that nesting headstarted Kempâs ridleys have similar post-nesting movement behaviors as wild-stock ridleys (Landry and Seney 2006; Shaver and Wibbels 2007). Because the Head Start Experiment was a large-scale experiment on the most endangered sea turtle in the world and was the subject of intense debate and controversy throughout the 1980s and early 1990s (Shaver and Wibbels 2007), it was officially terminated in 1993 but continued on a limited basis through 2000. While it is encouraging that some head-started Kempâs ridleys have survived to maturity and are nesting, it is not possible to accurately determine the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the experiment (Shaver and Wibbels 2007). However, head-started females have nested and viable second-generation hatchlings have been produced both at PAIS and at Rancho Nuevo. In addition, a large amount of biological information was obtained as a result of the Head Start Experiment that might otherwise have never been discovered (Fontaine and Shaver 2005)."

For example, the Stockholm time series is one of the oldest sea level records (Ekman 2003; see also Woodworth 1999 for comparison with other similar records). A remarkable number of long and high-quality sea level records are available for the Baltic Sea basin and, to date, more than 45 stations provide at least 60 years of data.

Increases in species richness seem to have been due to the addition of warm-temperate species without the loss of cool-temperate species. The warm period since the late 1980s is still too short to determine whether the present ecosystem state is transitional and whether the cool-temperate species will gradually disappear, but evidence from archaeological material laid down during the Mesolithic warm period (4000â7500 y BP) indicates that cool-temperate species may remain (Enghoff et al. 2007) at least until temperatures rise by considerably more. The time taken for this to happen depends on the rate of global warming but also on decadal regional variability, which could maintain a cooler state over the next few decades. Substantial biological changes in the Northeast Atlantic including the North Sea have been associated with shifts in the sub-polar gyre and warming over recent decades (Hatun et al. 2009). This includes large-scale modiï¬cation of the phenology and distribution of plankton assemblages (Beaugrand et al. 2002; Edwards and Richardson 2004; Richardson and Schoeman 2004), changes in the availability of food resources and species, reproduction of benthic animals, composition of ï¬sh assemblages (Attrill and Power 2002; Simpson et al. 2011), and recruitment to the North Sea cod stock (Clark et al. 2003; Olsen et al. 2011). The diversity of the North Sea ecosystem may lead to contrasting responses to future climate change. For instance, the increase in temperature, light (through improved transparency), and wind in the south-eastern North Sea have probably contributed to the increase in algal biomass in this region during the period 1948â2004 (Llope et al. 2009). While their data suggest that phytoplankton biomass may have reached a maximum in the southernmost parts of the North Sea, Llope et al. (2009) concluded that phytoplankton biomass in the northern North Sea would continue to respond positively to a warmer, brighter, and windier future if current trends are maintained. Projections of the phenological responses of individual species under climate change have not yet been made, but the empirical evidence suggests that phenological changes will continue as climate warming continues. It is currently uncertain whether genetic adaptations within species populations will be able to cope with these changes, at least partly, or whether the pace of climate change is too fast for genetic adaptations to take place. This uncertainty is further compounded by the difference in phenological responses between species and functional groups. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching and result in disruption of the functioning, persistence and resilience of North Sea ecosystems. It is not clear whether general species attributes (e.g. trophic level) are sufï¬cient to predict future outcomes or"

(2012), the anchovy population from the western Channel (not from the Bay of Biscay) invaded the North Sea and Baltic Sea during positive periods of the AMO. Given this evidence and according to the rules of ârelative stabilityâ within the EU Common Fisheries Policy, Spanish and French vessels would not necessarily be granted exclusive access to this expanding resource, unlike the present situation in the Bay of Biscay. Under the EU Common Fisheries Policy, a number of closed areas have been implemented as âtechnical measuresâ to conserve particular species and to protect nursery or spawning grounds. In the North Sea, these include closure areas to protect plaice, herring, Norway pout and sandeel. If species shift their distribution in response to climate change then it is possible that such measures will become less effective in the future (van Keeken et al. 2007). Juvenile plaice are typically concentrated in shallow inshore waters of the southeast North Sea and move gradually offshore as they grow. In order to reduce discarding of undersized plaice, thereby decreasing mortality and enhancing recruitment to the ï¬shery, the EU âPlaice Boxâ was introduced in 1989, excluding access to beam and otter trawlers larger than 300 hp. However recent surveys in the Wadden Sea have shown that 1-group plaice are now completely absent from the area where they were once very abundant. Consequently, the âPlaice Boxâ is now less effective as a management measure for plaice than was the case 10 or 15 years ago. The boundaries of, and expected beneï¬ts from marine protected areas (MPAs) may need to be âadaptiveâ in the future in the context of climate change. Cheung et al. (2012) looked at other ï¬shery closure areas in the North Sea and noted that they will most likely experience between 2 and 3 Â°C increases in temperature over the next 80â100 years and consequently it is unlikely that the species they are designed to protect now will occur there in the same numbers in the future given deï¬ned temperature tolerances or preferences of speciï¬c ï¬shes (Freitas et al. 2007; PÃ¶rtner and Peck 2010). Fishers have witnessed and responded to a number of new opportunities in recent years, as warm-water species have moved into the North Sea and/or their exploitation has become commercially viable for the ï¬rst time. Notable examples include new or expanding ï¬sheries for seabass, red mullet, John dory Zeus faber, anchovy and squid Loligo forbesi. Biomass estimates for seabass in the eastern Channel quadrupled from around 500 tonnes in 1985, to in excess of 2100 tonnes in 2004/2005, with populations also increasing rapidly in the southern North Sea (Pawson et al. 2007). This was attributed to an increase in seawater temperature, especially in the winter and has resulted in a dramatic expansion of seabass ï¬sheries both within the commercial sector and the recreational ï¬shing sector. Seabass are caught by angling on the east coast of Scotland and in Norway, but"

Unlike other sea turtle species, hawksbills nest in low densities on scattered, small beaches (USFWS 2012). Throughout their range, hawksbills nest in at least 70 countries on insular and mainland sandy beaches and inhabit coastal waters of more than 100 countries NMFS and USFWS (1993, 2007e). In 2007, at 83 nesting sites distributed among ten ocean regions around the world, approximately 21,212â28,138 hawksbills were estimated to nest each year (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; USFWS 2012). Although greatly depleted compared to historical levels, nesting populations in the Atlantic Ocean are generally doing better than those in the Indo-Pacific (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Hawksbill nesting in the Caribbean accounts for approximately 20â30 % of the worldâs hawksbill sea turtle population, and the number of hawksbill sea turtles living in the Caribbean was estimated at 27,000 in 2003 (Lutz et al. 2003; USFWS 2012). In the Atlantic, more population increases have been recorded in the Insular Caribbean, as compared to populations on the western Caribbean mainland or in the eastern Atlantic Ocean (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Historically, Panama supported the single most important nesting population in the Caribbean, but hawksbill nesting at ChiriquÄ±Ì Beach in Panama has declined by more than 95 % during the past 50 years (Carr 1979; Meylan and Donnelly 1999). The YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico now supports the largest nesting hawksbill population in the area (Figure 11.41) (Cuevas et al. 2010). The Insular Caribbean has eight nesting concentrations of hawksbills: Antigua/Barbuda (especially Jumby Bay), Bahamas, Barbados, Cuba (Doce Leguas Cays), Jamaica, Puerto Rico (especially Mona Island), Trinidad and Tobago, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (especially Buck Island Reef National Monument [BIRNM], an uninhabited island about 2.4 km [1.5 mi] north of the northeast coast of St. Croix) (Figure 11.41) (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). In 2002, 400â833 nesting females, or 2,000â2,500 nests, were estimated for Doce Leguas Cays, Cuba (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; Mortimer and Donnelly 2008; USFWS 2012). From 2001 through 2005, 199â332 nests were recorded each year on Mona Island, Puerto Rico, and 51â85 nests were recorded each season for Culebra Island, Caja de Muertos, and Humacao, Puerto Rico (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; USFWS 2012). From 2001 through 2006, an average of 56 nests were laid each year at BIRNM in the U.S. Virgin Islands, while 30â222 nests were laid in 2006 on U.S. Virgin Islands beaches outside BIRNM (NMFS and USFWS 2007e; USFWS 2012)."

34,204,0.443,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","However, tagged fish showed highly variable movement patterns, regardless of tagging location, season, or egress status. Seasonal changes in distribution suggested a northâsouth cyclical movement pattern within the Gulf of Mexico that supported a new perspective on Atlantic blue marlin, in which the Gulf of Mexico provides suitable year-round habitat that is utilized by a subset of the Atlantic population. An analysis of otolith chemistry of Atlantic blue marlin also suggested that movement out of the Gulf of Mexico for Atlantic blue marlin may be more limited, as compared to other regions (Wells et al. 2010). Atlantic blue marlin in the Gulf of Mexico tend to remain in offshore waters (Table 9.19). However, they may move close to the coast from July to September. They spawn in the Gulf of Mexico as early as May and continue to spawn throughout the summer (Table 9.18). Atlantic blue marlin that spawn on spawning grounds off Texas and Louisiana during the summer remain in the Gulf through the fall and winter. Blue marlin tag/recapture data from the Gulf of Mexico indicate that seasonal movements may occur between the Gulf of Mexico (summer) and the Bahamas (winter). Several data sources indicate that the Gulf of Mexico may serve as important spawning and/or nursery habitat for blue marlin (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008; Rooker et al. 2012). Blue marlin larvae were found in a 2005 fishery-independent survey in the areas from 27 to 28 N to 90 to 94 W in July (Rooker et al. 2012). This seems to suggest that blue marlin can spawn in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008; Kraus et al. 2011). However, larvae mainly are present near the western margin of Loop Current on the continental shelf in relatively warm waters (>27  C). The presence of young blue marlin larvae along the boundary of the Loop Current may be a result of transport from Caribbean/Straits of Florida spawning events (Kraus et al. 2011; Rooker et al. 2012). Because no spawning-capable adults have been captured in this region, it is unlikely that blue marlin spawn in the Loop Current in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008). Strong histological evidence supports the lack of spawning in the northern Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River, which is augmented by the failure to capture blue marlin larvae in areas not associated with the Loop Current (Kraus and Rooker 2007; Kraus et al. 2011; Rooker et al. 2012). Thus, the likelihood of blue marlin spawning in the northern Gulf of Mexico is slim, although the northern Gulf of Mexico supports an active recreational fishery for blue marlin from May through September (Brown-Peterson et al. 2008). Limited published information is available on blue marlin biology and life history from the Gulf of Mexico (Table 9.18) (De Sylva et al. 2000). Females are batch spawners and can spawn as many as four times in a spawning season (Brown-Peterson et al. 2004). They often release more than seven million eggs at once, each approximately 1 mm (0.04 in.) in diameter (BrownPeterson et al. 2008). The larvae may grow as much as 16 mm (0.63 in.) in a day (BrownPeterson et al. 2008). Males may live for 18 years and females up to 27 years. Females can grow up to four times the weight of males (Wilson et al. 1991; ICCAT 1997). The M estimated using the Hoenig method (Hoenig 1983) at a maximum age of 30 years is 0.14 (Hill et al. 1989), which was used in the most recent stock assessment. The estimated blue marlin recruitment fluctuates over time and has been low in recent years (Figure 9.28). However, there is great uncertainty associated with the estimated recruitment, which results mainly from uncertainty in the quality of fishery and biological data, as well as the assumed stock structure and population dynamics. Given the large distributional area that the Atlantic blue marlin occupies and the existence of multiple spawning grounds, blue marlin in different areas may be subject to different environmental stressors and prey availability. This may result in large spatial variability in key life-history parameters, such as growth and maturation."
231,1178,0.442,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"DBEM) were applied to the same present distribution datasets and the same environmental input parameters. As indicated by the test statistics, each method produced a plausible present distribution and estimate of habitats suitable for each species (14 commercial ï¬sh). When used to make projections into the future, the ensemble of models suggested northward shifts at an average rate of 27 km per decade (the current rate is around 20 km per decade for common ï¬sh in the North Sea, Dulvy et al. 2008). This modelling approach was extended to include several additional, commercial species (squid Loligo vulgaris, seabass, sardine, sprat, John dory, anchovy, plaice, herring, mackerel, halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus, red mullet etc.) as part of a Defra study (Defra 2013). The species predicted to move the furthest were anchovy, sardine, Greenland halibut, John dory and seabass (i.e. E. encrasicolus, S. pilchardus, R. hippoglossoides, Z. faber and D. labrax respectively, see Fig. 12.4). By contrast Rutterford et al. (2015) used the same ï¬sh survey datasets for the North Sea, together with generalised additive models (GAMs), to predict trends in the future distribution of species, but came to the conclusion that ï¬sh species over the next 50 years will be strongly constrained by the availability of suitable habitat in the North Sea, especially in terms of preferred depths. The authors found no consistent pattern among species in predicted changes in distribution. On the basis of the GAM results the authors suggested that they did not expect or predict substantial further deepening (as previously observed by Dulvy et al. 2008), and that the capacity of ï¬sh to remain in cooler water by changing their depth distribution had been largely exhausted by the 1980s, that ï¬sh with preferences for cooler water are being increasingly exposed to higher temperatures, with expected physiological, life history and negative population consequences. Beaugrand et al. (2011) described a model to map the future spatial distribution of Atlantic cod. The model, which they named the non-parametric probabilistic ecological niche model (NPPEN), suggested that cod may eventually disappear as a commercial species from some regions including the North Sea where a sustained decline has already been documented; in contrast, the abundance of cod is likely to increase in the Barents Sea. Lenoir et al. (2011) applied the same NPPEN model with multiple explanatory variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, and bathymetry) to predict the distribution of eight ï¬sh species up to the 2090s for the Northeast Atlantic. This study anticipated that by the 2090s horse mackerel and anchovy would show an increased probability of occurrence in northern waters compared with the 1960s, that pollack Pollachius pollachius, haddock and saithe would show a decrease in the south, and that turbot Scophthalmus maximus and sprat would show no overall change in probability (â0.2 to +0.2) anywhere."
241,103,0.441,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"However, this is uncertain owing to biases in model results for the hydrological cycle. Sea ice The future reduction of sea-ice cover in the Baltic Sea mainly depends on the projected changes in air temperature during winter. All simulations indicate a drastic decrease in sea-ice cover in the Baltic Sea in the future, in agreement with earlier studies. However, even under a warmer future climate, sea ice is likely to occur in future winters in the northern Baltic Sea. Storm surges Projected changes in sea-level extremes caused by changes in the regional wind ï¬eld indicate that at the end of the twenty-ï¬rst century, the greatest changes in mean sea-surface height would occur during spring, amounting to up to 20 cm in coastal areas of the Bothnian Bay. The maximum change in annual mean sea-surface height is expected to be 10 cm without accounting for the large-scale sea-level rise or land uplift in the Baltic Sea area. Overall, sea-level rise has a greater potential to increase storm surge levels in the Baltic Sea than increased wind speed.

The composition of the fish species accounting for over 50 % in each freeze were striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), and bay anchovy. They noted that the size classes of a species affected varied between some of the freezes, but not all species, e.g., pinfish. This observation they felt led to an âinstantaneous pictureâ of the species population structure at the time of the kill. Hence, the recommendation to fisheries managers was to respond to mass mortalities by imposing regulations to reduce fishing efforts immediately following the event to allow recruitment and compensatory mechanisms to take place. Commercial fishing after the cold kills, at least the 1940 episode, showed a dramatic decline (Gunter 1941). While there was some difference in the decline among commercial catches from the regions of Galveston, Matagorda, Aransas, and Laguna Madre, the red drum, spotted seatrout, and black drum all declined by 78 % while that of the southern flounder declined by 95 %. However, dead flounder do not float and because of their shape they are not easily trawled or dredged, so some mortalities could have easily escaped notice. He also tabulated data for catches after the 1940 freeze from both the year of the freeze and of the prior year and noted that there was no difference in decline from catches in the Gulf of Mexico. But there was in the bays, where the water was much shallower. It took about 3 years for the commercial catch to recover. Texas fishermen seem to agree that fish will be scarce for a few months after severe cold spells; whereas those from Florida and Mississippi estimate a 2- to 3-week period. As suggested above, this difference can be explained primarily by many of the fish in Florida, Mississippi, and offshore Texas migrating to more tolerable water or recovering after a water temperature rise after being affected but not killed. The nice thing about cold kills is that residents as well as numerous animals such as piscivorous birds and raccoons make a healthy feast of the freshly dead or numbed fish! Such is not the case for fish killed by most other causes."

Before 1956, no records documented green turtle nesting on Gulf of Mexico beaches or elsewhere in the continental United States However, green turtle populations are known to have been abundant historically as described in Section 11.1.2 (Meylan et al. 1995). Extensive seagrass beds in south Texas bays were once an important feeding ground for the green sea turtle (Owens et al. 1983). A review of the green turtle nesting data through 2001 for the Tortuguero, YucataÌn Peninsula, and Florida nesting beaches indicated that all three western Atlantic Ocean subpopulations were increasing (IUCN 2004). The population of nesting females for the western Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea was estimated to range from 30,981 to 31,981 in 2001, a 13 to 66 % increase over past published estimates (IUCN 2004). Green turtle nesting in Tortuguero has increased significantly since the 1970s (NMFS and USFWS 2007c). Evaluation of the trend in nesting activity on the Tortuguero beach indicated a relatively steady increase from 1971 to the mid-1980s, constant or possibly decreasing nesting during the late 1980s, and then resumption of an upward trend in the 1990s (Bjorndal et al. 1999). About 41,250 adult female green turtles emerged on beaches each year from 1971 through 1975, and from 1992 through 1996, approximately 72,200 females emerged per year (Bjorndal et al. 1999). Approximately 104,411 nests per year were laid on the beach at Tortuguero from 1999 through 2003, which corresponds to about 17,402â37,290 nesting female green turtles each year (TroeÌng and Rankin 2005). More than 80,000 green turtle nests were estimated for Tortuguero each year from 2003 through 2009, with a high of almost 178,000 estimated nests or about 68,000 estimated nesting females in 2007 (Figure 11.29)."
34,1293,0.437,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","14.1 INTRODUCTION How could the environmental health of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf or GoM) be described in regard to fish kills, diseases, and parasitic infections before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? This might seem like a simple question, but the answer is complex and difficult to report. Nevertheless, reporting some of that complexity is the aim of this chapter. Many people consider the GoM to be restricted to the offshore waters, but studies on diseases in offshore water deeper than 200 meters [m] (656 feet [ft]) are few, not very detailed, incomplete, and not necessarily representative of the entire Gulf. Looking at offshore fishes in the Gulf, one should also consider the nursery grounds for those species. These grounds are usually the estuaries of the Gulf. Moreover, these estuaries are independent habitats that provide important aspects of understanding mortality and diseases of animals throughout the entire Gulf. This chapter treats the entire GoM. Several factors have been impediments to research on this topic. An important reason for not being able to fully understand disease and its importance to the GoM involves the fact that when fishes become ill or otherwise stressed, they usually get preyed upon by predators and microbial consumers. Moreover, many diseases primarily affect the larval stages of the hosts, and individuals of these stages are so small that they are usually overlooked and seldom critically examined. When someone sees infected individuals, disease conditions may not necessarily be apparent. Infections in larval fishes by one or few individuals of a parasite species can have a role in disease epidemics. Observations of such cases can be supported by experimental laboratory studies. One critical reason that diseases in the Gulf of Mexico prior to the oil spill are not well-known is because some cutting-edge molecular diagnostic tools have been developed only recently and have not been widely applied for diagnosis of marine animal diseases. Another reason why diseases of offshore fishes as well as shellfishes, other invertebrates, marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds have not been studied relates to the high expense of collecting and studying the material. For example, charges for daily rental of large research ships can be as much as $50,000; the 29.7 m (97.4 ft) USM-GCRL R/V Tommy Munro, on which research involving the continental shelf is conducted, presently costs $7,200 plus the cost of fuel. Some of our past research has avoided high collecting costs because we took advantage of various inshore and offshore studies of fishes conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) by partaking in its cruises, by accompanying other biologists on their trips, by obtaining parasites from some fishes collected by others, by conducting numerous inshore and offshore collection activities from our own small vessels, by assessing diseases, and most importantly, by utilizing the vast array of literature reflecting research conducted by others."

In such areas, sediment accumulation by long-shore currents often created emerging barriers. The southern Baltic Sea coast is mainly composed of moraine cliffs (made by glacial tills, clays and fluvioglacial sands) and sandy or gravel coasts developed as spits. Abundant sand sediment has led to the creation of various sandspits, with the longest occurring on the southern Baltic Sea coast, such as the Vistula and Curonian sandspits. Lagoons, shallow sea bays and coastal lakes were formed on low-lying coast, where organic accumulation and sedimentation dominated. Spits such as islands or barriers develop where sediment, moving alongshore, is deposited at the mouth of estuaries and other places with an abrupt change in the direction of the coast (Trenhaile 1997). Several sandy barrier islands occur on the German Baltic Sea coast (e.g. Hiddensee), others built by gravel or pebbles, in Estonia. Owing to long-shore transport and the origin of land features, the Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian coastlines are effectively aligned, with sandy barriers separating valleys, deltas, lakes and lagoons from the open sea. The German and Danish soft coasts are more circuitous, due to numerous bays, peninsulas and islands. The northern part of the Baltic Sea coast is mainly formed by isostatic uplift due to the loss of glacial cover in Scandinavia. In some places, accumulative forms occur in bays or river deltas. Finland and Sweden have emergent coasts where abundant skerries form archipelagos. Some U-shaped fjords were formed by glaciers in rocky, mainly igneous beds (Fig. 20.2b) with the presence of some sandy, accumulative barriers or beaches. Rocky limestone or chalk beds, found in Estonia and on the Baltic Sea islands, have formed cliff coasts (Fig. 20.2e, f)."

The Baltic Sea is a young sea. It was formed after the glaciers that covered this area for over 100,000 years began to recede about 18,000 years ago, mainly as a result of changes in the orbital conï¬guration of the Earthâs rotation around the sun. In the Baltic Sea area, this last Ice Age ended about 11,000 years ago. During the following warmer Holocene, the Baltic Sea basin underwent a number of major changes owing to the gradual melting of the Fennoscandian ice sheet, which caused a rise in sea level and the slow isostatic uplift of the land readjusting to the disappearance of the heavy ice sheet, thus decreasing relative sea level. The interplay between these two processes led to a series of transitions in the Baltic Sea basin, varying between a freshwater lake during periods of isolation from the North Sea and a brackish sea when water mass exchange with the saline North Sea occurred. The melting of the ice sheets in North America had an influence on oceanic circulation, and it is believed that large volumes of cold water from the melting ice sheets entering the North Atlantic Ocean exerted an abrupt cooling around 8200 years ago that lasted several centuries in the Baltic Sea area. Changes in the orbital conï¬guration of the Earth also modulated the incoming solar insolation of the boreal high latitudes and thus strongly influenced the regional energy balance. The summer solar insolation peaked at around 7000â6000 years ago and subsequently decreased. After the melting of the remnants of the Fennoscandian ice sheets, a"

In such cases, AS (through the processes of primary succession) increase species richness and taxonomic diversity in a given area and increase and strengthen functional diversity and/or provide new services and goods (Bonsdorff 2006; Kotta et al. 2006). It must be emphasised that the Baltic Sea is âa sea of aliensâ (LeppÃ¤koski et al. 2002), since almost all marine organisms present today invaded the area sometime over the last 10,000 years. However, as it was mentioned previously, the invasion rate has accelerated enormously since the 1950s mainly due to human activities (such as maritime transportation and habitat change). Moreover, synergistic effects of factors such as pollution, eutrophication, overfishing and climate change stimulate new invasions (Fig. 4.2). Changes in environmental conditions and human pressure have on the one hand resulted in the elimination of highly specialised or sensitive native species from the Baltic ecosystem, while on the other hand they have generated and opened niches that have been quickly inhabited by new species. To some extent, the process of bioinvasion can be regarded as positive when species richness and taxonomic diversity are considered. For example, studies on the widespread Baltic invasive polychaete Marenzelleria spp. have shown that although this species has become dominant, it has not adversely affected deeper benthic communities, since it fills an âemptyâ niche. However, in shallow waters this has not been the case, and Marenzelleria spp. competes with the native polychaete worm Hediste diversicolor and affects the abundance of the amphipod Monoporeia affinis (DidÅ¾iulis 2006; Kotta and Olafsson 2003). Other positive consequences of alien species introduction include human benefits from both AS and IAS which has actually polarised public perceptions about bioinvasion.

Young (to age 8) red snapper in the eastern Gulf of Mexico tend to have a higher reproductive output at age compared to those in the western Gulf. A single stock of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico has been suggested by genetic studies (Camper et al. 1993; Gold et al. 1997; Heist and Gold 2000), which may result from the lack of sufficient time since the Pleistocene epoch for spatially separated substocks of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico to have become genetically distinct, or from enough mixing to maintain homogeneity in the population. However, phenotypic differences have been identified in growth, maturation, abundance, age/size compositions, prey compositions, and fishery dynamics between the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico. To account for such differences between the two areas in the stock assessment, the Gulf of Mexico red snapper stock is considered to consist of the two substocks. Although there is evidence of large differences in life history and population dynamics at fine spatial scales, such as among different reefs (Gallaway et al. 2009), more studies are needed to evaluate the potential existence of metapopulation structure."

Most populations or subpopulations have not been well studied, with the most notable exceptions being those of the Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida, area (Wells 2003) and Sanibel Island (Shane 2004) of west Florida. Similarly, dolphin populations are known in the north-central Gulf (Mullin 1988) and off Texas (Shane 1977; Moreno 2005) as well, but none has been followed for as long or as thoroughly as the subject of the Wells (2003) study. Bottlenose dolphins of the inshore areas of the northern Gulf of Mexico number about 28â32 separate stocks (that are not necessarily distinguished as genetic populations), with an estimated total of 5,355 (no reliable CV available) animals (Table 13.22). Three coastal stocks outside of bays and estuaries and up to 20 m (66 ft) deep, total approximately 13,600 animals (see details, below).

Details of these groupings are given below.

(1999) investigated combined scenarios of temperature and precipitation change with sea-level rise and beach loss and their effect on the number of tourists travelling to the Baltic and North Sea coasts of Germany. They concluded that the likelihood of choosing the north German coast for a holiday was slightly higher with increased temperatures. However, for scenarios with potentially negative impacts on the German coasts, such as beach erosion, the likelihood of visiting was substantially lower, even if with adaptations such as greater setback of tourism infrastructure or more diversiï¬ed outdoor activities. Lohmann (2002) concluded that the effects of climate change in the North Sea area, such as sea-level rise, were likely to destroy infrastructure and that frequent extreme weather events may discourage visitors. Infrastructure at ports and marinas is a major asset at many destinations. Sea-level rise, coastal erosion and storms might compromise its functionality. There is still a lack of detailed academic research on this topic for the North Sea region. For the German North Sea coastline, sea-level rise is expected to extend the tides (i.e. lengthen flood duration on mudflats) hampering tidal flat walks for tourists (Regierungskommission Klimaschutz 2012). Higher average temperatures in the North Sea region will also cause tourism-driven changes in biodiversity. If more tourists visit the North Sea in, before and after the summer season, this might increase pressure on local biodiversity, in particular vegetation cover and habitat for nesting birds (Coombers et al. 2008). Effects on nature-based tourism and activities, like animal watching, still require closer academic study. Travellers to the Baltic Sea coast judged algal blooms negatively, especially for swimming (Nilsson and GÃ¶ssling 2012). There is also concern that foam algae might pollute the beaches (Regierungskommission Klimaschutz 2012). Further studies are needed to examine the (potentially toxic) effects of new plant species moving into the North Sea region and an increase in harmful algal blooms could impact on bathing water quality and the tourism industry in general over the longer term (GÃ¶ssling et al. 2012). Broader socio-economic impacts of climate change on destinations, such as those concerning health, security or insurance implications should also be considered. Heat waves in summer might adversely affect health resorts, but it may be that such conditions are still preferable to those of other inland destinations and will therefore have an advantage in the future. Knowledge gaps still remain on health issues, especially the future distribution of vector-borne disease along the North Sea coast. Overall, tourism in the North Sea area in summer is expected to proï¬t from rising temperatures (air and water), decreasing precipitation and a longer season. But"

Most populations are resident, but the more northerly rails move south in the winter. Clapper Rails are strictly estuarineâthey very infrequently nest in freshwater marshes (Olson 1997), and are thus good indicators of marsh conditions, especially contaminants, oil, and habitat loss (Novak et al. 2011). They are a solitary species, and space out within marshes or mangroves. Clapper Rails mainly feed on crustaceans (Eddleman et al. 1998). They build nests in thick vegetation on the higher places, usually where vegetation is taller, providing some protection from aerial predators. They lay 7â9 eggs; most nest failures are due to predation on eggs, and flooding, which is likely to increase with sea level rise. Although young rails feed on their own, they remain with parents until they fledge. Future habitat changes that result from environmental stress, sea level rise, and subsidence will result in a landward increase in salinity (McKee et al. 2004), with changes in vegetation types and nesting bird populations (Greenberg et al. 2006). Since Clapper Rails nest and forage in habitats with higher salinity than some salt marsh birds, they may increase in Gulf Coast marshes with increased salt water intrusions (Rush et al. 2009a). While habitat loss is the most critical factor, tidal flooding and hunting pressures also decrease their populations (Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Because Clapper Rails breed and forage in coastal marshes and remain hidden most of the time, it is difficult to track their population numbers, although high tides (Rush et al. 2009b) and recent advances in acoustical monitoring make it easier to count them. There are no estimates for the number of Clapper Rails in Gulf Coast marshes, although they are counted on Breeding Bird Surveys and on Christmas Bird Counts. Breeding Bird Surveys indicate that they are declining in all states, except Louisiana, with lower declines in Florida than elsewhere (Figure 12.33). Using Christmas Bird Counts from 1965 to 2011 as a database, Niven and Butcher (2011) reported no significant trend in Clapper Rail wintering populations along the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, when these data are examined in detail, there appears to be a decline in the northern Gulf from the mid-1970s to the present (Figure 12.34). Resiliency may be intermediate to high, depending upon the availability of a source population. If a population is extirpated from a region because of habitat loss or degradation, excess available breeders from nearby areas would be necessary to reestablish the population. They likely breed at 1 year, have average clutch sizes of more than nine eggs in the Gulf Coast, and have variable hatching success, depending upon flood losses, that can average 85 % (Eddleman et al. 1998)."
231,810,0.419,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"decreasing towards the present. The role of the Dutch Wadden Sea as a nursery area seems to have changed considerably, a pattern which is most prominent in plaice but also apparent in some other flatï¬sh species. The densities of 0-year old plaice have strongly reduced since the mid-1980s to a stable and low level that has not changed since 2000. The period in which they use the area has also changed: instead of staying from early spring until October, they now tend to disappear in July/August. The 1- and 2-year olds have disappeared completely since the end of the 20th century. Although several mechanisms may be operating, climate change is a likely cause of these alterations. Using dynamic energy budgets, Teal et al. (2012) showed that the most likely explanation for the recent loss of the nursery function, especially for plaice, is that increased temperatures make coastal areas unsuitable for growth. Growth rate data for 0-year old plaice showed that recent higher summer temperatures result in metabolic activity raised to levels at which food becomes limiting (Teal et al. 2008). In contrast to the decline observed in overall biomass, dominated by marine juveniles, the resident species show an increase followed by a stable period in the coastal area. However, understanding of the mechanisms acting on the different resident species is still very limited. One exception is the discovery that the decline observed in eelpout Zoarces vivparus in the Wadden Sea since 1985 is due to an increase in temperature above the thermal maximum of the species, causing thermally limited oxygen delivery (PÃ¶rtner and Knust 2007). Thus, the mechanisms underlying the large changes observed in the ï¬sh fauna of the Wadden Sea are still largely unknown. They are certainly partly climate related, but the impacts of changes in food, predators and abiotic factors acting on the different life stages are still poorly understood (Rijnsdorp et al. 2009)."

Abandonment of colonies is indicative of habitat quality problems that need to be addressed in the Gulf States. Royal Terns forage on small prey fish, which they capture by diving, but they also eat squid, shrimp, and crabs in Florida (Stevenson and Anderson 1994). Royal Terns nest in dense groups, either in monospecific colonies, or with other terns (e.g., Caspian, Sandwich), Laughing Gulls, and Black Skimmers (Figure 12.43). Royal Terns nest a mere body length apart. When they nest with other species, they still nest in dense groups, which may be within or adjacent to more spaced-out gulls and terns. Royal Terns lay one egg, both incubate, and both provision the young. There is usually synchrony in egg-laying within subcolonies, which results in synchronous hatching. Parents brood very young chicks, but chicks quickly join a creÌche (young birds that stay in a close-knit group), which protects them when parents are away foraging (Buckley and Buckley 2002). Buckley and Buckley (2002) estimated the number of breeding pairs for the Gulf region as follows: 1,000 in Florida (both coasts), 250 in Mississippi, 10,590 in Louisiana, and 22,463 in Texas. Breeding populations in Louisiana declined in the early 1990s (Figure 12.39) (Visser and Peterson 1994). They attributed the variability in nesting numbers to the vulnerability of their nesting habitat to storms and high tides. Delany and Scott (2006) estimated the number of Royal Terns in the United States to be 139,000. Trends data from Shamrock Island in Texas (Figure 12.40) indicates an overall increase in the number of breeding Royal Terns until the mid-1990s (Gorman and Smith 2001), and then they declined (TCWS 2012). Breeding Bird Survey data indicate a great increase in Royal Terns in Louisiana, but a slight decline in Alabama and Texas (Figure 12.44). Analysis of Christmas Bird Count data does not indicate a significant trend (Niven and Butcher 2011), although an examination of data from Florida seems to indicate a decline, as well as a decline in the Gulf Coast overall (Figure 12.45). Resiliency is intermediate because they do not breed until the age of 5â6 years and lay one egg, and Royal Terns can live up to 28 years, but most live fewer years (Buckley and Buckley 2002).

231,760,0.416,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"The North Sea is one of the most productive, intensively exploited and well-studied sea areas in the world. It lies just north of the boundary (*50Â°N) between the warm- and cool-temperate biogeographic regions (Dinter 2001), also referred to as Lusitanian and Boreal. Because of its size, topography, and physical and chemical diversity (described elsewhere), the North Sea encompasses a number of more or less coupled ecosystems with some shared properties. Deep areas of the northern North Sea and Norwegian trench are strongly influenced, both physically and in biota, by inflows from the Norwegian Sea, NW European shelf (Fig. 8.1 is an artistâs impression of this ecosystem). The low salinity Baltic Sea outflow affects the Norwegian coastal area and the inflow from the English Channel and several major rivers affects the continental coastal areas of the southern North Sea. Shallower water depth, stronger tidal mixing and diminished ocean influence all contribute to greater seasonal variability in temperature in the southern North Sea, with summer temperature much higher than in the northern North Sea and winter temperatures much lower. The North Sea has been exploited by humans since they resettled its shifting margins after the last ice age 10,000 years ago. It has also been the subject of conservation concern for many hundreds of years and the focus of many scientiï¬c studies of marine life, which show the inexorable decline of easily caught ï¬sh and shellï¬sh species with vulnerable life histories, such as sturgeon Acipenser Fig. 8.1 Artistâs view of the ecosystem of the coastal northern North Sea.

Assuming that ship trafï¬c on the Baltic Sea developed in a similar manner to the global trends, these data would indicate that annual ship emissions on the Baltic Sea in 1950 were at least 60 % lower than ship emissions in 2000, for all pollutants considered. It should be noted, however, that applying global inventories to the Baltic Sea leads to an underestimate of ship emissions, mainly due to a lack of accounting for âshort-seaâ trafï¬c (i.e. the movement of cargo and passengers on routes in enclosed sea areas or near coastlines without crossing an ocean) (Jalkanen et al. 2009)."

Interestingly, their cross-correlation analyses suggest the propagation of a climate signal from SST through decapod larvae, adult crabs and lesser black-backed gulls with lags that match the biology of each trophic group. This is indicative of climate-induced changes in the marine fauna extending to the avian fauna, and thus to the terrestrial food web around the seabird colonies (Luczak et al. 2012). Case Study 5: Vulnerability of the seabird community in the western North Sea to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts. Most seabird studies have tended to consider the impacts of single stressors on single species at speciï¬c times of the year, and so may be unrepresentative of the combined effects of pressures experienced by top predator communities over an annual cycle (Burthe et al. 2014). For marine top predators, there is evidence to suggest that interactions between climate and other threats may be additive (Frederiksen et al. 2004b; Burthe et al. 2014). Burthe et al. (2014) studied the cumulative effects of multiple stressors on a community of seabirds in the North Sea. More precisely, they examined vulnerability to climate change and other anthropogenic threats in a seabird community (45 species; 11 families) that used the Forth and Tay region (eastern Scotland) of the North Sea for breeding, overwintering or migration between 1980 and 2011. They found only 13 % of the seabird community in the Forth and Tay region to fall within the categories of low or very low population concern to future warming, whereas in considering multiple anthropogenic threats 73 % of the species in this bird community were considered to be of high or very high population concern for the future (Burthe et al. 2014). Case Study 6: Effects of extreme climatic events on coastal birds breeding in low-lying saltmarshes (for a more extensive review see Chap. 9). Van de Pol et al. (2010) investigated whether the frequency, magnitude and timing of rare but catastrophic flooding events have changed over time in Europeâs largest estuary, the Wadden Sea. They subsequently quantiï¬ed how this had affected the flooding risk of six saltmarsh nesting bird species (both seabird species and coastal species). Maximum high tide has increased twice as fast as mean high tide over the past four decades, resulting in more frequent and more catastrophic flooding of nests, especially around the time when most eggs have just hatched. By using data on speciesâ nest elevations, on the timing of egg-laying and on the length of time that the eggs and chicks are at risk from flooding, van de Pol et al. (2010) showed that flood risk increased for all six species (even after accounting for compensatory land accretion) and that this could worsen in the near future if the species do not adapt. This study provides the ï¬rst evidence that increasing flooding risks have reduced the reproductive output below stable population levels in at least one species, the Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus.

The changes projected in sea-level extremes (or storm surges) from the scenario simulations by Meier et al. (2011b) have not yet been analysed. An evaluation of the earlier scenario simulations by Meier et al. (2004b) or Meier (2006) indicates that during the control period, both mean seasonal cycles and 100-year surge events in the Baltic Sea are simulated well relative to observations. However, extreme sea-level events in the western Baltic Sea and Danish straits were considerably underestimated, probably because the regional topography was not sufï¬ciently resolved using a Baltic Sea model with a relatively coarse horizontal resolution of about 11 km only (Meier 2006). To address this shortcoming, GrÃ¤we and Burchard (2012) used a high-resolution local model for the western Baltic Sea (with a spatial resolution of about 1 km), nested into a RCM in a dynamical downscaling approach, which also took into account baroclinic effects. They found that the quality of surge heights in their model was signiï¬cantly better than in the driving model. Taking available global sea-level rise scenarios and simulated regional wind speed changes, GrÃ¤we and Burchard (2012) found that sealevel rise has greater potential to increase surge levels in the Baltic Sea than does increased wind speed. Using the SRES A1B scenario and assuming a sea-level rise of 50 cm and a change in mean wind speed of approximately 4 %, resulted in projected surges with a 100-year return period for 2071â 2100 that were greatest at the stations LÃ¼beck, Koserow and Gedser in the western Baltic Sea and up to 2.7 m compared to simulated surge heights of less than 2.1 m for 1961â2000. However, the relative impact of changing wind speed on sealevel extremes might be greater for stations in the eastern Baltic Sea, for example in St Petersburg, depending on the driving GCM used (Meier 2006). Furthermore, GrÃ¤we and Burchard (2012) found that changes in storm surge height in the scenarios can be consistently explained by the increase in mean sea level and variation in wind speed, supporting earlier approaches by Meier et al. (2004b) and Meier (2006). In addition to the impact of changing winds on sea levels, Madsen (2009) analysed steric effects using a coupled North Sea and Baltic Sea model. The author found maximum halosteric changes in annual mean sea level of about 6.5 cm in the Baltic Sea. Hence, locally generated steric effects will be small compared to those of the NE Atlantic Ocean, basically because of the relatively small water depths. Changes in sea level from dynamical adjustment of global and regional changes might be greater but have not been studied in detail. HÃ¼nicke and Zorita (2008) found an increase in sea-level amplitude (i.e. the difference between mean winter and spring sea level) and suggested that this could be due to the"

The on-growing usually takes place in coastal surface cages (FAO 2005), but the successful rearing under more exposed conditions was proven in flexible surface cages in the Mediterranean (Sturrock et al. 2008), which is the main site of production of European sea bass. Since sea bass is a physoclist species, in which the swim bladder is closed and pressure compensation is only possible by slow gas exchange, the ascent and decent of the cage has to include sufï¬cient breaks to prevent a barotrauma of the ï¬shâs swim bladder (KorsÃ¸en 2011). However, the eurythermal species is capable to tolerate temperatures below 5 Â°C (FAO 2005), which would enable on-growing in the offshore regions of the German North Sea. Nonetheless, the average temperature of 10 Â°C in the North Sea (Wiltshire and Manly 2004) is below its optimum temperature range of 22â28 Â°C for growth (Lanari et al. 2002), which will result in an extended on-growing phase. A rough approximation of the actual length at the end of the on-growing can be based on the growth models by Lanari et al. (2002) and the annual temperature of the water in the German Bight (data BSH-German station bay, 10 m depth, daily mean values of 2009, www.bsh.de).

241,469,0.41,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Elken et al. (2003, 2006) investigated the large halocline variation and related mesoscale and basin-scale processes in the northern Gotland BasinâGulf of Finland system. The authors suggested that long-lasting pulses of south-westerly winds cause an increase in the water volume of the Gulf of Finland. The resulting increase in hydrostatic pressure in the gulf leads to an outflow of deep water. Such counter-estuarine transport weakens the stratiï¬cation of water masses at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland. As a consequence, the same energy input leads to an intensiï¬ed diapycnal mixing as compared to the classical situation at the entrance (strong upward vertical advection). Owing to the variable topography both in the northern Gotland Basin and in the Gulf of Finland, the basin-scale barotropic flows are converted into baroclinic mesoscale motions with a large isopycnal displacement (more than 20 m within a distance of 10â20 km), which causes intra-halocline current speeds of more than 20 cm sâ1. So, Elken et al. (2006) concluded that the nearbottom layers of the Gulf of Finland actively react to the wind forcing, a reasoning which considerably modiï¬es the traditional concept of the partially decoupled lower layer dynamics of the Baltic Sea. The multitude of processes at the entrance of the Gulf of Finland makes modelling the deepwater inflow extremely difï¬cult. The internal wave activity is high, the production of strong eddies and topographically controlled local currents are frequent, and thus the diapycnal mixing is intense."

Frederiksen et al. (2006) also demonstrated consistent trends across four trophic levels, from plankton to seabirds, in the North Sea but again the causal links were undeï¬ned. Thompson and Ollason (2001) showed how ocean climate variation had lagged effects on a Scottish pelagic seabird species through cohort differences in recruitment related to temperature changes in summer. Burthe et al. (2012) compared phenological trends for species from four levels of a North Sea food web over the period 1983â2006 when SST increased signiï¬cantly. The results suggest trophic mismatch between ï¬ve seabird species breeding in the North Sea and their sandeel prey, but no evidence of an impact on the seabird breeding success or population dynamics (Burthe et al. 2012). Also, the signiï¬cant increase in the number of lesser black-backed gulls from 1996 onwards has been linked to the earlier mentioned temperature-driven increase in recruitment of swimming crabs in wide areas of the southern North Sea. These crabs are a key prey item for the seagulls (Luczak et al. 2012)."

These Gulfcet surveys provided a more detailed knowledge of how cetaceans are affected by seasonal and interyear climatic conditions, including the presence and positions of eddies and gyres that spin off the Loop Current in the north-central Gulf and the periodic, and at times strong, fresh water incursions from the Mississippi/Atchafalaya River system (Davis et al. 1998, 2002; Baumgartner et al. 2001; OrtegaOrtiz 2002). Such work has continued in the first 10 years of this century, although not always with similar multidisciplinary input as in the 1990s. The sperm whale seismic surveys (SWSS) of the first 6 years of the 2000s revealed much about sperm whale habitat in the north-central Gulf (Jochens et al. 2008), and Keith Mullin has continued to lead NMFS surveys (Maze-Foley and Mullin 2006). Studies, now better integrated year to year with standardized visual (and often acoustic) data gathering and analysis techniques, are finally giving a more complete picture of the cetaceans of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Such long-term information is allowing for assessments of community structure of pelagic cetaceans at large spatial scales, as recently attempted by Schick et al. (2011). Data for the southern Gulf are much less complete, except for an analysis by Ortega-Ortiz (2002); and for western nearshore areas in the state of Veracruz, there are analyses by Galindo et al. (2009), MartÄ±Ìnez-Serrano et al. (2011), and Valdes-Arellanes et al. (2011). The shores of Cuba are poorly represented, except for a thesis by PeÌrez-Cao (2004) from the Camagâ¬ uey Archipelago, NE Cuba, and outside of the Gulf. Studies of bottlenose dolphins in nearshore and offshore waters deserve special attention, since bottlenose dolphins of the Sarasota-Bradenton area of west Florida are arguably the longest continuously studied marine mammal (Wells and Scott 2009), vying for this distinction only with killer whales of several pods in the coastal Pacific near the U.S.âCanadian border (Ford 2009). Other studies also have been carried out, most notably by Shane off south Texas and southwest Florida (Shane 1977, 2004; Shane et al. 1986), Mullin (1988) in the north-central Gulf, and students of Wâ¬ ursig (e.g., BraÌger et al. 1994; Maze 1997; Moreno 2005) off the northwest Gulf, near Galveston Texas. Most of these studies have relied heavily on photoidentification for mark-recapture numbers analyses and society descriptions, and more is now known about the generally open, fluid social systems of bottlenose dolphins than of the social systems of most other cetaceans. The study of Caribbean (West Indian) manatee, one of only four species of the taxonomic order Sirenia (Figure 13.3) and the only vegetarians among the 122 or so species of marine mammals, had a similar early introduction by Gordon Gunter in his work with cetaceans (Gunter 1941). The monograph by Daniel Hartman (1979) on ecology and behavior of manatees in Florida (work carried out in the late 1960s) finally gave detailed information on their preferred habitats, life-history strategies, foraging techniques, and social/sexual and other aspects of behavior and behavioral ecology. While there has been much updated work (e.g., Reynolds and Odell 1991; OâShea et al. 1995; Marsh et al. 2011), this early monograph still stands as a hallmark of marine mammal studies. Since Hartman (1979), it is now known that there are two subspecies of Caribbean manateeâthe Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) (Figure 13.3). The Florida manatee regularly occurs on both sides of Florida (i.e., into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and north to about Tampa), although more rare excursions to northwest Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana occur, while the Antillean manatee occurs in the southern Mexican part of the Gulf and all the way south to (and even south of) the estuary of the Amazon River, where it is believed to hybridize with the much smaller-bodied Amazon manatee (Trichechus inunguis). Marsh et al. (2011) provide excellent up-to-date information on all Sirenia."

According to this approach sea bottom organisms which are usually called benthos are consistently found in the combination of relief and types of sea sediments with a specific set of hydrological and hydrochemical factors forming in the whole the large marine ecosystem consisting of local ecoregions. A detailed regionalization of such large marine ecosystems in range of sea basins is necessary for carrying out monitoring, rational use and protection of marine biological resources at different hierarchical levels. Experience of authors of present paper on biogeographical regionalization of the sea basins is based on rich theoretical and empirical material, including on own researches executed earlier summarized in works of Petrov (2009, 2012), Bobkov and Petrov (2013)."
241,560,0.404,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"with strong (20 m sâ1) easterly winds during an anti-cyclonic blocking pattern (Suursaar et al. 2002). The highest surges usually occur in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland (Fig. 9.12). Such events have been analysed by Klevannyy et al. (2001), Nekrasov et al. (2007), Averkiev and Klevannyy (2010). As most of the cyclones over Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea travel from south-west or west to the east, storm surges are usually generated in the eastern or north-eastern sections of the basin. The surges are particularly pronounced in bays away of the nodal (central) part of the sea, such as the Neva Bay of St Petersburg (up to 421 cm). At the same time, negative surges or sea level lowering occur along the opposite, Swedish, Danish or German coasts. Those high and low sea level areas evolve in time, as the cyclones travel through a particular area. For extreme surges to occur in the coastal waters of Estonia and St Petersburg (and for negative surges on the Swedish and Danish coasts), the centre of a powerful cyclone should bypass Estonia to the north over the Scandinavian Peninsula and Bothnian Sea to make the local wind direction veer from south-west to north-west (Suursaar et al. 2006b; Averkiev and Klevannyy 2010). As the strongest winds occur a few hundred kilometres to the right of the cyclone track, reduced friction on the sea surface and the elongated shape of the Baltic Sea together with the PÃ¤rnu Bay (in case of PÃ¤rnu tide gauge) or Gulf of Finland (for Narva-JÃµesuu and St Petersburg) provides a span for surge waves to increase towards the east. The diminishing water depth and narrowing gulf width reinforce this effect. Since 1703, there have been about 300 flooding events in St Petersburg due to a sea level rise above the critical value of 160 cm (Bogdanov et al. 2000). In 1970, a decision was taken to build a 25-km-long dam with huge closable gates to protect the city. This structure was ï¬nished in 2011. A map of historical water-level maxima around the Baltic Sea coast was recently compiled by Averkiev and Klevannyy (2010) (Fig. 9.12). The authors compiled information from various sources and reported the data according to the relevant national water-level reference system. Data from stations of short duration using tide gauges are also included. Thus, the map is not homogeneous and must be considered a rough picture of extreme water-level maxima in the Baltic Sea (see also Fig. 9.13 for comparison). More detailed information is available from the original references (e.g. Hupfer et al. 2003; Sztobryn et al. 2005 and references therein; DailidienÄ et al. 2006; Suursaar et al. 2006a; Kowalewska-Kalkowska and Wisniewski 2009). Cyclone Gudrun on 9 January 2005, which attained a hurricane-like intensity according to the mean wind speed measurements (up to 34 m sâ1) in Denmark, produced its highest sea level at most of the Estonian tide gauges (275 cm at PÃ¤rnu; the previous highest was 253 cm on 19 October 1967) and some Finnish tide gauges (Helsinki 151 cm,"
231,181,0.403,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.6 Contaminants Contaminants enter the North Sea through various pathways and have had adverse and toxic effects on many species including cold-water corals, seabirds and marine mammals. Oil and oily wastes enter the North Sea from drilling operations, activities on platforms, shipping, harbours and ports, tanker spills and illegal discharges. Tankers and cargo vessels discharge ballast water containing non-indigenous species into the North Sea potentially with severe consequences for the ecosystem. Heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants enter the North Sea via atmospheric deposition and discharges from coastal industries and rivers (Chester et al. 1994). The quantities of most contaminants reaching the North Sea have decreased substantially since around 1985 (OSPAR 2010; Laane et al. 2013). After entering the marine environment, contaminated particles mix with non-contaminated particles. Depending on the transport mechanism associated with seasonal and short-term variations in waves and primary productivity these particles can be widely dispersed or be deposited and so remain within the area. At the seabed older material becomes contaminated by mixing with newly supplied material. Thus, after sedimentation contaminants may be resuspended and redistributed. This causes a long-term transport of toxic persistent compounds towards the North Atlantic up to the Arctic Ocean. Apart from physical mechanisms, bioturbation by infaunal communities may also redistribute pollutants into overlying waters (Kersten 1988). Chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as polychlorinated biphenyls; PCBs) were responsible for a dramatic reduction in the numbers of harbour seals in the Wadden Sea (Reijnders 1982), but after a ban on hunting and a strong reduction in the use of PCBs the population has since increased strongly (Wolff et al. 2010). Exposure to tributyltin (TBT) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) also resulted in adverse effects on organisms (Laane et al. 2013). Some of the persistent organic pollutants entering the North Sea are biomagniï¬ed through the marine food web. 1.6.3.7 Tourism Tourism is exerting high pressure on some coastal areas. Species and habitats could be affected by those activities that disturb wildlife, damage seabed habitat, and which cause noise disturbance and pollution. 1.6.3.8 Ports Port development is expected to continue as a result of increasing ship trafï¬c in the short-sea and containerised cargo markets.

Most of the scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea were performed with regionally limited ocean models with lateral boundaries in the Kattegat or Skagerrak. Due to the proximity of the lateral boundary, results for the Kattegat are not reliable. Instead, projections for the North Sea should be employed to study changes in the Kattegat and Skagerrak (Ãdlandsvik 2008; Holt et al. 2010). Only Madsen (2009) investigated both shallow seasâthe Baltic Sea and the North Seaâsimultaneously and found that warming is greater in the Baltic Sea than that in the North Sea. Holt et al. (2010) found in the A1B scenario that the shelf sea regions warm substantially more than the open ocean, by 1.5â4 Â°C depending on location. These results agree with observed warming trends in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and other shelf seas (Belkin 2009)."
34,982,0.401,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Spoonbills feed by tacto-location during day or night, at low tide (Hancock et al. 1992). While walking, they swing their slightly open bill from side to side; when it contacts prey, it snaps shut, mainly on fish, crayfish, shrimp, insects, and other aquatic invertebrates (Lewis 1983; Dumas 2000). Decline of the species in a specific area of the Gulf could be caused by loss of foraging habitat, although Spoonbills can move to other areas with suitable shallow pools for foraging. Roseate Spoonbills nest in mixed-species colonies with other herons and egrets, although in some places they nest mainly with White Ibis (Imhof 1962). They prefer islands and keys without predator access. In a colony in Nueces Bay, Texas, they nested with Great Blue Herons, Great Egrets, Snowy Egrets, Cattle Egrets, Louisiana Herons, Black-crowned Night Herons, and Laughing Gulls (White et al. 1982), which is typical in other parts of their range. They nest low in trees or shrubs, including mangroves (Sprunt 1954; Portnoy 1977; Lewis 1983). Incubation requires 22â24 days (Lewis 1983), and the nesting season can be prolonged because nesting is not synchronous within a colony (Sprunt 1954). Postbreeding movements require more study, although some birds from Texas move a little south into Mexico (Dumas 2000), and birds from Florida move northward (Hancock et al. 1992). Roseate Spoonbills, like many other wading birds, suffered virtual extirpation in the late 1800s to the mid-1930s because of harvesting for plumes and food. From 1865 to the late 1880s they were limited to small areas in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida (Imhof 1962). They were nearly extirpated by the late 1800s from the U.S. Gulf coast; their numbers declined to only 15 pairs during the end of the plume trade era (Rodgers et al. 1996). Spoonbill numbers gradually increased after protection from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. They first began breeding in Texas in 1923, and Friedmann (1925) saw flocks of 75â100 feeding in shallow water and reported another flock of 1,000 feeding in southern Texas. They increased to 830 pairs by 1941 to 3,000 pairs in the 1970s, and then declined to 1,124 pairs in the 1980s (Dumas 2000). By 1996, they were up to 2,901 pairs (Dumas 2000). In Louisiana, numbers ranged up to 150 pairs in the 1940s, and then increased thereafter (while they decreased in Texas), with a 36 % increase from 1966 to 1989 (Breeding Bird Survey) (Dumas 2000). Data from Florida Bay indicated a steady increase in the number of Roseate Spoonbill colonies, and nests, but great variability among years (Figure 12.22) (Powell et al. 1989). There were fewer than 500 pairs in the 2000s (Lorenz et al. 2008). Thus their numbers appear to have declined. A recent review by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FFWCC 2011a) recommended that Roseate Spoonbills be given the status of threatened because populations are very small and restricted. Nesting colonies are affected by hydrological changes caused by management. For example, construction of canals in the Everglades reduced the flow of freshwater to the Florida Bay and decreased Roseate Spoonbills in the 1980s (Davis et al. 2005). Small fish are the primary food of Roseate Spoonbills in Florida Bay (Bjork and Powell 1994), and without a water depth threshold of 12 cm, fish are not sufficiently concentrated to provide adequate food reserves (Lorenz 2000). Thus, hydrology (salinity gradients, water depth, and dry-down) influences whether birds nest and also their reproductive success (Davis et al. 2005). Delany and Scott (2006) estimated that the number of Roseate Spoonbills in Florida and the West Indies was 3,400 individuals. Data from Shamrock Island in Texas indicated a variable, but generally stable trend from 1973 to 1999 (Gorman and Smith 2001). The number of breeding pairs varied from about 25â200 (Figure 12.23). Thereafter, numbers seemed to increase (TCWS 2012). Using Christmas Bird Counts from 1965 to 2011, Niven and Butcher (2011) reported that wintering Roseate Spoonbills showed a significant increase of 5.9 % per year. Figure 12.24 shows populations from 1951 to 2001."
366,97,0.401,"The Future of the Law of the Sea : Bridging Gaps Between National, Individual and Common Interests","(catches less discards), while when discards are prohibited, the reference is the catches (discounting catches not subject to the landing obligation). On the other hand, flexibility between species is allowed. Catches of species that are subject to the landing obligation and that are caught in excess of quotas of the stocks in question, or catches of species in respect of which the MS has no quota, may be deducted from the quota of the target species provided that they do not exceed 9% of the quota of the target species.86 This second possibilityâflexibility between speciesâhas been seen by some as a breach of RS in favor of the autonomy of MSs, as it allows applying not used-up quotas to other species for which there is no quota, or for which quotas have been exceeded.87 In summary, RS maintains its flexibility mechanisms (quota swapping and yearto-year flexibility), the landing obligation is not absolute (with the exemptions of high survivability, de minimis, prohibited species, and predator-damaged fish), the fishing opportunities that take into account the effect of discards are expected to increase, and some flexibility between species will be admitted. Will this be enough? The biggest concern is with the so-called choke species, which may even further reduce quota exchanges. MSs that previously got rid of certain quotas will now need them to cover the discard ban to prevent that other species strangle the catches of its target species. The real challenges lie with the demersal species. Although we will have to wait to see what happens on the fishing grounds, the experience with pelagic species has not been encouraging. In this case, the choke species have not stimulated quota exchanges but rather reduced them.88 At this point, it should be remembered that one of the objectives of the CFP is to increase productivity in fisheries by ensuring the rational development of fisheries production and the optimum utilization of the factors of production, in particular labor.89 A notion that must be understood in the light of other objectives, which include a fair standard of living for the fishing community and supply at reasonable prices. This management of resources must also take into account the peculiarities resulting from structural and natural disparities between the various fishing regions,"
241,588,0.4,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The GIAâa readjustment of the Earthâs crust to the offloading of the ice sheets in the northern hemisphere that formed during the last glaciationâexerts a strong influence on sea level relative to land. Land uplift is stronger in the northern Baltic Sea, attaining rates close to 10 mm yearâ1, whereas in the southern Baltic Sea, it is close to equilibrium with some areas sinking by about 1 mm yearâ1. Analysis of individual records of land-locked tide gauge measurements corrected for the vertical land movements indicate that Baltic Sea sea level may have risen during the twentieth century at rates of around 1.5 mm yearâ1, which are close to the rate of global sea level rise. However, uncertainty is large because the margin of error of the estimates of land upliftâbased on GPS dataâmay be locally of the order of 1 mm yearâ1, and the time overlap between tide gauges and GPS measurements is short. An accurate estimate of absolute, climateinduced, Baltic Sea sea level rise over the twentieth century, is still not available, but is unlikely to deviate much from the global average. In more recent decades, as satellite altimetry data have become available, the basinwide rate of sea level rise may be around 5 mm yearâ1 (with an uncertainty of roughly Â±3 mm yearâ1) with the central estimate thus higher than the recent global mean of 3.2 mm yearâ1. Sea level records display long-term developments that are still not fully explained. These include (1) the long-term widening of the annual cycle of sea level (winter maxima minus spring minima), (2) the more positive long-term trends of upper-range sea level measurements as opposed to lower-range sea levelsâthus implying a long-term widening in the range of sea level observations, and (3) the timevarying correlation between sea level records and the main patterns of atmospheric climate variability, such as the NAO. Extreme sea level is caused by storm surges driven by the passage of atmospheric cyclones. There is some evidence that the intensity of storm surges may have increased in recent decades in some parts of the Baltic Sea, and this has been attributed to long-term shifts in the tracks of some types of cyclone rather than to long-term change in the intensity of storminess.

Several international treaties include provisions relating to a duty to render assistance at sea. The prevalence of treaties has been ascribed in part to the quite old but still well-known sinking of the Titanic, which raised demand for international cooperation in safety matters. The most widely applicable treaty rule, however, is Art. 98 of the UNCLOS: Every State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag, in so far as he can do so without serious danger to the ship, the crew or the passengers: (a) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost; (b) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him; (c) after a collision, to render assistance to the other ship, its crew and its passengers and, where possible, to inform the other ship of the name of his own ship, its port of registry and the nearest port at which it will call (emphasis added).79"

231,182,0.399,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"1.6.3.9 Non-indigenous Species Many studies report the occurrence of non-indigenous species in the North Sea that may have been introduced via ballast water from cargo ships, shipping or mariculture. Some new species are also reported that were misidentiï¬ed in the past (GÃ³mez, 2008). Two examples of imported species are the American comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi ï¬rst recorded in the North Sea in 2006 (Faasse and Bayha 2006) and the Paciï¬c oyster Crassostrea gigantea which was introduced in the 1980s on selected plots in the Wadden Sea used for cultivation of shellï¬sh (Drinkwaard 1998). A combination of over-exploitation of native oyster Ostrea edulis and import of the Paciï¬c oyster has almost driven the former to vanish (Reise et al. 2010). Jellyï¬sh concentrations are expected to increase across the entire North Sea in the next 100 years, owing to the projected rise in water temperature and fall in pH (Attrill et al. 2007; Blackford and Gilbert 2007). The ability of jellyï¬sh to reproduce in a short time may affect pelagic and coastal ecosystems (Purcell 2005; SchlÃ¼ter et al. 2010). An example of a non-indigenous phytoplankton species that is now well established in the North Sea is the diatom Coscinodiscus wailesii, which originated in the Paciï¬c Ocean (Edwards et al. 2001; Wiltshire et al. 2010). 1.6.3.10 Climate Change Chapters 3 and 6 provide a detailed description of climate change in the marine system. The following examples show that biological and physical effects of climate change are probably already being observed within the North Sea. Major south-north changes in distribution and abundance related to rising temperatures have been detected for two key calanoid copepods, the cold-water species Calanus ï¬nmarchicus and the warm-water species C. helgolandicus (Planque and Fromentin 1996). Annual abundance of C. ï¬nmarchicus, which was usually high in the northern North Sea, decreased and the population has shifted north out of the North Sea (Beaugrand et al. 2009). Former high abundance of C. helgolandicus in the central and southern North Sea declined in that area and higher abundances were found further north (HelaouÃ«t and Beaugrand 2007). During the summer period after the onset of stratiï¬cation decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations in the bottom water at the North Dogger and Oyster Grounds were observed related to an increase in seasonal bottom water temperature (Greenwood et al. 2010)."

Habitats are intermixed in different patch sizes, and the interface serves as the gateway for movement into both aquatic and terrestrial environments. While it is impossible to clearly define the coastal zone, functionally it is the area on either side of the actual meeting of the land and ocean that is influenced by both marine and terrestrial inputs. The margins themselves are usually narrow, providing an opportunity for animals to move quickly from one habitat to another (Burger 1991a). Since these characteristics apply to both plant and invertebrate communities, the diversity is amplified in higher trophic levels, such as fish, birds, and mammals. The land-water interface also serves as a physical buffer for both the marine ecosystem and for the terrestrial system. Estuarine and coastal environments protect inland terrestrial habitats from excessively high tides, hurricanes, erosion, and other severe storm events, while protecting marine environments from contamination by providing a sink for contaminants. The margin constantly changes due to the effects of wind and water. Because it is large, the Gulf of Mexico has a long coastline with a wide range of habitats. Because of its geographical position, it has a diversity of habitats that extend from tropical to temperate and from coastal to offshore islands. The Gulf serves as a conduit or migration route to southern wintering grounds between the United States (and more northern Canada) and Mexico, Central America, and South America (Gallardo et al. 2004). The land mass to the north is larger and serves as a funnel point for birds scattered across North America that are migrating to wintering grounds along the Gulf of Mexico or farther south. Most of the birds of the Gulf of Mexico are tied to the coastal zone because of breeding constraints and foraging opportunities. Gallardo et al. (2009) lists 395 species in 53 families as the number of bird species in the Gulf region. The main families in the Gulf are ducks (Anatidae, 46 species), gulls, terns and skimmers (Laridae, N Â¼ 41), herons and egrets (Ardeidae, N Â¼ 17), rails (Rallidae, N Â¼ 16), warblers (Parulidae, N Â¼ 36), and flycatchers (Tyrannidae, N Â¼ 17). The latter two groups are Passerines, but they frequently occur on coastal islands, on marshes, and in coastal forest habitats either as migrants or during the breeding season (Moore et al. 1990; Buler et al. 2007; Buler and Moore 2011). For a full list of the species, see Gallardo et al. (2009). Coasts are impacted by weather and storm events, as well as anthropogenic factors, such as alteration of hydrological processes, introduction of toxic chemicals and nutrients, increased human population density, increased fishing and other commercial enterprises, development of wind energy, increased numbers of oil and gas platforms, and direct human disturbance. Half of the continental U.S. population resides within 50 mile of the coasts, making them the most rapidly growing areas in the United States. From the 1960s to 2015, the population density of all Gulf coastal counties is expected to increase from 187 to 327 people per square mile (NOAA 1998). Condominiums, resorts, casinos, and other commercial and industrial development already characterize large expanses of the northern Gulf Coast. Development of wind energy is ongoing, both nearshore and offshore, and has the potential"
35,55,0.392,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"Marine extractive species include a large variety of species, which can be subdivided into three main groups among animals and algae: (1) ï¬lter feeders, such as oysters and mussels, (2) deposit feeders, such as polychaetes, sea urchins and sea cucumbers, as well as (3) dissolved nutrient absorbers, such as microalgae and macroalgae. These species act as living ï¬lters and can be raised without supplemental feed as they take up nutrients for nourishment from the surrounding water column. While ï¬lter and deposit feeders preferentially use small and large POM for their nutrition, algae extract dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN) from the water column. The POM mainly consists of naturally occurring seston and uneaten ï¬sh feed, faeces and bacterial matts in aquaculture operations. The dissolved fraction consists of inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) available from nature and released from fed aquaculture operations. As deposit feeders are not yet often used in offshore environments or in multi-use platforms, they are not discussed further within this chapter."

241,1114,0.392,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"19.2.2 Zooplankton It is well known that oceanic zooplankton respond to variations in climate (e.g. Beaugrand and Reid 2003; Hays et al. 2005). The response has usually been explained as a bottomup process: the atmospheric forcing influences primary productivity through hydrography and stratiï¬cation of water, which changes mixing depth, light and availability of nutrients. This in turn affects grazing zooplankton, planktivorous ï¬sh and even seabirds (Aebischer et al. 1990; Frederiksen et al. 2006). Similar responses to climate or weather parameters have also been shown in the Baltic Sea. For instance in the Gulf of Finland, there was a signiï¬cant positive correlation between westerly winds and the abundance of marine copepods, whereas easterly winds promoted a high abundance of small euryhaline cladocerans (Viitasalo et al. 1995). This could have been caused by westerly winds advecting saline waterâ and marine speciesâfrom the northern Baltic Proper into the Gulf of Finland, and it remained unclear whether any trophic effects were involved. In contrast, rotifers and cladocerans were positively associated with high sea surface temperatures in summer (Viitasalo et al. 1995). In this case, the warm water probably increased growth rates of these surface-dwelling taxa and also increased the availability of suitable small-sized food in the strongly stratiï¬ed water (Kivi et al. 1993). In an analysis of open-sea monitoring data for the Gulf of Finland and northern Baltic Proper in 1979â2008, rotifers also increased at the expense of crustacean zooplankton, apparently due to the combined effects of changes in hydrography, eutrophication and top-down pressure (Suikkanen et al. 2013). This resulted in a shift towards a food web structure with smaller sized organisms."

It has been proposed that such wide fluctuations are due to environmentally constrained primary productivity, which regulates energy budgets of this herbivorous turtle (Broderick et al. 2001). In the Florida Panhandle, green turtles nest along Eglin Air Force Base on Santa Rosa Island; 16 and 14 nests were laid in 1994 and 1996, respectively, while no nests were recorded in 1995 or 1997 (Lamont et al. 1998). This small nesting population also displays the annual nesting fluctuations characteristic of green turtle rookeries mentioned above. Green turtles also nest on the low-relief mangrove islands located in the Ten Thousand Islands in southwest Florida (Foley et al. 2000). From 1993 through 2002, the number of green turtle nests laid on Mexican beaches ranged from about 1,000 to over 7,000, with a high recorded in 2,000 of more than 7,200 nests, representing approximately 2,570 nesting females (Figure 11.31). Interannual fluctuations in green turtle nesting are also apparent for the Mexican Gulf coast (Figure 11.31). A summary of nesting data on Mexican beaches from 1993 through 2002 indicated that most green turtles nested in the state of Quintana Roo, followed by Veracruz, YucataÌn, Campeche, and Tamaulipas, with an estimated mean annual total of 1,430, 730, 633, 535, and 141 nests, respectively (MaÌrquez-M 2004). Daily nesting beach reconnaissance efforts along the YucataÌn Peninsula indicates that green turtle nesting has increased. In the early 1980s, approximately 875 nests per year were laid; by 2000, nesting had increased to more than 1,500 nests per year (Instituto Nacional de Pesca unpublished data cited in NMFS and USFWS 2007c). By 2004, about 1,547 females were estimated to nest on YucataÌn Peninsula beaches (IUCN 2004).

Dolphinfish spawn in warm ocean currents (water temperatures greater than 24  C) throughout much of the year (Tables 9.36, 9.37, and 9.38), and spawning occurs in the open water when the water temperature rises. The spawning season varies greatly with latitude. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, spawning occurs at least from April through December, while spawning takes place throughout the year in the southern Gulf of Mexico, and oceanic waters are preferred (Tables 9.36 and 9.37). Larval and juvenile dolphinfish are commonly found in floating seaweed (Gibbs and Collette 1959; Beardsley 1967; Rose and Hassler 1974). In waters above 34  C, dolphinfish larvae are found year-round, with greater numbers detected in spring and fall. In a study conducted in the northern Gulf of Mexico, 70 % of the youngest larvae collected were found at a depth greater than 180 m (590 ft). Dolphinfish are among the fastest-growing fish, and they become sexually mature within a few months (Table 9.36). The length at maturity varies spatially, ranging from 35 to 53 cm (13.8â20.9 in.)

Texas processing was at the level with such a small number of firms that reporting it separately would divulge confidential data. From 2006 forward, the Texas data had to be combined with the Louisiana data to maintain confidentiality. Gulf blue crab processing data exists for Alabama, Louisiana/Texas, and Florida west coast. The 2007â2009 average Alabama processed production was six times larger than the next largest, Louisiana/Texas. Recalling the level of landings in Alabama being a 3-year average of approximately ten million pounds, points to significant cross state movement of live blue crab. The 4 % of average Gulf landings clearly would not support the Alabama processing industryâs 4.2 million pounds of blue crab meat. It is an inescapable conclusion that Louisiana was the only state that could have supplied sufficient live crabs for Alabama to attain such a high processed volume."
231,353,0.389,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Ralf Weisse, Andreas Sterl Extreme sea levels pose signiï¬cant threats (such as flooding and/or erosion) to many of the low-lying coastal areas along the North Sea coast. Two of the more recent examples are the events of 31 January/1 February 1953 and 16/17 February 1962 that caused extreme sea levels along much of the North Sea coastline and that were associated with a widespread failure of coastal protection, mostly in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany (e.g. Baxter 2005; Gerritsen 2005). Since then, coastal defences have been substantially enhanced along much of the North Sea coastline. Extreme sea levels usually arise from a combination of factors extending over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales comprising high astronomical tides, storm surges (also referred to as meteorological residuals caused by high wind speeds and inverse barometric pressure effects) and extreme sea states (wind-generated waves at the ocean surface) (Weisse et al. 2012). On longer time scales, rising MSL may increase the risk associated with extreme sea levels as it modiï¬es the baseline upon which extreme sea levels act; that is, it tends to shift the entire frequency distribution towards higher values. The large-scale picture may be modiï¬ed by local conditions. For example, for given wind speed and direction the"

233,552,0.388,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Next Steps Several aspects of this analysis can be modiï¬ed depending on the userâs goals. For example, we took 5 km to be the minimum distance from continental mainland for an archipelago isolated enough to not experience a strong mainland source population. At one extreme, Davies et al. (2007) previously deï¬ned oceanic islands as those more than 200 km away from a continental shelf edge. Distance to mainland would understandably have different consequences on the species if (1) they have some portion of their metapopulation residing on the mainland, or (2) they are able to cross this water gap, albeit rarely. If this assessment was of larger sized islands or patches, one could implement a Î»M score per area (e.g. square kilometre). It is worth mentioning that species richness does not play any role in this ranking. Species richness is an anthropogenic valuation scheme, and this method is unique in considering from the phylogenetic and spatial considerations of the animals themselves. However, something that could be accounted for is complementarity, as in the case where two islands contain the same sets of species. Many sophisticated spatial planning tools try to take this into account, one such being Zonation (Moilanen et al. 2005; Moilanen 2007). It seems logical that species endemic to only one island require the most accurate distribution data, and most rigorous of assessments, because these cases have all their âeggs in one basketâ. Incorporating movement functions would greatly improve the modelâs connectivity aspect, determining how fragmented such oceanic islands are. The availability of such data is increasing, fortunately, and ideally they will improve habitat utilization and connectivity estimates in the future. This method can go beyond islands, however. We had excluded those species with distributions including continents because of how it would inï¬uence the biogeography dynamics. Facultative islanders (of which we found 1611 species), those species with distribution on both island and continent, made up a longer list that could be worthwhile for further study. This would be an interesting question to tackle, because it would be a step closer to quantifying mainland âvalueâ for islands, how to go about quantifying its contribution. Nevertheless, looking at only islands made for a simpler study, and a further interesting one is then to shift our focus towards continents. It would be more broadly useful, and also computationally challenging, to do the same analysis for higher precision information of animal distributions on the continents. The Î»M has the potential to identify important areas for connectivity, so that we might better respond to extinction threats, and therefore might be a better way of prioritising speciï¬c areas for conservation. This index weighs those island âpatchesâ which are most valuable to species with limited ranges and for species with unique phylogenies. Future schemes could consider different weightings and combinations of these two indices. More importantly, for islands a score is calculated by taking an average score over all species. As for island species, we would like to compare our lists with the outcome of the EDGE zones papers. It would be interesting to see whether the islands important for"

These models use species occurrence data together with digital data on environmental layers to help predict where species might occur, allowing targeted in situ observations or monitoring of species of particular interest or of conservation concern. If climatic variables are included among the environmental data, these models offer the potential to coarsely predict how species distributions may shift in response to global climate change (e.g., Bush et al. 2014a)."

231,1180,0.385,North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment,"Year-Class Strength and Implications for Fisheries Fishers and scientists have known for over 100 years that the status of ï¬sh stocks can be greatly influenced by prevailing climatic conditions (Hjort 1914; Cushing 1982). âRecruitmentâ variability is a key measure of stock productivity, and is deï¬ned as the number of juvenile ï¬sh surviving from the annual egg production to be exploited by the ï¬shery. Recruitment is critically dependent on the match or mismatch between the occurrence of the larvae and availability of their zooplankton food (Cushing 1990) as well as other processes that affect early life-history stages (see Petitgas et al. 2013). Empirical data on exploited populations often show strong relationships between recruitment success, ï¬sheries catches and climatic variables. These strong relationships have been demonstrated, for example, for cod (OâBrien et al. 2000; Brander and Mohn 2004; Cook and Heath 2005), plaice (Brunel and Boucher 2007), herring (Nash and Dickey-Collas 2005), mackerel (Jansen and Gislason 2011) and seabass (Pawson 1992). Correlations have been found between ï¬sh recruitment and various climate variables, including sea surface temperature, the NAO and even offshore winds (Table 12.2). A number of publications describing the impact of climate variability (e.g. the NAO and AMO) on small pelagic ï¬shes such as herring, anchovy or sardine in the North Sea have been published in recent years, for example those of Alheit et al. (2012) and GrÃ¶ger et al. (2010). According to the most recent assessment of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the NAO is one of the climate indices for which it is most difï¬cult to provide accurate future projections (IPCC 2013). Recent multi-model studies (e.g. Karpechko 2010) suggest overall that the NAO is likely to become slightly more positive (on average) in the future due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, a slight tendency towards enhanced recruitment and larval abundance of these species in the future could be expected if the relationships observed in the past continue to hold. In the case of cod, there is a well-established relationship between recruitment and sea temperature (OâBrien et al. 2000; Beaugrand et al. 2003), but this relationship varies with regard to the different cod stocks that inhabit the North Atlantic (Planque and FrÃ©dou 1999). For stocks at the northern extremes (e.g. in the Barents Sea) or the western Atlantic (e.g. Labrador), warming leads to enhanced recruitment, while in the North Sea, close to the southern limits of the range, warmer conditions lead to weaker than average year classes (Drinkwater 2005). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, cold conditions were correlated with a sequence of positive recruitment years in North Sea cod"

MSL is sea level averaged into monthly or annual mean values, which are the parameters of most interest to climate researchers (Woodworth et al. 2011). The focus in this chapter is on the last 200 years, when direct âmodernâ measurements of sea level are available from tide gauges and high precision satellite radar altimeter observations. MSL can be inferred indirectly over this period (and thousands of years earlier) using proxy records from salt-marsh sediments and the fossils within them (Gehrels and Woodworth 2013) or archaeology (e.g. ï¬sh tanks built by the Romans), and over much longer time scales (thousands to millions of years) using other paleo-data (e.g. geological records, from corals or isotopic methods). The North Sea coastline has one of the worldâs most densely populated tide gauge networks, with many (>15) records spanning 100 years or longer and a few going back almost continuously to the early 19th century. The tide gauges of Brest and Amsterdam also provide some data for parts of the 18th century and are among the longest sea level records in the world. Since 1992, satellite altimetry has provided near-global coverage of MSL. The advantage of altimetry is that it records geocentric sea level (i.e. measurements relative to the centre of the Earth). By contrast, tide gauges measure the relative changes between the ocean"
233,547,0.384,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Results We found 40 Least Concern and Data Deï¬cient species that possess a high combined score of Î»M and ED (see Table 1). In total, 42 of the island mammal species we assessed were listed by the IUCN as Data Deï¬cient, 47 as Least Concern, with the remainder as threatened species. Those species already listed as threatened were potentially suffering from other threats (e.g. non-native species as predators/competitors). Focusing on those species that are Data Deï¬cient or Least Concern and have higher Î»M-ED scores would be most beneï¬cial, as their rarity indicate them to be at risk and a high Î»M value represents an important patch, and one that would pay off greatly to conserve. The ï¬ve islands with the highest average Î»M-ED scores, taken by adding all the scores and dividing by our (island-restricted mammals) species richness per island were Jamaica, Guadalcanal, Isle of Pines, Madagascar, and Nggela Sule (see Table 2, Fig. 3 for map). Interestingly, Madagascar held 39 of the highest Î»M-ED species, and ranked fourth in our Î»M-ED islands list. We found that combining evolutionary distinctness with Î»M revealed species that may be of concern that were not otherwise noticed. Because quantifying fragmentation effects on species takes into account spatial conï¬guration, this can help to improve threat status assessments. The EDGE programme has already sought to visualize regions in the world with the most rare species and moved to prioritize those particular species. This adds a spatial understanding of the species distribution to that prioritization."
241,908,0.383,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"There is a wide variety of shore types on the Baltic Sea coasts: chalk cliffs, barrier islands with coastal lagoons, sandy beaches, flat clay shores, rocky shores and esker shores (see also Chap. 20). All these environments are subject to particular erosional and depositional processes, which are mediated by different shore-forming forces such as wave energy. These drivers, in turn, vary in response to changing weather conditions making them sensitive to climate change. Furthermore, the prevailing processes in the shore areas are also affected by the post-glacial land uplift of the Fennoscandian crust. There are several ways to classify coastal areas (e.g. Bird 2000; Fairbridge 2004; Finkl 2004) and the Baltic Sea coasts have been classiï¬ed by several authors (Furman et al. 1998; FrisÃ©n et al. 2005; HELCOM 2012; see also Chap. 20). HELCOM (2012) presented six coastal types based on the structural appearance of the coast: â¢ Archipelagosâthe mainland shoreline does not face the open sea â¢ Bodden coasts with lagoonsâlow elevation coasts with dynamic sediment balances â¢ Cliffsâerosional shores of soft sedimentary rocks â¢ Fjords and rocky shoresâhard rock environments with glacial erosion patterns â¢ Intended low coastsâlow elevation coasts with marshes and skerries â¢ Open low coastâoften sandy dynamic coasts. Shore openness deï¬nes the shoreâs exposure to the open sea and so portrays the wave formation potential (Ekebom et al. 2003; Tolvanen and Suominen 2005; MurtojÃ¤rvi et al. 2007). On coasts with low shore density, the shore openness is generally high, while on high shore density coasts, most of the shoreline is sheltered by surrounding islands. Owing to its restricted connection to the World Ocean, the Baltic Sea is effectively non-tidal. There are, however, irregular water level fluctuations caused by changes in atmospheric pressure, precipitation, wind strength and standing wave oscillation (seiche) (Myrberg et al. 2006; Chap. 9). The combined effect of these factors may under some circumstances cause local sea-level fluctuations in large bays of up to 3.2 m in the northernmost part of the Bothnian Bay (FrisÃ©n et al. 2005). An increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events may increase the frequency of extreme water level events (i.e. surges) on the Baltic Sea coasts. During warmer than normal winters, storms can also cause local sea-level rise, which together with ice dams in rivers and seiche fluctuations may increase winter flooding of Baltic Sea shores. The formation of sea ice influences Baltic Sea shores (see also Chap. 8). Ice usually forms ï¬rst in shallow inland bays, extending gradually towards the open sea. Sea ice in contact with the shore can cause local erosion through tearing as well as deposition by ice push (e.g. Forbes and Taylor 1994). Annual sea ice dynamics vary from year to year depending"

The annual recreational harvest (A + B1) of snappers from Florida waters expressed in pounds and as a percentage of the Gulf harvest is presented in Figure 10.109. As indicated, harvested pounds have been highly variable on an annual basis with a range from less than 2.5 million pounds to more than 5.5 million pounds. Since 1995, pounds of snappers harvested from Florida waters have averaged 3.8 million annually which represented almost 60 % of the total Gulf recreational snapper harvest (excluding Texas). Furthermore, as indicated, Floridaâs share of the Gulfâs total closely mimics the absolute Florida harvest in pounds. There are a large number of snapper species caught in Florida, with red snapper contributing the largest share of the total harvested poundage (A + B1). There has been a significant increase in the harvest of this species since 1995 (Figure 10.110, left panel) and this increase is generally attributed to growth in the stock and expansion of the stock from the northern Gulf to the Florida panhandle and down through the eastern Gulf."

To examine dead or dying stranding animals, one required a permit or special permission and such was seldom obtained before the animal decomposed too much to be evaluated. A few cases of single stranded animals appeared to result from an ectopic parasite. Trematodes and nematodes or their eggs have been found in the brains of these animals along the Pacific coast, and, in the Gulf during the 1980s, we observed in stranded bottlenose dolphins lung infections of metastrongyle nematodes Halocercus lagenorhynchi and Skrjabinalius cryptocephalus associated with pneumonia. Those findings compared favorably with those reported by Fauquier et al. (2009). Dailey et al.

Thus, much of the understanding of trends in North Sea benthos is based on evidence from relatively few sites. However, because most benthic animals have planktonic life stages the recent advances in molecular analysis mean preserved plankton samples can be now be reanalysed (Kirby and Lindley 2005). North Sea plankton samples, collected monthly by CPR since 1948 from all parts of the North Sea, show increasing abundance of meroplankton (the planktonic life stages of benthic species) and a decline in the abundance of holoplankton (permanent planktonic species) since 1958 (Lindley and Batten 2002). In contrast to deeper water benthic species, rocky shore species are easier to survey due to their greater accessibility and because their community dynamics, biodiversity and ecology can be studied experimentally (Sagarin et al. 1999; Tomanek and Helmuth 2002). Benthic community structure in the North Sea is affected by hydrographic variables; bottom water temperature has a particularly strong influence, but also bottom water salinity, and tidal stress (for the infauna). Chapter 1 discusses the dynamics of water masses in the North Sea and effects on hydrographic properties which affect the composition and productivity of pelagic (planktonic) communities (see Sect. 8.2) which, in turn, affect the benthic communities. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) drives some of the observed changes in benthic-pelagic coupling and has been shown to affect benthic communities off north-eastern Germany (KrÃ¶ncke et al. 1998, 2001) and in the Skagerrak off western Sweden (Tunberg and Nelson 1998), by causing variability in nutrient supply, changes in planktonic biomass and so"
241,474,0.381,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Owing to the transient nature of the atmospheric conditions over the Baltic Sea, the flow ï¬eld is highly variable, and thus changes in the resulting circulation and upwelling are difï¬cult to observe. However, three-dimensional models, forced by realistic atmospheric forcing conditions and river run-off, have reached a state of accuracy such that the highly fluctuating current ï¬eld and associated evolution of the temperature and salinity ï¬elds can be realistically simulated. Changes in the characteristics of the large-scale atmospheric wind ï¬eld over the central and eastern North Atlantic can be described by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, see Chap. 4, Box 4.1). Weakened westerlies across northern Europe, which is characteristic of the negative phase of the NAO, are a precondition for outflow from the Baltic Sea. Thus, negative phases of the NAO have the potential to indirectly affect circulation in the Baltic Sea and water mass exchange with the North Sea (Lehmann et al. 2002). The linear correlation between the volume exchange of the Baltic Sea and the NAO index is only r = 0.28 (r = 0.49 for the NAO winter index DJFM, December through March). A better relation of the wind ï¬eld over the Baltic Sea to the large-scale atmospheric circulation is given by the (BSI), which is signiï¬cantly related to the NAO. Furthermore, the BSI is highly correlated with the variation in water storage in the Baltic Sea and volume exchange with the Danish Sounds. For northern Europe, the NAO accounts for about 50 % of the dominant climate winter regimes, the âblockingâ"

Clearly, large uncertainties are associated with the current assessment of the red drum stock status described above. A bottom longline survey program has been developed to collect data for monitoring the red drum stock dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico (Powers et al. 2012). The condition of red drum within the Gulf of Mexico may also vary greatly from location to location. For example, the red drum population along the Florida Gulf coast appears to be recovered (Figure 9.52). Regardless of the uncertainties, the evolution of this fishery clearly demonstrates the necessity and importance of appropriate management regulations in improving the status of fish populations."

DePaola et al. (1994) noted that the prevalence of V. vulnificus collected offshore in the Gulf (32â35 ppt) was 11.8 % compared with 13 % in Galveston open Gulf beaches (18.9 ppt) and 68 % in the Galveston Bay estuary (11.3 ppt). Tao et al. (2012) found that a statistically significant ( p < 0.0001) inverse correlation between V. vulnificus-positive fish and salinity existed as did a positive correlation ( p < 0.03) between water temperature and V. vulnificuspositive fish in Gulf locations of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, Gulf Shores and Dauphin Island, Alabama. In addition to the fish listed above by DePaola et al. (1994), Tao et al. (2012) also reported ladyfish (Elops saurus), striped mullet, silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), sand weakfish (Cynoscion arenarius), spotted weakfish (Cynoscion nebulosus), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) to have V. vulnificus on the body surface. Buck (1990) isolated V. alginolyticus, V. damselae, and V. parahaemolyticus from fish from the GoM and adjacent Sarasota Bay, Florida. These isolates came from the gills, intestinal tract, mouth, surface skin, spines, and teeth. Exophthalmia, a condition known as âbugeye,â commonly affects fishes in the GoM. The most common cause is bacterial as shown in the red snapper maintained in culture (Figure 14.14). Figure 14.15 shows a case in the sheepshead minnow that also was probably bacterial in nature. The condition, however, can result from a variety of causes. When a trematode metacercaria infects the eye, especially in a semi-enclosed locality, a large percentage of the fish intermediate host population can be infected.

At the northern and southern extremes of their distribution, Atlantic sailfish occur only in the warmer months. The seasonal changes in distribution may be linked to prey migrations. The rates of Atlantic sailfish bycatch in the pelagic longline fisheries are two times higher in the Gulf of Mexico than in other areas of the North Atlantic during the spawning season, from May through September (De Sylva and Breder 1997), suggesting that spawning biomass in the Gulf of Mexico tends to be higher than spawning biomass in other areas of the Atlantic. This suggests that the Gulf of Mexico provides an important spawning and larval habitat for Atlantic sailfish. Essential fish habitat has been designated for juvenile, adult, and spawning Atlantic sailfish. These habitats are described in Table 9.26 and shown in Figures 9.42, 9.43, 9.44, and 9.45."

Subsequently, a moratorium was placed on the issuance of new permits and, according to unpublished NMFS records, a total of 1,907 vessels were permitted under the Gulf shrimp moratorium permit in 2009 (i.e., the upper-bound estimate of the number of vessels that would be legally allowed to shrimp in the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico). Of this total, 693 of the vessels, or more than one-third of the total, were home-ported in Texas. Louisiana ranked second (545 permits; 29 %), followed by Florida (278 permits; 15 %), Mississippi (164 permits), and Alabama (149 permits). While the number of permits equaled about 1,900 in 2009, Liese and Travis (2010) report that only about 1,215 of these actively harvested shrimp in 2009. In addition to those vessels holding a Gulf shrimp moratorium permit, which is required for shrimping in federal waters, a large number of boats shrimp only in the state waters. Based on state license sales, Miller and Isaacs (2011) estimate that the population of inshore shrimpers, excluding those that had a Gulf shrimp moratorium permit, approximated 3,765 in 2009.

241,1077,0.377,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"18.4.3.2 Past Changes A large set of historical CO2 data for the northern Baltic Sea including the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland is available for 1927â1938 when the ï¬rst pioneering studies on the marine CO2 system were performed by Kurt Buch and co-workers at the Finnish Institute of Marine Research (FIMR) in Helsinki. They determined equilibrium constants for the CO2 system that agreed reasonably well with those determined by more sophisticated analytical techniques in recent years. This indicates that their data can be compared against the presentday status of the marine CO2 system. The current text restricts discussion on possible change in the CO2 system to the surface water because interpreting the deep-water CO2 data requires detailed information about the chronology of water mass stagnation and renewal events. This is not available for the Buch (1945) data, which give only seasonal mean values. Surface water pCO2 reflects the interplay between biological production, mineralisation and mixing, and has undergone large changes during the past 80 years. In Buchâs (1945) data, the pCO2 minimum after the spring bloom in the eastern Gotland Sea was about 270 Âµatm. Taking into account the lower atmospheric pCO2 during the 1930s (about 320 Âµatm, Callendar 1940), a CO2 partial pressure difference, DpCO2, of about â50 Âµatm is obtained which indicates moderate undersaturation of the surface water with regard to atmospheric CO2. Recent pCO2 measurements show a spring bloom minimum of about 150 Âµatm which corresponds to a DpCO2 of â250 Âµatm (Schneider 2011). This undersaturation is about ï¬vefold larger than at the beginning of the last century and can be attributed to increased organic matter production as a consequence of eutrophication. Although this is consistent with other historic production estimates, it must be taken into account that Buchâs (1945) spring value refers only to a single year and so its representation for the spring bloom can be questioned. The changes in surface water DpCO2 during the past 80 years are even more pronounced in midsummer. Due to the intense N2 ï¬xation in July, the DpCO2 in the central Baltic Sea currently amounts to almost â300 Âµatm (Schneider et al. 2009), whereas the mean DpCO2 at this time of year for 1927â1935 was less than â40 Âµatm (Buch"
