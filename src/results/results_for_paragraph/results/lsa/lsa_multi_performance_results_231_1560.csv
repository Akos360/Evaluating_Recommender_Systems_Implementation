297,1755,0.515,The R Book,"Now, of course, there are many assumptions here. The most important is that the two variances and the prior mean are known without error, and that the unknown parameter is normally distributed. These assumptions are all relaxed in more advanced Bayesian models. Let us take a simple example, just to illustrate the concept of shrinkage. Suppose that Smith was the ï¬rst to estimate the productivity of this particular kind of grassland, and she found a mean of 500 units per unit area with a standard deviation of 25. Our new data give a mean of 420 with a standard deviation of 10. If we use Smithâs ï¬ndings as our prior, we get a posterior variance, v, of roughly 86 like this: (v <- 1/(1/25Ë2+1/10Ë2)) [1] 86.2069 The posterior mean is given by (v*(500/25Ë2 + 420/10Ë2)) [1] 431.0345 So the prior was N(500, 252 ), the likelihood from the new data was N(420, 102 ) and the posterior was N(431, 92 ). The new mean is closer to the likelihood than to the prior, and the standard deviation is substantially lower. Jones, working a decade later than Smith, found a mean of 400 with a standard deviation of 20. How much difference would it have made if we had taken Jones rather than Smith for our estimate of the prior? Now the posterior variance would be (v2 <- 1/(1/20Ë2+1/10Ë2)) [1] 80 and the new posterior mean would be (v2*(400/20Ë2 + 420/10Ë2)) [1] 416 The posterior variance is roughly the same as before, but the posterior mean is slightly lower: N(416, 92 ) compared to N(431, 92 ). So our choice of priors does matter, and the smaller our new sample, the more that choice matters. With three studies, we might have done a meta-analysis (see Chapter 21)."

320,71,0.489,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"The model output is taken from various regional model simulations driven by different European Global Climate Models produced in the European project ENSEMBLES (van der Linden and Mitchell 2009). The projections up to 2100 use a common forcing under A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario. The European warming will be higher than the global mean temperature increase. As can be seen in Fig. 2.3 this temperature increase is different from region to region and season to season. In the autumn and winter months the temperature change in North and Eastern Europe will be higher (up to 3  C) compared to South Europe (1â1.5  C). The warming in winter increases from the western coastal regions of Europe to the eastern continental interiors (Giorgi et al. 2004; Rowell 2005). This can be mainly explained through two mechanisms. The first is the influence of the rather modest warming of the ocean on the climate of the western parts of Europe (Rowell 2005), and the second is the snow albedo feedback mechanism. If the warming depletes the snow cover, the albedo decreases and more solar radiation reaches the surface, which in turn enhances the surface warming, accelerates the snow depletion, and sustains a positive feedback mechanism (Giorgi et al. 2004; Rowell 2005; KjellstroÌm et al. 2007). Furthermore, the minimum temperatures have risen most, leading to decreased winter temperature variability (RaÌisaÌnen et al. 2004). Adversely, in summer the increase in the south of up to 2.5  C is larger than in the north with an increase of less than 2  C. The projected increase in daily mean temperature varies overall. The model projections show a clear warming trend for the future, although there are regional and seasonal differences in the magnitude of the projected temperature increase.

241,453,0.475,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"since the mid-1980s. Although single remote sensing images are frequently disturbed by cloud coverage, skin layer uncertainties and other factors, the monthly mean SST from the remote sensing data agree well with those from in situ measurements in the offshore sea areas (Siegel et al. 2006; Bradtke et al. 2010). Lehmann et al. (2011) used remote sensing data for 1990â2008 to derive a linear trend of annual mean SST of up to 1 Â°C per decade in the northern part of the Bothnian Bay, but a high increase was also found in the Gulf of Finland and Gulf of Riga and in the northern Baltic Proper (Fig. 7.2). Warming of surface waters is lowest (0.3â0.5 Â°C per decade), north-east from Bornholm Island up to and along the Swedish coast, probably due to an increase in the frequency of coastal upwelling (Lehmann et al. 2012). Bradtke et al. (2010) also considered trends in monthly and seasonal mean values during 1986â2006 and found the highest positive trend (more than 2 Â°C per decade in August) in the Bothnian Sea and the northern Baltic Proper. At the same time, mean SST in March decreased. Siegel et al. (2006) studied the period 1990â2004 and found the highest rate of increase in the Bothnian Sea in July (more than 3 Â°C per decade), and in the Arkona and Gotland Sea in August and September (about 1.5 Â°C per decade). Trends in SST for the past three to four decades based on data from remote sensing generally agree well with trends determined from independent in situ observations of SST. Deep-water temperature in the Baltic Proper is determined mainly by the lateral spread of submerged saline water of North Sea origin, reflecting surface thermal conditions during deep-water formation.

For example, models generally have problems with sub-grid precipitation, simulating precipitation more often, but in lower amounts, than reality. As precipitation scavenging is a complex and nonlinear process (e.g. Barrie 1992) such issues will cause errors in modelled wet deposition that are difï¬cult to evaluate. There are also many uncertainties inherent in the deposition monitoring methods themselves (Draaijers and Erisman 1993; Erisman et al. 2005). Large differences between models were found in the global models participating in the COSAM study, in which the wet deposition efï¬ciency varied by a factor of four (Roelofs et al. 2001). A similar spread was also found for global models by Dentener et al. (2006) and Textor et al. (2006).

For mucuna biomass results were satisfactory with mean observed yields of 4263 kg/ha and simulated of 4224 kg/ha. The model was also evaluated for its ability to simulate maize grain yield variability across farming households. The model showed capacity to simulate the middle yield range from the farming households but did not perform so well for the lower and higher yields (Masikati et al. 2015).

As delta regions are particularly sensitive to precipitation and river runoff, outputs from an integrated catchment model (see Chap. 13 and Whitehead et al. 2015a, b) were used to determine run-off and associated nutrient loadings from the delta rivers into the Bay of Bengal. The model took account of both climatic scenarios (Q0, Q8, Q16) and patterns of upstream water use according to three socio-economic scenarios (Less Sustainable (LS), Business As Usual, (BAU), More Sustainable (MS)) scenarios (Whitehead et al. 2015a, b). The results of the Q0-BAU, Q8-LS and Q16-MS were used in further simulations. A regional POLCOMS-ERSEM coupled model (Holt et al. 2009; ButenschÃ¶n et al. 2016) was used to project both the physical state of the ocean (temperature, salinity, currents, light level), as well as the biogeochemistry and plankton production in the Bay of Bengal (see Chap. 14). The model simulates the dynamics of nutrients (C, P, N and Si), phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria, as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter. The model domain covers the entire coastal area of Bangladesh up to 200 km beyond the edge of the continental shelf, with a horizontal resolution of 0.1Â° and 42 vertical levels. For each climate dataset, the model was run continuously for 1971â2099. Outputs from the POLCOMS-ERSEM model were then used to drive a dynamic marine ecosystem model that predicts potential production by size class of fish, taking into account food availability, predation effects and temperature effects on feeding and mortality (Blanchard et al. 2012). Size-based methods like this are useful in that they capture the basic metabolic properties and dynamics of marine food webs, describing energy flux and production by size class, independent of speciesâ ecology (Blanchard et al. 2012). To make specific projections for key species, however, a second model, called SS-DBEM, was used (Fernandes et al. 2013, 2016, 2017), which projects changes in species distribution and abundance over time while explicitly considering changes in production, dispersal and physiology as a result of changing ocean conditions, as well as species interactions (Fernandes et al. 2013). The size-spectrum model was applied to explore potential changes in the total productivity of the Bangladesh Exclusive Economic Zone under both climate change and"

394,201,0.429,Biotechnologies for Plant Mutation Breeding : Protocols,"break (DSB) induction. The repair of DSBs via nonhomologous end-joining is error-prone to some extent and therefore can lead to nucleotide deletions or insertions (indels) at the breakage site (Waterworth et al. 2011). Depending on the type of mutation, this can result in functional modification, complete disruption of gene function, or removal of whole gene clusters from the plant genome. For application of this technique in model and crop plant species, the following customizable endonuclease platforms with different benefits and drawbacks are available: meganucleases, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs); the latter derive from a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPRassociated (CRISPR/Cas) microbial defense system [reviewed in Fichtner et al. (2014)]. TALENs are created by the fusion of a customized TALE DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the FokI restriction-endonuclease domain (FokI-R) (Christian et al. 2010). Primarily, a TALE-DBD from plant pathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas sp. consists of a variable number of nearly identical amino acid repeats. Each repeat has a length of 33â35 amino acids and binds preferentially to a certain nucleotide of the target DNA sequence (Boch et al. 2009; Moscou and Bogdanove 2009). Different binding specificity of distinct repeats can be explained by variations in amino acids 12 and 13, which are therefore called repeat variable diresidues (RVDs). The amino acid pairs most commonly used in RVDs of TALE-DBDs are NI (binding to adenine), NG (thymine), NN (guanine), and HD (cytosine). Given the opportunity of rearrangement of these repeats, it is possible to assemble a TALE-DBD for virtually any DNA target sequence of choice. Such customized TALEN-DBD in combination with the 25 kDa FokI-R domain, with the latter not having any own DNA-binding specificity (Li et al. 1992), TALENs represent a universal tool for DSB induction. However, FokI-R needs to form dimers to be catalytically active (Bitinaite et al. 1998). Therefore, two TALEN subunits binding to the desired target sequence in inverse orientation to each other are required. This obligatory dimerization decreases the probability for off-target mutations but also doubles the effort to produce an effective TALEN. TALENcoding DNA subunits can be highly efficiently assembled via Golden Gate cloning [e.g., Cermak et al. (2011)], PCR-based methods [e.g., Yang et al. (2013)], or FLASH assembly (Reyon et al. 2012). TALENs are more cost effective and much easier to handle than zinc-finger nucleases (Beumer et al. 2013). Therefore, TALENs were successfully applied for site-directed mutagenesis in a number of model and crop plants like Arabidopsis (Christian et al. 2013), tobacco (Zhang et al. 2013), Nicotiana benthamiana (Mahfouz et al. 2011), Brachypodium distachyon (Shan et al. 2013), rice (Li et al. 2012), Brassica oleracea (Sun et al. 2013), soybean (Haun et al. 2014), wheat (Wang et al. 2014), maize (Liang et al. 2014), and barley (Wendt et al. 2013; Gurushidze et al. 2014)."

Thus, the heterogeneous reactions involve the conversion of calcium carbonate to other calcium salts such as calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2), calcium sulphate (gypsum, CaSO4) or their ammonium salts ((NH4)NO3 and (NH4)HSO4 or (NH4)2SO4) as first demonstrated in laboratory experiments (Krueger et al. 2004) and then observed in recent field studies (Laskin et al. 2005; Matsuki et al. 2005, 2010b; Sullivan and Prather 2007; Shi et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2010). The reactivity of inorganic acids with dust is determined by several factors: chemical mineralogy of dust (Sullivan et al. 2007), transport pathways, the extent to which dust is transported across polluted sources (Sullivan et al. 2007; McKendry et al. 2008) and meteorological and chemical processing. In particular, sulphate and nitrate coating on dust surfaces is favoured in the marine atmosphere where the relative humidity is high (Hanisch and Crowley 2001; Usher et al. 2002; Trochkine et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2003a; Okada and Kai 2004; Ooki and Uematsu 2005; Matsuki et al. 2005). Dallâosto et al. (2010), who compare African dust mixing state at different distances from the emission source, demonstrate a continuous chemical evolution of dust particle composition during atmospheric transport, consistent with the relatively slow atmospheric oxidation of sulphur dioxide. Moreover, measurements on individual particles show evidence of the mineralogy-dependent formation of sulphate/ nitrate on dust particles (Matsuki et al. 2005; Laskin et al. 2005; Sullivan and Prather 2007). Sulphate formation is favoured on aluminosilicate-rich particles (Laskin et al. 2005; Shi et al. 2008) while preferential nitrate formation on carbonate-rich dust is observed (Ro et al. 2005; Sullivan et al. 2007; Matsuki et al. 2010a; Fairlie et al. 2010). It was proposed that the preferential association of sulphate with Al-rich dust is partly due to the oxidation of SO2 to H2SO4 catalysed by transition-metals, mainly iron, present in aluminosilica minerals (Sullivan et al. 2007; Sullivan and Prather 2007). Yet, the opposite behavior of sulphate and nitrate formation on carbonates could be explained by their difference of hygroscopicity (Sullivan et al. 2009; Formenti et al. 2011). Calcium sulphate is poorly water soluble, preventing further uptake of water and other gaseous species, and hence suppressing the transformation of sulphur dioxide to"

285,282,0.417,"Physiology, Psychoacoustics and Cognition in Normal and Impaired Hearing","Most contemporary cochlear implants (CIs) stimulate the auditory nerve with trains of symmetric biphasic pulses consisting of two phases of opposite polarity presented in short succession. Although both polarities can elicit neural responses (Miller et al. 1998, 1999; Klop et al. 2004; Undurraga et al. 2013), they are not equally efficient. Animal recordings performed at the level of the auditory nerve usually show longer latencies and lower thresholds for cathodic than for anodic stimulation (e.g., Miller et al. 1999). This observation is consistent with theoretical models of extracellular electrical stimulation of the nerve showing that a cathodic current produces a larger depolarization and elicits action potentials more peripherally than an anodic current of the same level (Rattay 1989). In past years, studies performed with human CI listeners have shown different results. While at hearing threshold, no consistent difference between polarities has been observed, a large number of studies have reported that anodic stimulation is more effective than cathodic stimulation at suprathreshold levels (Macherey et al. 2006, 2008; Undurraga et al. 2013; Carlyon et al. 2013). This has been shown psychophysically in loudness balancing, pitch ranking and masking experiments and electrophysiologically in measures of electrically-evoked compound action potentials and auditory brainstem responses. Although this result contrasts with the conclusions of most animal reports, an exception is the study by Miller et al. (1998) who found a similar trend in their guinea pigs. Because the results of this specific study are at odds with other measurements performed in the guinea pig (Klop et al. 2004) and with all measurements performed in cats, the first aim of the present study was to clarify the effect of polarity in guinea pigs. This was done by measuring the inferior colliculus evoked potential in response to intracochlear electrical stimulation using various pulse shapes differing in polarity and in current level. Although the reason for the higher sensitivity of human CI users to anodic stimulation remains unknown, predictions from two different -among the few- computational models of the implanted cochlea offer possible explanations (Macherey et al. 2006). First, the modeling results of Rattay et al. (2001) suggest that polarity sensitivity may strongly depend on the state of degeneration and demyelination of the peripheral processes of the neurons. Specifically, the model predicts lower anodic thresholds for degenerated peripheral processes. Although post-mortem studies have shown that such degeneration can occur in CI listeners, there is no currently available method to evaluate the presence of peripheral processes in patients. The second aim of this study was to investigate polarity sensitivity in guinea pigs as a function of time after deafening. Our reasoning was based on the observation that spiral ganglion neurons degenerate over time in deafened animals and that this degeneration first affects the peripheral processes (Koitchev et al. 1982; Cazals et al. 1983). If this degeneration is responsible for the higher anodic sensitivity, we hypothesized that the effect of polarity would change over time. An alternative explanation for the higher anodic sensitivity at high current levels comes from a model of the implanted guinea-pig cochlea (Frijns et al. 1996). This model predicts that cathodic stimulation should elicit action potentials at the periphery of the neurons but that above a certain current level, the propagation of these action potentials may be blocked by the hyperpolarization produced more"

MAGNET was applied to analyse the macroeconomic impacts of large-scale deployment of biomass resources in the Netherlands (Hoefnagels et al. 2013), the macroeconomic impacts of a bio-based economy in Malaysia (van Meijl et al. 2012), and the global leakage effects of EU biofuel consumption (Smeets et al. 2014).

An important constraint of these algorithms is that, at typical non-bloom concentrations, the PIC scattering represents only a few percent of the total scattering. Thus, to maximise the signal to noise ratio, satellite pixels must be aggregated in space and time, in order to define accurate mean concentrations. Currently, more verification with PIC field measurements is underway to optimise the use of PIC ocean-colour data in models (Balch et al. 2011). PIC is also produced by certain zooplanktonic organisms but these particles are too large to be detected by ocean colour (Balch et al. 1996). Different bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use ocean colour data to identify and differentiate between PFTs or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) in the surface ocean. These can be summarised into four main types: spectral-response methods which are based on differences in the shape of the light reflectance/absorption spectrum for different PFTs/PSCs (Sathyendranath et al. 2004; Alvain et al. 2005, 2008; Ciotti and Bricaud 2006; Bracher et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2011; Brewin et al. 2010a; Devred et al. 2011), methods which use information on the magnitude of chlorophyll a biomass or light absorption to distinguish between PFTs or PSCs (Devred et al. 2006; Uitz et al. 2006; Hirata et al. 2008; Brewin et al. 2010b; Hirata et al. 2011; Mouw and Yoder 2010), methods that retrieve the particle size distribution from satellite-derived backscattering signal and derive PSCs (Kostadinov et al. 2010), and ecological-based approaches which use information on environmental factors, such as temperature and wind stress, to supplement the bio-optical data for investigating PFTs (Raitsos et al. 2008). All methods derive dominant phytoplankton groups, while Uitz et al. (2006), Bracher et al. (2009, improved by Sadeghi et al. 2011) and Hirata et al. (2011) also give chl a for the different PFTs. Nearly all the PFT methods mentioned use information from the multispectral ocean colour sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS or MODIS and are based on the parameterisation of a large global or regional in situ data set in order to yield PFTs from satellite chl a or normalised water leaving radiances.

376,405,0.41,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","By contrast, there is no consistent relationship between biomass response to experimental warming and mean annual precipitation (MAP) across terrestrial plants studied (Fig. 7.6; Lin et al. 2010). Experimental warming has been shown to reduce soil water content by increasing evapotranspiration (Harte and Shaw 1995; Wan et al. 2005), with potentially negative effects on ANPP. Warming also may enhance productivity by alleviating low temperature limits on plant growth (Luo 2007; Lin et al. 2010) and increasing N mineralization (Rustad et al. 2001; Dijkstra et al. 2008). These opposing influences of warming may explain why many rangeland experiments have shown little consistent warming effect (Polley et al. 2013) and why interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation are smaller than expected from single-factor effects (Fig. 7.2b; Wu et al. 2011; Morgan et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2013). Corollary 4 Precipitation seasonality regulates ecosystem responses to both CO2 and warming. Warming and CO2 enrichment combined should lead to earlier and more rapid plant growth in ecosystems dominated by winter precipitation because warming will reduce temperature limitations on both growth and growth responses to CO2. On the other hand, warming may reduce CO2 benefits on arid and semiarid rangelands dominated by summer precipitation by increasing evaporative demand. The evaporative potential of air increases nonlinearly with temperature, such that a given increase in temperature will cause a disproportionately large increase in evaporative demand when temperature is high. Plant responses to CO2 enrichment alone also depend on the seasonal distribution of precipitation. CO2 stimulated ANPP of Australian grassland most during years when summer rainfall exceeded rainfall during spring and autumn (Hovenden et al. 2014). High rainfall during cool spring and autumn seasons may reduce production in this grassland by intensifying N limitation to plant growth."
241,676,0.409,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The GCMs were not designed for direct application in impact models. Prudhomme et al. (2002) stated that the quality of their output did not allow for direct use in hydrological impact studies, because the spatial and temporal scales were too coarse. Wilby et al. (1999) recommended the use of downscaling techniques before the GCM output data could be used in impact studies. There are many possibilities for downscaling GCM output: direct use of RCM output (Wood et al. 2004), use of bias-corrected RCM output (Wood et al. 2004; Fowler et al. 2007a), statistical downscaling (Wilby et al. 2000; MÃ¼ller-Wohlfeil et al. 2000), stochastic weather generators (Evans and Schreider 2002) or weather typologies, and/or indices (Pilling and Jones 2002). The skills of different downscaling methods differ considerably between variables and regions. Hydrologic simulation was found to be sensitive to biases in the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation at the monthly level, especially where the seasonal snow pack transfers run-off from one season to the next (Fowler et al. 2007c). Using the example of the Lule River in northern Sweden and two GCMs used to force the same RCM, Graham et al. (2007a) have shown that the choice of driving GCM has a greater impact on results than the choice of GHG emission scenario. The strong impact of the choice of GCM was also emphasised by Widmann et al. (2003), Jasper et al. (2004), SalathÃ© (2005), and Wilby et al. (2006). Fowler et al. (2007a) stated that at least two variablesâ temperature and precipitationâhad to be downscaled for impact studies in hydrology. In impact models, the physical consistency between variables is very important. To obey this requirement for physical consistency, multi-variate methods should be applied which yield simultaneous correction of relevant variables. This is possible when RCMs are used (Fowler and Kilsby 2007; Fowler et al. 2007a; Graham et al. 2007a, b), but is generally not in statistical downscaling. A multi-site approach should be used when spatial consistency is needed."

So although only two of the four reptilian orders are found in New Zealand, the diversity does span an unparalleled phylogenetic scale for this group of vertebrates. Furthermore, New Zealand species diversity is high but only in some parts of the tree (Fig. 3b).

241,1419,0.408,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"There are few studies of land coverâclimate interactions before AD 1850, although the number has increased rapidly since 2009. To date, there are no published modelling studies on the possible feedbacks of CLCC on past natural climate warming such as the well-known Early Holocene increase in mean annual temperatures and on the effects of Late Holocene CLCC and/or ALCC on later climate changes such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (warming) and the Little Ice Age (cooling, see also Chap. 3), except that of Pongratz et al. 2009b. However, simulations of the northwards expansion of trees due to a warmer climate showed that such climate-induced vegetation changes produced a positive feedback on climate (e.g. Cheddadi et al. 1997). There is only one study of the effect of past ALCC on regional climate in Europe using a regional climate model, the LANDCLIM project (Gaillard et al. 2010; Strandberg et al. 2013). The aim of the study was to evaluate the direct effects of anthropogenic deforestation on simulated climate at two contrasting times of the Holocene *6000 BP and *200 BP in Europe applying RCA3, a regional climate model with 50 km spatial resolution (Samuelsson et al. 2011). Three alternative descriptions of the past vegetation were used: (i) potential natural vegetation (V) simulated by the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS (Smith et al. 2001), (ii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land cover (deforestation) as simulated by the HYDE model (V + H), and (iii) potential vegetation with anthropogenic land cover as simulated by the KK model (V + K). The climate model results show that the simulated effects of deforestation depend on both local/regional climate and vegetation characteristics (Strandberg et al. 2013). At *6000 BP, the extent of simulated deforestation in Europe is generally small, but there are areas where deforestation as simulated by Kaplan et al. (2009) (V + K) is large enough to produce signiï¬cant differences in summer temperature of 0.5â1 Â°C, which is the case in southern Sweden and eastern Poland. However, the KK model overestimates deforestation in these areas compared to the pollen-based REVEALS reconstructions. At *200 BP, simulated deforestation is much more extensive than previously assumed, in particular according to the pollen-based REVEALS reconstructions (see Sect. 25.3.3.3) and the KK model. This leads to signiï¬cant temperature differences in large parts of Europe. In winter, deforestation leads to lower temperatures because of the differences in albedo between forested and unforested areas, particularly in the snow-covered regions. In summer, deforestation leads to higher temperatures in Central and eastern Europe since evapotranspiration from unforested areas is lower than from forests (hydrological cycle effect)."

Ingestible and inhalable medicines containing microplastic are used to deliver drugs to the organs of humans and farmed animals (terrestrial and aquatic) because the microplastic can translocate from their lungs or guts into their circulatory system (Thanoo et al. 1993; Dalmon et al. 1995; Curley et al. 1996; Hussain et al. 2001; Matsusaki et al. 2001; Wen et al. 2003; Kockisch et al. 2003; Corbanie et al. 2006). There has, however, been no work to synthesize information about the different types of polymers and sizes of microplastic used in medicines because this information does not seem to be readily available. Pathways. Like microplastics in cleaning products, microplastics from medicines are likely to transfer to habitats through sewage and storm water, or more directly through treating diseased animals in aquaculture and farming. There is, however, no quantitative work evaluating how much plastic is taken up by animals and excreted compared to those retained in tissues. As such, the quantities of medical microplastic in water or sediment sampled from habitats, sewage or storm water are unknown. Research is needed to synthesize a complete inventory of these polymers so that samples from humans, sewage, storm water, wildlife and habitats can be tested for the presence of these polymers. Some of the polymers used are thought to be biodegradable (Matsusaki et al. 2001), whist others can be composed of more durable polymers such as polycarbonate and polystyrene (Thanoo et al. 1993; Dunn et al. 1994). The rates and mechanisms of degradation inside human tissues may not be the same as in wildlife or habitats. Moreover, just because a polymer degrades, does not necessarily mean that the resulting metabolites are not toxic themselves: So, research is needed to determine how safe these particles are in humans, wildlife and habitats."

241,669,0.407,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"As RCMs can resolve mesoscale atmospheric features explicitly, they do add small-scale structures to the largescale circulation provided by the driving model (Feser 2006). This explicit treatment of small-scale atmospheric features leads, for many variables, to an AV with respect to the driving model. This is particularly the case for the simulation of precipitation, which also depends strongly on topography and landâsea contrast, which are better represented at the increased resolution of the RCM. Consequently, the simulated mean precipitation patterns as well as the extreme values are enhanced, especially for complex terrain (e.g. Christensen and Christensen 2001; Feldmann et al. 2008; Suklitsch et al. 2008). For the Baltic Sea region, Walther et al. (2013) demonstrated the improved simulation of the daily precipitation cycle for spring and summer with increasing RCM resolution; an example for a station in central southern Sweden is displayed in Fig. 10.10. Winterfeldt et al. (2011) analysed AV in dynamically downscaled wind speed ï¬elds. They used the Brier skill score (BSS) to detect the AV of the regionally modelled (with spectrally nudged-REMO) wind in comparison with the global reanalysis (NCEP). As seen in Fig. 10.11, the RCM provides AV along the coasts and in narrow bays and straits, in places with complex coastlines or topography. Over open seas and oceans, as well as the interior of Baltic Sea, the BSS is negative, indicating that in these regions, dynamical downscaling does not add value. Feser (2006) analysed AV in the case of SLP and 2 m air temperature provided by the REMO RCM in comparison with NCEP reanalysis data. Spatial ï¬lters were used to separate the data into two domains: that represented best at the large-scale and that represented well by the REMO model (Fig. 10.12). The effect of spectral nudging was also analysed. For SLP, no AV is provided by RCM simulation without nudging. The small improvement was obtained when spectral nudging was applied.

241,623,0.405,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"The biggest disadvantage of the RCM methodology is probably the occurrence of systematic biases in the present climate simulations. These systematic biases, also seen in GCMs, are because dynamic climate simulations carried out with GCMs and RCMs are bound only to changing atmospheric GHG concentrations. Due to their coarse resolution and parameterisations, GCMs and RCMs are not perfect; so even the mean climatological values produced by these models deviate from the corresponding observations. In RCM climate projections, the systematic biases are nonlinear combinations of the systematic errors of the driving GCM and the systematic errors of the RCM itself. Another limitation is that there is still the need to downscale area averages given as grid values in model output to point values necessary for impact studies (Xu et al. 2005). Given the discrepancies between observations and model results for present-day climate, a method is needed to cope with the biases. Given that good observation data sets exist, more realistic data sets of forcing ï¬elds incorporating the projected changes can be created and used for impact studies (Piani et al. 2010). This can be achieved through the methods known as MOS. These are statistical models linking simulated variables to observations. There are generally two groups of MOS methods: one is known as the bias correction method (DÃ©quÃ© et al. 2007; Piani et al. 2010), while the other is known as the perturbation of observed data (POD) or the delta change (DC) method (Hay et al. 2000; Lenderink et al. 2007a; van Roosmalen et al. 2011).

For instance, in winter, model results tend to be too wet in northern Europe, too warm in summer and winter, and too cold in spring and autumn (Jacob et al. 2007). On the one hand, RCMs generally overestimate the number of wet days; this âdrizzle effectâ is partly because RCMs simulate area averages rather than point values. While on the other, RCMs underestimate heavy precipitation events (e.g. Fowler et al. 2007b). Generally, bias is different in different part of the distribution (e.g. Jeong et al. 2011; Fig. 10.6). A major advantage of RCMs is the simulation of spatially coherent ï¬elds. In general, RCMs with a typical resolution of 25 km overestimate the spatial coherence of precipitation events, in particular for convective precipitation. It should be noted that RCMs provide meaningful information only on the scale of a few grid cells (e.g. Fowler and EkstrÃ¶m 2009). In particular, local precipitation is dominated by internal climate variability (Maraun 2012). As RCMs integrate the equations governing the atmospheric circulation, they in principle provide a coherent picture. However, biases in one variable may propagate into strong biases in dependant variables (e.g. Fig. 10.7); for example, Yang et al. (2010) have shown for Sweden that small temperature biases may, via the nonlinear interaction with precipitation around the melting point, lead to large biases in spring river run-off.

Climatechange simulations under elevated atmospheric CO2 predict pronounced shifts toward tree-dominated biomes (Scheiter and Higgins 2009).

Mean annual precipitation (MAP) determines the potential âcarrying capacityâ for woody plants and upper limit for woody plant cover (Sankaran et al. 2005). As MAP increases, the potential for landscapes to support woody cover increases linearly, becoming asymptotic at ca. 650 mm (Fig. 2.4). Shrub or tree savanna or open woodland communities may therefore characterize regions where MAP is below this threshold, whereas the tendency to develop woodland or forest communities to the general exclusion of grasses occurs above this threshold.

Over the past decade, since our discoveries of the potential roles for DSBs in neuronal diversity and disease, we have developed and enhanced a highthroughput, genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) approach to rapidly and highly sensitively identify DSBs genome-wide based on their translocation to bait DSBs (Chiarle et al. 2011; Frock et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2016). For this approach, bait DSBs can be introduced ectopically by designer endonucleases (Chiarle et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2014; Meng et al. 2014; Frock et al. 2015) or recurrent endogenous DSBs can be used as bait, including those initiated by AID during IgH CSR (Dong et al. 2015) or by RAG during V(D)J recombination (Zhang et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016). Our studies have shown that various classes of DSBs, including those induced ectopically by ionizing radiation, show a much greater preference to join to other DSBs within the same topological domain due to proximity effects associated with the spatial genome organization of chromatin domains (Zarrin et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2012; Alt et al. 2013; Frock et al. 2015). As two random DSBs rarely occur within the relatively short genomic distances within a chromosomal domain, which is often a megabase or less, this phenomenon most greatly impacts the joining of closely linked recurrent DSBs (Alt et al. 2013). Our HTGTS studies provided additional insights into our prior finding (Zarrin et al. 2007; Gostissa et al. 2014) that indicated that CSR joining exploits the predisposition of high frequency DSBs within topological domains to be joined to each other to achieve physiological joining levels (Zarrin et al. 2007; Dong et al. 2015). We also showed that, during V(D)J recombination, RAG exploits chromosomal loop domains to not only achieve high joining frequency but also to developmentally restrict its activity directionally within a loop domain (Hu et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016). To identify the sources and functions of neural DSBs, we applied our HTGTS DSB identification approach to cultured, primary mouse NSPCs. For these HTGTS studies, we employed ectopically generated bait DSBs on several different chromosomes to search for significant, recurrent clusters of DSBs genome-wide that joined to bait DSBs on more than one chromosome. These studies identified 27 recurrent DSB clusters (âRDCsâ) in the NSPC genome, all of which were enhanced by mild replication stress via treatment with aphidicolin, a compound that inhibits replication (Wei et al. 2016). Strikingly, all 27 of these RDCs lie within genes, most of which encode surface proteins involved in synaptogenesis and related neural processes (Wei et al. 2016). Moreover, variations of most RDC genes also have been"

This nematode is acquired by the croaker as well as numerous other fishes (Fusco and Overstreet 1978) when it feeds on copepods such as harpacticoids, the white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus) (see Fusco 1980), Atlantic brief squid (Lolliguncula brevis), and probably other hosts. Patterns of mean abundance, the number of the nematodes in all the croaker examined, whether infected or not, over time suggest the populations of this parasite exhibit extreme seasonal and annual variability, with some time periods exhibiting heavily infected croaker, whereas other periods exhibit few, if any, specimens of S. cricotus (Figure 14.55). Over the course of decades, both prevalence (% infected) and mean intensity of this parasite infecting croaker varied. In total, 1,307 croaker examined for this chapter had 2,193 individual S. cricotus from the 1970s and 1990s. In the early 1970s, prevalence of a sample reached as high as 74.6 %. In contrast, prevalence of S. cricotus in Atlantic croaker from the later 1970s was as low as 1.7 %. Low prevalence was also generally encountered during the 1990s when some collections, such as that in April of 1992, demonstrated no S. cricotus. Fluctuations of S. cricotus over time do not appear to be strongly driven by either water temperature or salinity. The period of highest mean abundances occurred during the early 1970s (Figure 14.55). In subsequent years, this parasite was less abundant, even when environmental conditions were similar to the period when abundances were high. The lack of S. cricotus in later time periods suggests a decrease in either the presence or consumption of infected intermediate hosts by Atlantic croaker, different susceptibilities to infection, differences in host density, or different climatic conditions after the early 1970s. The potential mechanisms for this difference could be numerous; however, this lack of coherence, a reliable estimate of mean abundance under normal conditions, over time would hinder before-and-after comparisons of parasite population structure in relation to environmental disruptions (see review by Underwood 1994). While the mechanism driving patterns of S. cricotus mean abundance in croaker remains unknown, the presence of a decline following the early 1970s was still apparent in the 1990s (Figure 14.55). In addition, abundance of S. cricotus often peaked within a time period during the early spring and summer months during the two periods in the 1970s and 1990s. The changes in abundance that occur on a seasonal basis would represent a further impediment to beforeâ andâafter comparisons of environmental disruption since this may necessarily involve comparing different seasons within a year. The decrease in S. cricotus over time is most clearly illustrated when comparing late spring and early summer months from the three time periods with one another and using that comparison to control for possible confounding seasonal effects. Even in cases where similar salinities occurred during the same months such as the spring and early summer months of the early 1970s and 1990s, mean abundance of S. cricotus was different, and that would suggest mechanisms besides those directly or indirectly related to either salinity or seasonality. In addition to abundance, prevalence and mean intensity also varied among time periods. Between March and June of 1971, prevalence ranged from 71 to 75 % with mean intensity varying from 3.3 to 7.2 worms/infected host. In the same months in 1976, prevalence was from 10 to 50 %, with mean intensity ranging from 2.6 to 3.9. In the 1990s, prevalence during the spring and early summer ranged between 0 and 44 %, with infected croaker harboring 3.2â3.7 worms/host. Thus, the shift in S. cricotus that is the result of changes in prevalence, intensity, and abundance suggests either changes in food web structure among and within time periods or physiological alterations in host immune response, but the pathway remains unresolved. Currently, a study is in progress that will include more data that will allow for comparisons between polluted and non-polluted areas of coastal Mississippi, including the relatively"

For example, one can consider a situation where f A = g A and at the same time there is s A = 1âA = 1+A = e A . Although such pairs do not possess a strict direction, they can play an important role in fuzzy arithmetic operations. Another notion that was introduced within the OFN model is inclination. Its role is to make a general comparison between the up and down parts of a given A = ( f A , g A ). Below let us refer to the so-called mean inclination: Definition 4.4 The mean inclination of an OFN A = ( f A , g A ) is defined as the function i m A : [0, 1] â R: (4.3) i m A = ( f A + g A )/2 Let us note that the mean inclination of OFNs with symmetrical shapes is a constant function. It does not depend on direction, in particular, there is i m A = i m A|â . Inclination can be used, for example, in a defuzzification process. For more detailed investigation related to defuzzification methods in the OFN model, refer to [2, 10] and some further chapters in this book. Below we recall just one example.

The description of adolescents at risk becomes less clear when we consider the phenomenon that obese people tend to be temporarily taller than their non-obese peers by up to 3 cm in adolescence (Johnson et al. 2012b; Metcalf et al. 2011). This difference is similar to the temporary greater height of some girls compared to boys during adolescence, due to their earlier maturation (Ellison and Reiches 2012). The temporary greater height of some obese adolescents most likely reflects an advanced pace of development. Indeed, numerous studies in diverse populations have shown that adolescent obesity is linked to the earlier development of secondary sexual characteristics, most of which are in turn associated with shorter adulthood height (Dunger et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2013a). Early timing of traits such as age at menarche has been implicated in cardio-metabolic disease processes (Prentice and Viner 2013; Hardy et al. 2006a), but whether or not they precede adolescent obesity or are causally related to adulthood disease independent of adolescent obesity remains unclear (Johnson et al. 2013a; Mumby et al. 2011; Pierce et al. 2012)."

Hurricane Andrew, which made landfall in Florida and Louisiana in late August 1992, removed sections of salt marsh and deposited them in shallow ponds and bays (Cahoon 2006). Hurricane Katrina similarly impacted brackish marshes east of the Mississippi River resulting in more than 80 ha (200 acres) of land loss (Morton and Barras 2011). Sediment and wrack deposition during hurricanes can bury marsh vegetation and result in plant mortality (Guntenspergen et al. 1995; Valiela and Rietsma 1995). Also, saltwater intrusion in lower salinity coastal marshes disrupts system ecology, resulting in short-term vegetation dieback (Cahoon 2006). In contrast to the negative effects of hurricanes and storms, hurricane-generated sediment input can counterbalance relative sea-level rise and promote wetland sustainability (McKee and Cherry 2009). In addition, bare patches resulting from wrack deposition allow for the recruitment of other plant species, generating habitat heterogeneity and increasing plant diversity (Guntenspergen et al. 1995). Mangrove forests in Florida have been periodically disturbed by hurricanes, such as Hurricane Donna in 1960 (Craighead and Gilbert 1962), Hurricane Andrew in 1992 (Smith et al. 1994; Baldwin et al. 1995), and Hurricane Wilma in 2006 (Whelan et al. 2009). These and other studies have documented the impacts of such storms on subsequent structure and function of mangrove forests, including defoliation and losses of branches or entire trees (Davis 1995; Baldwin et al. 2001; Davis et al. 2004; Milbrandt et al. 2006; Profitt et al. 2006; Ward et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2009; Whelan et al. 2009; Castaneda-Moya et al. 2010; Harris et al. 2010). Recovery of mangroves after hurricane disturbance is a function of a complex interaction of factors, including seedling recruitment and survival, resprouting capability, and colonization by herbaceous vegetation (Baldwin et al. 2001). Post-disturbance site productivity (Ross et al. 2006) and spatial variation in hurricane impact (Thaxton et al. 2007) further influence regeneration success. Recovery of ecological structure generally occurs, but it is a relatively slow process compared to herbaceous systems. Hurricane damage to seagrass beds can be highly variable and depends on location as well as hurricane characteristics (Smith et al. 1994; Courtemanche et al. 1999; Paerl et al. 2001; Coles and Brown 2007; CebriaÌn et al. 2008; Anton et al. 2009). Hurricanes have been observed to cause widespread damage to seagrasses, but also to pass with little or no damage (Poiner et al. 1989; Hemminga and Duarte 2000). For example, a cyclone and its associated rainfall caused a loss of approximately 1,000 km2 (247,000 ac) of seagrass in Hervey Bay, Australia (Preen et al. 1995). Other reports have shown hurricanes having only small impacts on seagrass beds and associated macrophytes (Fourqurean and Rutten 2004; Tilmant et al. 1994). Hurricane Katrina was one of the most destructive storms in U.S. history, with winds over 264 km/h (164 mi/h) and a storm surge of 7.8 to 8.5 m (25.6 to 27.9 ft) in the western coast of Mississippi (Hsu et al. 2005). Anton et al. (2009) showed that this powerful hurricane had no major impact on seagrass density, biomass, or community structure (abundance of producers and consumers) in a seagrass bed located approximately 100 km (62 mi) to the east of the hurricaneâs landfall. Overall, this research showed that natural temporal changes in seagrass metabolism, recorded before the hurricane, were larger than any post-storm changes. Conversely, a combination of tropical storm activity and higher-than-average watershed discharge in the Big Bend area of Florida is believed to have caused severe reductions in seagrass distribution and abundance up to 2005; absence of storm activity and relatively low river"
175,645,0.39,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","when this assumption may be reasonable. Often a more sophisticated multi-scaling model is appropriate (Gupta and Dawdy 1995a; Robinson and Sivapalan 1997). Generally the mean is employed as the index flood. The problem of estimating the pth quantile xp is then reduced to estimating the mean for a site Âµx, and the ratio xp/Âµx of the pth quantile to the mean. The mean can often be estimated adequately with the record available at a site, even if that record is short. The indicated ratio is estimated using regional information. The British Flood Studies Report (NERC 1975) calls these normalized flood distributions growth curves. Key to the success of the index-flood approach is identiï¬cation of sets of basins that have similar coefï¬cients of variation and skew. Basins can be grouped geographically, as well as by physiographic characteristics including drainage area and elevation. Regions need not be geographically contiguous. Each site can potentially be assigned its own unique region consisting of sites with which it is particularly similar (Zrinji and Burn 1994), or regional regression equations can be derived to compute normalized regional quantiles as a function of a siteâs physiographic characteristics and other statistics (Fill and Stedinger 1998). Clearly the next step for regionalization procedures, such as the index-flood method, is to move away from estimates of regional parameters that do not depend upon basin size and other physiographic parameters. Gupta et al. (1994) argue that the basic premise of the index-flood method, that the coefï¬cient of variation of floods is relatively constant, is inconsistent with the known relationships between the coefï¬cient of variation CV and drainage area (see also Robinson and Sivapalan 1997). Recently, Fill and Stedinger (1998) built such a relationship into an index-flood procedure using a regression model to explain variations in the normalized quantiles. Tasker and Stedinger (1986) illustrated how one might relate log-space skew to physiographic basin characteristics (see also Gupta and Dawdy 1995b).

179,1245,0.39,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 1: Water Quality, Sediments, Sediment Contaminants, Oil and Gas Seeps, Coastal Habitats, Offshore Plankton and Benthos, and Shellfish","Finding or prospecting for seeps has taken many approaches. Sub-seafloor and seafloor surface three-dimensional seismic profiles, multibeam bathymetry, and side-scan sonar swaths are used to identify areas of potential fluid gas expulsion. Acoustic wipe out zones indicate bubbles near the seafloor. Sea surface slicks seen from satellites can be followed back to natural releases of oil and gas at the seafloor (MacDonald et al. 1993; De Beukelaer et al. 2003). With these three types of information, the next step is to confirm existence of seep communities using bottom photographic surveys, ROV observations, or deep submergence research vehicle sampling (Roberts et al. 2010). Although seafloor trawling provided some of the first clear confirmations that seep communities exist (Rosman et al. 1987), this is now frowned upon because of the damage it does to the structures. The Gulf of Mexico seeps are the most well known worldwide (Fisher et al. 2007). The cold seep faunal assemblages occur in five categories: mussel beds, clam beds, vestimentiferan (tube worm) clumps, an epifauna of brachiopods and solitary corals, and gorgonian fields (Kennicutt et al. 1985; Rosman et al. 1987; MacDonald et al. 1989, 1990a, b, c). According to Roberts et al. (2010), of the thousands of seeps on the northern Gulf of Mexico slope, many surround the edges of the intraslope basins where shallow subsurface salt bodies give rise to bathymetry with faults that provide pathways for salt, gas, and oil to flow up to the seafloor. Stable isotope measurements suggest that a principal energy source is hydrogen sulfide in addition to methane (Brooks et al. 1985; Demopoulos et al. 2010; Becker et al. 2010). Physiological studies have suggested that endosymbiotic relationships exist between mussels and methanotrophic bacteria, but clams and vestimentiferans contain sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Cordes et al. 2005a). It is assumed that the seeping fossil hydrocarbons nourish sulfatereducing bacteria that provide sulfide to the sulfide-oxidizing endosymbionts (Freytag et al. 2001). The bathymodiolids harbor at least four symbiotic functional groups: methanotrophs (consume methane as an energy and carbon source), methylotrophs (consume a methyl group at the end of a fatty acid), and two different thiotrophs (oxidize-reduced sulfur compounds for energy) (Dupperon et al. 2007). The community of organisms on the deep Florida Escarpment is not supported by fossil hydrocarbons (Paull et al. 1984). The composition of the principal fauna associated with fluid expulsion varies over time as the seep matures. Bathymodiolus mussels with methanotrophic symbionts arrive first (Roberts et al. 1990; Bergquist et al. 2003). Prior to this, the sediments may need to be stabilized by carbonate precipitation that is a byproduct of the oxidation of the hydrocarbons (Aharon and Fu 2000; Joye et al. 2004; Luff et al. 2004). Vestimentiferan tubeworms follow after enough carbonate substrate is available (Cordes et al. 2003). The clumps of tubeworms and mussel beds are considered the foundation species of the seep communities (Cordes et al. 2010). The three species of mussels are Bathymodiolus brooksi, B. childressi, and B. heckerae. The tubeworms are known to be Escarpia laminata and Lamellibrachia luymesi (Miglietta et al. 2010) and Seepiophila jonesi (Gardiner et al. 2001), among others. These foundation species serve as habitat for a speciose assemblage of smaller organisms, but the small organisms associated with the larger individual clumps are difficult to sample quantitatively (Bright et al. 2010; Cordes et al. 2010; Lessard-Pilon et al. 2010). Fauna associated with tubeworms appears to have a higher diversity than mussel beds on the upper slope (550 m [1,804 ft] depth), but at greater depths, this distinct difference is less obvious in rarefaction curves (Cordes et al. 2010). The mussel beds appear to have a mid-depth maximum (MDM) diversity but the fauna associated with the tubeworms did not. This is an interesting observation because MDMs have been observed on many continental margins, but their cause is equivocal at best. The nonseep macroinfauna of the Gulf of Mexico has a distinct MDM, but this was not apparent in the polychaete worms (Rowe and Kennicutt 2008). Many of the species associated"

This is an important consideration as algal CH3I production has been found to vary depending on the species and environmental conditions, such as nutrient-limitation (SmytheWright et al. 2010), grazing (Smythe-Wright et al. 2010), light-levels (Moore et al. 1996b; Laturnus et al. 1998), mechanical damage (Nightingale et al. 1995) and desiccation (Nightingale et al. 1995). The only sources which some studies have suggested could contribute significantly to global or regional CH3I production in the marine environment are photochemistry and cyanobacteria. Richter and Wallace (2004) suggest that 50 % of the average daily flux of CH3I from the tropical Atlantic surface layer could be due to photochemistry. The extrapolation of laboratory production rates suggests that the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus could contribute significantly to CH3I production in the eastern tropical Atlantic (Hughes et al. 2011) and calculations presented in Smythe-Wright et al. (2006) suggest that this organism is also an important global source producing 4.3 Gmol year1. However, orders of magnitude variability in the CH3I production rate have been observed in laboratory cultures of Prochlorococcus between the three studies on this topic published to date (Smythe-Wright et al. 2006; Brownell et al. 2010; Hughes et al. 2011). Hughes et al. (2011) suggest that CH3I production by Prochlorococcus is strongly dependent on cell physiological state. Therefore, the different incubation conditions used in these three studies could explain this variability and should be considered when extrapolating laboratory production rates to the natural environment. Other sources such as bacteria (Amachi et al. 2001; Fuse et al. 2003) and detrital aggregates (Hughes et al. 2008b) are not understood sufficiently to allow accurate global flux estimates to be made. Several mechanisms for CH3I production in seawater have been proposed: 1. A photochemical CH3I source has been suggested to involve a radical recombination pathway (Eq. 1.1, Moore and Zafiriou 1994) but more information on the mechanism is needed. CH3  Ã¾ I"

Given uncertainty in climate model parameter values, 17 different combinations of parameter values were used to identify ranges in possible temperature and precipitation changes (see Chap. 11, Fig. 11.3). Despite substantial variability between the 17 iterations, all projections indicate a warmer and wetter climate by 2099. From these 17 scenarios, three were selected for application in the models to cover a range of possible change (Q0, Q8 and Q16). Ensemble members were selected to provide a central baseline (Q0), a warmer and drier scenario during the mid-century (Q8), and a much warmer and wetter scenario for both 2050 and 2099 (Q16). Sea-level rise is also a critical issue for Bangladesh. Global sea-level rise scenarios are based directly on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Church et al. 2013). These are not explicitly coupled to the Q0, Q8 and Q16 scenarios, and their application is explained in the relevant chapter (see Chaps. 14 and 16).

Horn flies also promote livestock-avoidance behaviors, such as walking and tail switching (Harvey and Launchbaugh 1982). These additional activities and energy expenditures directly contribute to reduced livestock performance. Ticks (Amblyomma americanum Koch) reduce weight gains of British breeds, such as Hereford, by greater than 30 % (Byford et al. 1992). By contrast, ticks have less effect on Brahman crosses with British and Continental cattle, and little, if any, effect on Brahman cattle (Utech et al. 1978; George et al. 1985). Livestock gains in Australia could decrease by greater than 18 % because of increased tick infestations associated with climate change unless European and British cattle breeds are replaced by Brahmans or other tick-resistant breeds (White 2003). Climate change drivers also are anticipated to reduce livestock performance on many rangelands by reducing forage quantity, quality, or both (Polley et al. 2013). Drought obviously reduces forage production, whereas elevated CO2 has consistently been shown to increase plant C:N ratios and decrease tissue N concentrations (Cotrufo et al. 1998; Morgan et al. 2001), resulting in forage with reduced crude protein levels. Forage digestibility often declines at elevated CO2 (Morgan et al. 2004a; Milchunas et al. 2005). Regional-scale analyses indicate that livestock become more nutrient limited in warmer and drier climates as both dietary crude protein and digestible organic matter content of forages decrease (Craine et al. 2010). A 4-year study in the tallgrass prairie showed that warming reduced N concentration and, correspondingly, crude protein levels of live and dormant forage from five warm-season grasses (An et al. 2005). In the absence of protein supplementation, cattle production will decline if forage quality declines too greatly because forage intake is volume limited. Forage quality may increase in cooler regions, such as the northern USA and southern Canada (Craine et al. 2010), if winters become warmer and wetter as anticipated."

Viral mRNA is detectable in the intestines of larval and adult African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) as early as 3 h after exposure to virus in water and then spreads to other tissues, suggesting that the intestines are a primary point of entry of waterborne virus in amphibians (Robert et al. 2011). The skin may not be a common site of infection in metamorphosed amphibians because they secrete antimicrobial peptides on their skin, which can inactivate several types of pathogens, including FV3 and ATV (Chinchar et al. 2001, 2004; Sheafor et al. 2008; Rollins-Smith 2009). Brunner et al.

241,633,0.381,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"10.3.2.2 Regression Methods Regression models include linear and nonlinear relationships between predictors and the predictand (Benestad et al. 2008). Among them are the multiple regression (Murphy 1999), the CCA method (Busuioc et al. 1999), and the SVD method (Bretherton et al. 1992). The difference between these approaches is that the multiple regression minimises the root-mean-square errors (distance between predictions and observations), the CCA maximises the correlation, and the SVD maximises the covariance between two ï¬elds. Artiï¬cial neural networks also represent nonlinear regression models (Crane and Hewitson 1998). 10.3.2.3 Weather Classification Methods The weather classiï¬cation methods involve various strategies, such as analogues (Zorita and von Storch 1999; Timbal et al. 2008), circulation classiï¬cation schemes (BÃ¡rdossy and Caspary 1990; Jones et al. 1993), cluster analysis (CorteReal et al. 1999; Huth 2000), and neural nets. The analogue model involves searching the record of past events and taking the day that most closely matches the situation wanted to predict. Cluster analysis bases the predictions on a number of closest states (Wilks 1995), either by taking the mean of the days with close matches or by using the observed values for all days that match the predicted state, and constructing a statistical distribution (histogram). From this sample, or a ï¬tted probability density distribution, a random value may be drawn. Neural nets involve various adaptive learning algorithms, such as âartiï¬cial intelligenceâ (Wilby et al. 1998; Hewitson and Crane 2002). The analogue model, circulation classiï¬cation schemes, and cluster analysis all involve a re-sampling of past measurements. These re-sampling techniques suffer from one caveat that the tails of the distributions will be distorted because the sampling cannot produce new record-breaking values (Benestad 2008). Even stationary series are expected to produce new record-breaking events, given sufï¬ciently long intervals for observations. Theory of independent and identically distributed (iid) series shows that the expected occurrence of new record-breaking events will converge towards zero, but never actually become zero. Nevertheless, this implies that the upper and lower tails of the distribution of the results from the re-sampling methods may be distorted and that the"

The fluctuation of geochemical composition in hydrothermal mixing zones may have a significant impact on the rate of microbial growth and metabolic activity, biogeochemical reactions, and the dominant microbial population. In particular, reduced compounds such as H2, CH4, HS , and Fe2+ are not only essential energy sources for chemolithotrophs but also factors that control the composition and density of the microbial community. Previous studies have investigated habitat components, for example, the boundary zone (interface) between hydrothermal fluid and ambient seawater, including low-temperature diffusive flow (Holden et al. 1998; Huber et al. 2002, 2003; Perner et al. 2007), chimney structures (Schrenk et al. 2003; Takai et al. 2001), and hydrothermal sediments (Nunoura et al. 2010; Teske et al. 2002; Yanagawa et al. 2013). These studies demonstrated the prevalence of Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and various candidate divisions in the hydrothermal system. Due to fluctuations in the environmental conditions, microbial communities in hydrothermally influenced regions exhibit variability on various spatial and temporal scales, including large-scale intra- and inter-field variability (Flores et al. 2012; Huber et al. 2010; Nunoura and Takai 2009), short-term temporal and spatial variability (Perner et al. 2009, 2013), and spatial variability on a small scale of a few centimeters to meters (Nakagawa et al. 2005; Takai et al. 2004).

Until now, only a limited number of global surveys have been conducted on the quantity and distribution of microplastics in the oceans (Lusher 2015). Most surveys focused on specific oceanic regions and habitats, such as coastal areas, regional seas, gyres or the poles (Thompson et al. 2004, Collignon et al. 2012; Rios and Moore 2007). Concentrations of microplastics at sea vary from thousands to hundreds of thousands of particles kmâ2 and latest reports suggest that microplastic pollution has spread throughout the worldâs oceans from the water column (Lattin et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2011) to sediments even of the deep sea (Moore et al. 2001b; Law et al. 2010; Claessens et al. 2011; Cole et al. 2011; Collignon et al. 2012; Erikssen et al. 2014; Reisser et al. 2013; van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013; Woodall et al. 2014; Fischer et al. 2015). Recently, microplastics were also recorded from Arctic sea ice in densities two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported from highly contaminated surface waters, such as those of the Pacific gyre (Obbard et al. 2014). This has important implications considering the projected acceleration in sea ice melting due to global climate change and concomitant release of microplastics to the Arctic marine ecosystem. Time-series data on the composition and abundance of microplastics are sparse. However, available evidence on long-term trends suggests various patterns in microplastic concentrations. A decade ago, Thompson et al. (2004) demonstrated the broad spatial extent and accumulation of this type of contamination. They found plastic particles in sediments from U.K. beaches and archived among the plankton in samples dating back to the 1960s with a significant increase in abundance over time. More recent evidence indicated that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific subtropical gyre have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades (Goldstein et al. 2013). However, no change in microplastic concentration was observed at the surface of the North Atlantic gyre for a period of 30 years (Law et al. 2010). Less is known about the composition of microplastics in the oceans. Evidence suggests a temporal decrease in the average size of plastic litter (Barnes et al. 2009; Erikssen et al. 2014). Studies based on the stomach contents of shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) in the Bering Sea also indicated a decrease in âindustrialâ primary pellets and an increase in âuserâ plastic between the 1970s and the late 1990s (Vlietstra and Parga 2002) but constant levels over the last decade (Van Franeker et al. 2011). Similarly, long-term data from The Netherlands since the 1980s show a decrease of industrial plastics and an increase in user plastics, with shipping and fisheries being the main sources (van Franeker 2012)."

These results necessitate pre-existing chains for every running direction for every position, an unlikely scenario. In another type of network model that is not mutually exclusive with those mentioned, the most excited cells fire first, which drives inhibitory cells to delay the activity of other place cells that code for more distant positions (Dragoi and BuzsaÌki 2006; Maurer et al. 2006; Geisler et al. 2007; Stark et al. 2013). Silencing of soma-targeting interneurons (Royer et al. 2012), or decoupling retrograde communication between pyramidal and inhibitory cells through endocannabinoid receptor antagonism (Robbe et al. 2006; Robbe and BuzsaÌki 2009; Losonczy et al. 2010), causes large disruptions in assembly coordination and a redistribution of spiking across theta phase. These findings show a clear role of inhibition in phase precession. Several observations support network models of precession. Place cells show trial-to-trial variance in their firing rates that cannot be explained by changes in position or theta phase alone (LaÌnskyÌ et al. 2001). Statistical models have shown that the precise trial-to-trial timing can be predicted by the spiking activity of other neurons, as would be expected if sequencing was brought about through a chaining of co-active ensembles oscillating faster than the baseline LFP (Harris et al. 2002; Dragoi and BuzsaÌki 2006; Geisler et al. 2007). However, principal cells respond to many environment stimuli and therefore a misspecification of the model may mistake common external modulation for a causal network interaction (Chadwick et al. 2015). Therefore further experimentation is needed to resolve whether theta sequences truly reflect network level synchronization."
29,59,0.374,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","Introduction Over the past decades, neuroscience research has shown that sensory inputs are processed at multiple locations distributed across the brain. These regions do not encode specific mental faculties but are responsible for specific unitary operations (Kandel and Hudspeth 2013). Cognition arises in a network of serial and parallel pathways between functionally discrete units, each responsible for elementsâbut not all aspectsâof a given function. Although the tenet of functional localization holds that neural processing is modular, the structure of the underlying network and the rules of interareal communication are not well understood. Thanks to the development of powerful new tools for recording, labeling and genetically manipulating brain circuits, the mouse visual system has emerged as a tractable system in which these questions can be addressed with unprecedented precision (Luo et al. 2008; Huberman and Niell 2011; Oh et al. 2014; Zingg et al. 2014). Mice are most active at night and rely heavily on their whiskers for recognizing objects and their ears and noses for hearing and social communication (Holy and Guo 2005; Jadhav and Feldman 2010; Stowers et al. 2013). When starved for food, mice are diurnal and use dichromatic vision for guiding their actions in the field (Jacobs et al. 2004; Daan et al. 2011; Baden et al. 2013). Through their small eyes with afoveate retinas, the world looks blurred and lacks the rich detail experienced by humans, whose vision is 100 times sharper. At close range, however, the acuity of 0.5 cycles/deg is sufficient to resolve landmark features that can be used for referencing locomotion-dependent path integration signals during spatial navigation (Prusky et al. 2000; Prusky and Douglas 2005; Chen et al. 2013). In fact, experiments on visual object recognition have shown that rats, and presumably mice, can use invariant shape information to identify landmarks from a variety of different viewing angles (Alemi-Neissi et al. 2013). These studies demonstrate that mice process multiple complex visual cues and associate them with motor actions. Many of these computations are performed in interconnected cortical and subcortical networks, bringing up the questions of what the architecture of these networks is and how do functionally distinct areas communicate with each other."
280,494,0.374,Diversity and Evolution of Butterfly Wing Patterns : An integrative Approach,"We summarized above what was revealed by studies of D. guttifera, but will it apply to pattern formation in other organisms? Due to the experimental strengths of this system, we can be optimistic that we will reach an integrated model for pigmentation pattern formation in Drosophila. Butterflies show interesting parallels with the Drosophila wing patterning genes, as Wnt genes and Distal-less are key players in both lineages (Werner et al. 2010; Martin et al. 2012; Brakefield et al. 1996; Arnoult et al. 2013). If we expand the comparison to vertebrates, there are large differences in genes involved in pattern formation and melanin synthesis (Kopp 2009; Kronforst et al. 2012; Kaelin et al. 2012; Mallarino et al. 2016). Still we assume we can find some common mechanisms, such as a way of measuring distance in a tissue, and a hierarchical regulatory architecture. Comparing comprehensive datasets will be instrumental in answering this question of fundamental interest for our understanding of the mechanisms that generate biodiversity on Earth.

Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence of the formation of secondary organic aerosol on dust in these studies. If carboxylic acids are the most common identified organic species in mixing with dust, internal mixing of dust has been observed with MSA (DallâOsto et al. 2010); PAH (Falkovich et al. 2004; Stone et al. 2011); pesticides (Falkovich et al. 2004); fatty acids (Mochida et al. 2007); hopane and levoglucosan (Stone et al. 2011) and organic nitrogen (DallâOsto et al. 2010). The abundant organic matter found on dust surfaces suggests that dust is an excellent medium for long-range transport of pollution in the troposphere (Falkovich et al. 2004). The extent organic compounds coat onto dust depends on the transport pathway, reactivity of organic species, ambient concentration and ambient humidity, notably for high water-soluble species like carboxylic acids (Falkovich et al. 2004; DallâOsto et al. 2010). Sea Salt Sea salt aerosols can also participate in heterogeneous reactions with nitric and sulphuric acids, leading to chloride (and also other halogens like Br) depletion (notably Cl-depletion) through HCl volatilisation and the production of halogen radicals, particularly in relatively polluted marine air (Sturges and Shaw 1993; Johansen et al. 1999; Kumar et al. 2008). The release of reactive chloride is considered to be an important intermediate in the oxidation reactions associated with the removal of light hydrocarbons and ozone in the marine atmosphere (Singh and Kasting 1988; Vogt et al. 1996). The magnitude of Cl-depletion of marine aerosols has been demonstrated to usually increase with decreasing sea salt particle size (Mouri and Okada 1993; Kerminen et al. 1998; Yao et al. 2003; Hsu et al. 2007). This reaction produces sea salt particles coated with sulphate and nitrate over Asian and Pacific areas (Matsumoto et al. 2004; Matsuki et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2009) and in the Mediterranean region (Tursic et al. 2006). In the clean atmosphere, methanesulphonate is the major species involved in chloride depletion as observed in Finland (Kerminen et al. 1998) and in the Arctic (Maskey et al. 2011). The S-containing sea salt particles are generated by reactions of the sea salt particles with MSA and/or H2SO4 from biogenic sources rather than anthropogenic ones. Mixing between sea salt and oxalate is"

285,136,0.372,"Physiology, Psychoacoustics and Cognition in Normal and Impaired Hearing","Bilateral cochlear implantation seeks to restore the advantages of binaural hearing to the profound deaf by providing binaural cues that are important for binaural perception, such as binaural fusion, sound localization and better detection of signals in noise. Most bilateral cochlear implant (BiCI) users have shown improvements compared to their ability when only one CI was used. However, compared to normal hearing (NH) individuals, the average performance of BiCI users is still worse and has a large variability in performance amongst them (Majdak et al. 2011; Litovsky et al. 2012; Goupell et al. 2013; Kan et al. 2013). One likely reason for the worse performance of BiCI users is the interaural electrodes mismatch between two CIs because of different surgery insertion depth or different implant length. Since the inputs to the NH binaural system from the two ears can be assumed to be well matched and binaural brainstem neurons are comparing only by interaurally place matched inputs, it is very important to determine interaural electrode pairs for frequency matching the electrode arrays in the two ears to compensate for any differences in the implanted cochleae. This interaural electrode pairing (IEP) is expected to become even more relevant in the future, to better exploit recent time information preserving coding strategies and with the advent of truly binaural cochlear implants, which will preserve, enhance, and/or optimize interaural cues. It has been suggested that physiological measures of binaural interactions (e.g., evoked potentials) will likely be required to accomplish best-matched interaural electrode pairs (Pelizzone et al. 1990). More recently, the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses (eABRs) have been obtained in both animals (Smith and Delgutte 2007) and humans (He et al. 2010; Gordon et al. 2012). Smith and Delgutte (2007) proposed a potential way by using evoked potentials to match interaural electrode pairs for bilaterally implanted cats. Their study shows that the interaural electrode pairings that produced the best aligned IC activation patterns were also those that yielded the maximum BIC amplitude. More recently, He et al. (2010) observed some evidence of a BIC/electrodeoffset interaction at low current levels. In another follow up study, they used the same electroencephalography (EEG) procedure to examine whether the BIC amplitude evoked from different electrode pairings correlated with an interaural pitch comparison task (He et al. 2012). Their results show that there is no significant correlation between results of BIC measures and interaural pitch comparisons on either the individual or group levels. Gordon et al. (2012) demonstrated that binaural processing in the brainstem of children using bilateral CI occurs regardless of bilateral or unilateral deafness; it is disrupted by a large but not by a small mismatch in place of stimulation. All these studies suggest that BIC could be a potentially approaches for electrode pairing, especially for pediatrics, however, it is not accurate enough in all existing studies of human subjects. In order to tackle the issue of accuracy, a 61-channel monaural and binaural eABR recording setup was developed together with a multi-step offline post-pro-"

The HO2/OH ratio in the presence of IO will be reduced by the combination of Eqs.1.8 and 1.9 (Bloss et al. 2005; McFiggans et al. 2000; Saiz-Lopez et al. 2008). Compared to the analogous bromine chemistry, this cycle is particularly important because the IO + HO2 reaction is fast and HOI photolyses more readily than BrO (Atkinson et al. 2007). The source of I atoms shown in Fig. 1.5 is the photolysis of oceanic precursors (see Sect. 1.3.3), which is therefore restricted to daytime. However, nocturnal IO has also been observed (Mahajan et al. 2009b; Saiz-Lopez and Plane 2004). It has been proposed that the source of IO is the reaction between the NO3 radical and I2, to give I atoms:"

But how many seeds were involved in each case? tapply(sample,extract,sum) bean cucumber This means that 395 seeds were treated with bean extract and 436 seeds were treated with cucumber.

241,634,0.371,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"10.3.2.4 Weather Generators Stochastic weather generators are statistical models producing high-resolution local-scale time series of a suite of elements such as temperature and precipitation among others, whose large-scale statistics follow the required criteria (Richardson 1981; Wilks and Wilby 1999; Olsson et al. 2009; Willems and Vrac 2011). Among many applications, they can serve as a computationally effective tool to produce site-speciï¬c data sets at the required time resolution (Semenov et al. 1998). The distribution used is usually different for different climate variables. For temperature, the normal distribution is the most popular (Semenov et al. 1998). More complicated is the generation of precipitation data, and different functions are used. Among the most popular are the Markov chain, the semi-empirical, and the NeymanâScott rectangular pulse (NSRP) weather generator. In the Markov chain generator, precipitation occurrence and totals are produced separately (Sunyer et al. 2012). Two states are possible: wet or dry days. The amount of precipitation on a rainy (wet) day is most often generated using a gamma or exponential distribution (Benestad 2007). In the semi-empirical generator, a few distributions can be deï¬ned, for instance for wet and dry spell lengths and precipitation amount. In the NSRP weather generator, Kilsby et al. (2007) proposed four different steps. A storm origin is described by the Poisson process. Separate rain cells within a storm are separated by time intervals taken from exponential distribution. The duration and intensity of each rain cell are also described by exponential distributions, and their sum gives a rainfall total. Weather generators can be used when the observation records are relatively short. They can also supply many weather ârealisationsâ having the same overall statistics. A wide suite of statistics can be used to ï¬t the model: mean, variance, skewness, autocorrelation, and many others. Weather generators can also serve to produce data for locations where there is information about the statistical distribution and time structure. For places with only short records of high-temporal-resolution data but longer series with data of low resolution, it is possible to use information from the longer records to make inferences about the distributions, and it is in principle possible to produce projections for temporal scales higher than those usually produced by RCMs (6 h). 10.3.2.5 Randomisation Models generally underestimate the local-scale variance. To resolve this, Karl et al. (1990) proposed the use of a scaling factor to ensure that the variance of the projected surface values will match the observed variance. But this could"
376,395,0.37,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The combined effect of climate change drivers may differ from that anticipated by summing single-driver effects (Fig. 7.2; but see, Dukes et al. 2005). For instance, plant biomass responses to combined warming and CO2 enrichment treatments often are smaller than anticipated from single-factor experiments (Morgan et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012). Interactions also are evident in driver effects on plant community composition. Responses of foliar cover to experimental warming were species specific in an old field, varied through time, and were contingent on precipitation treatments (Engel et al. 2009). Warming may exacerbate effects of reduced precipitation on rangelands (Hovenden et al. 2008; Sherry et al. 2008), but the ecosystem consequences of the combination of climate change drivers generally are not as extreme as would be anticipated from single-driver effects (Wu et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012)."

These compounds represent the largest known natural contribution to atmospheric organic bromine and are recognised as an important source of reactive bromine to the troposphere and lower stratosphere, where they may contribute up to 40 % of O3 depletion in mid latitudes (Salawitch et al. 2005; Salawitch 2006; Yang et al. 2005; WMO 2011). The magnitude of the oceanic emissions is uncertain and ranges from 3 to 22 Gmol Br year 1, with a recurring mean of around 10 Gmol Br year 1 for CHBr3, and from 0.5 to 3.5 Gmol Br year 1 for CH2Br2 (Quack and Wallace 2003; WMO 2011). Elevated atmospheric concentrations have been observed over the tropical oceans (Class and Ballschmiter 1988a; Atlas et al. 1993; Schauffler et al. 1998) and were linked to oceanic supersaturations of the compounds and especially to productive upwelling areas. Equatorial surface waters of the tropical Atlantic were indeed identified as a significant CHBr3 source to the atmosphere, with CHBr3 production occurring in the deep chlorophyll maximum (Quack et al. 2004). Generally the oceanic distributions of the brominated compounds, bromoform, dibromomethane (CH2Br2), dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl) and bromodichloromethane (CHBrCl2), are associated with the"

243,211,0.369,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"a change of direction from a âcentrally driven strategy of replace allâ to âlocally chosen and implemented systemsâ (Robertson et al. 2011; Sheikh et al. 2011). NHS calls to improve the quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare, coupled with substantial financial support, have provoked widespread interest in the timely implementation of HEPMA systems in UK hospitals (Buntin et al. 2011; Black et al. 2011; McKibbon et al. 2011) and attracted a number of UK and overseas suppliers. Electronic prescribing is already well established in Englandâs primary care (Avery et al. 2007; Fernando et al. 2004; Hibberd et al. 2016). Over the last decade, several attempts have been made to implement HEPMA systems in secondary care. In 2013 only 13% of hospitals had hospitalwide HEPMA systems (Ahmed et al. 2013). This is however expected to rise rapidly as a result of the Â£500 Million Safer Hospitals Safer Wards technology fund launched in 2013 and a policy target of complete implementation across the NHS by 2020 (Carter 2015). The move towards local selection of systems has resulted in hospitals being faced with a range of options, none of which are however currently perceived as fully meeting the needs of the English market (Mozaffar et al. 2014). Whilst the first generation of HEPMA systems was developed within hospitals, today we see a marked shift away from home-grown solutions towards COTS âpackagedâ software (Mozaffar et al. 2014). There are a number of reasons for this move. These include the very substantial costs associated with developing and maintaining bespoke systems (and the stalled progress and anticipated failure of a flagship project to jointly develop an integrated solution within/for English hospitals1), the perceived advantages of packaged solutions (in terms of functionality/price, dependability, maintenance) and problems with limited interoperability between providers (Schiff et al. 2003; Westbrook et al. 2012). However, standard COTS solutions, built around generic models of the user organisation, may be far removed from the workflows of particular adopter organisations, necessitating a considerable effort to configure and customise software or to adjust local working practices (Pollock and Williams 2008). Despite these investments, the HEPMA market in England is faced with a great deal of uncertainty and is undergoing rapid change and evolution (Aarts and Koppel 2009; Mozaffar et al. 2014). As well as intense policy pressures and incentives to adopt HEPMA, hospitals are confronted by the lack of maturity of current supplier offerings, their limited tailoring to the English context, the diversity of systems and lack of knowledge about the available options. These factors all contribute to the challenges that hospitals face in procuring, implementing and realizing the benefits of these systems (Wolfstadt et al. 2008; Bates et al. 2003; Cresswell et al. 2013; Mozaffar et al. 2014). Thus the Lorenzo patient system being collaboratively developed under NPfIT encountered such serious delays that its wide adoption is seen as increasingly unlikely. Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust recently awarded the highest possible risk rating to its Lorenzo project, citing âpotential risks to patient safety quality, information governance and performance trajectoriesâ (HSJ 2014)."
260,58,0.368,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Although ranaviruses infecting freshwater fishes are relatively well characterized, less is known about the significance of ranaviruses infecting cultured or feral populations of marine fishes. Exceptions include two related ranaviruses, SGIV and GIV, which significantly impact grouper mariculture in Asia (Chua et al. 1994; Murali et al. 2002; Qin et al. 2003). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 26 conserved iridovirus genes demonstrated that GIV and SGIV are each otherâs closest relatives; however, these viruses are genetically divergent from other ranaviruses (Eaton et al. 2007). Therefore, GIV/SGIV may need to be considered as a new genus within the family Iridoviridae (Jancovich et al. 2015). SGIV was first identified following a mass mortality event of net-cage farmed brown-spotted grouper (Epinephelus tauvina) in Singapore in 1994 (Chua et al. 1994). The authors referred to the epizootic as Sleepy Grouper Disease; however, they failed to isolate or genetically characterize the virus. In 1998, the same disease was again observed in Singapore farms following imports of brown-spotted grouper fry from Taiwan (Qin et al. 2003). These authors genetically characterized the virus as a novel ranavirus, and named it SGIV (Qin et al. 2003). Similarly, GIV has negatively impacted production of yellow grouper (Epinephelus awoara) in Taiwan (Murali et al. 2002). Delivery of the virus to yellow grouper by injection resulted in 100 % mortality during experimental challenges (Murali et al. 2002). A recent study reported the isolation of SGIV and GIV strains from grouper and non-grouper species cultured in Taiwan (Huang et al. 2011, Table 3). This study illustrates the apparent expanding host range of SGIV/GIV including the first isolation of these viruses in freshwater (largemouth bass) and catadromous (barramundi) fishes. Other partially characterized ranaviruses from wild marine fishes include cod ranavirus (CoIV) isolated from Danish Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua; Ariel et al. 2010) and the short-finned eel ranavirus (SERV) isolated from short-finned eel (Anguilla australis) off the coast of New Zealand (Bang-Jensen et al. 2009). Ranaviruses isolated from seemingly healthy cultivated freshwater and marine fishes include the pike-perch iridovirus (PPIV) isolated from Finnish pike-perch fingerlings (Tapiovaara et al. 1998) and Ranavirus maxima (Rmax) isolated from Danish turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) fry (Ariel et al. 2010). Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of these fish viruses have revealed they represent previously unknown ranaviruses, warranting more comprehensive study into their biology and potential impact on cultivated and wild populations (Holopainen et al. 2009; Jancovich et al. 2015)."

ARMA(p, q) models have been extended to describe seasonal flow series by having their coefï¬cients depend upon the seasonâthese are called periodic Autoregressive-Moving average models, or PARMA. Salas and Obeysekera (1992), Salas and Fernandez (1993), and Claps et al. (1993) discuss the conceptual basis of such stochastic streamflow models. For example, Salas and Obeysekera (1992) found that low-order PARMA models, such as a PARMA(2,1), arise from reasonable conceptual representations of persistence in rainfall, runoff, and groundwater recharge and release. Claps et al.

Greater percolation to depth should increase ANPP by reducing the frequency or duration of periods during which soil water content remains below the lower stress threshold. Consistent with the soil water bucket model, it was found that delivering the same total of precipitation as fewer, but larger events increased ANPP by 30 % in semiarid shortgrass steppe, but decreased ANPP by 10â18 % in tallgrass prairie (Knapp et al. 2002; Heisler-White et al. 2009). Corollary 3 Precipitation regulates the response of productivity to CO2 but not to warming. The ANPP response to CO2 varies as a function of precipitation when considered across ecosystems. The ANPP-CO2 response peaks at âmoderateâ levels of annual precipitation (300â400 mm) across desert and grassland ecosystems (Fig. 7.5; Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b). Productivity responds relatively little to CO2 when precipitation is very low because water stress inhibits growth and may contribute to plant senescence and mortality if it becomes sufficiently severe. The benefits of elevated CO2 on productivity are reduced when annual precipitation is >400 mm partly because the efficient use of water use is no longer a critical variable (Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b). Therefore, the average across-ecosystem response of NPP to CO2 likely will be greatest in systems in which NPP is or will become moderately water limited (Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b, 2011; Webb et al. 2012)."

On a basin-scale, however, CO2 fluxes simulated in the above model studies are not significantly correlated with the NAO index. Chemical buffering of changes in the CO2 concentrations by the large pool of carbonate and bicarbonate ions (Broecker and Peng 1974) has been suggested as one reason for this decoupling. Seawater pCO2 itself is driven by sea surface temperature (SST), mixing (advective and convective) and biology (production/respiration). In the tropical North Atlantic NA, the seasonal pCO2 cycle is strongly coupled to the SST variability. These oligotrophic waters do not support strong biological productivity due to the lack of nutrients (Longhurst 2007). The subtropical regions demonstrate low biological productivity and the seasonal cycle of pCO2 is dominated by temperature changes. The annual amplitude of approximately 40 Î¼atm peaks during the summer months, which corresponds to the temperature peak (Takahashi et al. 2009; Telszewski et al. 2009) but is reduced to a certain extent by low primary production. The pCO2 in the subpolar NA is driven by high temperature variability (ÎSST ~ 8  C) and high biological productivity. Here the biological productivity during spring and summer has a strong counteracting effect on the temperature driven pCO2 increase during this period (KoÌrtzinger et al. 2008; LuÌger et al. 2004)."

241,1415,0.363,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"net radiation energy at the surface is used for vertical heat transfer than for evapotranspiration (see also Bonan 2008). However, woodland can also sustain its evapotranspiration rate when water availability is low, which leads to lower Bowen ratios than in grassland in dry conditions; that is, grassland becomes the source of excess heating instead of woodland. There are still important problems in relation to how ALCCs are explored in numerical experiments using climate models. Pielke et al. (2011) concluded that most studies were based on only one or two models, which did not reflect the uncertainty between models in their responses to increased CO2 levels or in the strength of their landâatmosphere interactions, an uncertainty that is evident in the LUCID multi-model study of Pitman et al. (2009). That study mainly focused on the Northern Hemisphere summer season, and the key result was a statistically signiï¬cant impact of ALCC on the simulated latent heat flux and air temperature over the regions where anthropogenic land cover changed, but the direction of the change in summer temperature was inconsistent among the models. In terms of rainfall, four of the coupled atmosphereâland models used showed a signiï¬cant impact on rainfall over regions with ALCC, while three models did not show impacts greater than the expected random variability of model outputs (Seneviratne et al. 2010). In their review, Pitman et al. (2009) did not ï¬nd statistically signiï¬cant impacts of ALCC on latent heat flux, temperature or rainfall remote from the actual ALCC, that is no teleconnections. The authors also suggested that robust conclusions on the effects of ALCCs on climate can only be drawn from multi-model experiments. Studies based on a single model only provide indications of possible feedback mechanisms and their implications. The goal of the most recently published part of the LUCID project (de Noblet-DucoudrÃ© et al. 2012) was to provide a detailed examination of why the LSMs diverge in their response to ALCC. For this purpose, the authors used seven atmosphereâland models with a common experimental design. For the vegetation distribution, each model used as a starting point the same distribution of crop and pasture, at a resolution of 0.5Â° Ã 0.5Â°, as extracted from Ramankutty and Foley (1999), combined with the pasture areas from Klein Goldewijk et al. (2011) (Fig. 25.8). However, as there are between-model differences in (i) the way land information was represented, (ii) sources of information to describe present-day and potential vegetation, and (iii) strategies to implement ALCC in the model, the resulting land-cover distribution (including natural vegetation) used in each model differed (de Noblet-DucoudrÃ© et al. 2012; Fig. 25.8). Although the areas covered by crops increased from AD 1870 to AD 1992 in all land-cover data sets used, the increase varied; all LSMs describe temperate deforestation, but at"

The highest monthly outflows have normally been recorded in May during snowmelt floods, with a record value of about 10,350 mâ3 sâ1 in May 1920. The lowest monthly mean outflow was 640 mâ3 sâ1 in March 1942 giving a ratio of about 16:1 between the highest and lowest monthly outflow. Normally, outflow is lowest in winter and peaks in spring or early summer. The relative variation in monthly mean outflow was lowest in May (22 %) and highest in September (35 %). The discharge regime has changed over the decades in response to both climatic fluctuations and human impacts, predominantly water regulation. Although there is no statistically signiï¬cant change in the annual mean outflow from Finland for 1912â2004, climate change has affected the annual cycle of flow, particularly the seasonal distribution of flow. The most signiï¬cant change has occurred in the hydrological regimes of winter and spring. Both seasons have become milder during the twentieth century (see also Chap. 4, Sect. 4.4), and consequently, late-winter and earlyspring mean discharges have increased. However, the magnitudes of spring peak flow have not changed. Regulation has increased the winter and spring mean discharge in some places, while the summer flow has decreased. Winter and spring monthly mean discharges from Finland increased by 100â150 mâ3 sâ1 per decade during 1912â2004. June and July monthly mean discharges from Finland decreased by 85â195 mâ3 sâ1 per decade. Changes in seasonal discharge were different in different regions. Most drainage basins in Finland are affected by regulation, but especially in northern Finland and in Ostrobothnia. Winter and spring discharge increased mostly in the north, whereas summer discharge decreased speciï¬cally in southern Finland. Long-term changes in the individual discharge time series were similar to the changes in the outflow from Finland. At most sites, the winter and spring mean discharges increased at both unregulated and regulated sites. However, in northern Lapland, it seems more likely that winter discharge decreased. The increase in winter discharge focused on late winter and the increase in spring discharge on early spring. The rise in winter and spring discharge can almost certainly be attributed to warming in winter and spring and earlier snowmelt. At some regulated sites, the release of water has been increased in winter and early spring in order to increase the storage capacity for snowmelt water. This explains the stronger winter and spring discharge trends at some regulated sites. Spring high flow occurred earlier within the year at about a third of the observation sites. In most cases, this shift in timing was 1â8 days per decade. There is no overall change in the magnitude of spring high flow. At a third of the unregulated sites, summer discharge has increased,"

According to the validation with observed climate along the historical period, the RCM was bias-corrected for the whole simulated period (Cervigni et al. 2013 â Chap. 4 and Appendix B). To take into account the uncertainty on future climate outcomes nine GCMs simulations taking part of the CMIP3 experiment plus those from the CMCC-MED GCM, were used to âperturbâ the RCM results along the period 2006â2065 and maintain high resolution. The GCMs chosen for the simulations were thus: HadCM3, CGCM_2.3.2, CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, CCSM3, MIROC3.2, GFDL_cm2.1, ECHAM5, FGOALS, and CMCC-MED.

Land cover classifications or predictions of vegetation attributes (e.g., cover) have been used for landscape-scale rangeland assessment and monitoring (e.g., Hunt and Miyake 2006; Marsett et al. 2006; Homer et al. 2013).

Recent studies on agricultural streams with high nitrate concentrations indicate that in-stream nitrate removal may not increase proportionately with nitrate availability due to nitrate saturation of the microbial community responsible for denitriï¬cation (Bernot et al. 2006; Herrman et al. 2008). The study by Herrman et al. (2008) suggested a concentration of 2 mg NO3âN lâ1 as a threshold, above which the streams become increasingly saturated with nitrate and export substantial N. Other research has identiï¬ed hydraulic retention time (in-stream water residence time) as a key stream characteristic controlling N removal (Valett et al. 1996). In lakes, permanent N retention occurs as denitriï¬cation but also by incorporation in sedimenting organic matter that is permanently buried on the lake bottom (SÃ¸ndergaard 2007). As for streams, hydraulic retention time is found to be a key factor controlling N retention in lakes (Windolf et al. 1996; SÃ¸ndergaard 2007; Herrman et al. 2008). On average for 69 Danish lakes, 43 % of the N input was permanently retained (Jensen et al. 1990). Based on data reported by contracting countries, HELCOM (2004) estimated a 30 % N retention of the gross load entering river systems in the Baltic Sea drainage basin. Retention processes for P in rivers, riparian areas and floodplains comprise sorption to suspended solids and bottom sediment, deposition of particulate matter on the river bed, biotic assimilation by algae and macrophytes, and sedimentation on inundated riparian areas and floodplains (Kronvang et al. 1999; PÃ¤rn et al. 2011). Storage of P within the river is often considered a temporary sink only, as the P build-up in biomass and sediment during summer is flushed out during high winter flows (De Witt 1999; Schulz et al. 2003). Permanent in-stream retention was explained by Svendsen et al. (1995) as sorption of DIP to Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides. In-stream net retention is probably of minor importance (Vassiljev and StÃ¥lnacke 2005), whereas P storage by sedimentation on inundated riparian areas and floodplains can be considerable; rates of up to 127 kg P haâ1 yearâ1 are reported (review by Hoffmann et al. 2009). In lakes, P retention occurs via sedimentation of particulate-bound forms or via uptake and incorporation of dissolved P by plants and subsequent sedimentation (SÃ¸ndergaard 2007). In the drainage areas of entire river systems, P retention in lakes is often considered the most important permanent sink (Svendsen et al. 1995; Vassiljev and StÃ¥lnacke 2005). Kronvang et al. (1999) found an average retention of 3 kg P haâ1 yearâ1 for 18 shallow Danish lakes. Vassiljev and StÃ¥lnacke (2005) using a model approach estimated lake P retention to be around 30â35 % in the 44,000 km2 Lake Peipsi catchment. However, the retention rate in some lakes is currently negative due to high internal P loading from the sediment following a reduction in the external load (Jeppesen et al. 1999). For the Baltic Sea"

A biotic source of CO originating from macro-algae was also investigated by different groups (Loewus and Delwiche 1963; Troxler and Dokos 1973), but King (2001) concluded that this source is not a significant fraction of the global oceanic source. Recently, laboratory studies of trace gas emissions by various phytoplankton species have shown that CO is also emitted directly by phytoplankton under photosynthetically available radiation (Gros et al. 2009). Cyanobacteria and diatoms were the largest CO emitters and this source could account for up to 20 % of the CO production in seawater. Finally, another source of oceanic CO is the so-called âdark productionâ which has been reported by several groups (Day and Faloona 2009 and references therein) and which is needed to explain non-zero CO values below the euphotic zone (Kettle 2005). The first detailed measurements of CO in the mixed layer of the oceanic water column in the Pacific Ocean showed that it varies seasonally and regionally with daily means between 0.1 and 4.7 nmol L 1 (Bates et al. 1995). CO showed pronounced diurnal cycles with maxima in the afternoon, in agreement with the photochemical nature of the main source in water. Since then, measurements of CO have been performed only over a few additional areas in the open ocean. Stubbins et al. (2006b) determined values between 0.2 and 2.6 nmol L 1 during an Atlantic Meridional cruise (from 35  S to 54  N). Gros et al. (unpublished data) measured values around 1 nmol L 1 in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, with levels rising to 20 nmol L 1 in a phytoplankton bloom near the Argentinian coast. Xie et al.

In shelf waters, CO concentrations were also found to be variable but with values in the upper range of those measured in the open ocean. Day and Faloona (2009) found values between 2.7 and 17 nmol L 1 for a Californian upwelling system; Xie et al.

391,740,0.353,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"thus iron limitations occurs (Martin et al. 1991). Therefore, atmospheric deposition can play a critical role in supplying new iron to the surface ocean (Fung et al. 2000). Most of the iron deposited onto the ocean surface comes from atmospheric mineral aerosols which is approximately 3.5 % iron, with small contributions from combustion sources (Luo et al. 2008); because of the dominance of mineral aerosols to the iron budget, the largest deposition of iron to the oceans occurs downwind of the large desert regions (Fig. 4.18a). Not all forms of iron are thought to be equally bioavailable (Jickells and Spokes 2001; Mahowald et al. 2009). Most soils have relatively insoluble iron forms, while atmospheric aerosols appear to be more soluble, arguing that atmospheric processing may be occurring (Jickells and Spokes 2001) and plausible mechanisms based on acidity have been proposed (e.g. Jickells and Spokes 2001; Meskhidze et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 1997), although this can be very sensitive to the mineralogical composition of aerosol (Journet et al. 2008). Smaller particles are slightly more soluble than larger particles (e.g. Baker and Jickells 2006; Chen and Siefert 2004; Hand et al. 2004), which can largely be explained by the longer residence time of smaller particles (Hand et al. 2004). Recent studies have suggested a role for combustion sources of soluble iron (Chuang et al. 2005; Guieu et al. 2005; Sedwick et al. 2007), however estimates from observations and models still suggest that the largest deposition of soluble iron occurs downwind of the main desert dust source areas (Fig. 4.18b). Extrapolations of the limited data on soluble iron from combustion and atmospheric processing suggest that soluble iron deposition may have doubled over the last century, assuming constant mineral aerosol composition because of increased pollution (Luo et al. 2008; Mahowald et al. 2009). More recent estimates of changes in desert dust over the past century based on observations suggest there may have been almost a doubling in desert dust between 1900 and 2000 (Mahowald et al. 2010), suggesting almost a quadrupling of soluble iron inputs to the oceans over this time period. The importance of atmospheric iron was probably initially overestimated (e.g. Ridgwell and Watson 2002), because of an underestimate of the ocean sediment sources of iron (Lam and Bishop 2008) and a lack of understanding of the role of colloids in the ocean in maintaining iron supply (Parekh et al."

Together with other deï¬cits in physical function it predicts falls, especially in people with global cognitive impairment (Welmer et al. 2016). The relationship between fast walking speed and health is rooted in more healthy behaviors, lower cardiovascular risk factors, and lower levels of inflammatory markers (Elbaz et al. 2013).

241,807,0.352,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations are causing a radiative imbalance of the Earth, which will cause the Earth to heat until thermal radiation once more balances incoming solar radiation. The majority of the extra heat retained due to the energy imbalance imposed by the emission scenario selected will be absorbed by the ocean, and as a consequence, the volume of the oceans would on average increase due to thermosteric expansion (Table 14.1). Steric expansion will be greatest in the open ocean where the water column is deepest (Landerer et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010). This would lead to a differential increase in the steric sea surface heights (SSH), which would drive a redistribution of ocean mass from the ocean interior to shallower regions (Landerer et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010). Changes in ocean circulation and in the hydrological cycle will also induce thermosteric and halosteric changes. The combined sea surface topography response is a complex spatial pattern of sea-level rise. The sea surface topography has been simulated by the ensemble of models in the CMIP3 archive (Meehl et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2010; Slangen et al. 2011), but the Baltic Sea region is very poorly resolved by the majority of the models. The dynamic sea surface topography has therefore been separated into a global average steric response, and the deviation from the mean referred to as the dynamic sea level (DSL) (following Landerer et al. 2007; Meehl et al. 2007; Yin et al. 2009, 2010) depicted in Fig. 14.1. The full CMIP3 ensemble of projections will be used for the A1B global steric contribution, but for the DSL contribution in the Baltic Sea region, the calculation is restricted to the mean of three models (GFDL CM2.1; MIROC 3.2 HiRES; MPI ECHAM5) (see Fig. 14.1).

255,109,0.352,Railway Ecology,"trapping and indirect evidence, such as scat identiï¬cation, was used in Australia for the ï¬rst time by Hunt et al. (1987). This technique has been repeatedly improved, as it was the ï¬rst widely used method to conï¬rm culvert/wildlife pass usage. Due to its low costs, it is more cost-effective for short-term surveys than modern alternatives, like video-surveillance (Ford et al. 2009; Mateus et al. 2011). However, the use of track pads is limited to optimal conditions, as the material employed can become useless by rain or livestock passage (RodrÃ­guez et al. 1996, 1997; Mateus et al. 2011), and there can be track misidentiï¬cation and underestimation of crossings due to track overlapping (Ford et al. 2009). Tracks in snowy landscapes can help to estimate the qualitative crossing of certain sections (Olsson et al. 2010), although limitations of this method regarding misidentiï¬cation and track overlapping are similar to those from sandy beds. (3) Video-surveillance. Modern technology allows the monitoring of pass usage thanks to cameras activated by infrared motion detectors at the pass entrance (Ford et al. 2009; Mateus et al. 2011). This method is constrained by the sensitiveness of the camera monitor sensor (Ford et al. 2009), which is especially limiting in large passes and with small animals (Mateus et al. 2011), because video cameras cover small areas and only animals close to the sensor are recorded (Ford et al. 2009; GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2010; Mateus et al. 2011). Thus, a logical next step to evaluate the use of wildlife passes has been the development of wireless sensor networks (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2010). These are low-cost devices that, by using a camera at the entrance of the pass and an infrared motion sensor network deployed in the surrounding area, enable the recording of reactions of animals approaching the wildlife pass and their eventual crossings (GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez et al. 2010). (4) Capture-mark-recapture (hereinafter âCMRâ). These are ï¬ne-scale methods as they are individual-based, but they are intrusive, time- and budget-consuming, and require safety measures both for the animals and the researchers working around the transport infrastructures; all this leads to small- to modest-sized samples (Simmons et al. 2010). Tagging must be adapted to the size and the ecology of the target species. CMR with numbered plastic tags allowed Bhattacharya et al. (2003) to monitor bumblebee movement across a railway, with a recapture rate of 31% (n = 367). In France, Vandevelde et al. (2012) (see Chap. 16) used a thin-point permanent pen to mark gatekeeper butterflies with a recapture rate of 30% (n = 149). Alternatively, passive integrated transponders have been proven to be useful to monitor wildlife passages. Once the animal crosses, an antenna connected to a decoder unit installed in the pass records the individual, time, and date of crossing (recapture rate = 50%, n = 6; Soanes et al. 2013). Radio-tracking-based projects share some of the advantages (ï¬ne-scale, individual-based) and disadvantages (intrusive, time- and budget-consuming) of the previous methods, although the increasing effectiveness (e.g., satellite-based telemetry) and decreasing price currently make radio-tracking suitable for a wide variety of organisms (Simmons et al. 2010).

38,400,0.352,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"project(s) is an active area of exploration, especially for larger networks such as SciStarter (Azavea and SciStarter 2014) or iNaturalist. Recruitment is necessary so that citizens become aware of a projectâs existence. The starting point for recruitment is to determine who the target audience is (e.g., school children vs. bird watchers) and to then tailor the promotion and recruitment process towards this group (Tweddle et al. 2012). The creation of a safe and meaningful experience requires careful forethought about the nature of the participantâs experience, including where, what, when and how the data will be collected, any inherent risks that may arise and how to avoid, mitigate or manage those risks. This is especially important when participants may encounter challenging or hazardous conditions, such as observations which take place on or near waterbodies, from light aircraft, in remote or risky areas or involving dangerous or poisonous species. Addressing these considerations early on with careful planning and a response plan in case problems arise is essential to creating a sustainable CS program. Earthwatch has created templates for planning and managing risk on ï¬eld-based CS projects as part of a broader approach to developing ï¬eld-based CS projects (Earthwatch Institute 2013). For those individuals already engaged with these subjects, promotion and support via e-mail, newsletters, Facebook and Twitter may be sufï¬cient. Other actions might, however, be necessary to recruit new participants, such as through the use of the national, local or regional press or utilizing different types of media (e.g., TV, radio, print, online) and specialist publications. Holding a launch event, or an event at an existing festival or fair, can provide valuable face-to-face contact that will inform potential volunteers about the aims of the project, why their help is important and what they will gain from the project. These types of events also allow citizens to interact directly with the scientists involved and establish close relationships. Word-of-mouth recruitment by existing participants is one of the most powerful means of growing the base of volunteers for a program (Prestopnik and Crowston 2012a, b; Tweddle et al. 2012). With respect to volunteer motivation, there are many studies (Bramston et al. 2011; Bruyere and Rappe 2007; Buesching et al. 2015; Raddick et al. 2013; Silvertown et al. 2013; Van den Berg et al. 2009) that have examined this aspect of CS projects. Understanding motivation is a critical prerequisite to developing successful CS projects. For example, Van den Berg et al. (2009) surveyed volunteers enrolled in a conservation program, and revealed a number of motivations including: the desire to learn more about the science behind the project; enjoyment of the outdoors; the feeling that they are helping the environment; getting to know other people with similar interests and as a way to make new friends; and having fun. The main motivation found by Raddick et al. (2013) in participating in the Galaxy Zoo CS project was the desire to contribute to science while other motivators included interest in the scientiï¬c subject and the possibility of making new scientiï¬c discoveries. Although this list of motivations is far from exhaustive, it highlights the need to recognise that individuals are motivated by a number of different drivers and that these may differ across communities and across different demographic groups. Some communities may feel excluded and identifying the"

However, capturing these varying stakeholder attitudes are also of relevance for businesses, NGOs and other stakeholders (Mazur and Curtis 2008; Freeman et al. 2012; Ladenburg and Krause 2011). Studies from different countries have explored groupsâ views on how aquaculture impacts, i.e. on the environment (e.g. by chemical pollution, effecting local ï¬sh stocks and wildlife, visual pollution of coastal landscape), on possible job-creation and economic beneï¬ts of mostly rural marginal areas, how it interferes with tourism, ï¬shing or recreation, how it contributes to food security, and how the regulation of aquaculture should be. This has been done for a number of countries, including Australia (Mazur and Curtis 2006, 2008), Spain (Bacher et al. 2014), Thailand (Schmitt and Brugere 2013), US and Norway (Chu et al. 2010), Greece (Katranidis et al. 2003), New Zealand (Shafer et al. 2010), Germany (Krause et al. 2011; Wever et al. 2015), Israel (Freeman et al. 2012), and Scotland (Whitmarsh and Palmieri 2009). Many of the studies concentrate on local stakeholder groups related to aquaculture (e.g. Bacher et al. 2014), several include tourists (e.g. Katranidis et al. 2003), some consider the general public (e.g. Mazur and Curtis 2008), and some also try to consider how the attitudes and risk perceptions expressed correlate with personal characteristics (e.g. lifestyle behaviour, Freeman et al. 2012), or even with community situation (e.g. employment or income deprivation, Whitmarsh and Palmieri 2009). Bergfjord (2009) asked ï¬sh farmers in Norway what they see as the greatest risks to their business. The majority of respondents raised biggest concerns pertaining to market conditions for their product and towards the outbreak of diseases. Socially related dimensions do, however, also appear on their list, including sea area access, changes to the license system and of environmental regulations, which are all relatively high up on the list, while public repugnance to ï¬sh farms (aesthetics, environment) is ranked lower.

The LATL shows consistent differences in neural activity, peaking at around 250 ms, between adjective-noun phrases (e.g. red boat) and the same nouns in isolation (preceded by an unpronounceable consonant string, e.g. xqk boat) (Bemis and PylkkÃ¤nen 2011). Importantly, there is no equivalent increase in activity when nouns are presented in a list (e.g. cup, boat) rather than in a phrase, suggesting that the LATL is speciï¬cally engaged by the composition of words into a coherent phrase, rather than by a simple increase in the amount of lexical information present. Of course, composition is not limited to the combination of adjectives and nouns, but extends across all word classes: verbs and adverbs, verbs and their objects, prepositions and their arguments, to name but a few. Within linguistics, at least one prominent model of semantic composition outlines two broad types of composition: the satisfaction of a predicateâs argument position (argument saturation), and the optional modiï¬cation of a predicate (modiï¬cation) (Heim and Kratzer 1998). Argument saturation represents a core process of semantic composition. Several word classes, such as verbs, prepositions, and determiners, require arguments in order to exist in well-formed expressions. For example, in the phrase âeat meatâ, the verb âeatâ takes the direct object âmeatâ as its internal argument. Composing the verb with its argument saturates its argument requirement, allowing it to be interpreted. While argument saturation is crucial to the construction of well-formed sentences, language also contains optional elements that serve to enrich the meaning of a well-formed expression. For example, though âI ate meatâ is a perfectly interpretable sentence, the meaning conveyed is greatly changed when meat is modiï¬ed with an adjective such as âspoiledâ. This type of optional composition is typically described as modiï¬cation. Westerlund et al. (2015) investigated whether LATL combinatory responses generalize across these two composition types by presenting words in either modiï¬cation or argument saturation contexts (black sweater and eats meat). Both types of composition elicited larger responses in the LATL compared to the same second words presented in isolation. In both cases, the effects peaked at â¼250 ms. Furthermore, similar results were found in Arabic, a language with post-nominal"

120,145,0.349,Genome Editing in Neurosciences,"Gene Editing Enzymes Targeted gene editing has evolved dramatically in the last 25 years. While originally a technique that a handful of laboratories had mastered, it is now a common tool used in hundreds of laboratories around the world. One family of gene editing proteins is the customized zinc finger proteins (Segal and Barbas 2000; Wolfe et al. 2000; Pabo et al. 2001; Nagaoka and Sugiura 2000). These proteins were adapted for targeted use in the late 1990s (Liu et al. 1997; Segal et al. 1999; Dreier et al. 2001). Each zinc finger protein could be designed to recognize three different base pairs on DNA through various interactions between the proteins alpha helix amino acids and the DNA base pairs (Segal and Barbas 2001). To recognize a specific sequence of DNA, the zinc fingers could be attached to each other, with six zinc fingers recognizing a unique 18-base pair sequence in an organismâs genome. The zinc finger proteins could have effector or nuclease domains attached, allowing for gene regulation or gene replacement. The effector domains included VP64 for gene activation, KRAB for gene silencing and DNMT1 for methylation (Beerli et al. 1998; Rivenbark et al. 2012). The nuclease domain could cut targeted genomic sites and allow for mutagenesis or homologous recombination at enhanced efficiency. Zinc finger proteins have been successfully used in human cells, animal organs and have reached Phase II human clinical trials (Geurts et al. 2009; Urnov et al. 2005; SangamoBiosciences 2001; Eisenstein 2012). Although promising, zinc fingers presented several challenges for researchers. Their targeting ability was limited, they required specialized design techniques and they exhibited a frequent incidence of off-target events (Cornu and Cathomen 2010; Gupta et al. 2010; Gabriel et al. 2011). Some advances have been made to reduce the off-target potential and increase detection of these events (Zykovich et al. 2009; Cornu et al. 2008). The therapeutic potential of zinc fingers for a variety of diseases, including HD, continues to be explored by the biotechnology company Sangamo (Cornu et al. 2008; Wolffe 2016). In 2009, a new gene editing protein was described, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs; Boch et al. 2009; Moscou and Bogdanove 2009). These proteins were originally characterized in Xanthomonas bacteria and represented a major advance for DNA regulating proteins. TALEs, unlike zinc fingers, made contact with individual DNA base pairs, which greatly expanded the sequences that could be targeted in the genome (Moscou and Bogdanove 2009). They were also much easier to design and assemble. Much like zinc fingers, TALEs could have effector or nuclease domains attached to the DNA binding domain, allowing for the DNA to be cut or for genes to be regulated (Christian et al. 2010; Maeder et al. 2013a, b; Cong et al. 2012). Promising experiments in a variety of organisms have validated the efficacy of TALEs, although no human clinical trials have begun. A recent publication has shown the ability of TALEs to specifically silence the mutant HTT allele in cell culture models or to engineer an allelic series into the HTT locus (Fink et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2013). The TALEs still exhibit off-target effects and may have potential immune issues (Guilinger et al. 2014). Gene editing became a widely accessible technology in 2012 with the characterization of the CRISPR system and its implications for targeted gene editing and"

394,429,0.348,Biotechnologies for Plant Mutation Breeding : Protocols,"Natural and induced mutations are powerful tools for functional genomics and plant breeding. Methods for rapid discovery and genotyping of mutations are important for a variety of applications including marker development, marker-assisted selection, population genetics, and reverse-genetics. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most common type of natural nucleotide variation in plants. While the spectra of mutations induced by treatment with either chemical or physical mutagens vary depending on the mutagen and dosage of mutagen used, many treatments with chemical mutagens produce predominantly SNP or small indel mutations. For example, data collected from Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) projects where species were treated with either ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), sodium azide or a combination of sodium azide, and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) show that these mutagens create predominantly single-base-point mutations (Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2011). Furthermore, treatment with EMS produces greater than 90 % GC to AT transition mutations for many crop species (Greene et al. 2003; Slade and Knauf 2005; Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2011; Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2012). There is a broader diversity of effects reported of plants treated with physical mutagens. For example, fast neutron irradiation of plants has been reported to generate genomic deletions ranging in size from less than 56 base pairs to nearly three million base pairs (Li et al. 2001; Rogers et al. 2009; Bolon et al. 2011; Belfield et al. 2012). The most common mutagen used in the development of the ~3200 officially released mutant crop varieties curated in the IAEAâs Mutant Variety Database (http://mvd.iaea.org/) is gamma irradiation. Reports on the type of DNA lesions induced by gamma irradiation are quite variable. In rice, data suggest that >80 % of mutations induced via gamma irradiation are small deletions up to 16 base pairs, with the remainder being large deletions (Sato et al. 2006; Bruce et al. 2009). Yet in maize only deletions greater than 200 kilobases were reported (Yuan et al. 2014). Some caution is needed when trying to draw broad conclusions from these datasets as many technologies employed to discover mutations have strong ascertainment biases. For example, enzymatic mismatch cleavage of PCR products is highly efficient for discovery of SNPs and deletions of up to approximately 50 base pairs, but variations involving a larger number of nucleotides go undetected (Till et al. 2003; Comai et al. 2004). Discovery of large insertions and deletions requires more technically complex and expensive approaches (Bolon et al. 2011; Henry et al. 2014). Enzymatic-based approaches for the discovery and characterization of smaller nucleotide variation date back to the 1970s. A class of enzymes known as singlestrand-specific nucleases was first shown to preferentially cleave single-stranded regions of otherwise doubled-stranded DNA (Shenk et al. 1975; Kroeker and Kowalski 1978; Desai and Shankar 2003). By the late 1990s, PCR and capillary Sanger sequencing allowed direct identification of single-nucleotide variation. This remains cost prohibitive for large-scale screening, and assignment of heterozygous indels using this technique is challenging. In 1998, a single-strand-specific nuclease"
241,981,0.348,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"streams, hydrological regimes during winter and spring have changed signiï¬cantly (see also Chap. 5). This is mainly attributed to winters and springs becoming milder and in consequence late-winter and early-spring discharges increasing. Studies combining several hydrological model simulations (to the end of this century) in the Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme show that while results varied depending on the climate change scenario and model boundary conditions, some projections were consistent between runs, for example an overall increased autumn and winter run-off and increased annual run-off volume in northern Sweden (Andreasson et al. 2004). In a similar study focusing on river run-off for the entire Baltic Sea drainage basin, Graham (2004) found a general trend of reduced river flow from the south-eastern Baltic Sea catchment together with increased river flow from the north. The magnitude and timing of the spring flood is important for the annual fluxes of dissolved and particulate matter in boreal river systems (Woo et al. 2008). Higher spring temperatures and a higher proportion of winter precipitation falling as rain could result in earlier snowmelt and thinner snowpacks. This would lead to spring floods occurring earlier in the year and having a lower magnitude (Andreasson et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2008). However, in high-latitude catchments, sustained sub-zero winter temperatures coupled with increased precipitation may lead to maintained or even increased spring floods (Dankers and Middelkoop 2008). Rantakari et al. (2010) compared TOC fluxes in headwater streams between two climatically different years and found decreased TOC export during the spring ice melt period and increasing export during the rest of the year including snowcover and snow-free periods. Wet years have been shown to favour the export of TOC from forest-dominated areas (Kohler et al. 2009) and imply that future wetter conditions may increase the TOC export as well as many elements associated with TOC such as Al, Fe, trace elements and potentially harmful elements such as Hg. Empirical models of streamwater fluxes of DOC including both soil temperature and water fluxes have been able to predict seasonal variation in streamwater DOC concentrations reasonably accurately showing that both parameters are important (Kohler et al. 2009). Simulations of a climatic scenario with an average temperature increase of about 2.5 Â°C and increase in precipitation of 25 % for a boreal headwater stream suggest an increase in the annual TOC export of approximately 15 % (Kohler et al. 2009). The model simulations also indicate that the autumn months are particularly sensitive and that wetter and warmer conditions could cause a TOC increase of up to 5 mg lâ1 (Kohler et al. 2009). Temperature effects related to snow cover may also have profound effects on waterborne DOC export from forests (Agren et al. 2010). Higher temperature in organic soils has been shown to increase DOC export, not because of"
36,387,0.348,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"Seven bat lyssaviruses have been isolated in Eurasia (Table 10.1). European bat lyssavirus type 1 and type 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2; Bourhy et al. 1992) are the most widely recognised and studied. Five fatal cases of human infections with EBLV have so far been reported, three from EBLV-1 (Roine et al. 1988; Selimov et al. 1989; Botvinkin et al. 2005) and two from EBLV-2 (Lumio et al. 1986; Fooks et al. 2003; Nathwani et al. 2003). Spillover of EBLV-1 into other mammals has also been observed, but rarely, with examples including zoo bats (RÃ¸nsholt et al. 1998), sheep (TjÃ¸rnehÃ¸j et al. 2006), domestic cats (Dacheux et al. 2009) and a stone marten (MÃ¼ller et al. 2004). While EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 have been detected in a range of bat species (reviewed in Schatz et al. 2013), they are most frequently associated with serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus) and Daubentonâs bat (Myotis daubentonii), respectively. The dynamics of EBLV infections in their natural hosts is poorly understood, but banding and recapture data and the frequent capture of apparently healthy bats with antibodies against EBLV suggest that many bats survive infection (Serra-Cobo et al. 2002; Amengual et al. 2007; Schatz et al. 2013). In cases where bats develop clinical symptoms of EBLV infection, the affected individuals are often unable to fly, are generally weak and show abnormal behaviour, including attempts to bite (Banyard et al. 2011). Experimental studies suggest that variable development of clinical signs may be related to inoculation route and dose (reviewed in Banyard et al. 2011). Comparatively, little is known about the remaining Eurasian bat lyssaviruses, which have each been isolated from bats only once: West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV, Botvinkin et al. 2003), Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV, Freuling et al. 2011), Aravan virus (ARAV, Kuzmin et al. 1991), Irkut virus (IRKV, Botvinkin et al. 2003) and Khujand virus (KHUV, Kuzmin et al. 2001), or is only known from partial genetic sequence data (Lleida virus, Ceballos et al. 2013, Table 10.1). Of these, only IRKV has been detected in other mammals (a human who developed rabies after a bat bite, Leonova et al. 2009). WCBV appears to have a large geographical range. It was isolated from Miniopterus schreibersii in Russia, but cross-reactive antibodies have also been detected in Miniopterus bats in Kenya (Kuzmin et al. 2008a). The relatively wide distribution and migratory behaviour of Miniopterus spp. may facilitate cross-continental transmission of this virus. Alternatively, given the close relationship between WCBV and Ikoma virus (IKOV), which was recently isolated in neighbouring Tanzania, the serological findings from Kenya could in fact indicate exposure to IKOV or another related lyssavirus rather than WCBV (Marston et al. 2012; Horton et al. 2014). Similarly, serological surveys have detected antibodies against ARAV virus and KHUV virus in Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus) from Bangladesh (Kuzmin et al. 2006), and ARAV, KHUV, IRKV or Australian bat lyssavirus in Lyleâs flying foxes (P. lylei) and dawn bats (Eonycteris spelaea) from Thailand (Lumlertdacha et al. 2005). Yet, given the limited lyssavirus surveillance in bats performed to date in this region and that individuals in these studies tested positive to multiple viruses, these results likely represent cross-reactivity of serological assays to unknown lyssaviruses."

A physical distortion could open stretch-activated calcium channels, as in other systems (Lee et al. 1999; Tracey et al. 2003; OâNeil and Heller 2005; Hillyard et al. 2010). Epithelial cells that have received enough calcium ions inside could duplicate their genome and differentiate into scale cells that harbor specified cell size and specified scale size. In this time series, gene expression changes are downstream (not upstream) events; in other words, these changes are not a cause but a result of morphogenic signal propagation. The distortion hypothesis states that mechanical disturbance of an epithelial sheet functions as morphogenic signals. This idea may sound unfamiliar to biologists, but this should not be a reason to reject this model as long as the model is consistent with experimental and observational results. Fortunately, mechanobiology is an expanding interdisciplinary field between biology and physics (Iskratsch et al. 2014). Changes in the mechanical property of a cellular sheet may be caused by physical damage and subsequent wound-healing processes (Antunes et al. 2013) and by cell death (Teng and Toyama 2011; Toyama et al. 2008) in addition to cellular size and shape changes."

230,192,0.345,Marine Anthropogenic Litter,"5.1.3 The Accumulation of Chemicals on Plastic Debris in the Marine Environment Because of their physical and chemical properties, plastics accumulate a complex mixture of chemical contaminants present in the surrounding seawater (Mato et al. 2001; Teuten et al. 2007, 2009; Rochman et al. 2013c; Holmes et al. 2012; Engler 2012), adding to the cocktail of chemicals already present from manufacturing. As a result of widespread global contamination of chemical contaminants (Ogata et al. 2009; Ross and Birnbaum 2010) and plastic debris (Thompson et al. 2004; Barnes et al. 2009; Browne et al. 2011), marine plastic debris is recovered globally with measurable amounts of POPs (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), PAHs and PBDEs) and other persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs) (e.g. halogenated flame retardants, pesticides and nonylphenol; Mato et al. 2001; Endo et al. 2005; Ogata et al. 2009; Hirai et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012; Rios et al. 2010) and metals (e.g. lead, copper and cadmium; Ashton et al. 2010; Holmes et al. 2012; Rochman et al. 2014a). PBTs, which include those listed as POPs by the Stockholm Convention, generally have a low water-solubility (i.e. are hydrophobic) and tend to partition out of the water column and onto another environmental matrix with similar hydrophobic properties (e.g. sediment, organic matter); thus, when PBTs encounter plastic debris they tend to sorb to this material (Engler 2012). Thus, it is not surprising that an early study reported PCBs on marine plastic debris (Carpenter and Smith 1972) or that plastics are used as passive samplers to quantify PBTs in aquatic environments (Huckins et al. 1993; Lohmann 2012). Today, the accumulation of PBTs on plastic debris is unequivocal. Global samples show the presence of PBTs on plastic debris collected from coastal beaches (Van et al. 2011; Heskett et al. 2012; Fries et al. 2012; Fisner et al. 2013; Antunes et al. 2013) all the way to the remote open-ocean (Rios et al. 2007, 2010; Hirai et al. 2011). As such, plastic pre-production pellets, a recognizable component of marine debris, are now used to examine the global pattern of PBTs (Ogata et al. 2009; Takada et al. 2006), acting as passive samplers and providing baseline information regarding PBT contamination in the ocean. International Pellet Watch leads this effort, collecting plastic pellets globally and measuring the concentrations of various PBTs sorbed to plastic debris (Takada et al. 2006; Ogata et al. 2009; see also Fig. 5.3 in Hidalgo-Ruz and Thiel 2015 in this volume). The presence of organic chemicals on plastic debris may be established globally, but the presence of a complex mixture of metals on plastic debris has only been recently demonstrated (Ashton et al. 2010; Holmes et al. 2012; Nakashima et al. 2011, 2012; Rochman et al. 2014a). Similar to organic chemicals, several metals have long been additive ingredients of plastics (e.g. lead added to PVC; Lithner et al. 2011; Nakashima et al. 2011, 2012), but now we have evidence that plastic debris accumulates metals from ocean water (Ashton et al. 2010; Holmes et al. 2012; Rochman et al. 2014a).

However, indirect effects were also found to be signiï¬cant. Irrigation demands were found to increase by up to 90 % for the SRES A2 scenario. Although groundwater levels generally increased with increasing mean precipitation, the water content of the root zone was found to decrease during summer in response to decreasing summer precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration. Changes in land cover from grass to forest and changes in growing season length resulted in minor effects on groundwater recharge. More signiï¬cant effects were found when assuming that plant respiration became more water efï¬cient with increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. A simple approach was used where future potential evapotranspiration (PET) was assumed to equal present PET and not to increase in response to the projected rise in future temperature. The resulting reduction in actual evapotranspiration was found to have a relatively large impact on groundwater recharge, groundwater levels and stream discharge. Sea level rise of 0.5 and 1.0 m was shown to have a pronounced effect on groundwater levels in coastal areas, where groundwater was affected up to 10 km inland from the coast. van Roosmalen et al. (2011) studied the impact of the bias correction method on the response of a hydrological model. The delta change method (Chap. 10, Sect. 10.3.1.2), where the observed database of meteorological variables are perturbed according to the changes projected by the climate model, was compared to a distribution-based scaling (Chap. 10, Sect. 10. 3.1.1; Piani et al. 2010), where the projected meteorological variables are corrected. In contrast to the delta change method, the distribution-based scaling method reproduced the dynamics of the climate model, for example prolonged periods of drought and possible changes in the number of days with precipitation. Comparing the hydrological simulations using both methods, only small differences in the hydrological variables were found. Only average quantities were analysed, however, such as annual groundwater recharge, mean change in groundwater level or mean monthly river discharge. The authors recommended that additional analyses are needed, addressing extremes and sensitivity to catchment characteristics, such as sandy versus clay catchments."

However, the occurrence of Phragmites on the outer portions of the delta is a mixed blessing. On one hand, Phragmites populations stabilize an easily erodible landscape (Rooth and Stevenson 2000) and protect the more diverse and fragile interior marshes of the delta (Hauber et al. 2011). On the other hand, Phragmites populations provide little in the way of habitat and food for migrating waterfowl that overwinter in the Mississippi River delta (Hauber et al. 1991). The Phragmites marshes of the Mississippi Riverâs Birdfoot Delta are unique in that they contain the most phenotypically and genetically diverse Phragmites populations in the world (Hauber et al. 2011). The most common phenotype, known as the Delta phenotype, tends to occur in the outer portions of the delta and is considered the oldest Phragmites lineage in the Birdfoot Delta (Hauber et al. 1991; Fournier et al. 1995; White et al. 2004a). More recently the interior marshes of the delta have been colonized by at least two other lineages, the Gulf Coast subspecies and the introduced haplotype M, which has Eurasian origins (Hauber et al. 2011). Another Phragmites haplotype, AD, was also recently discovered by Hauber et al. (2011), but its distribution is presently unknown."
391,760,0.344,Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions of Gases and Particles,"4.5.4.2 Experimental: Microcosms Microcosm experiments involve the enclosure of a water sample in a container, typically 1â10 l in volume, and its incubation under simulated in situ conditions. Microcosm experiments are often used in the study of the effects of atmospheric nutrient deposition on natural plankton communities, as they represent an easy experimental approach to monitor a wide range of chemical and biological properties and their response to controlled perturbations. Microcosm experiments have the same limitations as any approach that involves in vitro confinement of water samples, including sampling bias and the difficulty of precisely simulating in situ conditions. The composition of the community can change markedly after bottle enclosure (Massana et al. 2001; Calvo-DÄ±Ìaz et al. 2011) and therefore most bioassay experiments have a duration that does not exceed 3â4 days (e.g. Bonnet et al. 2005; Mills et al. 2004; Moore et al. 2008), which means the recorded changes represent short-term responses to the simulated perturbation. For all these reasons, the results obtained from bioassay experiments are best interpreted in conjunction with in situ observations collected during oceanographic cruises and time-series monitoring programmes. Published reports show a large degree of variability in the responses of surface plankton communities during microcosm fertilisation experiments intended to simulate the effects of atmospheric deposition. Part of this variability stems from the fact that the materials used to amend the water samples differ widely among studies, as they may consist of collected aerosols (Herut et al. 2005), collected rainwater (Klein et al. 1997), unprocessed desert soils (Mills et al. 2004), and atmospherically processed soils (Ternon et al. 2011). In addition to the geographical variability in the composition and solubility of natural aerosols, the relative abundance of anthropogenic particles varies widely in both space and time, and plays a crucial role in"

Recent geochemical and bio-incubation experiments have shown that volcanic ash rapidly releases sufficient amounts of nutrients into seawater that are potentially bio-available for phytoplankton production and growth (Frogner et al. 2001; Duggen et al. 2007; Jones and Gislason 2008; Hamme et al. 2010; Langmann et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2011; Olgun et al. 2011). Atmospheric impacts of other volcanic products such as the sulphate aerosols are discussed in Sect. 4.2.3.5 of Chap. 4. The North Pacific, especially the subarctic region, is a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean region where phytoplankton growth is known to be limited by iron (Martin and Fitzwater 1988; Boyd et al. 1996; Boyd and Harrison 1999) and sporadically by silicate (Wong and Matear 1999; Whitney et al. 2005). Episodic increases of Asian mineral dust input have been observed to increase primary production in the North Pacific (Young et al. 1991). The causal connection between aeolian iron input and diatom production over longer time-scales (e.g. Quaternary) was also indicated by sediment core studies (McDonald and Pedersen 1999). In the North Pacific, volcanic ash is one of the major iron sources, due to the high flux of ash"

Later, they were treated with ten doses from 10 to 100 Gy of a cobalt-60 source at a dose rate of 44 Gy/min. Radiation sensitivity and postirradiation recovery were assessed by measuring survival rate, propagation rate, shoot height, and fresh weight. The different Musa accessions showed different responses depending on the ploidy level and genomic constitution. The following ranges of doses were recommended: 10â20 Gy for diploid cultivars (AA and BB), 30â40 Gy for triploid cultivars (AAA and AAB), and 40â50 Gy for triploid cultivars (ABB) (Roux 2004). In vitro mutagenesis of multicellular meristems of Musa spp. can lead to a high degree of chimaerism. The regenerated mutant plants will be potentially unstable in regard to cellular genotypes and expressed phenotypes due to segregation in subsequent vegetative propagated generations. Interestingly, data from chemical mutagenesis of triploid bananas suggests that chimaerism can be quickly resolved and may not be an issue in some cases (Jankowicz-Cieslak et al. 2012). Similar data is not available for gamma irradiation, and therefore several rounds of subculturing are advised to remove chimaeras (see Chap. 3 for more on chimaera dissolution in banana). Once subculturing is completed, the rooted plantlets are weaned in the greenhouse and planted in the fields for evaluation (Kulkarni et al. 2007). The main advantage of using the ECS for in vitro mutagenesis treatment is the instant production of non-chimaeric populations or the quick dissociation of the chimaeric sectors if they are found. Using this process can therefore increase the efficiency of mutagenic treatments (Roux et al. 2001). There are only a few available reports on gamma irradiation for ECS in Musa spp. (LoÌpez et al. 2007; Roux 2004; Kulkarni et al. 2004). The time at which the cells are irradiated is very critical, according to Roux et al. (2004) and Kulkarni et al. (2007). The optimal timing for irradiation is considered to be 4â6 days after subculture because at this time the majority of cells are in the G1 phase. One of the most important steps in mutagenesis experiments is to determine the appropriate dose. Theoretically, LD50 will cause the highest frequency of mutations (Van Harten 1998). Studies on irradiated embryogenic cell suspension from cultivars âCEMSA Â¾â (AAB) and âCalcutta 4â (AA) showed that the LD50 should be calculated during the embryo germination stage (sprouts and roots emission) (LoÌpez et al. 2007; Sales et al. 2013). The irradiated ECS survival has been too high and variable. Roux et al. (2004) stated that the ECS of cultivars âWilliamsâ and âThree Hand Plantyâ grew even at a very high dose of 250 Gy. Kulkarni et al. (2004) observed that a 40 Gy dose in cv. âGran Nainâ was completely lethal. Due to the higher hydration levels, the ECS were more radiosensitive. However, previous reports indicate that gamma irradiation at approximately 70 Gy was completely lethal to the shoot-tip multiples. When searching for a desired trait, mutation induction protocols should aim to increase the degree of plantâs genetic diversity within the resulting plant population. In order to accomplish this goal, it is necessary to continue integrating the gamma ray mutagenesis processes with selection of in vitro cell lines or tissue cultures using a selection agent (e.g. a medium with a high concentration of salt or"

It is often as important to know the uncertainty of a measurement as it is to know the numeric value of the measurement. Sometimes, knowing the uncertainty is even more valuable: If you do not understand the uncertainty in an observation, it is not possible to understand if a model is statistically the same (correct) or different (wrong) compared to an observation. If the mean temperature is 68 Â°F (20 Â°C), and a model predicts 72 Â°F (22 Â°C), is the model wrong? If the expected error or uncertainty in the observation is Â±4 Â°F (2 Â°C) or larger, the model is correct. If the observed uncertainty is smaller than Â±4 Â°F (2 Â°C), then the model is wrong. Figure 9.1 addressed the sampling uncertainty of not knowing the âtrueâ distribution. Figure 9.2 illustrates the difference in distributions. If there is a lot of variability or spread about the mean (which can be measured statistically by the standard deviation; see Chap. 10) in the model and observations, then the model is not statistically different from the observations at some level of probability. Separating the black and blue curves is hard; separating the red and blue curves is easier, even though the red and black curves have the same mean. Scientists often try to estimate a conï¬dence level, or conï¬dence interval, for a distribution as a way of understanding the expected error. If an observation has uncertainty, a 95 % conï¬dence interval indicates we are 95 % certain to be within a given range. In Fig. 9.1d, this range is about 95â105, so 5 % of the observations fall outside this range. When comparing models to observations, if the conï¬dence interval for the model overlaps the observation, then the model is not signiï¬cantly Distributions"
394,501,0.342,Biotechnologies for Plant Mutation Breeding : Protocols,"18.1.1 Introduction Mutations can occur spontaneously due to errors in DNA replication, or they can be induced by physical or chemical mutagenic agents, such as gamma rays, X-rays, alkylating agents (e.g. EMS, MNU) or sodium azide (for further information, see Chaps. 1â3 and 6). Both spontaneous and induced mutations can lead to the development of new alleles that can alter the phenotype of an individual. Only mutations that occur in the germ line cells that give rise to the germ line and production of gametes will be inherited. Some mutations may have a positive influence on the agronomic traits of plants and therefore may be important for breeding. Mutations can also be used in basic research for the analysis of gene function. Recent developments in the sequencing of the genomes of many important crop plants, among them was barley, have greatly facilitated the selection of a gene or its fragment for mutational analysis (IBGSC et al. 2012). Many different methods for mutation detection in the gene of interest have been developed (reviewed by Shu et al. 2012). Among them are techniques such as single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) (Hestekin and Barron 2006), denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (McCallum et al. 2000), temperature/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE/DGGE) (Hestekin and Barron 2006), conformation-sensitive gel/capillary electrophoresis (CSGE/CSCE) (Gady et al. 2009), high-resolution melting (HRM) (Gundry et al. 2003), mismatch cleavage (Colbert et al. 2001; Till et al. 2006a) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) (Chawade et al. 2010). The improvement of new molecular techniques and increased knowledge of gene sequences has led to the invention of Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING)âa reverse genetics method that combines the creation of a mutated population through classical mutagenesis with rapid and high-throughput screening for individuals that carry mutations in the desired genes (McCallum et al. 2000). The application of the TILLING strategy in the functional genomics and breeding programmes of different crops has recently been reviewed by Kurowska et al. (2011) and Wang et al. (2012). The most common method for mutation detection in TILLING is mismatch cleavage using CEL I endonuclease followed by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel. Recently, due to the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies, TILLING by sequencing seems to be a modern strategy that will take the lead in mutation detection in the future (see Chap. 20)."

Ecosystems based on metabolism of inorganic materials are of interest for their potential insight into the origins of life (e.g., Alt 1988; Juniper and Fouquet 1988; Duhig et al. 1992; Juniper and Tebo 1995; Hofmann and Farmer 2000; Reysenbach and Cady 2001). In the context of the TAIGA project, hydrothermal activity in the Southern Mariana Trough is recognized as Sulfur TAIGA and Iron TAIGA (Urabe et al. Chap. 1), and the project aims to elucidate what kind of ecosystems are prevalent, what kind of metabolisms they employ, and what kind of chemical environments they live in (Urabe et al. 2009). In this tectonic setting, in which hydrothermal activities are extending southward, how ecosystems propagate may shed light on more general questions about the evolution of life processes. Also, a fundamental question about mass flux at Earthâs surface is the influence of subducting materials and magmatic volatiles. Extremely acidic fluids affected by magmatic volatiles raise the solubility of metals and mobilize them from rocks to fluids (Gamo et al. 1997b, 2006; Gena et al. 2001; Yang and Scott 2006). This aspect of the metal supply may have a great influence on Fe-utilizing ecosystems. It was with these topics in mind that we investigated the chemical and isotopic compositions of hydrothermal fluids in the Southern Mariana Trough."
255,117,0.342,Railway Ecology,"Habitat Management Vegetation mowing at railway verges was successfully applied to reduce moose WTCs in Norway, and it could have had three complementary beneï¬ts: ï¬rst, reducing the attractiveness of the verges for animals, therefore reducing foraging close to railways (Jaren et al. 1991; Andreassen et al. 2005); second, reducing the time spent by animals close to the railway, as they could perceive the clearing as dangerous (Jaren et al. 1991); and, third, allow them âsee and be seenâ rule, as provided for both the train driver and the animal, with a greater amount of time to react to each other and avoid a collision (Jaren et al. 1991). This technique reduced the number of moose WTCs by half (Jaren et al. 1991; Andreassen et al. 2005). On the contrary, Eriksson (2014) originally hypothesized that tree-clearing could be the factor behind the increase in moose and roe deer train collisions in Sweden, as early successional stages created after mowing provided attractive foraging opportunities for ungulates, but she found that it had no effect on the increase of WTCs in her âBefore-After-Control-Impactâ, the so-called BACI design (Eriksson 2014). Finally, it is worth mentioning that vegetation removal may increase barrier effects for small vertebrates, as these do not cross open spaces due to their associated high predation risks (Hunt et al. 1987; Yanes et al. 1995)."

The kelp aquaculture industry in western countries has become one of the fastest growing industries. For both Saccharina and Undaria, cultivation begins with zoospores (meiospores) for seeding. The seeding methods are a bit different between Asia (use of seed frames) and the West (use of seedspools), mainly due to the nursery capacities and the scale of operations of the open water farms (Redmond et al. 2014). However, the open water cultivation techniques use very similar longlines. Once the seedstring is outplanted in the open water farms, the kelp thalli will grow up to 2â5 m in length, even to 10 m sometimes (Pereira and Yarish 2008; Redmond et al. 2014). Facing climate change, many efforts are deployed to develop kelp strains that grow fast, are resistant to disease and tolerate higher temperatures. Selective breeding and intensive selection of kelp strains in Asia, however, have reduced the genetic diversity and narrowed the germplasm base of the varieties in cultivation. This has led to decreased adaptability of these varieties to environmental changes and jeopardizes the industry expansion in Asia (Kawashima and Tokuda 1993; Li et al. 2009; Robinson et al. 2013). In North America and Europe, strain development will be a challenge. The collection of zoospore âseedsâ has relied mostly on wild sources. Development of a seedbank for kelp species will provide a sustainable and reliable source of seedstock without impacting the natural beds of seaweeds. Having seaweeds with desirable morphological and physiological traits will also enhance production capacity of the seaweed industry. Other challenges in these parts of the world are the legal aspects and the social syndrome known as NIMBY (âNot In My Back Yardâ). For example, in the USA at least 120 federal laws were identiï¬ed that affect aquaculture either directly (50 laws) or indirectly (70 laws) and more than 1200 state statutes regulate aquaculture in 32 states (Getchis et al. 2008). Regulatory complexity is further increased when towns or counties are given jurisdiction over local waters. Social resistance has also been a major factor limiting the growth of aquaculture in the USA. The nearshore waters of the USA are heavily used, having both recreational (boating, ï¬shing, swimming) and aesthetic (ocean and bay views from waterfront homes) values. For that reason, offshore cultivation has been suggested as an alternative to avoid stakeholder conflicts (Langan and Horton 2005; Rensel et al. 2011; Buchholz et al. 2012). Since nutrients may be limiting in offshore environments, an IMTA systems may be more appropriate than monoculture (Troell et al. 2009; Buchholz et al. 2012). Considering current cultivation techniques, the kelp species should be one of the most appropriate groups to cultivate offshore due to their low maintenance requirement and ease of harvest in comparison to other cultured species. The IMTA practices of offshore farms are unlikely to experience user conflicts, which may result in fewer restrictions on farm size and greater economies of scale."
241,955,0.341,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Freshwater biogeochemistry in relatively unperturbed aquatic systems within the Baltic Sea catchment and the background load of the biogenic elements C, N, P and Si is the result of its weathering regime, which characterises total ionic strength, acidity (pH) and alkalinity as well as vegetation cover and vegetation type. Generally, weathering reactions charge rainwater with basic cations and anions including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), orthophosphate and silicic acid when inï¬ltrating natural soils (Drever 1997). Nitrogen enters the system through biological N ï¬xation, and organic C stems from recently produced biomass (mainly litter and root exudates) (Froberg et al. 2003; Karltun et al. 2005; van Hees et al. 2005; Giesler et al. 2007; Jonsson et al. 2007) and older stored soil organic C (Vonk et al. 2008; Vonk and Gustafsson 2009). However, the bedrock dominated by acid volcanic and plutonic acid rocks as well as the occurrence of coniferous forests and wetlands storing huge amounts of organic C leads to freshwaters in boreal watersheds characterised by low ionic strength, low alkalinity and high concentrations of humic and fulvic acids that form the major pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP). Background loads and concentrations in the cultivated watersheds are difï¬cult to estimate because humans have influenced these landscapes over many centuries. However, the occurrence of sedimentary bedrock in cultivated watersheds and the higher temperatures that increase weathering reactions lead to a higher ionic strength and higher alkalinity. Relatively natural unperturbed conditions can be found in the well-studied River KalixÃ¤lven (Ingri et al. 1997; Humborg et al. 2004), in the Simojoki river basin (Lepisto et al. 2008) and in unmanaged headwater catchments (Mattsson et al. 2003; Finer et al. 2004; Kortelainen et al. 2006a). In most other watersheds around the Baltic Sea, freshwater biogeochemistry is affected by following human drivers: atmospheric deposition, forestry and wetland management, eutrophication, and damming and other types of hydrological alteration."
120,62,0.341,Genome Editing in Neurosciences,"Genome-Wide Viral Library Preparation and Delivery Stable and long-term transduction of post-mitotic neurons by lentivirus has been in use for over 20 years (Naldini et al. 1996a, b). The available genome-wide shRNA or CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) viral libraries described to date are typically packaged with a vesicular stomatitis virus-G (VSV-G) envelope due to resulting high stability and wide host cell range of the virus (Moffat et al. 2006; Root et al. 2006; Shalem et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2014). VSV-G pseudotyping additionally enhances the neuronal tropism of lentivirus (Burns et al. 1993; Yee et al. 1994). Concentration of the initially obtained viral supernatants by ultracentrifugation yields high titers of intact VSV-G pseudotyped virus (Burns et al. 1993; Yee et al. 1994) that are essential for in vivo stereotaxic injections into the brain. As lentivirus is a relatively large virus (~100 nm), its diffusion is limited in the dense neuropil of the mammalian CNS. Given this consideration, injection parameters must be carefully optimized for each target tissue region (Cetin et al. 2006). Adeno-assisted virus (AAV) represents another potential delivery vehicle for pooled screens. As AAV is a small (~20 nm) non-enveloped virus that can be concentrated to very high titers, it is ideal for in vivo CNS delivery and, for this reason, AAV vectors have been widely used in human gene therapy clinical trials (Hocquemiller et al. 2016). Drawbacks to using AAV include its limited payload size (~4.5 kb), which limits the ability to perform cDNA overexpression screens, and the fact that the AAV serotype to be used may need to be optimized for the CNS cell type of interest. The choice of viral library payload will depend on the experimental goals of the screening project but, in principle, cDNA, shRNA, or CRISPR gRNA libraries could all be used to interrogate CNS gene function. A recent study that compared the results of both shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA screens to identify essential genes in a leukemia cell line found modest correlation between screen results (Morgens et al. 2016), and in some biological contexts it may be that both knockdown (shRNA or CRISPRi; Qi et al. 2013) and knockout (CRISPR) strategies should be employed to examine disease-relevant mechanisms (Deans et al. 2016). Once a viral library is chosen and prepared, the number of cells needed for genome-wide screening should be estimated to determine the feasibility of conducting screening in the desired CNS cell population. Based on past shRNA and CRISPR gRNA screens, approximately 1000 cells should be targeted per"

Grass production in tallgrass prairie in this region is highly responsive to early-season precipitation (Craine et al. 2012). The anticipated shift to larger, but less frequent precipitation events may reduce ANPP in mesic rangelands (Knapp et al. 2002), but increase ANPP in more arid systems in the region (HeislerWhite et al. 2009). Forage quality may improve, especially if forage benefits of increased early-season precipitation are not negated by effects of late-season dry periods. Livestock productionâThe combination of warmer temperatures, greater precipitation, and CO2 enrichment should increase livestock productivity by moderating winter temperatures (Baker et al. 1993; Eckert et al. 1995; RÃ¶tter and Geijn 1999), lengthening the growing season, and increasing early-season NPP.

241,772,0.34,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"(GCMs) used as surface boundary conditions in RCMs might be biased due to the coarse resolution of GCMs. Such biases would affect model sensitivity and hence the results in climate projections (Meier et al. 2011d). To reduce computational demands, scenario simulations were performed for selected time slices only (e.g. Madsen 2009) which requires the application of the âdeltaâ or âdelta changeâ approach (e.g. Meier 2002). Since the ï¬rst assessment of climate change in the Baltic Sea basin (BACC Author Team 2008), the number of relevant scenario simulations has increased considerably. In particular, a large number of scenario simulations were carried out during 2009â2011 within the ECOSUPPORT project (advanced modelling tool for scenarios of the Baltic Sea ECOsystem to SUPPORT decision making, www. baltex-research.eu/ecosupport). The following items characterise the new simulations compared to the ï¬rst BACC assessment: â¢ The horizontal resolution of atmosphere and ocean model components increased to typically less than 25 and 3.6 km, respectively (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). â¢ New model versions of GCMs and RCMs were used. â¢ The results and assumptions of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007) were used instead of those from the IPCCâs Third Assessment Report (IPCC 2001). â¢ Multi-model ensemble modelling was introduced to estimate uncertainties due to biases in the Baltic Sea models (e.g. Meier et al. 2011b). â¢ Instead of time slices often combined with the delta approach (e.g. Meier 2006), transient simulations (1960â 2100) were performed (e.g. Neumann 2010). â¢ Coupled physicalâbiogeochemical models were used (Neumann 2010; Meier et al. 2011a, b, c, 2012a, b, c; Eilola et al. 2012; Neumann et al. 2012). This chapter relies on literature concerning climate change scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea between 2007 and (March) 2012. The focus is on projected changes in water temperature, salinity, sea ice, storm surges, and wind waves. Changes in marine biogeochemical variables such as oxygen, nutrients, and phytoplankton (chlorophyll) concentrations are addressed in Chaps. 18 and 19. The graphics included in this chapter (with the exception of Fig. 13.6) show ensemble mean changes projected for 2069â2098 relative to a baseline/reference of 1978â2007 in transient scenario simulations calculated with three coupled physicalâ biogeochemical models for the Baltic Sea following Meier et al. (2011b, 2012c). The Baltic Sea models are forced with RCM data driven by two GCMs at the lateral boundaries and two greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (SRES A1B and A2, see NakiÄenoviÄ et al. 2000). The atmospheric forcing ï¬elds of the RCM were analysed by Meier et al. (2011d). Results at six monitoring stations representing"
48,42,0.34,Time Predictions : Understanding and Avoiding Unrealism in Project Planning and Everyday Life (Volume 5.0),"The mean value takes into account how far away extreme observations are, since a value that is 14 hours more than the balance point has the same weight as 14 values that are one hour less than the balance point. In contrast, to find the median value, one just has to count the observations and ensure that as many observations are above as below it. Research suggests that we tend to underestimate the mean value when presented with a right-skewed distribution, such as the distribution in Fig. 3.1 [9], and when establishing the distribution from memory. If the mode and the median are easier to understand and to calculate and are more robust (less affected by outliers) than the mean, why do we want to determine the mean of an outcome distribution? The main reason for using the mean when predicting time is that the mean value minimizes the deviation between the sum of time predictions and the sum of the actual time usages. When we want to know the total time usage of a set of tasks or projects, that is, when we want to add time predictions, this property is crucial. It may be required, for example, when breaking down a project and summarizing time predictions of subtasks or when considering the overall potential for cost overrun of a set of projects. If, for example, we use the prediction of the most likely time usage to predict driving to work from home 10 times, the sum of these predictions is likely be too low to reflect the actual total time. If, on the other hand, we use the mean prediction, we would typically be more correct about the total time of driving 10 times. Similarly, if you are the chief executive officer of a large company and have four large projects running with most likely costs of $500 million each, you should not expect the total costs to be $2 billion but, most likely, substantially higher, given the right-skewness of most project cost distributions. We explain in more detail about why this is so and how to properly add time predictions later in this book. Table 3.3 summarizes the suitability of the most likely, median, and mean time prediction values, given different time prediction goals. You may have started wondering how we can know the time usage distributions, which is a prerequisite for even thinking about using the mode, median, and mean time usage as our time prediction. In some cases, we have highly relevant data about past time usage, perhaps for travel times or production times enabling such"
36,128,0.34,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"successional stages of tropical dry forest in Mexico (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009). This likely reflects distinct differences in the composition of early successional vegetation, and consequently resource scarcity, in tropical dry compared to wet forests. Pinto and Keitt (2008) found that the abundances of Sturnira spp. were positively associated with secondary forest cover, reflecting the speciesâ preference for early successional vegetation. Conversely, Carollia spp. responded to forest cover that included both primary and secondary forests, implying that habitat connectivity may be more important than successional stage for populations in this genus. As with logged forests, these findings suggest species-specific responses to secondary vegetation linked to interspecific differences in diet, home range size, and body size. Contrary to the flexible responses observed for many frugivores and nectarivores, a large body of empirical evidence indicates that gleaning animalivorous phyllostomines are sensitive to forest degradation, as they are absent or occur at low abundance in secondary regrowth (Fenton et al. 1992; Brosset et al. 1996; MedellÃ­n et al. 2000; Faria 2006; Castro-Luna et al. 2007a, b; Mancina et al. 2007; Willig et al. 2007; Pardini et al. 2009; Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010; de la PeÃ±aCuÃ©llar et al. 2012; Vleut et al. 2012, 2013). Some studies have detected a clear pattern of species richness increasing across successional gradients (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009; de la PeÃ±a-CuÃ©llar et al. 2012), but this pattern has not been evident in others (Castro-Luna et al. 2007a; Mancina et al. 2007). Nonetheless, for Neotropical wet and dry forests, floristically more diverse and structurally more complex habitats harbor greater taxonomic and functional richness than do early or intermediate stages of succession. Here, vegetation complexity appears to be an important factor shaping assemblage composition (MedellÃ­n et al. 2000; Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2009; Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010; Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012; de la PeÃ±a-CuÃ©llar et al. 2012). Late successional forest stands often host many bat species not found in earlier stages, in particular rare taxa, and through succession, the number of species and ensembles increases for frugivorous, nectarivorous, and gleaning animalivorous taxa (AvilaCabadilla et al. 2009, 2012; de la PeÃ±a-CuÃ©llar et al. 2012). In tropical wet forest in Mexico, abundances of the most common bat species were associated positively or negatively with variation in canopy cover across successional stages, rather than with landscape attributes (Castro-Luna et al. 2007a). In contrast, a study in Mexican tropical dry forest found evidence for an important role of local (vegetation complexity) and landscape attributes (area and cover of different vegetation types) as determinants of variation in abundance, which were ensemble specific and scale dependent (Avila-Cabadilla et al. 2012). In Central Amazonia, gleaning animalivorous phyllostomid bats exhibited greater abundance and richness in Cecropia-dominated regrowth, whereas stenodermatine frugivores were more abundant in abandoned pastures and Vismia-dominated regrowth, demonstrating that different successional trajectories result from differences in land-use history (cutting versus cutting and burning) that lead to distinct differences in bat assemblage composition (Bobrowiec and Gribel 2010). Despite the recovery potential of Neotropical bat assemblages during succession, the conservation value of secondary forests for bats critically hinges"
29,140,0.34,"Micro-, Meso- and Macro-Connectomics of the Brain","transduced. Even more appealing approaches include the use of viral vectors with highly-efficient retrograde transduction capacities. These can be injected in the projection sites of FEF after which the retrogradely-labeled cell bodies in the FEF can be targeted with optogenetics (Yizhar et al. 2011). Although such retrograde, or other conditional gene expression, approaches have been highly successful in rodents (Packer et al. 2013), there are no studies to date where retrogradely-driven optogenetics has been used in the cerebrum of nonhuman primates. A very elegant study using a highly efficient retrograde transduction system in nonhuman primates, resulting in exclusive expression of neurotoxin-producing enzymes in projection cells, has shown its efficacy in the spinal cord of monkeys (Kinoshita et al. 2012). Conceivably, similar pathway-specific, genetically-based perturbation methods will soon become applicable in the cerebrum of macaques. The enormous advantage of such techniques is that, instead of a specific region, the functional role of a specific pathway between two regions can be investigated. A few years ago, we optogenetically targeted specific regions in frontal cortex of monkeys performing a saccade task, guided by prior fMRI maps (Gerits et al. 2012). Although optogenetically-induced neuronal effects in monkeys had been described previously (Han et al. 2009; Diester et al. 2011), our fMRI-guidance strategy allowed us to observe, for the first time, an optogenetically-induced behavioral effect in monkeysâi.e. faster saccades during an eye-movement task. When combined with concurrent fMRI, we also observed increased activity in connected regions, strongly resembling the anatomically-connected areas, and hence mimicking the electrical microstimulation effects described above (see Fig. 3). Meanwhile, several groups replicated optogenetically-induced behavioral effects in monkeys with different tasks and targeting different regions but without fMRI-guidance (Cavanaugh et al. 2012; Dai et al. 2014; Ohayon et al. 2013; Jazayeri et al. 2012). fMRI-based guidance, however, will greatly facilitate experiments aimed at simultaneously targeting multiple sites in the same subjects. With optogenetics, one can then temporarily activate or inactivate one or several of these nodes, even within specific subcomponents of a behavioral task. In conclusion, I would argue that the genetically-based tools, which have recently instigated a revolution in rodent-based neuroscience, will ultimately find their way into nonhuman primate research. Although achieving cell-specificity will be challenging in monkeys due to the lack of Cre-lines, this animal model is crucial for elucidating the underpinnings of high-level perceptual and cognitive processes absent in rodents. To study multiple nodes within a functional network, highresolution functional imaging will greatly advance the precision of the targeting, be it with high-throughput electrodes, viral vector injections, or pharmacological agents.

260,274,0.339,Ranaviruses : Lethal Pathogens of Ectothermic Vertebrates,"Ranaviruses were detected and diagnosed as a disease agent in amphibians in the 1960s, and in reptiles and fish in the 1980s (Duffus et al. 2015). Since these initial cases, ranaviruses have been linked to numerous epizootic mortality events in these three classes of lower vertebrate animals (Duffus et al. 2015). Although long-term population data are generally lacking, there is evidence that ranaviruses can cause population declines in amphibians (Teacher et al. 2010; Beebee 2012; Earl and Gray 2014; Price et al. 2014). Further, the nearly complete loss of entire age classes of fish and amphibians due to ranavirus outbreaks have been reported (Petranka et al. 2003; Todd-Thompson 2010; Waltzek et al. 2014; Wheelwright et al. 2014), and some species of global conservation concern are highly susceptible (Geng et al. 2010; Sutton et al. 2014a). More recently, the potential economic impact of ranaviruses in farmed fish and amphibians (Mazzoni et al. 2009; Waltzek et al. 2014), and on recreational fisheries (Grizzle and Brunner 2003) has been recognized.

285,409,0.339,"Physiology, Psychoacoustics and Cognition in Normal and Impaired Hearing","Delays from each side must be matched for coincidence detection to occur. How? Coincidence requires microsecond precision, which may be achieved by a two-step process, where latencies from each ear are matched during development, and then precisely matched modulo 2Ï. This was first proposed by Gerstner et al. (1996), who postulated that the necessary degree of coherence in the signal arrival times could be attained during development by an unsupervised Hebbian learning rule that selects connections with matching delays from a broad distribution of axons with random delays. Our data support this matching hypothesis, with coarse delays laid down through normal development, and precise, i.e. Â± 20 Âµs modulo 2Ï, delays regulated by some as yet unknown activity dependent processes (Seidl et al. 2010). Anatomical data are consistent with coarsely matched latencies. For each frequency, latencies in barn owl NM and in the midline cross fibre tract are similar, consistent with a common path from the ear into the brain (see Fig. 7 in KÃ¶ppl 1997). Our previous measures of latency did not have the precision of the current intracellular recordings, with ipsilateral and contralateral delays at the dorsal and ventral borders of NL of 2.82 Â± 0.24 and 2.87 Â± 0.21 ms respectively (Carr and Konishi 1990). Note the standard deviations of about 200 Âµs in these early recordings of latency. Our current recordings support the hypothesis that within NL, latencies vary by multiples of 2Ï, and may be precisely regulated at a fine time scale, in order to create a cycle by cycle representation of the stimulus at the point(s) of coincidence detection (Funabiki et al. 2011; Ashida et al. 2013). Modulation by multiples of 2Ï is also consistent with cross-correlation and spike timing dependent plasticity models (Gerstner et al. 1996; Kempter et al. 1998; Pena and Konishi 2000; Fischer et al. 2008). Variability in response latency also characterizes mammalian auditory nerve and cochlear nucleus recordings (Sanes and Constantine-Paton 1985; Carney and Yin 1988; Young et al. 1988).
