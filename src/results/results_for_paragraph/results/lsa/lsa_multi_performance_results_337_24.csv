303,185,0.573,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"four key concepts as its main constitutive pillars. These are âgeographical scales,â âsocial location,â âpower geometry,â and âimagination.â First, according to Pessar and Mahler, genderâa relational conceptâoperates within âgeographical scalesâ that comprise multiple spatial and social scales across transnational spaces. At the same time, gender ideologies and relations are continuously reaffirmed and reconfigured within each constituent âgeographical scale.â âSocial location,â as the second component of this analytical framework, refers to peopleâs positions within interconnected power hierarchies, which are created through various socially stratifying factors such as history, politics, economics, geography, and kinship. Since the hierarchies of each factor operate at various levels and affect the âsocial locationâ of individuals or groups, Pessar and Mahler emphasize that social location is always fluid and not fixed. Certain advantages and disadvantages are conferred according to oneâs âsocial location.â Furthermore, âsocial locationâ determines the types and degrees of agency one can exercise. Pessar and Mahler call this âpower geometry,â which is the third component of their framework. The fourth component is âimagination.â In examining agency, they emphasize that it not only implies peopleâs ability to influence others and their surroundings, but also their cognitive power to initiate change. Suppose that two people are in the same âsocial location.â One might simply be buried, whereas the other might intend to fight back thanks to âimagination.â Focusing on âpower geometryâ makes us aware that it is not only crucial how transnational âgeographical scalesâ are formed; it is also who and what controls their formation that plays the key role in understanding the âsecurityâ and âinsecurityâ of todayâs FODWs. This general understanding draws our attention to multiple-layered migration regimes, which are touched on in the next section. Such layers of legality reflect the intentions of the powerful within todayâs âgeographical scales.â Given that various regimes intend to keep FODWs in their current âsocial positionââinvisibleâit may still be possible for FODWs themselves to transform their âpower geometryâ through âimagination.â Taking âimaginationâ into consideration, the GGP framework suggests that not all FODWs should remain powerless, exploited, and controlled by employers and governments in their host and home countries. It recognizes that their âsocial locationâ can shift. âPower geometryâ is malleable, and some FODWs could someday fulfill the roles of initiators, refiners, and transformers. To frustrate such challenges from FODWs, however, powerful playersânational governments being the main players in this caseâcontinue to strengthen confining mechanisms, among"

Another approach to researching social innovation, exemplified in Chapter 2, is the use of comparative historical case studies. McGowan and Westley introduce a theoretical and methodological framework based on three propositions: first, that new social phenomena create the opportunity for changes to social relations and structures by enabling glimpses into the âadjacent possibleâ; second, that agentsâ behaviour and roles within social innovation can be divided into three categories â poets, debaters and designers â whose efforts are complementary; and finally, that to achieve broad, lasting change, the innovation in question must cross multiple scales â from the niche (micro) level to the (macro) landscape level. The authors explore these frameworks through a case study on the emergence of the intelligence test. This illustrates the three elements within the authorsâ theoretical framework and also shows how social innovation is culturally contingent. The ideas that inspired the development of the intelligence test, such as Social Darwinism, are now widely viewed as profoundly perverse. In 2011, the Centre de recherche sur les innovations sociales (Center for Research on Social Innovations â CRISES) started to build a database of social innovations. In Chapter 3, Bouchard et al. examine the uses and the challenges of building such a database. Since research on social innovation is generally conducted through case studies, it is difficult to carry out macro-sociological analysis of the social transformations that accompany these innovations, and results cannot be generalised. The database of social innovations aims to fill this gap and to enable the longitudinal, sectoral and spatial analysis of social innovation in the context of Quebec. The process of building a database represents an innovative approach to the research of social innovation, and the authors point to a number of methodological, theoretical and epistemological challenges associated with such a task. Part II explores some of the ways in which social innovations reconfigure relations between civil society, the state and the market. Indeed, the boundaries between these sectors are becoming increasingly porous and one of the striking features of social innovations is their ability to combine the traditionally disparate logics of the private, public and civil society sectors. In Chapter 4, Jenson examines some of the varied meanings of the âquasi-conceptâ of social innovation, and argues that one of its major contributions is to provide a novel way to reorganise market relations in the post-neoliberal world. The âwelfare diamondâ is a heuristic device"

It represents a different model of governance based on a new decisionmaking process where local government and civil society organisations act together with a common strategy. They join efforts and resources with the aim to improve social cohesion in Barcelona. One of the powerful outputs of this program is the creation of several action networks to carry out concrete welfare policies. The chapter will analyse the social processes that allowed the emergence and development of the program, its effects and expectations of future. The integration guidelines in Bern are the subject of a chapter by Maxime Felder. In the second half of the nineties, due to growing heterogeneity and fragmentation of the social and urban structure, and the arrival of new lifestyles (of nationals as well as of migrants), Swiss cities started taking charge of the challenges of migrant integration. In order to overcome an ageing foreigners law and diverse understanding of concepts and procedures, the city of Bern decided to elaborate a concept of guidelines and recommendations regarding integration of migrant populations. A large consultation resulted in a widely publicised document compiling recommendations addressing everyone, and particularly institutional actors. The document was meant to inform the population about the position and aims of the city council regarding integration. This way of discussing, negotiating and writing down guidelines supports participation and acceptance through involvement of stakeholders and acknowledges the limits of traditional welfare governance operating by enforceable rules in a field like integration. The fourth and final part of the book (Part IV) is devoted to crosscutting and conclusive issues. A chapter on the dark side of social innovation by Ola Larsson and Taco Brandsen critically appraises the concept and practice of social innovation. Normative assumptions behind research on social innovation tend to obscure the dark sides of the phenomenon, such as failure, political conflict and oppression. One of the aims of the WILCO project was to identify lessons for social policies and ultimately improve social cohesion. Such an optimistic approach should not, however, prevent us from discussing the more disturbing elements that the researchers identified. The final conclusive chapter of the book by Taco Brandsen, Sandro Cattacin, Adalbert Evers and Annette Zimmer, gives an overview of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly in social innovation. It discusses the implications of the findings, for policymakers and professionals as well as the academic research agenda. âGoodâ signifies what innovations can contribute to a societyâs ability to cope with change and, more precisely, to do it in a way that change can is perceived as progress in civility. âBadâ signifies the shortcomings of social innovationsâ especially their limited impact in an overall averse social and policy context. âUglyâ stands for discourses that deal with social innovations as if they were something elseâusually, treating them like market-based products and technologies. On the basis of the overall evidence on the potential and limits of social innovation discourse, the chapter will give a balanced assessment of the state of the art of social innovation and of social innovation research."
269,85,0.499,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"get off the ground than collaborations with, say, entomologists. We might nonetheless claim that Cacioppo and Berntson set the stage for a contemporary research landscape that â at least in certain corners â is attending carefully to the ways in which social adversity is a causal factor in mental disorder (European Network of National Networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions in Schizophrenia (EU-GEI) et al. 2014; Hyman 2009), in which the sociopolitics of stress and trauma are situated in accounts of specific psychopathologies (Galea 2011), in which specific brain regions are situated vis-Ã -vis the role they play in human social interaction (Amodio and Frith 2006), and so on. From the other direction, a range of positions in social theory have radically undercut the traditional scepticism that the social sciences (at least the qualitative social sciences) have displayed toward not only biological explanations â but any admixture of the biological and social per se. In his account of what might become of âThe Human Sciences in a Biological Ageâ, sociologist Nikolas Rose points out that, âNo longer are social theories thought progressive by virtue of their distance from the biological. Indeed the reverse assumption is common â it seems that âconstructivismâ is passÃ©, the linguistic turn has reached a dead end and a rhetoric of materiality is almost obligatoryâ (Rose 2013, 4). While retaining some critical distance from these obligations, Rose nonetheless casts a future for the social sciences in which an attention to vitality (understood not only as a philosophical commitment, but as a deep, abiding and collaborative attention to the biological stakes of human life) returns to the centre of the sociological enterprise. Similar claims have been made across a range of contemporary social theories (e.g. Braidotti 2010; Greco 2005; Grosz 2004). In our own efforts to think with and through bodies, we have been especially moved by arguments emerging from feminist science studies, and from that literature sometimes inadequately gathered together under the rubric of a âmaterial feminismâ â which has, at least since Donna Haraway first drew attention to the theoretical potency of the body positioned scientifically (Haraway 1985), pioneered such approaches. Put very broadly, a âmaterial feminismâ moves beyond an insistence on the construction of gendered bodies to ask whether feminist theory might, rather, seek resources in the materiality of the body, and in the thinking of the sciences that labour to bring that materiality into understanding. It describes a move of feminist theory beyond the âtextual, linguistic and discursiveâ, to refocus on the pains and pleasures of embodiment: âwe need a way to talk about these"
72,75,0.496,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"theory â in terms of its implications and usefulness in the analysis of innovation â has been little explored until now.7 Revisiting Tardeâs social theory â which, at its core, is a sociology of innovation â allows a widening of perspective on the nature of social innovation. This goes beyond the economic and technological innovations noted by Schumpeter (1964) and, after him, by the sociology of technology focused either on the social consequences of technology (Ogburn, 1937) or on the âsocial shaping of technologyâ (MacKenzie and Wajcman, 1985; Williams and SÃ¶rensen, 2002) or âsocial construction of technological systemsâ (Bijker, Hughes and Pinch, 1987). At the same time, this new focus reveals the blind spots of a narrow economic view. Because Tarde places the laws of the practices of imitation at the centre of his theory of social development, the associated micro foundations of social phenomena provide vital input into an integrative theory of innovation. It enables a discovery of how social phenomena â conditions and constructs â come into being and how they change. The key to this discovery is to analyse the development of social inventions and innovations as well as the associated social practices of their imitation. Unlike Schumpeter, for whom the innovator â namely the âentrepreneurâ â is the focus of interest, Tarde is concerned with the inventions that are understood to be the central driver of social change. For Tarde, these are the many small inventions and ideas, which were difficult or easy to arrive at and mostly went unnoticed at the time of their arising, which therefore are usually almost exclusively inglorious and nameless. (Tarde, 2009b, p. 26) These countless inventions can change society and its practices through multiple acts of imitation, and only as a result of imitation do these inventions become an innovation and a true social phenomenon: âIn the realm of the social, everything takes place as invention and imitation, with imitation forming the rivers and inventions the mountainsâ (ibid, p. 27). For Tarde, imitation is the central mechanism of social reproduction and of social change: All similarities of social origin that belong to the social world are the fruits of some kind of imitation, be it the imitation of customs or fashions through sympathy or obedience, instruction or education, naÃ¯ve or carefully considered imitation. (ibid, p. 38) According to Tarde, imitations always involve variations and simultaneously bring about innovations in social structures and practices."
164,122,0.494,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","A couple of assumptions can be made regarding how ecological factors may determine social marginality and how boundaries in ecological marginality are similar to those in social marginality. We assume that marginalized people often lack access to resources due to unfavorable (geographical) location or generally restrictive local biophysical conditions (Gatzweiler et al. 2011). For instance, remoteness in the sense of living far away from economic centers may result in social marginality by limiting access to work, education, and health care (Leimgruber 2004). From an anthropocentric point of view, ecological systems provide goods and services that their inhabitants use to ensure their well-being. Constraints in resource procurement determine the extent of marginalization. Examples are farming in isolated areas, in areas with limited access to water, or where soils or other conditions are of limited suitability. Complementarily, people may become marginalized as the result of ecological degradation such as desertification, acidification, or salinization of soils, and air or water pollution, etc. In these cases marginalization is the result of a gradual process. Assuming that unfavorable ecological conditions contribute to the general marginality of a human settlement, there may also be privileged individuals who are able to increase their resilience and adaptive capabilities at the expense of less privileged individuals or of common resources. In environments with poor or depleted biophysical assets, forms of social exclusion often manifest (Winchester and White 1988; Gatzweiler et al. 2011). These considerations suggest that it is appropriate to enlarge the scope of analysis over a broader realm in order to understand ecological marginality and the âsocio-ecological systemsâ (SES) concept. It is generally acknowledged that understanding complex phenomena requires insights from multiple scientific disciplines, but not until the 1970s in the context of greater awareness of the global environmental crisis did an appropriate conceptual framework for considering âmingled phenomenaâ emerge (Vayda and McCay 1975). It was during this period that the concepts such as âlifescape,â âlivelihood,â âcoupled human-environmental,â and âhuman-natural systemsâ were first proposed (Howorth 1999; Marschke and Berkes 2006). Recently SES has emerged as a concept integrating human-natural interrelationships that is used to harmonize social development and conservation goals. By asserting that many complex phenomena include both social and ecological systems simultaneously and inseparably (Gallopin 2006), and therefore any demarcation is artificial and arbitrary (Folke 2006), the application of crosscutting and integrated approaches such as the concept of marginality are advocated for the consideration of complex issues. Based on this concept it is worth identifying situations where social marginalization occurs due to ecological variables or ecosystem settings. People can be marginalized due to environmental factors that inhibit their well-being. These factors generally act on distinct spatial and temporal scales due to variation in the physical and chemical characteristics of ecosystems (degraded soils, salinity, toxic pollutants, etc.). All of these factors may be used to describe the degree of marginality to which the inhabitants of an ecosystem are subject. For example, many tropical areas of Africa are affected by sleeping sickness/animal trypanosomiasis, which is transmitted by tsetse flies, making them marginal areas to inhabit and raise cattle: pastoralists who only have access to these areas are marginalized by environmental factors."
72,76,0.489,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Added to this are individual initiatives and rebellions against prevailing morals, customs, rules â interruptions or crossings of âimitation streamsâ â that are transferred and imitated from person to person, leading to social innovations. âResearching the âmany small inventionsâ, according to Tarde, is a matter for a sociology which âhas become a truly experimental scienceââ (Balke, 2009, p. 151). Social change must be viewed as a contingent phenomenon that resists any general (macro) theory. Because of the basic interdependence between social structures and social negotiation (Joas, 1992, p. 60), in every reproduced action there exists simultaneously the momentum of creation, change and transformation. The benefit of conceptualising a micro foundation of the social realm consists in decoding the recursive processes based on many small social inventions, ideas, initiatives and innovations as drivers of social change. If social micro units are accorded constitutive importance for the dynamics of society, it becomes possible to describe social change not simply as a trend in the sense of a transition from one state at time t to another at time t1, but to see it as an independent non-deterministic reality. Thus, social innovation can be understood as a âstarting point for creating social dynamics behind technological innovationsâ (Geels, 2006, p. 6), that is, as change that arises as a result of constant changes by inventive and imitating actors (Tarde, 2009c, p. 67). With Tarde, social change can be traced back to the effects of small and micro units. Change is explained from the bottom up in current discourse on social transformation processes, as a fundamental prerequisite for substantial change (Paech, 2012). Its emergence from unintended and intentional deviations from the ideal of imitation provides the possibility of linking micro and macro perspectives (Gilgenmann, 2010, p. 7) â connecting a view of individuals in their society with a view of the society as a whole. While the macro perspective looks at how social facts and constructs impact on social life, that is, it refers to the power of structures, institutions etc. to shape actions (see, for example, Hasse and KrÃ¼cken, 2005, p. 17), the micro perspective on the social realm focuses on the âlaw of their formationâ (Tarde, 2009a, p. 101) and discovers how they emerge and transform, that is, it enables a micro foundation of social change. The key to analysis, therefore, lies in identifying social innovations that spread through society as a result of imitation to bring about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). These are non-teleological and highly contingent processes."
376,443,0.485,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","SESs are typically too large and complex to analyze all their structural and functional components at once. Creating a conceptual framework is one way of thinking through the complexity of SESs. The primary purpose of SES frameworks is the identification of specific components, processes, or feedbacks for analysis, and a metric for assessing their roles and interactions in the system. For example, who are the resource uses, and do they share information about the resource with each other? How far is a population from where policy and management decisions are made, and how valued is their input about resource use? Policy makers or resource managers can create their own frameworks in order to analyze their resource systems of interest. The key is identifying the important variables, the scales on which they operate, figuring out how they interact, and then measuring them over time. When problems arise, trying to solve the âwhyâ will often entail finding unexpected connections between multiple components within the SES. Understanding how the SES has reacted to perturbations in the past can be of great help in this effort. At best, the use of SES frameworks will spotlight where interventions are needed or possible to achieve management goals, and will detect system changes over time in a way that allows for some level of prediction. One SES framework originating from political and economic science is meant to allow identification of SES components and interactions within systems of resource use such as fish, groundwater, or pastures. This framework divides an SES into seven categories for analysis: resource systems, resource units, governance, users, interactions, outcomes, and related (or adjacent) ecosystems (Ostrom 2007, 2009). Each of the seven categories is then subdivided into a set of components in order to identify causal relationships and drivers, so that different systems can be compared. A different framework focuses on the exposure of an SES to a particular hazard, and then tracks sensitivity and resilience of both social and ecological components with the aim of analyzing vulnerability (Turner et al. 2003). A third, called the Drylands Development Paradigm, aims to synthesize lessons from research on desertification and economic development, and to act as a template whereby each of the five key principles of SESs can be examined and tested in case studies (Reynolds et al. 2007). The Resilience Alliance has created its own framework specifically for assessing the resilience of an SES (Resilience Alliance). Each of these frameworks is intended for a specific set of contexts and types of resource use, but the underlying assumptions about the interdependency of SESs are the same (for a review of ten SES frameworks, see Binder et al. 2013). Researchers and managers tend to focus on the components of an SES most likely to be influenced by a given change or intervention, or perhaps those most amenable to analysis or management based on their own discipline, as the methods and theories of their own discipline are most familiar to them. Team approaches that include social as well as ecological scientists can help to assure a more comprehensive approach. Three key characteristics critical for analyzing an SESâscale, feedback, and resilienceâmay be difficult to recognize and measure, and thus may be overlooked. A rangeland SES is profoundly affected by attributes such as the"

We choose this framing because of experiences of confusion around the concept social-ecological system, especially as to how boundary judgements (to the system) and relational dynamics are understood. Our framing choice does not treat a social-biophysical system as a single entity or system, but as a relational dynamic between two systems mediated by human-invented institutions (rules of the game) and technologies. This framing is also an act of inclusion as it recognises the systemic, relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments as well as distinct relational dynamics within a social and a biophysical system (Figs. 9.3 and 9.4); situational framing sets the key initial starting conditions which give rise to inclusivity, or not. Within our preferred framing, concerns like âbiodiversity conservationâ are means of influencing the unfolding dynamic between the social and the biophysical through the design and use of new institutions that serve human purposes in relation to conservation, e.g. the institutional forms of âecosystems servicesâ if they become widespread are likely to have a major impact on this unfolding dynamic (Ison 2011). Framing choices and awareness need to operate at multiple levels and in relation to situations and practices. We have outlined our framing preference for the situations that have to be governed â structurally coupled social-biophysical systems. However, how these might be governed requires another framing choice â here our preference is to see governance situations as akin to âwicked problemsâ or situations characterised by complexity, uncertainty, interdependencies, and multiple perspectives where what is at issue has to be constructed by concerned stakeholders (Ison et al. 2007, 2015a). Thus, what is, or is not, inclusive is related to the locked-in historical features of a situation that can create pathway dependencies and to initial starting conditions associated with a new issue or an emergent concern or crisis. As practice in relation to situation unfolds, there are multiple opportunities for being inclusive or not. Here we outline three matters that if not understood can affect inclusivity."

In light of the increasing importance of social innovation, this chapter focuses on a conception of social innovation that is grounded in social theory, as a precondition for the development of an integrated theory of socio-technological innovation in which social innovation is more than a mere appendage, side-effect and result of technical innovation. Against this background, social innovation is defined here as a new combination1 or configuration of practices in areas of social action, prompted by certain actors or constellations of actors with the ultimate goal of coping better with needs and problems than is possible by using existing practices (Howaldt and Schwarz, 2010, p. 54). An innovation is, therefore, âsocialâ to the extent that it varies social action and is socially accepted and diffused in society (be it throughout society, through large parts of it or only in certain societal sub-areas). Depending on the circumstances of social change, interests, policies and power, social ideas and successfully implemented social innovations may be transformed and, ultimately, institutionalised as regular social practice, that is, made routine. From this perspective, social innovations can be seen as actions that spread through society as a result of imitation, bringing about social change: a âprocess of change in the social structure of a society in its constitutive institutions, cultural patterns, associated social actions and conscious awarenessâ (Zapf, 2003, p. 427). Only by taking into account the unique properties and specifications of social innovation will it be possible to understand the systemic connection and interdependence of social and technological innovation processes to analyse the relationship between social innovation and social change. This chapter aims to outline how Gabriel Tardeâs social theory can be of benefit in developing a theoretically grounded concept of social innovation and how it can be reinterpreted in terms of practice theory.2 In comparison with action, system and structural theories, this perspective on social innovation is based upon a modified understanding of the âsocialâ as social practices and their reconfiguration as a core element of social innovation (Shove et al., 2012). Practice theories overcome the dichotomies between structure and action, subject and object, rule and application, society and the individual, that arbitrarily define micro and macro levels or sociological âreality rulesâ (Latour and LÃ©pinay, 2010, p. 114). Tarde focuses on social practices as the central theoretical and analytical category and last unit of sociality. The social world is, therefore, composed of specific, although interdependent practices: practices of"
72,43,0.48,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Research themes To date, the research literature that focuses on social innovation specifically is limited, albeit growing. A review of this body of work reveals three clusters of research themes. Each is now considered in turn. Innovation in social relations The largest and most well-developed body of work on social innovation specifically focuses on innovation that addresses various dimensions of changes in social relations. This literature can be subdivided into five categories of scholarship: 1. Research Design Challenges: Early work on social innovation developed from within behavioural science with a particular interest in devising âsocial changeâ approaches to tackle key, contemporary social problems, often at a community level (Fairweather, 1967).3 2. Changes in Social Structures: HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen and Heiskala (2007) argued that it is social innovation processes that ultimately determine the economic and social performance of nations, regions, and industrial sectors and organisations: âSocial innovations are changes in the cultural, normative or regulative structures of society which enhance its collective power resources and improve its economic and social performanceâ (2007, p. 59)."
192,411,0.478,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"and eventually derailing experience, namely that social psychology (as an established paradigm) is unable to reach the level of specificity needed to comprehend everyday existence the way novels, plays and movies do. The contradiction resurges between the specificity of fiction and the generality of academic research (M2). In order to reconcile the two, established social psychology must be sublated (in the Hegelian sense of the term Aufheben) by combining the experimental method with the âspecificity principleâ, so that social psychology becomes sensitive to the complexities, nuances and idiosyncrasies of everyday life. It would also entail a reconciliation of social psychology with the genres of the imagination practiced by Stapel during the pre-academic stage of his career. In other words the specificity principles aims to achieve a negation of the negation, a convergence of the quest for general cognitive mechanism (social psychology) with a radical openness to the transient theatre of everyday existence, bringing social psychology on a higher level of complexity (M3). But unfortunately, this third moment proves unreachable (M2 â | M3) so that his project of transforming (sublating) the paradigm falters. The reconciliation of social psychological theory and everyday phenomena proves unattainable. More precisely, Stapel is unable to overcome the tension between reality as a littered, messy, disorderly environment and the mapping techniques of social psychology. He keeps looking for the causal factor x which allows us to address a problem by pushing a button, but this presupposes that the world is as makeable and modifiable as the behaviour of test animals in research facilities. While aiming to develop a level of specificity comparable to novelists or playwrights, Stapel continues to turn research subjects into lab rats in a labyrinth. But the human world proves too recalcitrant and transient to be captured in Stapelâs mousetraps. This leads to discontent and stagnation ($). The publication factory falters. This crisis precedes his misconduct. Fabrication and falsification are desperate efforts of a craving subject to remain faithful to the logic of the established paradigm, so that the infringement could be seen as a desperate act of fidelity, committed in response to the fact that the social psychological fact-fabricating factory as such is faltering. But social psychology fails to realise a cleansing of reality, so that it is ironical that the normative trinity eventually calls for a âcleansing operationâ to clean up the Stapelgate mess. Could journal articles such as Stapelâs Science paper (a fingered, fabricated story) be regarded as a piece of fiction, a Zola-like, literary experiment? This interpretation is negated by the decidedly dichotomous or even stereotypical style of thinking of Stapelâs paper (clean versus littered environments, prejudiced versus non-prejudiced subjects, etc.), while novelists and playwrights tend to depict a greyer and more ambiguous ambiance. The stereotyping inherent in social psychology itself is a mental cleaning device for cleaning up the messy chaos of reality. Stapel becomes a novelist only in his subsequent, post-traumatic effort to overcome the crisis, namely via writing Derailment as a âtherapeuticâ practice of the Self, an auto-pathography which at least partly allows him to overcome his Î´Î¹ÎµÏÏÎ¯ÏÎ¸Î·Î¼ÎµÎ½ (Aristophanes), his Spaltung (as discussed in Chaps. 2 and 8), while being sufficiently âspecificâ to acknowledge realityâs messiness.

The characteristics of organisations and interactions (relations) will serve as discriminating factors for providing a better understanding of certain types of social innovations. Thus, by expanding the level of analysis and by allowing for comparative analyses, the database can strengthen and build the existing links between social innovation and social transformation. In this way, it will allow for a thorough examination of a central assumption of CRISES, namely that room for innovation and experimentation widens when the macro-social regulations (market, state, collective agreements) are in flux. In such a context, micro-systems can serve as places from which to identify the processes in which new social patterns emerge. By building clusters (Schumpeter, 1932; Porter, 1990) and by institutionalising along different logics, they can form systems and eventually shape new national trajectories of growth (Hollingsworth and Boyer, 1997; Strange, 1996; Crouch and Streeck, 1996)."
167,488,0.476,The Interconnected Arctic â UArctic Congress 2016,"Understanding the ways in which Arctic science has been conducted is crucial to understanding how and to what degree intersectional analyses have been integrated into this body of scholarship. Intersectional research is generally part of the broader domain of social sciences, which itself has experienced âscience warsâ, a contestation of methodologies, methods, and approaches (Keating and Della Porta 2010). Social sciences operate at high levels of abstraction, where social inquiry includes exploring ontologies, epistemologies, approaches, methodologies, and methods without predetermining the process of inquiry (ibid). As such, different processes of inquiry result in different constructions and productions of knowledge. Feminists have long demonstrated a gendered and masculinist bias within concepts and approaches to scholarship, not least exemplified by the emphasis on rationality, objectivity, and public domains, often embodied by research in the natural sciences and visibly expressed in un-reflexive, silent authorship reinforcing âan unreflective orientation toward objectivist traditions and normsâ (Gray 2017: 180). A core feature of feminist and intersectional methodological approaches therefore includes the practice of âreflexivityâ whereby the researcher is ââresponsibleâ and âresponsiveâ to her work and her âsubjectsâ of study because it makes explicit the deliberative movement of her scholarshipâ (Ackerly et al. 2006: 258, cited in Agathangelou and Turcotte 2008). Reflexivity allows for insight into phenomena while also illuminating how such insights were derived: âthe closer an academic discipline is aligned with the natural science model the greater the pressure can be to engage in un-reflexive silent authorshipâ (Gray: 182). Thus, the dominance of a natural science heavy Arctic scholarship informed by objectivist methods plays a significant role in the acceptance and comprehension of what intersectional analy-"

Ideas and practices of childhood and ideas and practices of migrancy are not ï¬xed but moving relatively to each other and to other parts of their environments, and this dynamic movement creates and changes the patterns that connect. Although I still do not understand everything Bateson writes, he has certainly contributed strongly to shaping the way I think. His writings have also guided me through some of the more recent, related theories such as critical realism and complexity theory, both of which provide an alternative to conventional social theoretical perspectives (e.g. Morin 2008; Potter and LÃ³pez 2001; Walby 2007). These theorists regard social phenomena as interconnected systems rather than as structures versus agencyâwhatâs more, they argue that social systems are always open, which means that parts of one system will always be interacting with parts of other systems (Danermark et al. 2002; Sayer 2010; Smith 1998). I also ï¬nd relevant their emphasis on the historical embeddedness and âpath dependencyâ of agency, so evident in the variety of ideas and practices of childhood worldwide as well as within national and local communities. So many practices and choices are simply not conceivable in other contexts. For instance, look at Adaâs chapter on âprotectingâ Roma children in Norwayâalthough the Roma do experience and respond to control and oppression in many other national settings, these play out in other, particular ways for particular historical reasons. Adaptation strategies that have worked well in the past may no longer give the intended results, because the present is always different and always changing. Critical realism as well as complexity and dynamic systems theories provide ways of thinking about society that dissolve the structure-agency dichotomy, replacing it with an approach foregrounding the dynamics of practice and process, as immanent in individuals as well as in larger social entities. The issue of whether social phenomena and events should be understood primarily in terms of structure, or primarily in terms of individual agency constitutes an ongoing challenge to the social sciences. While existing literature has tended to favour structural explanations at the expense of agency, or the other way around, I am much more interested in exploring how structure and agency interplay with each other and with power processes. âPureâ structure and âpureâ agency are theoretical constructs that have little resonance with empirical research. If you focus on processes and systems, questions about where structure ends and agency begins just seem like a dead endâ at least to me, they do. Is it not more interesting to explore identity processes as processes, rather than trying to pinpoint whether a young person is part of one or the other static social structure through individual choices? If we regard Czech, or Danish, or Norwegian, or any national society as open and dynamic systems, and the individuals as smaller open systems adapting to and thereby also changing the larger systems, to me that comes much closer to understanding what identity processes are all about. It also shows how influence and power are multi-directional. Even when relationships are clearly power asymmetrical, such as in all the chapters in this book, people donât just sit there and let things happen. Thatâs not how people are and thatâs not how power works."
46,113,0.473,A Philosophical Examination of Social Justice and Child Poverty,"processes. This certainly has implications for social policy: benefits alone will not be enough to solve the problem of social exclusion. The fact that social exclusion is a relational concept poses another issue and shows that social relations are of utmost importance. Inclusion and exclusion are processes that unfold through the interactions within certain social environments and contexts and reshape the opportunities persons have. There is a link between the main assumption of the capability approach, namely that capabilities and functionings are dependent on different conversion factors, and this relational dimension of social inclusion/exclusion. Being excluded means to be cut off from important conversion factors other people have access to as well. Social inclusion/exclusion is also more of a process than a static concept (Millar 2007). One is included through activities, doing certain things on a regularly basis and being part of social groups. Social inclusion is therefore not a functioning one can acquire at a certain point in time and keep without putting constant effort into it. Social inclusion has also a spatial dimension; where children live and how their neighborhood and environment look have a great influence on what they can do and have and on what kind of relations they can have to other people (MacDonald and Marsh 2005). Social inclusion has two sides, an internal and an external one. The external side can be evaluated by looking at what children in poverty are actually doing and having; the internal side, on the other hand, has an emotional aspect and refers to the actual feeling and knowing that one is included and accepted. The concept of respect and the functioning of being respected as a human of equal worth, which we will discuss later in this chapter, also comes into play here. Both the internal and external dimension of social inclusion are fertile: the internal dimension is closely related to self-efficacy and other positive self-relations of selftrust and self-esteem, which in turn are fertile for the development and achievement of other capabilities and functionings â children that have them are more likely to explore their potentials and try to succeed. The external dimension of social inclusion is fertile because having social relations and being accepted and recognized by others and in the social world one lives in gives a child much more valuable options and makes it easier to realize them. Social inclusion is important if a child needs help; for example, if she struggles at school or if she has problems with her parents; it is important in later life because it can provide networks and is a form of social capital that has been shown to be beneficial especially for economic status (Pichler and Wallace 2008). Hence, social inclusion in capability terms refers to the ability to achieve functionings and capabilities as a child that are viewed as"

In fact, they are one system, with critical feedbacks across temporal and spatial scalesâ (Ostrom 2007, p. 15181). SES frameworks are built around the analysis of action situations similar to those defined by Parsons (Sect. 4.3.3). They have been developed in order âto clarify the structure of an SES so we understand the niche involved and how a particular solution may help to improve outcomes or make them worse. Also, solutions may not work the same way over time. As structural variables change, participants need to have ways of learning and adapting to these changesâ (Ostrom 2007, p. 15181). Figure 4.6 summarises the influencing factors at a very high level of aggregation into an analytical framework that seeks to define common characteristics of SES and to draw on both social sciences as well as natural sciences. Similar to the farming systems research framework, the generic SES framework (1) relies on systems thinking appropriate to address complex governance problems and (2) makes use of a range of disciplinary expertise that is interdisciplinary combined.

143,237,0.466,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"The Concept of Social Entrepreneurship Social entrepreneurship is at the root of organizations pursuing sustainable and profitable methods of creating social impact. It is a label that merges the excitement of having a social purpose with the model of using innovation and business structures to solve social problems. The phenomenon, which involves combining resources in new ways to create social value, is increasingly popular, gaining attention from both academia and practice (Kupolokun 2014). Although the term âsocial entrepreneurshipâ and its current meaning are relatively new, the phenomenon as a practice is not. Both government aid agencies and private foundations have, over many years, supported initiatives, introduced programs, and implemented interventions to attempt to assist impoverished and marginalized groups around the world in innovative ways (Noruzi et al. 2010). Zahra et al.

First, it takes an integrated, systems approach that considers interactions, feedbacks and trade-offs, which is missing in most analyses (Dempsey and Robertson 2012). Second, the research considers many different epistemic approaches including the consideration of poverty-environment linkages from multiple methodological and theoretical standpoints (Nicholls et al. 2016). Some of these are integrated within the modelling framework, while others provide richness and understanding to the findings. Third, the analysis is future oriented. It is not sufficient to understand present ecological determinants of well-being, without understanding the capacity for these systems or services to continue to generate wellbeing into the future under various political, social-economic and environmental scenarios. Finally, the outcome of the analysis is not an answer to a single question, but rather a process which provides key insights concerning associative and causal linkages that have the potential to untangle and answer a wide range of questions on poverty and the environment (Chap. 28). The research also describes a range of plausible future trajectories derived in a participatory manner. Hence, while the individual components of the analysis are interesting, the integration of these components is ground-breakingâfor example, the integration of social differentiation in rural settlements with biophysical outputs to model poverty through time based on changes in the natural environment."

Social norms are the accepted or implied rules about how members of a social group should, and do, behave (Sherif 1936). Individuals breaking these rules may be sanctioned formally, if the norm is written into law for example, or informally through social disapproval. The more motivated an individual is to identify with a particular social group, the more likely they are to recognize and conform to the groupâs norms (Deaux 1996; Manfredo 2008), particularly if the norm is central to group identification (Christensen et al. 2004). Social norms are dynamic, and"
164,45,0.462,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","In conclusion we ask, what can be expected for whom, from the insights gained under the marginality framework developed here and the analyses done in that context? The answers to this question with the following four assertions are a call for accompanying policy actions with applied and interdisciplinary research for marginality reduction: First, recognizing marginality and marginalized people as complex phenomena leads to equally multi-facetted solutions. At first glance, this appears not to be helpful for focused development policy. However, narrowly focused policies often simply aim to treat the most prominent problem areas independent of social, ecological, and economic contexts, and may not deal with systemic problems. When marginality patterns and causes are identified and assessed in a multi-level (local, national, and global) context, appropriate actions become visible. Once the domains in which marginality may be rooted are identified they can be better addressed, such as: the lack of rights (e.g., ethnic, gender, disabilities), or the entrenched human behavior of people who have been discriminated against for a long time in a certain setting, the lack of access to services or technology, or ill designed macroeconomic policies that adversely impact certain segments of the labor market. This is an added value to income-poverty assessment, which are also most valuable as part of marginality assessment, but are further removed from cause and effect concepts. Second, the marginality framework clarifies the actorsâ and agentsâ potential roles, including the marginalized themselves. Beginning with asking questions like: âwho are the marginalized?â; âwhere do they live?â and âhow and why are they marginalized?â leads to a people and community focus and the institutional setting under which they act. The marginality framework sees social and ecological systems as coupled, and facilitates the identification of the relationships between actors and public infrastructure (physical and social), and how the institutional environment creates structures which lead to processes of marginalization. By implication the framework draws attention to the marginality problem and thereby can facilitate targeting action, not in the sense of targeting a set of poor people, but targeting a set of root causes of marginality, say social exclusion, ecological risks, or deficient institutions."

Whether or not these hopes and expectations come to fruition is harder to ascertain, as they depend both on the values and strategies of change agents and on the impact of context on these social innovations, which can often only be verified in retrospect. Thereby we have tried, first, to avoid working with a normative concept that is imposed on social processes from a purely academic perspective and second, to take account of the fact that innovations are processes with future directions and meanings that depend on many factors. Furthermore, we have avoided assuming an inherent link between social innovation and specific organisational forms such as âsocial enterprisesâ or an individual character or attitude represented by the âsocial entrepreneurâ (for an overview on this perspective, see the contributions in Nicholls 2006). The link between social innovations and organisational forms should be an empirical question, not a presupposition."
87,151,0.461,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","symbols together form the cultural system. Thus, values, beliefs and symbols must be considered in the analysis of social action situations. Referring to our former discussion, one could say that the cultural system is the basis for information flows and communication process in social systems. Like the social system, the cultural system provides comparatively abstract structures that from the perspective of the individual may appear as given. While social structures provide institutions, Parsons calls cultural structures of symbolic signification generalised media of interaction. The prototype and most highly developed example of generalised media of social interaction is language. Parsons argues that social action situations can be seen as (action) systems, in which the personal, the social and the cultural systems are tied together and interpenetrate each other. At a later stage, he added the biological organism as a fourth system. All systems shape action situations by providing orientations (motivations, normative expectations, values, instincts) as well as structures (abilities/resources, rules, media, physical conditions). Social Systems as Communication Situations While Parsons developed his systems theory starting from the analysis of social action situations, the German sociologist and systems thinker Niklas Luhmann (1927â1998) has shifted the perspective to the analysis of the reproduction of social systems (Luhmann 2013). One could say, while Parsons is focussing on the single acts and social organisations at a given point in time, Luhmann is interested in the perpetuation and continuation of social processes in the flow of time. Central to his analysis is the connectivity of events. Rather than to ask how systems shape actions, he asks how systems emerge out of individual acts. Thus, his concern is less about the person that acts but more about the other actors that observe, interpret the act and may react or do not react. Accordingly, the central element of systems is not action but communication."

On the basis of the overall evidence, this concluding chapter discusses the implications of our findings and identifies key issues for discussion. To recognise the often overtly or implicitly normative nature of social innovation literature and to do homage to one of the most famous âSpaghetti Westernsâ, we have ordered our argument in terms of the âGoodâ, the âBadâ and the âUglyâ. âGoodâ signifies what innovations can contribute to a societyâs ability to cope with change and, more precisely, to do it in a way that change can be thought of as progress in civility. âBadâ signifies the shortcomings of social innovationsâespecially their limited impacts in an overall averse social and policy context. âUglyâ stands for discourses that regard social innovations as something elseâusually as market-based products and technologies."
97,169,0.458,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","Due to the multiple factors of risk, management in cities and urban regions needs to be based on a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach. A social-ecologicaltechnological systems (SETs) approach (illustrated in Fig. 6.1) can be a useful framework to understand the dynamic interactions between social, ecological, and technical-infrastructural domains of urban systems. The SETs approach aims at overcoming the limitation of a purely socio-technological approach which tends to exclude ecological functions, or of a social-ecological approach inclined to overlook critical roles of technology and infrastructure as fundamental constituents, and drivers of urban system dynamics (McPhearson et al. 2016a). As the SETs approach, can broaden the spectrum of the options available for intervention (Grimm et al. 2016), it is therefore a suitable framework to explore the range of options available and needed to adapt to climate impacts in the urban context. Using this framework, we investigate the pros and cons of adapting to climate change through grey infrastructures (i.e. hard or engineering approaches), âgreenâ and âblueâ approaches (i.e. the restoration of ecosystems, various types of"
278,225,0.458,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The concept of socio-economic metabolism is relatively young in the literature. Here we interpret the term in an inclusive sense that is synonymous with social (Fischer-Kowalski 1998; Fischer-Kowalski and Weisz 1999), industrial (Ayres 1989) and anthropogenic metabolism (Baccini and Brunner 1991). Modelling methods that incorporate anthropogenic stocks and ï¬ows can trace their lineage back to the early works of Forrester (1958), but examples where social metabolism and material and energy ï¬ow accounting are united with dynamic stock analysis are rare (Baccini and Bader 1996; MÃ¼ller et al. 2004; Lennox et al. 2005; MÃ¼ller 2006; Baynes et al. 2009; MÃ¼ller et al. 2013; Pauliuk and MÃ¼ller 2014). Even within that handful, few talk of the services from stocks that are germane to our discussion on sustainable development. There are a number of proponents of this integrated thinking and there is a natural application in urban systems. The âSocial-Ecological-Infrastructural Systems Frameworkâ of Ramaswami et al. (2012) begins with questions of urban sustainability and expands to the same scope as the socio-economic metabolism framework. They speciï¬cally include services from internal and âtrans-boundaryâ infrastructures, but the key difference from the socio-economic metabolism framework lies in the dynamic treatment of stocks in-use in the latter. In the following sections, we discuss key features of the socio-economic metabolism framework (hereafter the âmetabolic frameworkâ or approach) â see Fig. 6.2."

This analysis would lead to a more in-depth understanding of the characteristics of this model, including its evolution over time, as well as the effects of social innovations on social transformation. Social innovation could even be examined with regard to its possible capacity to influence or transform the development model itself (Lipietz, 1989), and conversely, the effects of such a modified model on social innovation. It would also be possible to study regional innovation systems in the context of smaller territories or sector-based innovation systems (LÃ©vesque, 2011). There are many other possible lines of research that could be addressed by the CRISES Database on Social Innovation, including: â¢ To what extent does the state-institutional framework (public policy, governance schemes, etc.) influence the means â collective action and social innovations â used by organisations to respond to civil societyâs needs and aspirations? An answer to this question might be found in the analysis, for a given territorial context, of the relationships between the legal and regulatory framework in which organisations operate; the public policies and government programmes that apply to organisations; and the factors of emergence of social innovations, in particular the needs and aspirations leading to collective action. â¢ How does geographic proximity influence the development of social innovation clusters and which sectors of activity are the most conducive to the development of such clusters? â¢ To what extent do the different types of interactions between organisations have an influence on the development of certain types of social innovation? This pertains to the question of networking between organisations, and a network analysis calls for a spatiotemporal analysis of data. More concretely, the composition and structure of networks, as manifested in interactions, can be studied by means of visualisations and associated analytical methods. In fact, graphs are the most widely used theoretical tool for modelling and identification of properties of structured sets (Beauquier et al., 1992). They are essential to anyone wishing to study and represent a set of links between elements of a finite set of objects (Xuong, 1992).

72,148,0.452,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"significantly, as part of its concern with the levels and conditions of employment, involves emphasising community-based actions to ensure greater inclusion via local partnerships that innovate in economic governance and employment creation.7 For example, the OECDâs Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) programme has as its mission to contribute to the creation of more and better jobs via innovative policy as well as effective implementation and coordinated strategies.8 In 2000, the programme launched its Forum on Social Innovations, framed explicitly around the notion of improving well-being,9 and developed an officially legitimated definition of social innovation that extended that of the Oslo Manual.10 In this definition, social innovation involves âconceptual, process or product change, organisational change and changes in financing, and new relationships with stakeholders and territoriesâ. The value added by social innovations is that they can, according to the Forum on Social Innovations, both innovate in services and help in âidentifying and implementing new labour market integration processes, new competencies, new jobs, and new forms of participation, as diverse elements that each contribute to improving the position of individuals in the workforceâ. Concretely, this has supported the promotion of social entrepreneurship and social economy organisations, by identifying and celebrating their potential for job creation.11 LEED provides expert teams of advisors to jurisdictions seeking to put such innovations into place. Of course the OECD is not alone in seeing social entrepreneurs and their market behaviour as significant within the wider economy. The European Union has also been moving in this direction particularly since the 2008 economic crisis. The European Union launched its Social Business Initiative (SBI) in 2011 (European Commission, 2011b). Initially, the potential for âsocial businessâ was broadly cast to include all types of firms from multinationals to social enterprises.12 Quickly, however, the SBI narrowed down13 to focus only on social entrepreneurs and their businesses, valued because âsocial enterprises seek to serve the communityâs interest (social, societal, environmental objectives) rather than profit maximisation. They often have an innovative nature, through the goods or services they offer, and through the organisation or production methods they resort to â¦â.14 The promise of social innovations and social enterprise was incorporated into the European Unionâs Europe 2020 strategy.15 Moreover, a series of high-profile interventions have signalled that the European Union shares the views of those who see a greater role for social enterprises in achieving its targets"
299,129,0.45,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"supply equals demand. Individuals are thought to vote with their purchasing dollars so as to guide the economy toward that blessed state of equilibrium, which is considered the âholy grailâ of neoclassical economics. If preferences can be manipulated by culture or corporations, by social pressures or advertising, then an economy that satisfies those preferences would appear not to serve the people but, rather, the manipulators who choose the preferences. Such a revelation would require economists to study the relative power of persuasion and political power exercised by various elites, a far cry from economics. Moreover, it calls into question the very fundamental precept that people are free agents, and undermines the value of liberty. However, it is possible to acknowledge the reality of manipulation and the (re) formation of preferences by a variety of social forces while noting that there are limits to the extent to which people can be manipulated. The cultural theory of preference formation posits something similar: that individual preferences come about when a person determines his or her group identities, and then observes the norms associated with those groups. Certain options are socially validated by those with whom an individual identifies, which leads her to adopt preferences for those options using heuristics and schemas (Wildavsky 1987, pp. 9â10). The responsive communitarian framework, to which this author subscribes, suggests that human beings are âmultipleâ beings, capable of acting in line with their internalized social norms (superego) and their pursuit of pure pleasure (id) (Etzioni 1988, pp. 11â12). The grand challenge facing the non-economic social sciences is that of determining how and to what degree each of these multiple selves, social norms, and processes of social validation contributes to specific preferences. Thousands of studies examine various elements of the general process of preference formation. However, they have not yielded reached a consensus regarding which variables to study or about the relationship among them, that is, have not been consolidated into an overarching theory of preference formations and dynamics. Instead, a thousand flowers bloom. Various studies that stress the role of broad categories of variables relevant to preference formation and change include biological (Witt 1991) and neurological (Simion 2005) factors and processes, cognitive patterns and heuristics, social norms (Bicchieri 2010, p. 297; Binmore 2010, p. 142), demographic characteristics, structural positions, and a host of cultural factors. There are also numerous differences of scholarly opinion about how socialization occurs; for example, not all psychologists agree that children attach to and attempt to emulate their primary caregiver in a single way, and there is no consensus about the relative influence exercised by each individual in a childâs life (Maccoby 1992). Additionally, because many of these processes and social factors influence preferences subconsciouslyâthey operate âunder the radarââsocial scientists further disagree about how to model them objectively, without resorting to imprecise subjective ways of evaluating their influence. A full survey of the non-economic approaches to preference formation and the hundreds and thousands of precise variables thought to play a part is beyond the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that the non-economic disciplines have not yet presented a consolidated theory of preference formation. Furthermore, as was previously demonstrated, the relatively unified theory provided by economics has disintegrated in recent years due to empirical challenges and failure to take into"

It is then not the more or less technical nature of an innovation, nor the degree to which its final (by)effects are beneficial, but the offspring from the realms of society and social interactions that might make a difference between innovations at large and social innovations. He also tries to show that in the last centuries, there has been a swing from individual and business based to what he calls ânon-market/networkedâ based (social) innovations. It would be tempting to discuss then in which ways there is a link between more social innovation and more civil society as a fertile ground for processes that generate and give room to such innovations. The view proposed by Johnson may allow a more subtle understanding of the prevailing broad consensus on the positive definition of the âsocialâ aspect of social innovation (see BEPA 2010; Mulgan 2006). They may not always be seen unanimously as good, but possibly as more promising or attractive than previous arrangements, or in comparison to the lifestyles created by the innovative products, services or regulations of big business and big government. While this allows us to feel sympathetic towards social innovations, we must still remain critical about statements and definitions that declare them as inherently good. Interpretations of the added value and success of social innovations, which reflect what is seen as good and better for society, will often be widely contested. By definition, innovations differ from prevailing routines, forms of thinking and acting. It is possible that they may become a mainstream practice, but this is never the case at the outset. They can be linked with a diverse range of goals and come to take on different meanings over time. Just as important as the initial goals of social innovation are wider political concepts and institutional systems in which they become embedded (see e.g. Osborne and Brown 2011), reactions of the social and economic environments, and the hopes for better coping strategies and solutions that they attract. The enormous impact of social environments for the shape and directions innovations take is a well known topic from the older and more established research and debates on technological innovations (see e.g. Chesbrough 2003). Basically all innovations, technological and social innovations, are, as convincingly argued by Nowotny (1997), marked by a high degree of risk and uncertainty in the course of their development. Altogether, this shows that defining innovationâand more specifically social innovationâis an issue in an evolving area of study undergoing a great deal of change and often linked with normative assumptions. Against this background, our definition avoids objectifying what is a matter of processes involving not only proponents and activists and their initial goals but also the ways contexts react and shape the ways and directions social innovations develop. We employed the simple criterion that social innovations are those that, created mainly by networks and joint action in social realms beyond business and government routines, at any given moment, raise the hope and expectations of progress towards something âbetterâ (a more socially sustainable/democratic/effective"

Pinocchio (object a) deflects the life of Geppetto ($), for instance, while the seductive nature of the âeffect xâ deflected Stapel from his initial course. Psychoanalysis aims to reconstruct this dynamics by following the Fallgeschichte with evenly-poised attention. The psychoanalytic reader is not interested in social psychology (for instance: in prejudice studies) as such, but rather in the question: what exactly is it that is drawing/deflecting the tormented subject into this apparently desperate trajectory.25 What is the difference between experimental social science (the field for which Stapel qualified until he disqualified himself) and psychoanalysis? In his inaugural lecture, Diederik A. Stapel (2001) defined social psychology as âthe science of everyday lifeâ, combining specificity with precision, a title which is reminiscent of one of Freudâs publications, namely The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (Zur Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens 1904/1941). In this book, Freud aims to demonstrate how minor, everyday instances of malfunctioning (forgetting names, memories or foreign words, slips of the tongue, reading errors, etc.) are symptomatic of unconscious complexes and inhibitions. Quite a few examples used by Freud involve ethnic prejudices and anti-Semitism, and this is comparable to social psychology as we have seen. For the prototypical social psychologist, the Mr. Hyde of European Caucasians is an anti-Semite (especially the ones who do not know this about themselves). According to Freud, psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt cannot really explain specific instances of forgetfulness or mistakes. His laboratory knowledge fails to elucidate concrete examples taken from everyday life. In the case of psychoanalysis, however, whenever a specific mistake occurs, a dialogue will evolve, building on free associations, which is expected to disclose the inconvenient, obfuscated factor. Whereas social psychology aims at discovering general mechanisms,"

Many social innovations that sought to develop new kinds of services also had a novel governance dimension. However, for some innovations, influencing and changing the system of governance was found to be their core focus. This was the case, for example, in Bern, Switzerland (Evers et al., 2014, p. 355), where new integration guidelines that became mandatory for public stakeholders were worked out in a cooperative process by a group of administrators, experts and representatives of local NGOs. Fostering units and types of organisation that operate in a more embedded and networked way Traditional service organisations and systems focus very much on their respective special tasks, effectively functioning in silos (Boyle et al., 2010). This limited degree of cooperation and sharing also applies, however, in those parts of the service landscape that have been shaped by managerial reforms. Social innovations, by contrast, are characterised by bringing together what is usually separate, whether this is ideas, concerns or practices. Since the social innovations that were studied have a highly localised character, they were much more embedded than organisations that were part of a hierarchical system, whether in business or in centralised welfare administrations. A good example of an unconventional form of networking was the âNeighbourhood Stores for Education, Research, and Talent Developmentâ in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Evers et al., 2014, p. 208), where teachers and students"

Even though internal platforms for crowdfunding in which only researchers can donate to a project proposal may develop faster, it is conceivableâas with the peer review in traditional fundingâthat mainstream research is favored. Some also suspect that crowdfunding, but also social payments, could establish a disproportionate preference of applied research over basic research (Giles 2012, p. 253). The same could also be suspected for popular science or science that lends itself easily to media portrayal. Crowdfunding, social payments, and virtual currencies place new demands on researchersâ self-marketing (Ledford 2012), but these demands need not be a bad thing, since a clear, succinct, and understandable presentation of a project proposal can only enhance and augment the verifiability and testability of scientific concepts by eliminating the dense prose and difficult wording found in many funding applications (language that is often mandated by fundersâ requirements), thus promoting the intersubjective verifiability of scientific concepts called for by science theory and philosophy of science. A more solid grounding in the scientific community might be achieved if crowdfunding, social payments and virtual currencies were not applied in entirely open contexts, but rather only within scientific communities (if necessary under the umbrella of discipline-specific associations or learned societies).

Mankind remains almost everywhere bent under the yoke of the dictatorship of no alternatives. The hegemonic project in the rich North Atlantic region â the reconciliation of European-style social protection within American-style economic flexibility, undertaken as an accommodation of the mid-20th century institutional and ideological settlement to present economic realities â excludes more ambitious innovations even if advanced by fragmentary and gradualist means. Outside the North Atlantic region, the major emerging powers have little to show by way of alternatives other than state capitalism, combined with pieces of neoliberalism and compensatory social democracy. Their potential for spiritual rebellion and institutional invention continues to be suppressed under the burdens of a mental colonialism that their increasing power makes all the more surprising. The most insidious opposition, however, comes from the high academic culture, in which the social innovators might have expected to find friends. There, across the whole range of social and historical studies, tendencies of thought prevail that would, if they were to be believed, deny authority to what the innovators seek to accomplish. In the hard, positive social sciences â beginning with the most influential, economics â rationalisation predominates: a way of explaining present arrangements that justifies their superiority or inevitability by suggesting that they are the outcome of a cumulative convergence to best practice.

223,51,0.44,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"The Relevance of the Spatial Dimension and the Spatial Turn From the perspective of geography-making, which begins with the premises that all socially and culturally relevant geographies are constructed realities, the spatial conditions and spatial relations of individual actions are fundamental to the formation and structuration of social realities. A prime example is the current globalization affecting various aspects of everyday life. Systematic social theories have largely ignored the spatial dimension of social life. The reasons for this omission are profound and require thorough reconstruction of the underlying modes of thought. Without such analysis, one runs the risk of importing the traditional spatial perspective into the social sciences and cultural studies. The fact that such uncritical adoption of the conventional spatial perspective is neither productive nor insightful is exemplified by the âspatial,â or âgeographical,â turn in the social sciences, cultural studies, and the humanities (see DÃ¶ring & Thielmann, 2008; Foucault, 1999; Levy, 1999; GÃ¼nzel, 2009; SchlÃ¶gel, 2002; Soja, 1989; Warf & Arias, 2008). The absence of the spatial dimension in social and cultural theorizing contrasts with the spatial obsession characteristic of early studies in human geography, a field that emerged in the late nineteenth century as a space-centered science applying to the study of human individuals and societies. This orientation and the way of thinking underlying it have significant ramifications for geography as an academic discipline and entail problematic political implications. Traditional human geographyâs rather simplistic focus on space and distance as determining dimensions of behavior results in an emphasis on the individual as part of the human species and neglects his or her capacity to perform social actions, which is fundamental for the meaningful construction of social and cultural realities. Arrival at this perspective needed a theoretical and not always successful debate lasting more than a century. The insights it has contributed greatly help the current debate about the spatial turn in the social and cultural sciences, identify its implications (some of which are problematic), and detect its shortcomings on the background of the history of geographical research. Observed from the current theoretical debates, the first turn from human geography to social geography as of the early twentieth century was theoretically uninformed about social science and showed that merely integrating the social dimension"

271,45,0.435,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"Beyond detailed research results, existing studies on mediatization agree that any process of mediatization is very specific in relation to the social domain under consideration. This term social domain is used by various representatives of mediatization research (amongst others Hjarvard 2013; EkstrÃ¶m et al. 2016; Lunt and Livingstone 2016), while coming close to the everyday understanding of âspheresâ of society. In its widest sense, the term âsocial domainâ refers to those âspheresâ as being meaningful in everyday practice. The scaling of the different âmeaningful domainsâ can be very different, reaching from certain social groups or organizations to whole social fields or systems. We can understand this scaling to be a problem of terminological blurriness. However, the main argument being pushed forward in mediatization research is different. By hinting at the domain specificity of mediatization, scholars want to emphasize the variety of mediatization across different spheres of society. Mediatization is not a homogeneous process but very much differs from one area to another. It is a âdomain-specificâ phenomenon. We can understand this as taking up a long tradition in social sciences relating to the idea of âsocialâ as well as âculturalâ differentiation (Winter and Eckert 1990: 142â151; Hahn 2000: 14â24; Schimank 2013: 37â50; 131â149). Max Weber, for example, used the term WertsphÃ¤ren (Weber 1988 [1919]: 611) to reflect this. Pierre Bourdieu (1993) described processes of differentiation by analyzing differences within and across âsocial fieldsâ. Roger Friedland and Robert Alford (1991) preferred the idea of âinstitutional fieldsâ. In system theory, we find the concept of âsubsystemâ (Luhmann 2012, Vol. 2: 4â27), a term which was also used by JÃ¼rgen Habermas (1992) to describe social differentiation. In a similar vein, phenomenology puts emphasis on different (small) âlife-worldsâ (SchÃ¼tz 1967: 139â144; Luckmann 1970: 587), with a certain relationship to the âsocial worldsâ of symbolic interactionism (Shibutani 1955: 566; Strauss 1978; Clarke 2011: 384â385). More recently, Luc Boltanski and Laurent ThÃ©venot (2006) proposed the idea of different âorders of justificationâ."
293,17,0.433,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Dutch context, Schinkel (2010) coincides to note that the very notion of society is problematic, as it implies the existence of a more or less homogeneous and cohesive social environment in which only certain types of peopleânamely migrantsâneed to integrate. Despite being a contested concept, integration continues to be central in many studies and debates on the settlement of newcomers in host societies. In Europe, several authors have attempted to strip the concept of its normative character and build a more open and analytical definition (Hoffmann-Novotny 1973; Esser 1980; Heckmann 1981, 2015; Penninx 1989, 2005; Bommes 2012). Esser (2004, 46) defines integration as âthe inclusion [of individual actors] in already existing social systemsâ. For Heckmann (2006, 18), integration is âa generations lasting process of inclusion and acceptance of migrants in the core institutions, relations and statuses of the receiving societyâ. According to Bommes (2012, 113), âthe problem of migrant assimilation refers to no more (and no less) than the conditions under which they succeed or fail to fulfil the conditions of participation in social systemsâ. In order to work or to gain access to goods, education, rights, and social welfare, Bommes (ibid.) argues, every individual must have some knowledge of what it means to work or how to behave as a patient, a client, a pupil, a student, or an applicant. From this perspective, there is no alternative to integration. Interestingly, all of these approaches have in common the assumption that actors (immigrants in this case) are partially engaged in multiple autonomous and interdependent fields or systems. This implies a shift away from a holistic approach that conceptualizes integration into a taken-for-granted reference populationâthe âcore cultureâ or national society as a wholeâtowards a disaggregated approach that considers not only multiple reference populations but also distinct processes occurring in different domains (Brubaker 2001, 542â544). For instance, Esser (2001, 16) refers to four dimensions: culturation (similar to socialization), placement (position in society), interaction (social relations and networks), and identification (belonging). Similarly, Heckmann and Schnapper (2003) distinguish between structural integration, cultural integration (or acculturation), interactive integration, and identificational integration. From this perspective, integration dynamics and tempos are viewed as different for each dimension, and processes of structural marginalization and inequality become key. In line with these more recent approaches to the concept of integration, this chapter aims to set up an analytical framework for the study of integration processes and policies. For this purpose, we focus in the first part on the concept of integration, introducing an open non-normative analytical definition and identifying the main dimensions, parties involved, levels of analysis, and other relevant factors such as time and generations. In the second part, we define integration policies and propose a distinction between policy frames and concrete policy measures as well as a shift from government to governance in order to account for the complex, multi-layered, and often contradictory character of integration policies. The conclusion returns to the concepts of integration and integration policies and suggests lines for further research."
99,491,0.43,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In order to provide some counterweight against the inevitable parade of successful innovations that comes out of such a project as WILCO, we adopted a more critical perspective on social innovation research. As this chapter has shown, many perspectives on social innovations have explicit or hidden normative assumptions that obscure the dark side of the phenomenon: the failures, the conflicts and the oppression of universalistic approaches. As argued in the previous sections, attention for detail and a diverse group can go some way in preventing such assumptions from stifling the debate. In the end, one should always have a few critical questions at hand. Who benefits from the introduction of social innovations? Who loses? Did anything get worse? Common sense also helps. In the context of welfare, many of the problems are what policy science calls wicked problems, such as poverty, addictions and homelessness. These do not have easy or ultimate solutions. Eldorado is not around the corner."

Second, these people do not float in a global space, but need to touch ground from time to time (Ley 2004). An analysis of transnationalism as an everyday phenomenon needs, therefore, to take into account the localities where the social practice that constitutes these relations and communications across borders, takes place. Locality therefore represents, on the one hand, the social context in which migrants and other transnational actors are rooted, and it stands, on the other hand, for the nodes of the networks (Gielis 2009). Some authors have called such places translocal because they are meaningful owing to their connection across national borders (Brickell and Datta 2011; Smith 2011). Third, these localities need to be connected somehow to become translocal. Such connections have been addressed conceptually through the study of networks (Featherstone 2007; Featherstone et al. 2007). Fourth, the spatial formation that is constituted through the networks of people and places and the practices that maintain them have been termed transnational social spaces (Pries 2008; Faist 2009). Transnational studies confront researchers with a social phenomenon that is complex, because it is, on the one hand, spatially disrupted, and on the other hand, highly connected in social terms. Researchers have developed various approaches to deal with this complexity. One of the earliest and most cited is the notion of multi-sited research that was discussed prominently by Marcus (1995). The idea of following people, things, metaphors, stories, biographies, or conflicts has been used in various studies in the field of transnational migration (Amelina 2010; Sinatti 2011). Nevertheless, some scholars criticize that these research strategies are seldom truly multi-, but rather, double-sited and that it seems impossible to conduct an equally intensive ethnography in multiple sites (Hage 2005). The problem of conducting parallel ethnographies has, for instance, been addressed by Mazzucato (2010: 206) with her âsimultaneous matched samples.â While being resource-intensive, the advantage of conducting research simultaneously at two sites by two connected groups of researchers provides accounts of simultaneity that cannot be apprehended otherwise. Other researchers, such as Tarrius, have stressed the aspect of movement and created a moving ethnography (Tarrius 2000; Tarrius 2002). This leads also to mobile methods: â[A] mobile ethnography involves travelling with people and things, participating in their continual shift through time, place and relations with othersâ (Watts and Urry 2008: 867). The âmoving territoriesâ Tarrius (2001) evokes, point towards the tensions that lie at the heart of research on transnationalism: the ambivalence between fixing people and places (territories) and their constant movement. All these approaches have in common, that they obtain rich data by a variety of methods. The research strategy we are presenting here is also a mixed-methods approach that bridges the spatial disruption and grasps the notions of movement and fixity that are always competing in these studies. A comparison with items measuring the characteristics of social networks in quantitative household panel data exemplifies the reasoning behind our approach. Of course, social capital as a resource and social network data have also gained importance in recent years in quantitative research. For instance, the Swiss household panel, includes a variety of items to grasp the extent of a householdâs network and can be used for analysis of social support (see for instance Bachmann 2014). However, the data are unsuitable for our question for"

The first major change has been the blurring of the previously sacrosanct demarcation between profit and nonprofit. What started off as the adoption of corporate rigor has evolved into the implementation of numerous business tools, such as the use of profit as a motive or the notion that key performance indicators (KPIs) are applicable in nonprofit management as well. This has shaken out with organizations sitting at various points on the profitânonprofit continuum, offering an array of options for funders. One of the most powerful social investment trends to emerge from this new thinking is the creation of social enterprises on the organizational side and impact investing on the funding side. The term social enterprise is used often to refer to a host of initiatives and models. A social enterprise must perform the delicate balancing act of meeting its financial obligations while staying true to its social imperatives."
164,601,0.429,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","by Banks in 1972 in reference to Robert Owen. While there is no commonly agreed upon definition of social entrepreneurship, most authors agree that the three defining features of social entrepreneurship are sociality, innovation, and market orientation (Nicholls 2006). The explicit and central social mission of social entrepreneurs is reflected in the special emphasis on projects designed to improve the quality of life of humans: health, nutrition, education, training, and the creation of stable and productive jobs (Bornstein 2007). Opinions differ, however, as to what extent social entrepreneurs are necessarily engaged in business activities. For instance Ashoka founder Bill Drayton contends that social entrepreneurs are âchange makers,â but not necessarily business people. According to Drayton people like Florence Nightingale, who revolutionized health care, are good historical examples of social entrepreneurs. They were committed to creating change in their societies and employed entrepreneurial principles, but they did not see themselves as business operators (Lamb 2011). Observers also disagree over whether social entrepreneurship refers only to nonprofit or also to profit-seeking enterprises. While some authors require the primacy of social targets over all other objectives, many so-called hybrid organizations also exist that operate with a double or triple bottom line (i.e., aiming at social, financial, and environmental returns on investment) (Dees 1998; Guclu et al. 2002; Mair and MartÃ­ 2006; Nicholls 2006; Bornstein 2007; Seelos and Mair 2007; Certo and Miller 2008). The idea of a triple bottom line was introduced by Spreckley (1981), who proposed to add criteria other than financial performance to measure the success of enterprises. The term was then promoted by John Elkington (1997) in his book Cannibals with Forks. In the absence of a common definition, an exact number of existing social enterprises is difficult to find. A recent report counted 55,000 social enterprises in the UK alone in 2006 (Brown and Campanale 2006). Ashoka, one of the pioneers in supporting social entrepreneurs, has 2,500 âfellowsâ worldwide.3 The organization, which was set up in 1980 by Bill Drayton, brings communities of social entrepreneurs together to help leverage their impacts, to broaden the scale of their ideas, and to capture and disseminate examples of best practices. To this end Ashoka selects social entrepreneurs as âAshoka Fellowsâ and provides them with living stipends for an average of three years, professional support, and access to a global network of peers in 70 countries. The organization started with an annual budget of US$50,000 and grew to nearly US$35 million by 2008, and is now active in 60 countries. Several organizations have followed the approach pioneered by Ashoka. Two well-known examples are the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship and the Skoll Foundation. Launched in 1998 by Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, and his wife Hilde, the Schwab Foundation promotes âentrepreneurial solutions and social commitment with a clear impact at the grassroots level.â4 The foundationâs activities focus on supporting social entrepreneurs strategically by"

To identify and explore the barriers and bridges to that integration, a range of social and systems sciences were applied to examine the effectiveness of ârepublican,â e.g., national, based on the French system, and traditional forms of governance and the potential to harmonize them. In addition, exercises in scenario development allowed managers and planners to explore potential paths of policy development. Finally, conceptual modeling afforded a systems analysis of the ecological, economic, and social factors that can individually or by interaction create opportunities or barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries management. The results were used to make recommendations for ï¬sh and water policies, in education (universities and governmental agricultural professional schools), and will have practical relevance for food security and health care (Melcher et al. 2013; Ouedraogo et al. 2014; Sendzimir et al. 2015).

247,44,0.428,Humanities World Report 2015,"Archaeology, more than any other humanities discipline, benefits from the natural sciences (and their associated technology). But, increasingly in the field of environmental and climate science, the influence may be working the other way around. Archaeological research is becoming a more important source of evidence in these fields.20 History is closely intertwined with the social sciences, all of which include a historical dimension or subdivision, whether political, legal, social or economic. Indeed, the fact that history so obviously contributes to the social sciences says something about the arbitrariness of the distinction between humanities and social sciences. Also, history is becoming increasingly important in the understanding of environmental change. This is part of a wider trend, the âhistorical turnâ, where more and more academic disciplines are embracing an interest in historical perspectives. Historical research over long time-periods can bring a new perspective to the social sciences. For example, it has been shown that over time the world has witnessed a substantial decline in violent interpersonal conflicts. For instance, in Europe over the last three or four centuries there has been a substantial drop in homicide rates.21 Furthermore, it seems clear that there is a close and sustained correlation between manslaughter and alcohol consumption.

In addition to incorporating multiple perspectives, AM increases adaptive capacity by shifting decision-making processes from linear (crisisâanalysisâ policy) to a cyclic process (Fig. 1.3). This process structures learning and iteratively integrates how we modify assessment and policy formulation, implementation, and monitoring in order to track and manage change in the world (Magnuszewski et al. 2005). The search for durable solutions to crises in ecosystems and society has repeatedly expanded the scope of inquiry outward from science to develop policies based on a broader base of experience and practice. Initial experiments (Holling 1978) acknowledged government and local practice but focused mostly on bridging disciplines within science. Subsequent experiments worked to include government (Walters 1986), local practitioners (Light and Blann 2000). However, managing aquatic ecosystems proceeds over time scales (decades) that far exceed those of individual projects or individual management campaigns. To make ecosystems sustainable, the adaptive potential raised by AM must be sustained over periods long enough to institutionalize adaptive and sustainable practices. This drive to build long-term ecosystem sustainability proposed adaptive governance as a framework that would foster AM while addressing social aspects neglected in initial AM experiments (Gunderson et al. 2016). Speciï¬cally, it should create a workspace where formal and informal institutions can collaborate to understand and manage complex issues in social-ecological systems (Schultz et al. 2015). Adaptive governance would be distinguished by its capacity to increase the importance of learning and to bridge previously separate levels: formal/informal, scales of administration (polycentricity), in ways that embrace cross-scale interactions in ecosystems and society (Chafï¬n et al. 2014; Chafï¬n and Gunderson 2015)."

By raising such questions, the biographical approach is perfectly suited to track the impact of social inequality and the constraints and restrictions it imposes on the transition into adulthood for second-generation residents down to the level of individual experiences, strategies and sense-making."

Such activity typically comes up against strong vested interests and can encounter (sometimes violent) resistance. As a consequence, the politicisation of social innovation research offers an important new lens through which systemic change can be understood: recognising the political dimension of social innovation is not merely a research opportunity, but it also raises significant practical questions and challenges. Political action often prompts a reaction and can lead to institutional confrontation or even danger. Further, when social innovation addresses public welfare issues or aims to drive political change, it typically does so as private action that lacks any formal democratic legitimacy. This is particularly problematic in cases where social innovation acts as a âshadow stateâ substituting for what would otherwise be the welfare responsibilities of the elected state. Such a democratic deficit challenges rights-based models of citizensâ relationship to their government. There is also the more general issue of who is included in, and who is excluded from, social innovation impacts. A second issue concerns the public legitimacy of social innovation. Many social innovations that aim to address institutional voids may initially lack legitimacy to key populations. This is because they often take the form of interventions that combine otherwise distinct institutional logics and models of action in innovative forms and that challenge normative notions of the roles and responsibilities of the discrete sectors. Such hybrid forms of action typically blend the logics and rationales of two or more established sectors to build new organisational structures (i.e., âsocialâ business), processes (i.e., work integration models) or goods and services (i.e., user-led welfare models) that correspond to complex sets of needs and demands in late modern societies better than conventional interventions do. The logics and rationales of action of each conventional sector are quite different and even contradictory at the normative level. As a consequence, the public legitimacy of social innovation (at both normative and cognitive levels: see Suchman, 1995) can often be compromised, with new models variously seen as attempts to privatise the social, dismantle the state or undermine civil society (Nicholls and Cho, 2006). The reaction to the social enterprise/social business hybrid model within social innovation has been particularly hostile since this challenges fundamental principles of the state and civil society as not-for-profit sectors in many countries. Such loss of public legitimacy can have serious consequences in terms of access to resources, market competitiveness, policy support and staff recruitment."

A U.S. National Academy of Sciences report suggested efforts âto facilitate crosscutting research focused on understanding the interaction among the climate, human, and environmental systems â¦â (NRC 2009). The Future Earth initiative stemmed from the proposal for âa new contract between science and society in recognition that science must inform policy to make more wise and timely decisions â¦â (ICSU 2012). In the U.S., the Obama Administration directed U.S. Federal agencies in 2015 to factor the value of ecosystem services into Federal planning and decision-making (OMB 2015).

According to Tardif (2005, p. 25), the approach is based on the notion of the emergence of social innovation: As a localized process initiated by different actors who seek to change the interactions taking place between themselves as well as with their organizational and institutional environment â the whole with the aim to counteract the impact of crises while attempting to reconcile the different levels of individual interest, public interest and common good. The statistical analysis of data will make it possible to move from a micro to a meso and macro approach to studying social innovation. The assumption is that there are objects of study of relevance for social innovation that are not observable at the micro scale. At the meso level of analysis, such a database will allow for a new reading of social innovations in terms of the mechanisms, configurations, evolution and modes of dissemination in time and across locations and sectors of activity. The approach will, moreover, make it possible to focus on phenomena hitherto little studied in the QuÃ©bec context, such as the emergence and dissemination of innovation clusters, including their patterns and paths of institutionalisation or even their configuration into an innovation system, and to examine their impacts on social transformation, in particular with regard to the QuÃ©bec development model. This framework, once applied to QuÃ©bec, may be extended to other areas in order to conduct international comparisons. There are, indeed, times and territories where social innovations tend to multiply, taking the form of innovation clusters, especially at the onset of crises or in economies with plural tendencies (Klein et al., 2013). Innovations are, then, oriented along emerging socio-technical paradigms, such as new representations of problems and possible solutions or experiments that were successfully carried out in organisations and local communities. For example, during the 1980s and 1990s in QuÃ©bec, when the crisis of Fordism and the welfare state became apparent, social innovations arose in the areas of labour, people services, collective enterprises, public policies and local development (the areas that CRISES focuses on). Using the CRISES Database on Social Innovations, it will be possible to trace the dynamics of the emergence of these innovations as well as their spread into clusters and their wider impacts on society. For example, a researcher might study the proximity effect, which is a phenomenon that promotes collective dynamics with the potential to modulate or reject the dominant forms of social control or"

The community and domestic units (blood-related or legal and ritual family units in this case) are the social institutions that mediate the causes and consequences of migration at the material and symbolic level. From a social psychological perspective, much mainstream research linked to justice in Mexico, Latin America, and North America (e.g. research into difference, discrimination, racism, violence, personality, identity, gender, inter-group relations, cooperation, and competition) has been undertaken from an individual and group perspective, leaving behind or in second place anthropological, societal, and sociological considerations.5 This has to do with the influence and weight of the behaviourist perspective, which can be traced back to figures such as G.W.

36,886,0.42,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"purposes, most measures are commonly based on self-reporting (or interviews) through questionnaires with scaled responses. Good questionnaires can gather information on knowledge, values, attitudes, opinions, behaviors, facts, and other information and have been increasingly used in ecology and conservation biology to assess stakeholder opinions and perceptions of and behaviors toward species or issues of conservation concern (White et al. 2005). Although many of us have designed and given questionnaires to or interviewed stakeholders, robust design that can evaluate the values and attitudes behind behaviors and provide an unbiased assessment of the behaviors themselves requires substantial preparation. Central is a solid theoretical understanding of social psychology and psychometrics and design considerations. For example, questionnaires need to quantify and maximize validity (does the questionnaire or âinstrumentâ measure what it intended to) and reliability (does the instrument consistently or accurately measure what it is intended to measure). The procedure for sampling the target population (e.g., random, systematic, comprehensive) needs to be considered as does nonresponse bias, to name but a few factors. Measuring behavior through self-reporting or interviews can be particularly tricky if the behavior is illegal or contravenes a social norm (socially disapproved or inappropriate). Respondents may not tell the truth or may skip the question, compromising data validity (King and Bruner 2000). This is key if the prevalence of particular behaviors (such as hunting bats) is the end point of the study and is even more pertinent if the study aims to assess whether attitudes are good predictors of behavior (e.g., St John et al. 2011). Recent applications of sensitive question tools from human health research (e.g., condom use in HIV research) to conservation ârule breakingâ provide much higher reporting of illegal activities than conventional approaches (St John et al. 2013; Nuno and St John 2015). If non-sensitive characteristics (attitudes or demographics) can predict sensitive behaviors, then the identification of the target audience for intervention is greatly facilitated (St John et al. 2013). Scientists are rarely trained in appropriate social science methodologies and indeed may come at human studies from a very different philosophical perspective that can influence our understanding and interpretation of social science data and conclusions (Moon and Blackman 2014). As emphasized in the introduction, we should be collaborating directly with social scientists (Mascia et al. 2003; Sandbrook et al. 2013; St John et al. 2014), but a good introduction to methods is given in Newing (2011)."
72,10,0.419,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"natural sciences, most of the big 20th-century theoretical breakthroughs in physics, chemistry and biology did not arise in a detached ivory tower but as responses to the practical problems of the real world, and much of the theoretical distinction between basic and applied research, which became institutionally embodied in the late 20th century, misread that history â a point eloquently made in Jon Agarâs recent book (2013). Yet to describe the study of social innovation as a craft knowledge is not to imply any less need for research rigour. There is still a need for falsifiable hypotheses â the more clear-cut, or surprising, the better. There is certainly a need for data â time series data on the growth or decay of social organisations, their contribution to GDP, their social make-up, their geography, and so on â and we should hope that over the next decade social innovation can begin to catch up with the rapid progress being made in the statistical study of other fields of innovation. Examples of this include the progress being made in measuring intangibles, the pioneering work on measuring the creative economy (Bakhshi et al., 2012) and the use of web-scraping and other tools to show economic phenomena before they have been captured by official statistics (Bakhshi and Mateos-Garcia, 2012). That sort of rigour is bound to take research away from the immediate concerns of practitioners, and so a balance needs to be struck. The Italian philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci (1979) famously commented that we should cultivate pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will; perhaps what we most need here is to combine enthusiasm of the spirit and scepticism of the intellect. Striking that balance is a challenge both for the field and for individuals. Many individuals researching social innovation are also practitioners and activists; they are advocates as well as scholars, immersed in the mission as well as the measurement and analysis. This is bound to create tensions. But again, it is not so different from other areas of social science â from late 19th-century sociology to late 20th-century rational choice economics, many of the most apparently detached intellectuals were also in truth advocates for new ways of seeing the world and new ways of acting on it. Joseph Schumpeter, for example, was the finance minister of Austria in 1919 (Backhaus, 2003)."

All these concepts attempt to show how social reality is structured by pre-existing ideas about a nationâs self-understanding, and how such ideas frame social interactions, institutional arrangements, policy outcomes and social movements (Bertossi and Duyvendak 2012)."
72,34,0.416,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Westley and Antadze (2010, p. 2) subsequently expanded upon this by noting that: Social innovation is a complex process of introducing new products, processes or programs that profoundly change the basic routines, resource and authority flows, or beliefs of the social system in which the innovation occurs. Such successful social innovations have durability and broad impact. Second, social innovation can be seen as the answer to social market failures in the provision of vital public goods. This is reflected in the OECDâs definition of social innovation, which also includes a reference to the process dimensions of social innovation (2011, p. 1): Social innovation is distinct from economic innovation because it is not about introducing new types of production or exploiting new markets in itself but is about satisfying new needs not provided by the market (even if markets intervene later) or creating new, more satisfactory ways of insertion in terms of giving people a place and a role in production. In addition to these two meta-definitions, three levels of social innovation can be identified (see Table I.1). First, there is incremental innovation in goods and services to address social need more effectively or efficiently. This is the objective of many successful charities and notfor-profits, as well as some so-called âBottom of the Pyramidâ (Prahalad, 2006) commercial firms. From this perspective, social innovation may simply be a good business opportunity. Second, there is institutional innovation that aims to harness or retool existing social and economic structures to generate new social value and outcomes. Examples such as Fair Trade (Nicholls and Opal, 2005) or mobile banking typically exploit or modify existing market structures to deliver new or additional social value. Finally, disruptive social innovation aims at systems change. This is typically the realm of social movements and self-consciously âpoliticalâ actors, groups and networks aiming to change power relations, alter social hierarchies and reframe issues to the benefit of otherwise disenfranchised groups. Disruptive social innovation can be characterised by structured mass participation in political parties or formal membership schemes of social movements, on the one hand, or loose coalitions of individuals and interests united by an evanescent issue or technology such as social media, on the other. Policy entrepreneurs from within"
72,35,0.416,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"state structures can also drive disruptive social innovation by focussing on reforming democracy and enlarging or deepening citizensâ roles within it. Social innovation can also be defined in terms of the level of its action or impact from the individual to the systems level (micro-, meso- or macrolevel). Such levels or dimensions can be mapped against the two main definitions of social innovation focused either on new social processes or on new social outcomes (see Table I.2). These differing levels of impact point to the complexity of performance measurement on social innovation and emphasise the need for clarity about the unit of impact of a social innovation. Social innovation can also be considered in the context of the more institutionalised fields of social entrepreneurship (Dees, 1998; Nicholls, 2006) and social enterprise (Alter, 2006; Nyssens, 2006). In this setting, social innovation can be seen as the biggest field of"

A weak tie is ânot merely a trivial acquaintance tie but rather a crucial bridge between the two densely knit clumps of close friendsâ (Granovetter 1983, 202). Granovetter shows that weak ties are indeed quite âstrongâ with regard to their networking power: Weak ties play a crucial role in connecting a person to wider social circles. Strong ties tend to exist among similar people, whereas weak ties are links to different kinds of people. According to Putnam (2001, 22), relationships based on similarity and strong ties are bonding; they âtend to reinforce exclusive identities and homogenous groupsâ. Relationships including weak or loose ties are âbridgingâ, since they connect unlike persons to others and âencompass people across diverse social cleavagesâ (Svendsen and Patulny 2007, 22). Secondly, we argue that case-specific protests are not a homogeneous category. Differences in the profile of the actors involved and the strategies used may occur. Some case-specific protests show similarities with what several authors define as social movements, âcollective challenges to elites, authorities, other groups or cultural codes by people with common purposes and solidarity in sustained interactions with elites, opponents and authoritiesâ (Tarrow 1994, 2). Social movements distinguish themselves, among others, by the fact that they try to âpromote or resist change in the group, society, or world order of which it is partâ (McAdam and Snow 2010, 1). Even though the kind and degree of change sought may vary radically, social movements always ârefer to the fundaments of societyâ (Rucht 2002, 4; our translation). Analyzing social movements in a broader historical context, Rucht notices that large social movements seeking an alternative model of society, as they existed in the twentieth century, have largely vanished. Contemporary movements do not challenge the foundations of institutions and procedures, but challenge shortcomings in their embodiment with regard to widely accepted basic principles (ibid.). Today, protest activities tend to focus on specific issues, operate on a smaller scale, express more concrete claims, and struggle for less ambitious aims (see also Ion 2011)."

77,21,0.411,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Investigation of the life course is a progressive research programme that raises new encompassing questions which require the development of new methods, such as large-scale social surveys that include the collection of biomedical data (Blane et al. 2013). However such projects raise ethical issues and public concerns that can impede their developments, as illustrated by the failure of the Swiss Etiological Study of Adjustment and Mental Health (SESAM) (Kummer 2011). Next to challenges associated with work in interdisciplinary teams that bring together social and biological scientists, statistical expertise is required to analyse longitudinal data, adding another layer of complexity. Important questions arise around the empirical analysis of the theoretical models. In this volume, Bell and Jones underline the perils of modelling age, period and cohort effects and propose a theory driven approach to conceptualise these effects. In a chapter combining a methodological discussion and empirical results, Hoekstra and Twisk compare the contributions of latent class growth models and mixed models to the analysis of health trajectories. Ghisletta et al. also examine the advantages and limitations of different statistical models, namely linear mixed-effects models and structural equation models. While life course epidemiology remains centred on the analysis of quantitative data, we consider that qualitative data are also needed to improve our understanding of health trajectories. Meanings associated with transitions and social hierarchies, expectations of successive cohorts of elderly people ageing in better health conditions are important elements in the complex experience of health. As initiated with work on lay views on health inequalities (Davidson et al. 2006; Popay et al. 1998), data from in-depth individual or collective interviews can inform on mechanisms that relate social and physiological aspects of individual life courses. Qualitative data collected with people suffering from specific conditions are needed to understand their trajectories and their interpretations of biological and social vulnerability."
72,147,0.41,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"often coming from the community sector of the welfare diamond may seek to shape either â and sometimes both â the supply and demand structures of labour markets, increasingly with the support of public authorities. On the supply side, and usually as part of an agenda around social inclusion, social enterprises can work to enable young people, women, immigrants and the long-term unemployed to enter the labour market. Such efforts rely on a variety of legal forms and can be seen as ânew expressions of organized civil societyâ (Vidal, 2005, p. 807). These enterprises can be an instrument for the achievement of the âactivationâ commitment of European social and economic policy (Evers and Guillemard, 2012, Chapter 7). On the demand side, social enterprises â and the social economy more generally â are often tasked with filling gaps in services that do not attract investment by traditional private-sector firms. These new service providers meet growing societal needs and, in the process, create employment. In this context, social innovation can address existing gaps in the market corner of the welfare diamond and, particularly, its failure adequately to provide work, income and inclusion as well as products and services. In these ways, social innovation can also invoke other quasi-concepts, such as social inclusion or social cohesion. Some examples serve to illustrate various perspectives on social and labour market policy. The OECD has long been concerned with promoting higher employment rates but has also increasingly become cognisant of market imperfections (Mahon and McBride, 2008). It has been actively constructing an analysis of how to address social challenges around employment by relying on social innovation (Noya, 2011). Since its 2005 edition, the OECDâs Oslo Manual has recognised a social dimension to innovation. While its Innovation Strategy still primarily focuses on standard approaches and measures of innovation, social innovation has received some attention when âglobal and social challengesâ are raised, while social enterprises have been discussed as an instrument of response to such challenges (OECD, 2010a: 182ff; 2010b: Chapter 5). Deployment of the quasi-concept is, in other words, an alternative way of doing entrepreneurship, management and finance. This can be interpreted as a call for greater interaction across the market and community corners of the welfare diamond â perhaps including a blurring of boundary distinctions. This turn to social innovation is evident in the OECDâs efforts to foster development of labour markets and its analysis of the failure of these markets to provide sufficient well-being for all. An analysis of policy documents and initiatives shows that, while there is a range of ideas about social innovation, one strategy in which the OECD has invested"
72,72,0.409,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"certain observations were available; but it is not an inherent part of the theory (Ogburn, 1969, p. 139).5 Yet, these aspects of Ogburnâs theory â that could have formed the basis for a comprehensive theory of innovation â remained largely ignored in a wider theoretical context in which there was a one-sided focus on the relevance of technology for social change (Freeman, 1974; OECD, 1997). Only in recent years has a new understanding of the innovation process become more important, in which openness towards society is central (FORA, 2010, p. 15 ff.). Individual aspects of this development are reflected in terms and concepts such as âopen innovationâ, âcustomer and user integrationâ, â(innovation) networksâ, âmulti-stakeholder dialoguesâ and âthe new power of the citizenryâ (Marg et al., 2013). The development of ârobust design conceptsâ (Gross et al., 2005) and institutions that combine research and innovation with âpost-conventional forms of participationâ (Marg et al., 2013, p. 8) are explicitly the subject matter of, for example, transition management, transdisciplinary sustainability research, governance research and, particularly, network research (for example, Powell and Grodal, 2005). Thus, at the same time, social innovation has started to be seen as a type of innovation that is distinguishable from technological innovation with its own subject area, sphere of influence and field of application (Howaldt and Schwarz, 2010). However, it is not possible to define social innovations solely by referring to a distinct social sphere or to socially desirable outcomes as their key purpose (Rammert, 2010, p. 40). Rather, what is at issue is the substantive core of the innovation. With social innovations, the new does not manifest itself in the medium of technological artefacts, but at the level of social practices. If it is accepted that the invention and diffusion of the steam engine, the computer or the smartphone should be regarded differently from the invention and social spread of a national system of healthcare provision, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or a system of micro lending, then it stands to reason that there is an intrinsic difference between technological and social innovations. While it is true that all innovations, regardless of their object, can be viewed as a social phenomenon, this does not obviate the need empirically to research the commonalities and differences between these two types of innovation. Even if, in reality, both types closely connect with each other in socio-technological systems, the need for analytical distinction does not disappear. This is all the more urgent given that existing sociological innovation research, that has emanated"

72,58,0.408,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Third, there are challenges in scaling up social innovation. The stated objective of much social innovation is to bring about systemic change. However, genuine systems change is a very ambitious objective and typically requires a combination of scale, geographical spread and political support. Bloom and Chatterji (2009) acknowledged these factors when they established the SCALERS model as a guide to key activities needed to achieve scale in social innovation, notably in terms of staffing, communicating, alliance building, lobbying, earnings generation, replicating and stimulating market forces. Elsewhere research has focused on the institutional, rather than organisational, aspects of achieving scale, particularly in terms of building social innovation âecosystemsâ (Bloom and Dees, 2008). However, there is relatively little evidence as yet of social innovation delivering systems change without government support â which begs important questions about the publicâprivate dimensions of scaling social innovation. Fourth, social innovation is often limited by access to market â or even discretionary â commercial finance at the start-up and growth phase (Nicholls, 2010b). There are several reasons for this. First, as was noted above, social innovation often occupies hybrid institutional spaces that span the logics of the state and the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. This creates difficulties in terms of assessing risk and return within conventional financial modelling. Furthermore, given its explicit social focus, social innovation âventuresâ may not aim at maximising their financial bottom line, focusing instead on creating âblended valueâ (Emerson, 2003) that combines social and financial performance. A third challenge is investor exit â there is currently no fully functioning secondary market in which social innovation investments can be realised. The emergence of an impact investing market (OâDonohoe et al., 2010) over recent years may partly address this capital gap â but it seems likely that, going forward, public and philanthropic finance will remain important to develop and grow social innovation. Fifth, there are, as yet, no agreed measurement mechanisms or standard units of analysis for social innovation impact and performance. Welfare economics and the large range of bespoke social impact measurement approaches developed within the not-for-profit or social entrepreneurship sectors offer a set of models that can be used in different contexts, but no dominant standard has emerged (Mulgan, 2010; Ebrahim and Rangan, 2010). As a consequence, exploring the comparative performance of social innovation remains a challenge. This has profound implications for access to capital and policy making."
72,294,0.407,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Introduction India has seen a recent and rapid emergence of social enterprise as a potential alternative development channel. Social enterprises, defined in this chapter as organisations that combine a focus on financial sustainability with an explicit commitment to social impact through their products and/or employment and sourcing strategies, offer new and innovative ways of providing goods, services and livelihood opportunities for the poor. In other words, social enterprise is a hybrid â operating with the social impact objectives of an NGO and the market-driven financial aims of a for-profit firm. Social enterprise, therefore, involves the reconfiguring of social relations between the private sector market and civil society (Allen et al., 2012; Koh et al., 2012). Innovation is central in social enterprises in emerging markets because many are creating new products and services, as well as accessing and, at times, creating new markets and value chains (Koh et al., 2014; Rajan, 2013). However, to innovate and grow their social enterprises, entrepreneurs need to interact with other actors, including fellow entrepreneurs, suppliers, wholesalers, investors and incubators. They do so to access new information and knowledge, new sources of finance, new business connections along the value chain and new markets and customers. Social enterprises in and around Indiaâs major cities (including Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi) can increasingly rely on a range of support organisations to help them grow and flourish, including investors, incubators and networking platforms, as highlighted in a number of recent reports (Saltuk et al., 2011; Allen et al., 2012). However, accessing such financial and non-financial support can be difficult, especially outside of the large cities, as there are few formal mechanisms to connect"

56,316,0.407,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"however, they do not return definitively. These reference groups âfamily, local community, nation â represent various sites and scales in the literature on home. To conclude, I would like to explore what a Luhmannian concept of home could be. As I have sought to stress throughout, I was often struck by the fact that hostel residents felt compelled to justify their presence in France on the basis of healthcare needs and administrative requirements, revealing the influence of medical and bureaucratic organisations on the menâs lives. This gave me pause for reflection: could inclusion in the organisations regulating access to different social systems also constitute a type of home for the men in the hostels, valued for âinstrumentalâ reasons insofar as it procures healthcare and a minimum standard of living?2 If one takes a Luhmannian view, the answer is yes. What it means to be âincludedâ and to be âat homeâ no longer necessarily implies only an emotional attachment to a territory (place) or social group (household, ethnic group, nation), as home has conventionally been conceptualised (Porteous 1976; Rapport and Overing 2007). Luhmannâs theory of social systems challenges the assumption that society is formed primarily of groups of individuals distributed across distinct, demarcated territories. This has been the dominant conception of society across history, encompassing kin groups, tribes, ethnic groups, and in the modern era, nation-states. Instead, Luhmann proposed an alternative model of society based on individualsâ acts of communication in distinct social realms differentiated by their function, such as politics, law, the economy, religion, science, and so on (Luhmann 1995). In premodern societies, social inclusion and life chances were determined by social strata and rank. But in the social systems which make up functionally differentiated society, social inclusion operates according to the codes and logics of each autonomous system. These criteria are fundamentally more inclusive than in pre-modern times: discrimination on the basis of inherited or ascribed characteristics such as ethnicity or class is no longer relevant. In principle, social systems tend to openness and inclusion: what matters is whether the ârules of accessâ specific to each system are met or not (Luhmann 1990: 35). For example, whether a job applicant has the required qualification profile, whether a patient has symptoms needing urgent medical treatment, whether a political candidate meets the constitutionally-defined conditions for holding public office. Functionally differentiated systems are âindifferentâ (Luhmann 1990: 30) to all attributes other than whatever the relevant expectations happen to be. Nonetheless, in practice, it is organisations in society (such as courts, hospitals, firms, schools, and so on) which regulate inclusion in social systems, and individuals may in fact be exposed to considerable risks of exclusion (e.g. unemployment). The role of organisations in functionally differentiated society has been most astutely analysed by Michael Bommes, who led the way in applying a systems theoretic approach to migration questions (Boswell and DâAmato 2012). Bommes argues that organisations in functionally differentiated society develop expectations about the typical person profile capable of being included as an organisational mem2"
269,154,0.405,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"The familiar register of exhortations to interdisciplinarity â mutuality! reciprocity! exchange! â is one that assumes that differentials of power do not exist. And yet, for many people from the humanities and social sciences â and we are thinking quite beyond our own collaborations here â experiencing oneâs role in a collaboration with life scientists as a relatively powerless one undercuts these kinds of exhortations. Go to the bar at any science and technology studies conference, and it wonât take too many drinks before social scientists start telling you about how their research is often understood as âpublic engagementâ; how they consistently have to justify their expertise to their collaborators; how they have to translate (or sometimes give up on) their conceptual language in a way that is not always reciprocated, and so on. This doesnât mean that life scientists in collaborations are especially power-hungry; or that they behave badly (no doubt most would be surprised and taken aback to learn that their collaborators would narrate their experience in such ways). But it is to say that when a group of people collaborate within institutional structures that end up placing the more highly valued epistemological frameworks, as well as financial resources, largely on one side, then asymmetries result. Even among â and perhaps especially among â the most well-meaning people, such asymmetries can produce some unlovely relations. It is important to note that such relations are rarely, if ever, explicitly endorsed by collaborating life scientists, and life scientists themselves often do not gain from them. Indeed, to the extent that interdisciplinary asymmetries of power can produce silences and absences, there is a significant risk that they reduce the space for the complex collaborative entanglements that motivate many scientific collaborators in the first place. Perhaps more importantly, and this is perhaps not always so visible to collaborators, even if natural scientists in particular collaborations may appear to hold all the power, those scientists themselves are subject to precisely the same asymmetries, when they reenter a larger prestige economy that might mark their collaborations with social scientists or humanities scholars as decidedly low-value contributions. And this is to say nothing of the way that natural scientists may experience a more subtle asymmetry, as they get pinioned by the philosopherâs or literary theoristâs rhetorical monopoly on, and their own explicit exclusion from, what it means to think âcriticallyâ. (Indeed, we have lost track of the number of times we"

The GoNERI program included various tasks for the purpose of developing an advanced nuclear engineering curriculum. Among them, the task of âintegrationâ was given the highest priority. An official statement of the GoNERI program framed this attempt as âthe first systematic education on nuclear energy in the world â¦ incorporating the social, liberal arts and technical subjects as they relate to nuclear utilization.â [3] The UTNEM professors were aware that the faculty and students of UTNEM in many cases did not yet have sufficient command of the fundamentals of the social sciences (their domain, concepts, terminology, methodology, etc.), and that this separated them from social scientific activities even at the time when GoNERI started in 2007 and limited them in collaborating with social scientists and citizens. Consequently, three researchers with different social scientific backgrounds (history of science, risk communication studies, and sociology"
347,279,0.404,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Science-based advice is universally regarded and used as a primary trustworthy basis for environmental management and decision-making. However, at the same time, in many areas, there is an ambiguity and increasing concern about the sole dependence on expertise from the (natural) sciences, which often acts to the detriment of sufficient consideration of other knowledge claims, stakeholder perspectives and values held by actors such as NGOs, citizens or business people. Bijker et al. (2009: 1) have called this phenomenon the paradox of scientific authority and asked the question of âhow can scientific advice be effective and influential in an age in which the status of science and/or scientists seems to be as low as it has ever been?â One reason for this paradox lies in the fact that science becomes politicised whenever it is called into a political context (Weingart 1999) and is hence subject to constraints, i.e. rules, norms and evaluation criteria, other than those set by the scientific community. A basic challenge is that the demarcation that exists between the spheres of science and politics falls apart in such contexts, which consequently leads to concerns and potential conflicts about the legitimate role of science and its relation to policy. Both the role of science-based advice and the political decisions based on it may therefore become contested with respect to credibility, legitimacy and accountability (cf. Cash et al. 2003). In management practice, a distinction is often made between a science system (representing factual knowledge claims) and a social system (representing political, business and other concerns of public life) â a division that is inscribed in the institutional design of most policy systems in modern societies. Science is responsible for providing the best available knowledge in terms of a presumed value-free and objective input to political decision-making, which is accordingly seen as most rational and democratically legitimated (Funtowicz and Strand 2007; Wilson 2009). This idealised model of interaction between science and policy relies on what has been called the âideal causal chainâ of implementing scientific knowledge in policy processes (Fig. 8.1; Gezelius 2008). The ecosystem approach to management (EAM) is seen as a necessary and idealistic approach for managing marine resources and other environmental issues with regard to all five areas of environment and risks analysed here (Backer et al. 2010; Garcia et al. 2003; Hammer 2015). As a consequence, assessment and management"
72,328,0.404,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion This chapter set out to improve the understanding of how innovative social enterprises use networks. In spite of coming from very different backgrounds, all the social entrepreneurs found that their networks changed substantially over time. In the beginning they generally relied more heavily on family and friends, while later they had more professional contacts on board, whether as mentors, investors and/or Board members. It was striking how important the social entrepreneurs found the connection to other social entrepreneurs as a source of day-to-day support and best practice advice. The impact of individual networks went beyond the individual social entrepreneurs to affect the wider social enterprise ecosystem by multiplying through network platforms and creating large networks of actors within the social enterprise ecosystem, such as the Jagriti Yatra network or the Dasra cohort network. The case studies highlighted that entrepreneurs starting from very different backgrounds can gain access to support that enables them to become financially sustainable social enterprises. Nevertheless, the case studies also showed that it can be difficult to access support for those not based in one of Indiaâs major cities, where the social enterprise support ecosystem is concentrated. Further, there is a bias towards the use of English among the organisations providing financial and non-financial support for social entrepreneurs (such as incubators and impact investors). Increasingly, programmes and application forms are"
284,14,0.403,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Environmental governance as a ï¬eld of inquiry Environmental governance offers an analytical perspective that combines socioenvironmental research with development-oriented governance research (Lemos and Agrawal, 2006). Socioenvironmental research addresses the interplay between environmental and social change. In this context, as in this introductory chapter, the social dimension is broadly deï¬ned, also encompassing cultural, economic, political and institutional relations. Governance research addresses the way in which society organizes itself in order to solve its dilemmas and create new opportunities. Until the 1980s, social scientists working in Latin American countries focused on concepts of governability as the region faced unstable political conditions and structural challenges such as inequality, violence, corruption and limited citizenship. However, the growing emphasis on formal institutions and market-driven mechanisms of neoliberal governance quickly attracted the attention of social scientists to a perspective of governance as a social process that inï¬uences the level of governability (Kooiman, 2003). This perspective criticized the normative perspective of âgood governanceâ introduced by the World Bank in the seminal report Governance and Development (1992). According to this document, the solution to overcome underdevelopment should be self-governance. The World Bank proposed a roadmap to achieve so-called good governance based on three pillars: a âsmall stateâ through deregulation; âmarket incentivesâ though privatization and liberalization; and âparticipationâ through decentralization and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Subsequent World Bank reports further elaborated this international agenda, stressing in a rather technocratic approach, the need for effective state institutions to achieve development in a global context of liberalized markets (Demmers, FernÃ¡ndez Jilberto and Hogenboom, 2004). Alternatively, social science scholars use (environmental) governance to emphasize social relations and, in particular, the tension between conservation and development goals in order to understand the interplay among social, institutional and environmental change. The environmental governance research builds on a range of theoretical schools, including new institutionalism (Ostrom, 1990; Young, 1999; Biermann and Pattberg, 2008), sociopolitical studies (Kooiman et al., 2005; Lemos and Agrawal, 2006) and sociocultural approaches (Cleaver, 2002; Alimonda and GandÃ¡segui, 2006; Castro, 2008; Gudynas, 2011). Despite their different theoretical and methodological stands (see Castro, 2013), they all address social behaviour towards natural"
271,589,0.403,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"The 12 empirical chapters demonstrate through their extremely varied choice of social domains and communicative figurations how the concept of communicative figurations can be applied as a heuristic framework for producing insights about the ways in which âour social domains are moulded by mediaâ (Hepp and Hasebrink, Chap. 2), or ratherâif we adhere to a strict practice theoretical perspectiveâhow these social domains are moulded by the practices in which social actors are using media to achieve their mundane, professional and political ends: âThe concept of figurations links a micro-analysis of individual practices with a meso-analysis of certain social domains and thus offers us various possibilities to contextualize this with macro questions about societyâ (Hepp and Hasebrink, Chap. 2). The study in Chap. 13 by Andreas Breiter and Arne Hendrik Ruhe is a case in point: Applying the core concepts of figurational theory, their chapter shows how the figurational framework can be used to rigorously map the mediated managerial governance structures of German and English schools. The analysis focuses on the meso (organizational) level, its media ensemble and the role of management information systems, but in order to do so analyzes the media repertoires of individual teachers and administrators,1 and also anchors the communicative practices discovered in the macro national educational governance systems in the two countries: âThe schoolâs media ensemble is a moulding force for changes in communicative practices within the actor constellation of schools, among staff, students and administrators as well as in contact with parentsâ (Breiter and Ruhe, Chap. 13)."
99,11,0.402,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"1.1 The Promise and Challenge of Social Innovations The effort to strengthen social cohesion and lower social inequalities is among Europeâs main policy challenges. At the urban level, these great challenges become visible and tangible, which in many senses makes cities a microcosm of society. It means that local welfare systems are at the forefront of the struggle to address this challengeâand they are far from winning. While the statistics show some positive signs, the overall picture still shows sharp and sometimes rising inequalities, a loss of social cohesion and failing policies of integration and inclusion. When we focus on specific groups in society (e.g. migrants), the situation is even more dire. It is clear that new ideas and approaches to tackle these very wicked problems are needed. Contrary to what is sometimes thought, a lack of bottom-up innovation is not the issue in itself. European cities are teeming with new ideas, initiated by citizens, professionals and policymakers. There are by now many examples of innovation, paraded by think tanks and policymakers as tomorrowâs answers. This is certainly promising. Yet this altogether too rosy picture obscures some of the drawbacks,"
99,15,0.402,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"ic method, but simultaneously characterised by an indeterminate quality that makes it adaptable to a variety of situations and flexible enough to follow the twists and turns of policy, that everyday politics sometimes make necessaryâ (European Commission 2013, p. 16). Indeed, it has achieved the status of a buzzword in national and European policy circles. US President Obama established no less than two offices for social innovation. The EU has used the term to fund several initiatives, including the research project upon which this book is based. It is then little wonder that the meaning has diluted, sometimes referring to anything that is considered new and that is not technical. Although as an academic concept, it is less wide-ranging, there still remains a broad range of interpretations. Some posit simply that it must constitute a new approach to a particular kind of problem. The Stanford Centre for Social Innovation, for example, describes it as âthe process of inventing, securing support for, and implementing novel solutions to social needs and problemsâ (Phillis et al. 2008, p. 34). This is a conveniently flexible interpretation, yet one could argue that, according to this definition, there is little that does not qualify as a social innovation. Other scholars are more specific in circumscribing the nature of innovation. For example, the SOCIAL POLIS project defined it as âthe satisfaction of alienated human needs through the transformation of social relations: transformations which âimproveâ the governance systems that guide and regulate the allocation of goods and services meant to satisfy those needs, and which establish new governance structures and organizations (discussion forums, political decision-making systems, etc.)â (Moulaert 2010, 2013). This implies not only that an innovation must be radical (transformative), but also that it changes the power structure within the system where it is introduced. The problem with this kind of definition is less with its normative character, but with its essentialist nature. It is true that innovations are about new ideas and purposes deriving from established paths and patterns getting practical; however, it must be likewise considered that they are about processes and ways of development under conditions and in contexts where interaction is not determined and foreseeable ex ante. Innovatory effects of a new product, strategy or service can be path breaking to different degrees. Thinking this way it becomes clear that what is needed is a concept of social innovation as a complex societal process, rather than a mere classificatory definition of an action or product. For the purposes of the WILCO project, we defined social innovation as both products and processes; ideas translated into practical approaches; new in the context where they appear. It was important for us to use such a definition, rather than a more specific one, because one cannot clearly predict what comes out of even a very promising innovation in the course of its development. The problem with defining social innovation resides less in âinnovationâ and much more in the meaning one attributes to âsocialâ. Studying the current literature on conceptualising and defining social innovations, one finds that âsocialâ is mainly equated with âimprovementâ (Phillis 2008), finding better answers to basic needs and more satisfying social relations (Moulaert 2010), and a range of other âgood thingsâ. One way of challenging such an interpretation of âsocialâ has been proposed by Johnson in his essay asking âWhere good ideas come fromâ (2010). He argues that there are four different environments that create new ideas, processes and things:"

The proposal concerning awareness of the limits of scientific and technical abilities was formed through interdisciplinary discussions among the experts. Some readers of the SCJ report seem to have felt uneasiness with this proposal because this proposal apparently cast a scientific doubt on the feasibility of the geological disposal of HLW. To the authorâs understanding, this proposal is a rather general statement that there is no perfect scientific evidence to support the safety of HLW disposal for more than 10,000 years. Having heard the discussions related to this proposal, the author recognized there are many different academic approaches depending on the field of science. For example, natural scientists seek truths in natural phenomena, whereas engineers try to make things and/or systems that are valuable and acceptable for human society. HLW issues are related not only to various fields of science, but also to value systems shared by society. Here again, the author was convinced that we need to reflect more deeply on the relationship between science and society."

What social structural factors relate to unique patterns in youth mobile phone usage in low-income areas faced with severe social challenges? We suggest that certain social dynamics inherent in the institutions of family, public places and peer relations are key factors.

242,279,0.401,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Informed by, but critical of, the Marxist intellectual tradition which limits the concept of social reproduction to the renewal of social relations and material bases of the society and economy, feminist theorizations try to bridge the conceptual and theoretical separation between the production of things and the creation and maintenance of human lives (Katz 2011). Social reproduction in feminist terms encapsulates many layers of power relations that are historically shaped: sexuality and biological reproduction; reproduction of labour power inclusive of an intergenerational process of care provision; reproduction of social relations and institutions, of which the family and its relationship with the state is one of the most significant (Whitehead 2002). Social reproduction simultaneously is a material and a discursive system through which a society recreates itself biologically, emotionally, culturally, institutionally, and economically. As Kabeer (2004: 10) points out, this process involves an array of institutional structures and activities that embody gendered values and knowledge, therefore regimes of social reproduction are essentially gendered regimes, particularly as regards the significance attached to reproductive activities and the recognition given to those who carry them out. It is here that the concept of âreproductive bargainâ introduced by Pearson (1997) is particularly valuable. The concept originally referred to the division of responsibility for different aspects of daily, generational, and social reproduction between the state, the household, and individuals in terms of resources that are collectively provided, and those that are accessed through wages and other money incomes. By studying the changing institutional arrangements in Cuba, which underwent a rapid transition in the 1990s, Pearson demonstrates how households adapt and devise new strategies to sustain and reproduce themselves, strategies that are patterned by an existing gender division of labour, and in some aspects, reinforced traditional gender roles. Building on this insight, Gottfried (2009: 77) proposes a more general model to analyse an ensemble"
278,366,0.401,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"The social and solidarity economy finds its roots in the social economy, which emerged in the early period of Western industrialization, in the nineteenth century, when poverty in urban centres was a central concern. The Welsh social reformer Robert Owen founded the cooperative movement at this time, and cooperatives and associations became âthe first line of defenceâ in rallying to address social ails (Lewis 1997 in Laville 2011). The social economy was relegated to the status of a âthird sectorâ in the post-war period, when the market economy was seen as responsible for regulating property and currencies, and where the welfare state was considered the primary vector for social action through the redistribution of wealth (Laville 1994). The social economy cast in this role of a âthird sectorâ represented all other forms of organization, including non-profit and non-governmental activities. Neoliberal policies, recurring financial crises, as well as the failure of the welfare state to address social issues, all contributed to a rebirth of the social economy in the 1990s. As inequalities widened and environmental issues expanded to a local and global scale, the âsustainable developmentâ paradigm was brought into question in what has been called a âcrisis of valuesâ, leading to a renewed interest in the social economy (Laville and Cattani 2006). Almost 10 years after the first Earth Summit, the participants at the first World Social Forum in 2001 (Porto Alegre, Brazil) rallied around the phrase âAnother world is possibleâ; the social economy was seen as playing a prominent role in this new world order. For some, the notion of the âsocial economyâ was insufficient, as this term was too closely associated with the third sector at that time. Arguments were put forward to challenge a definition of the social economy solely based on the type of entity or legal status.2 From this effort, the term âcivil and solidarity economyâ was coined to account for numerous other initiatives that had emerged, particularly in Europe, that were neither non-for-profit nor non-governmental (Laville 2011). Private enterprises, for example, can be built on social values and have their place in what came to be known as the âsocial and solidarity economyâ (SSE), primarily in French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguesespeaking countries, in Europe and in the Americas. As Fraisse (2003) rightly notes, the SSE is being interpreted in different ways around the world. In the United States, members of the SSE aim towards the sys2"

As Scholten (2011: 42) notes âthe social construction of problems is considered inherently related to the institutional setting within which framing takes placeâ. Of particular relevance is that the EU is not responsible for migrant integration and does not possess or promote a particular migrant integration framework or paradigm.

First, knowledge exchange on migrant integration and, second, the stimulation of applied scientific research on issues associated with integration. It is important to"
278,427,0.397,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"This motivation to improve human development standards comes with significant challenges specific to developing countries, due to limited data availability. The IE community can provide significant assistance to developing countries by simplifying and downsizing data requirements to a point which yields sufficiently accurate results to inform policy. It would indeed be counterproductive if developing countries were to wait for economic growth to fuel complex data gathering operations that can in turn inform their sustainable development policies. Some of the relatively simple metrics developed in IE that can be used to inform specific policies are ratios of different materials to measure resource efficiency. These ratios along with the caveats that need to be kept in mind while incorporating them into policies are in Table 11.2. In addition, IE research has developed frameworks and models that capture the complexity of real systems by integrating several IE-based tools, for example the social-ecological-infrastructural systems (SEIS) framework and LCA analysis in EIPs (Ramaswami et al. 2012; Eckelman and Chertow 2013). An example of the socio-economic metabolism approach is advocated in Chap. 6. The SEIS framework is currently being used to assess environmental impacts of emerging cities in USA, China and India (Ramaswami et al. 2015). A similar framework is the Integrative Regional Action Planning (IRAP) framework that integrates planning across undeveloped land, rural and urban regions (Jaderi et al. 2014; Van ZeijlRozema and Martens 2011; Huynen et al. 2004; Lowe 2006). Such integrative frameworks call for cooperation between various stakeholders and institutions for a comprehensive understanding of regions, their impacts and solutions. These inte-"
341,301,0.395,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"IWRM is considered to be a central concept in contemporary water governance (White 1998; Lubell and Edelenbos 2013). The key feature of IWRM is âintegrationâ, which is a normative goal that can refer to the integration of fragmented responsibilities for water governance (functions), institutional fragmentation (e.g. Wallis and Ison 2011b) and societal fragmentation (Lubell and Edelenbos 2013). The latter, societal fragmentation, is characterised by a disconnect between those making decisions and those affected by them. IWRM promotes stakeholder participation through some platform or institutional arrangement that promotes inclusion. However, as Warner (2006) found in an assessment of multi-stakeholder platforms in managing catchments, a realistic assessment of their purpose and capacity to achieve this ought to be considered before initiation. A finding from SLIM research (Ison et al. 2007), in which 14 empirical case studies of water governance platforms were undertaken, was that the existence of a multi-stakeholder platform, i.e. of multi-stakeholder institutions, did not guarantee effective performances that could be said to constitute social learning. How is IWRM suited to governing the relational dynamics between people and their biophysical environments? One enduring challenge that Molle (2009) highlighted is managing interconnected and nested biophysical landscapes with disconnected administrative and social systems. Inclusiveness in IWRM could help âconnectâ social systems, achieving a greater variety of participants particularly through inclusion of people with local-scale interests. Institutional barriers, such as the centralisation of policy and lack of support for local capacity to implement IWRM (Medema et al. 2008), are both impediments to and arguments for greater inclusiveness. Despite the duration of IWRM as a governance framing choice (White 1998), what has not become clear is a praxis (or praxeology) of IWRM including the institutional forms needed to support this praxis. In this framing, the perennial issue is how to address the question: what do actors need to experience to claim that integration has occurred? In our experience, this question is rarely addressed well, in situations where integration is sought or claimed."
347,280,0.393,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"practices need to adapt to new ways of giving, using and implementing various sorts of advice. This shift towards EAM is furthermore in line with the EUâs general principles of âgood governanceâ (COM 2001: 10) applied in various marine policies such as the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), aiming for a âbroad involvement of stakeholders at all stages of the policy from conception to implementationâ (EC 2002: 6). Our study analyses the problems and challenges faced when a traditional conceptualisation of science-policy interfaces, such as the âideal causal chainâ model, is applied to different cases of environmental governance in the Baltic Sea and suggests ways in which associated problems and challenges might be countered. Applying the EAM concept, with its aspirations to achieve sustainable use of ecosystems in line with place-based requirements and sensitivities of the socioecological system (cf. BostrÃ¶m et al. 2016), opens new opportunities for a more holistic approach to understand and design science-policy interfaces by taking both the natural system (represented via science) and the social system (sociopolitical aspects) into account (cf. Gilek et al. 2015). The widening perspective of EAM could hence contribute to avoiding some of the traditional pitfalls of narrowly assigned science-based management systems. One of these pitfalls is the strongly sector-based marine environmental governance of the Baltic Sea that is studied here. Furthermore, all our case studies present strongly politicised domains of environmental governance (albeit with case-specific differences), where the boundaries between science and policy are continuously blurred and often debated. This implies that political and cultural values heavily influence scientific processes while science on the other hand strongly influences policy developments. This phenomenon is described as the âco-production of science and policyâ (Jasanoff 2004; Jasanoff and Wynne 1998) and highlights key questions about the roles and responsibilities of different actors such as scientists (and the science system) and other relevant stakeholders and policymakers in the interplay between assessment and management. In this âco-producedâ context, new and developed institutional structures and processes of interaction could act as âboundary organisationsâ between science and policy that make environmental problems governable. As Lidskog (2014:3) states: âBy negotiating and renegotiating the boundaries between science and policy, environmental problems and their possible solutions are co-produced. Both science and policy are mobilised in order to solve a specific environmental problemâ."

Many call for social innovators to address new social risks by expanding markets as well as by shifting relationships among markets, the community and state.6 This blurring of boundaries can happen in two ways. In some cases, while states and other public authorities continue to finance interventions to address risk, they are much less willing to design policy that involves them directly in delivery.

164,126,0.392,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","social and cultural cohesion and adaptive abilities have been lost, preventing the rebuilding of society (Volkan 2000). In the case of ârigidity traps,â decision circuits are highly interconnected, reinforcing themselves and making the system inflexible (Gunderson and Holling 2002). A good example is an old forest where larger, wellestablished trees inhibit the growth of saplings, impeding the renewal of the forest as a whole and increasing vulnerability to disturbances such as wildfire (Carpenter and Brock 2008). A corresponding social example would be the case of authoritarian governments where vertical decision-making structures impede innovation and adaptation, that tend to collapse when the overall settings such as democratic values become gradually hegemonic. Preventing the marginalization of a human community by increasing its resilience and adaptive capacity cannot be achieved by concentrating on a single component without considering other interlinked components of the SES. Contrarily it must fulfill various complementary and successive goals (e.g., guaranteeing food security, creating income generating opportunities, and maintaining ecosystem services)â goals which aim at improving the conditions for living systems, either social or ecological. In consequence any intervention to prevent and eventually reduce marginality should consider the functionality of the components of the SES and the involved processes. Moreover these efforts need to acknowledge the complexity of SES and therefore adopt systemic principles that allow the identification and characterization of the components, and consideration of the context, boundaries, connectedness, feedback, inflows and outflows as proposed by the âEcosystem Approachâ (Waltner-Toews et al. 2008), and further elaborated by Gatzweiler et al. (2011) in the context of social marginality."

Nature-based solutions as social-spatial interventions have a transformative impact in the relations between people and nature. First, nature-based solutions contribute in the mental and physical health and wellbeing of people in cities (Andersson et al. 2015; Ambrey and Fleming 2014, p. 1298; Bratman et al. 2015; Buchel and Frantzeskaki 2015; Carrus et al. 2015). Reconnecting with nature in cities can contribute to social ties, establishment of sense of community and social cohesion (Kazmierczak 2013). Second, nature-based solutions are systemic ways on locally responding to climate change pressures. So far research has focused on the (potential) insurance value of naturebased solutions that revolves around the restorative capacity of these solutions deeming them effective for climate change adaptation and mitigation (Green et al. 2016; Haase et al. 2012; Kabisch et al. 2016; Mullaney et al. 2015; Andersson et al. Chap. 4 this volume). We add to this understanding is that nature-based solutions can have regenerative impact (Carrus et al. 2015, p. 226). We argue that for understanding the impact of nature-based solutions in cities, we need to attend to their social production (Ernston 2013). In this way, we will understand how nature-based solutions as social-spatial settings, they mediate the need and ability of actors and communities to establish a positive dependence of place motivating them to restore it (Tidball and Stedman 2012, p. 297). Third, transition initiatives are instrumental in creating and localizing nature-based solutions, moving from a passive experience âof natureâ to an active experience âwith (making) natureâ. In this way, transition initiatives experiment with nature-based solutions, learn-by-doing on how to adapt them to city-specific and place-specific situations and geophysical characteristics and create new narratives and understandings of their benefits. As thus, nature-based solutions are seeds of transformation of local practice and local space towards more sustainable ones. In line with the above, nature-based solutions as social-ecological settings require social actors and social processes to be implemented in cities. In this chapter we examine the way nature-based solutions scale as a social process that includes transition initiatives driving their social production. Specifically, we examine, how transition initiatives as actor configurations that establish, experiment and localise nature-based solutions shift them from âsolutionsâ to social configurations, making nature-based solutions the new âurban commons of sustainabilityâ and in this way contributing to accelerating sustainability transitions in cities."

Conceptual Referents The major elements of this model are communication, developmental changes, and society. For each of these major elements, conceptual referents were identified. The conceptual referents for communication were ICTs and their unique features. The referents for developmental changes were social learning, social cohesion, social mobilization, improved livelihood outcomes and improved governance. The referents for society were individuals, groups, communities, organizations, and institutions. After 2 days of discussions, The Hague group decided that the agreed upon constructs and visual model constituted an ICT4D framework that held much promise and that it was time to disband. Theoretically, the framework explained how development sectors could benefit from information and communication technologies. Furthermore, it enumerated the elements required to do so. In other words, it made us understand the dynamic behind the impact."

Different modes of investigation carry with them different archival legacies, and conventions of thinking and writing. As any theorist of translation, or historian of science will know all too well, there is no straightforward, translucent âlanguageâ through which any of us can present research findings, let alone arguments. As much as we want to trouble a model of disciplines in which each is confined to her own pen, let us stress that this book is written, unapologetically, by two authors who have been trained in different corners of the interpretive social sciences, and who ally themselves with social and cultural theory. Having spent significant amounts of time and resources training ourselves up in cognitive neuroscience, as well as working closely with neuroscientists, we consider ourselves to be â as social scientists go â relatively well versed in the neurosciences, and in the rhetorics through which those sciences move forward. We will do all we can to speak to, through, and with those rhetorics in what follows. Nonetheless, we do have particular networks of citations, modes of address, and means of presenting and analysing our interlocutorsâ arguments and empirical materials. This will provoke discomfort in some of our readers and friends steeped in other, scientific traditions for writing, and thinking and reading. But this, in many ways, is a volume about learning to be discomfited."

191,479,0.391,Collaborating Against Child Abuse : Exploring The Nordic Barnahus Model,"Holism is a central aspect of social work because all children, young people and adults are part of a whole, of something bigger than the individual. A holistic approach is based on the understanding that the problems of a child or young person cannot be viewed separately from the rest of the individual (EjrnÃ¦s and Guldager 2008; Guldager 2015). Working holistically means working with all the aspects of a personâs life that are important to a case, based on the assumption that all the aspects are interconnected (Harder 2011). Not all elements are equally important, but they are all significant and nothing can deliberately be left out. A holistic approach is by definition multidisciplinary, as one profession cannot be profoundly knowledgeable about all the aspects of a case (Guldager 2015). Holism is central to social work, as explained in the words of Ferguson, because social work includes the combination of a value base of respect, empowerment and social justice, the emphasis on a relationship between worker and service user founded on trust and non-judgmental acceptance; a knowledge base which embraces both developmental psychology and also an understanding of social structures and social procedures, and a repertoire of methods ranging from individual counselling to advocacy and community work; all these give social work a holistic perspective which makes it unique among the helping professions (Ferguson 2008)."

More consideration needs to be given to understanding and predicting embankment breaching as this will become more likely over time if no planning is undertaken. Upgrading the embankments, as already proposed in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, is one approach, combined with other actions such as improved warning systems (Dasgupta et al. 2014). More fundamentally there is a need to develop more sustainable long-term delta-scale management techniques that utilise sediments and sedimentation in new ways. This is large-scale controlled (or engineered) sedimentation within polders as well as working with morphodynamic processes to build land elevation and sustain natural ecological functions such as fisheries spawning (Amir et al. 2013; Auerbach et al. 2015). âTidal river managementâ has only been employed locally to date, and to be successful would require both fundamental scientific investigation of morphodynamic processes and the development of innovative large-scale engineering application. In addition to the technical dimensions of these policies, the social dimensions will also need to be considered such as education and training, infrastructure development and targeted financial support to the poorest of the poor. Ignoring these social dimensions is likely to impede or stop their application. In addition to the insights obtained, the method itself is worthy of consideration. The hybrid integrated framework and method has allowed a move away from an ad hoc external expert or purely indicator-based approach. It provides an opportunity not only to explore the interactions between domains of knowledge as diverse as oceanographic modelling and perception-based assessments of well-being but also to incorporate the views of stakeholders throughout in ways which maintain the relevance and credibility of the findings, despite their complexity. The assumptions are explicit and have been debated and challenged as part of this co-production process, and changed as knowledge has grown and the detailed questions being posed have evolved with this understanding. Hence, it provides an explicit framework to analyse the problem and provide spatially explicit output. In particular, it forces the users to identify, consider and explore the limits to knowledge of the relevant system. Such reflection is critical in problems where gaps and limits in current knowledge need to be acknowledged and addressed. It should be noted"
72,32,0.389,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"In particular, this volume aims to challenge some of the emerging normative assumptions about the âpromise of social innovationâ, namely a general acceptance that it is an unproblematic and consistently positive phenomenon without drawbacks or unintended consequences. Thus, this collection explores the implications of social innovation in cross-sector collaborations and hybrid forms, across several contexts and in multiple country settings to highlight a range of issues across social innovation models. The research presented here deliberately ranges across different socio-structural levels and units of analysis â from micro to macro â in order to offer multiple insights into the various contexts in which social innovation can operate effectively. Much of the work here also has strong policy implications: by codifying and analysing practice, its objective is to inform future policy making in social innovation across countries. This book also aims to contribute to the critical field-building project of social innovation that is already underway across a range of researchers and institutions by augmenting the existing body of knowledge on this subject with work on new trends and case examples. In the process, the hope is that the work published here will also support the building of a community of researchers looking at social innovation by adding its own, modest legitimacy to working on this subject.

It contributes to encouraging and supporting such new market actors via actions such as the 2014 conference on âEmpowering social entrepreneurs for innovation, inclusive growth and jobsâ. At that event, workshops focused on the âpotential of social enterprises for job creation and green economyâ as well as on the ways that the European Union could use its structural funds to support and foster social enterprises.16 Leverage for jobs, social inclusion and green initiatives were all identified as necessary because they are inadequately addressed by traditional firms. Nor is it only international or supranational organisations that engage in behaviour meant to structure labour markets, both on the supply and demand sides. The major cross-national study of social cohesion and innovation reported in Evers et al. (2014) documented that âwork integration enterprisesâ were the most common innovation in local welfare systems. These kinds of businesses exist at the blurry boundary between market and community, often difficult to distinguish from the kinds of community groups, third-sector providers and associations that engage in social development projects, frequently at the local level (Moulaert et al., 2010). Social policy communitiesâ enthusiasm for the market participation of social entrepreneurs and the social economy has had to go beyond cheer-leading and publicising best practices, of course. The reconfiguration of the welfare diamond has necessitated attention to how social innovations will be financed. This need has resulted in blurring of boundaries between public and private governance as public funds flow into the market corner of the welfare diamond to finance, in whole or in part, services that are no longer public services in the classic meaning of the term, that is provided by public employees at no cost (or little cost) to users. âMany if not most of the SIs [social innovations] we dealt with rely on a multiplicity of resources and their combination; the mix may vary and state financing may often be the most important component, but in most cases there is a degree of (financial) co-responsibility of other organizations from the civil society or the business sectorâ (Evers et al., 2014, p. 22). In other words, local, regional, national or European public authorities were actively using their available funds to foster local innovations in labour markets and for services. They were engaged in market-making and in blurring traditional boundaries between public and other forms of services. Developments in childcare services provide another good example of this blurring, which has intensified as the âsocial investment"

In the next chapter, Chap. 8, Thomas Wiedmann considers the environmental and social impacts of the increase in global trade experienced during recent decades. He discusses how, for example, todayâs longer and increasingly complex global supply chains make it more difficult to connect the environmental impacts of production to the final consumer of the goods and services. In addition to discussing developments in analytical tools and data requirements, Wiedmann also discusses the broadening of indicators. He reviews how studies now extend beyond the traditional analysis of carbon emissions, to include other environmental indicators such as land and water use and, importantly, social indicators such as child labour, which extend the analysis into the âSocial equityâ lobe of Fig. 1. The chapter by Angela Druckman and Tim Jackson (9) follows neatly from Thomas Wiedmannâs Chap. (8), as it takes the concept of âfootprintingâ, which Wiedmann applies to trade, and applies it to household consumption. Both approaches are based on consumption perspective accounting, which uses whole systems, life cycle thinking to attribute all impacts along supply chains to final consumers. Druckman and Jackson review the determinants of the carbon footprints of Western households, the composition of average household footprints, and also discuss the rebound effect. They conclude that while it is vital to address the systems of provision of food, energy, housing and transportation, structural income growth presents a key challenge and that we should seek solutions that provide low carbon lifestyles with high levels of well-being. Once again, âdevelopmentâ must not to be equated with economic growth. In Chap. 10 Marlyne Sahakian picks up on the importance of the structure of the economy and the well-being it provides by introducing the concept of the social and solidarity economy, fully embracing the âSocial equityâ lobe in Fig. 1. As noted above, a high quality of life is the objective, not just economic activity as measured by GDP. The concept is people centric: it aims to place service to communities ahead of profit and embraces the notion of reciprocity. Examples of activities of the social and solidarity economy include social entrepreneurship, crowd funding, fair trade, community currencies and some forms of peer-to-peer sharing. Many of these activities are niche: they are often at the grassroots level operating at the margins of the dominant capitalist economy. Hence, to make progress, the issue of scale is, she says, the greatest challenge. Importantly for this book, Sahakian analyses the linkages between the social and solidarity economy and industrial ecology and finds many synergies. She also, however, notes a tension that is a challenge for the future, whereby industrial ecology generally prioritises the environment, whereas the social and solidarity economy prioritises people. In the terms of Fig. 1, a genuine balance must be found between the âEnvironmental compatibilityâ and âSocial equityâ lobes. In Chap. 11, Megha Shenoy focuses attention on developing countries â the âglobal Southâ â and so returns to the original focus of sustainable development. The holistic approach of industrial ecology can provide a valuable platform on which to develop strategies and policies for sustainable development. In turn, the development of industrial ecology thinking should be informed by experience in the"

This variable measures citiesâ orientations towards innovation in regard to social policies. The context of the production of social policies was summarised through three key variables: 10. Federalism and local autonomy. This variable measures the independence and financial autonomy of the city from national social policies. It also measures the strength of the local welfare state. 11. Co-decision logics of local welfare-state institutions (participation in networks of actors) and co-operation with non-profit organisations in the production of social policies. 12. The dominant welfare mix. This variable measures the degree to which the production of social policies is distinguished by logics oriented towards the state or society (non-profit organisations). In all cities, qualitative and partially quantitative data have been collected, permitting us to describe the different ways in which social policies and social innovations are produced and how they are embedded.8 The data concerning the 12 variables are largely descriptive and were interpreted in various meetings involving the authors of the individual city reports until we arrived at a consensus concerning a general classification of each city through a simple scheme of representations of the values. Following the logic of the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA, see Ragin 1987) we dichotomised all variable values as 1 or 0 (some disputed cases received the value 0.5). The result was a sort of truth table indicating the combination of the presence or absence of specific characteristics from the above-mentioned variables."

The disparity in economic impacts apparent at the county level may destabilize the SES socially by creating feelings of inequity at the village level. Sedentarization has undermined the resilience of these pastoral communities by generating social and ecological tensions at multiple spatial scales.

If we get a proper grasp on these complexities, we are better equipped to understand not only the richness of grassroots mobilization that evolved during the Bolivarian process, but also the inherent challenges of rolling out social policy reforms through bottom-up participation. Moreover, as a second point, the case illustrates the opaque dynamics characterizing the Venezuelan state and bureaucracy, and the multiple strategies deployed by people in popular sector communities to make it more responsive. Seen together, this case provides a solid platform for our continuous explorations in subsequent chapters into how the Venezuelan state was sought transformed both from the inside and from below, and the numerous challenges and contradictions that this process implied."
72,183,0.383,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Germany (Evers et al., 2014, p. 137). This is an example of one of many municipalities in Germany that had opted for local responsibility rather than being part of an integrated centralised service system. Upgrading the community component in mixed welfare systems Given that the community sphere was often subsumed within the third sector of voluntary associations in society, excluding family relationships and informal neighbourhood-communities, it was all the more important to see that a major aspect of many social innovations was developing innovative forms of community. A good example of combining the public and community spheres and sharing the responsibility for care between these two was the âChildren CafÃ©sâ in Lille, France, which opened up the tasks and concerns of family life to the community. Another example was from Amsterdam (the Netherlands), where a housing corporation decided to support community organisations (âNeighbourhood Management Companiesâ) in their housing as it was being reconstructed (Evers et al., 2014, p. 80; p. 203). It should certainly be noted that many social innovations were, in various ways, challenging traditional interpretations of welfare, in which community, building on a shared sense of duty, was seen as a rather parochial element to be gradually substituted by more state-public, professionalised and completely voluntary elements. Integrating economic and social logics In contrast to the previous point, the integration of social and economic logics is much better established as a concern in the debates on the profile of future welfare systems. The creeping economisation of all spheres of life, and an increasingly productivist attitude that evaluates all social actions and relationships primarily with respect to their quantifiable economic effect, is just one side of the coin. The other side can be found in the debate on the welfare state as a âsocial investment stateâ (Morel et al., 2012) that advocates modernising public welfare through an approach that stresses the positive economic effects of social policy interventions in education, family support, and occupational and social integration. In urban regeneration, those social innovations that sought to combine the active participation of people as co-producers and co-decision-makers with public and private investment could be seen as part of this perspective on social investment as a means of societal development. Integrating welfare and urban politics Policy fields that are usually excluded from the welfare system, such as environmental policy or cultural activities, played an important role in"
275,295,0.383,Foundations of Trusted Autonomy,"for these reasons is a desire to maintain a strong relationship with us (whether that is economic, love, friendship etc.). Trust between individuals is different to trust we have in corporations. This asymmetry is a really significant issue for AS, because humans ground their trust in beliefs about the corporation behind the AS, not the systems themselves instantiated in a single car, robot, or computer installation. Social norming is an approach to procedural ethics outside of traditional philosophical theories from anthropology and sociology [101]. Social norming is about learning how to behave in groups to get along the best. It requires we understand social expectations. Detailed theories of cooperative behaviour stem from disciplines such as sociology, biology, anthropology and group psychology. These models are not about competence and achieving optimal performance on tasks, but about creating the most cohesive, resilient teams of organisms. Theories such as game theory contribute to understanding social norming [72]. One of the many advantages of group level norms is the ability to train AS with social norming without needing top-down ethical theories to drive behaviours. However, while there are promising avenues for research into the ethical programming to improve trust, many barriers exist for the universalization of such programming. This is because there remains vast disagreement on what the right ethical principles are or even whether ethical principles exist such that they could be implemented into an AS. What does ethical talk amount to? It seems that humans judge each others actions as ethical or not ethical based a huge range of theoretical, contextual, pragmatic and social factors that ethical theories struggle to explain beyond stipulating that actual human decision makers exhibit a sort of hopeless contrariness. There is a lot of work to be done in determining what the most ethical action is in any particular context and what model underpins such actions. However, even if we can program AS to be ultimately logical, rational or ethical, humans may be uncomfortable. Would we trust machines that obey norms without empathy [28]? Consider the origins of the word robot from the 1920 play, Rossumovi UniverzaÌlniÌ Roboti (Rossumâs Universal Robots). In the play Czech writer Karel Capek endowed robots with not just thoughts, but emotions to enable them to increase their productivity [97]. Capekâs robots were forced workers more like biological androids Replicants in Bladerunner than metal machines. If we program AS with emotions and empathy to build trust, will they suffer if we treat them badly? If AS are moral agents that can suffer, then building trustworthy autonomous systems also means building an ethical and legal framework around their use and identifying their rights [81]. Japanese roboticists are already designing robots to have âkokoroâ, translated into heart, spirit or mind [1]. Kokoro stems from animist spiritual thinking that all objects, including rocks and trees, have some level of consciousness and agency including emotions, intelligence and intention. Robots and AS of the future may need complex social identities to meet ethical and social norms."
278,373,0.382,Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology,"industrial ecology community (Cohen-Rosenthal 2004), was consistently critical of reductionist strategies that would rely solely on engineering know-how, proper technologies and market-based incentives. For Cohen-Rosenthal, the focus should be on social processes, or the actual points of connection between material and energy flows, and specifically connections between people. Yet little attention is given in IE to the relation between interests, institutions and resources (Opoku 2004), and this dimension remains to be further conceptualized â although interest in this dimension has been growing in the past decade, as we will now turn to. IE engages with various tools, which are now considered a part industrial ecology approaches, including InputâOutput Accounting and Material Flow Analysis, as well as Life Cycle Assessments. The value of LCA has been to extend beyond the âend of pipeâ perspective, which only addresses final outputs, in terms of pollution and environmental degradation. Rather, inputs and outputs are described and can be quantified and qualified across the production-consumption chain, from extraction of natural resources, through manufacturing, distribution, usage and final disposal. In more recent years, social LCA has developed to consider the social impacts in the life cycle of products and processes (UNEP 2009; Andrews et al. 2009; Hauschild et al. 2008), with more recent work in developing a social hotspots database that includes a consideration of labour intensity and worker rights (Benoit-Norris et al. 2012) and on integrating occupational health and safety standards (Scanlon et al. 2015). One aspect of the social and solidarity economy is that the primacy of people over profit is not an âend of pipeâ gesture, but rather embedded across the economic activity in question, from its guiding principles and mission, to how salaries and employee benefits are organized, to how profit is shared. We will come back to this notion in the next section of this chapter, when we consider forms of âend of pipe sharingâ to distinguish more robust solidarity economy activities from âbusiness as usualâ. The notion of reciprocity, which is an important concept underpinning the SSE, is interesting to explore in relation to IE. If we continue with the notion of IE as being based on a metaphor, can we identify any forms of reciprocity in nature? In other terms, do we see cooperation or competition in natural systems? Ehrenfeld (2000) suggests that a balance is needed between both. Does altruism exist in nature? Perhaps something closer would be mutualism, which would suggest cooperation between members that lead to mutually beneficial or even neutral outcomes. For Ehrenfeld, ââ¦the power of the concept of industrial ecology lies in its normative context and in its potential to shape paradigmatic thinking. It is normative in the sense that (â¦) three features of the ecological metaphor â community, connectedness, and cooperation â are characteristics we should strive for in designing our worlds.â (Ehrenfeld 2000: 238). These three features, of community, connectedness and cooperation, are closely related to the social and solidarity economy and would merit being further conceptualized. We could draw on the work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809â1865) here, the father of mutualism in economic theory, who suggested that human activities could be mutualized towards the creation of a collective good. In terms of governance systems, the notion of voluntary engagement in complementary relations, which is important in the SSE literature, is not explicit in the IE literature. Forms of auto-organization are usually upheld as the preferred way of"

Her approach seeks to transcend âeither/orâ dichotomies and account for the interrelationships of the local, national, regional, and global beyond the Westphalian frame that has focused on national security rather than on justice. She discusses a tripartite model of social justice aiming at âparticipatory parityâ, with reference to the economic dimension of redistribution, the cultural dimension of recognition, and the political dimension of representation (Fraser 2001, 2005, 2008). Unlike other approaches, in her view and in order to be effective in terms of social justice, all three dimensions must have equal weight: Insofar as the stress on recognition is displacing redistribution, it may actually promote economic inequality. Insofar as the cultural turn is reifying collective identities, it risks sanctioning violations of human rights and freezing the very antagonisms it purports to mediate. Insofar, finally, as struggles of any type are misframing transnational processes, they risk truncating the scope of justice and excluding relevant social actors (Fraser 2001: 13)."

161,224,0.381,Mhealth innovation in Asia : Grassroots Challenges and Practical interventions,"the healthcare system in China (Chib, Si, Hway, & Phuong, 2013), who utilized mobile phones to negotiate professional relationships depending on the social capital therein. While such a Western theory could well describe the phenomenon encountered, the Chinese cultural concept of guanxi provides far greater explanatory power and deeper insights. We ï¬nd that guanxi relations describe the power hierarchies of rural barefoot doctors vis-Ã -vis their urban counterparts, who as the insider network, have greater medical knowledge, access to health resources, and comprise the formal healthcare information system (HIS). Rural doctors then utilize mobile phones in a parallel guanxi system using their existing social networks. The Chinese concept of social relations thus provides us insights into barriers faced in implementation of HIS. Further, the concept can be incorporated into program design for interventionary programs that minimize top-down centralized control in favor of more participatory designs that give voice to the margins. The implications from the cautionary tale of guanxi mimics the recommendations of Watkins and Baulch (Chap. 4) to pay attention to the sociocultural contexts of mHealth implementations. In Chap. 7, Chen examines mHealth apps, having gained popularity in China with the proliferation of smartphones, and ï¬nds that levels of app integration into lifestyles and perceptions of the role of apps vary between users. Users have differing comfort levels and knowledge of how the apps work, leading to different usage patterns. In the intrapersonal sphere, while some users appreciated how apps gave them greater control over their health, others were worried about being over-dependent on apps. In the social sphere, mHealth apps gave users a sense of belonging to a larger community with similar health pursuits, but also caused some to feel lonely as apps facilitated exercise conducted in isolation. Chen proposes that app developers take into consideration how to empower users to feel in control of their health regime, and integrate them into a larger health community through social features in the app. KrÃ¶mer (2016) argues that few mHealth projects have applied the theoretical concept of empowerment, with existing theories relating to either personal or psychological motivations. There is an opportunity to develop culturally relevant theorizing to integrate empowerment with social influences from a Chinese (Asian) perspective. In conclusion, one might very well ask whether the âhard scholarly evidenceâ, the lack of which our editors lament, has been indeed discovered. We would do well to pause before making judgments about evidence of impact, given the range of illustrations available, and the respective lenses that varied stakeholders will use to examine the evidence base. The contribution of this volume is to argue for the application of a sociocultural structural lens to issues of power within complex and variegated societies which applies beyond that of the mHealth domain. This set of empirical and conceptual contributions provides such a lens, allowing us to shift the needle just that bit forward. This collection is exemplary in bringing a range of (new) voices in mHealth in Asia to the fore. The discipline can only gain from the increased research capacities and the growing body of sophisticated analysis and evidence."
192,381,0.381,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"replication attempts (unless they have something to hide of course). But the objective of this chapter is not to solve the (unsolvable?) replication problem (apparently more challenging even in social psychology than in science in general) about which so many books and papers have already been written. The question rather is what a dialectical-psychoanalytical view can contribute to our understanding of Stapelâs misconduct in response to the challenges emerging in his âimpossible professionâ. Was his misconduct perhaps a (misguided) response to the replication crisis and other embarrassing problems occurring in this type of university discourse? There may be more continuity between âfabricationâ (in the non-normative sense) of social psychological facts âbackstageâ, and the âfabricationâ (now in a pejorative sense) of fraudulent data published in Stapelâs papers than the committees (in their persistent use of metaphors such as âcleansing operationâ) seem able or willing to acknowledge. What I find remarkable is that the three committees, while claiming to have âscrutinizedâ a whole body of work, fail to address the methodological discussions that are part of this work (discussions which increasingly reflect a sense of despair on the part of the author). As if âscrutinizingâ an oeuvre means something else than reading and addressing its content, but I will return to this issue below. Interestingly, Stapelâs fraud has been regarded as an experiment in itself. Question: how often and to what extent can an established scientist commit fraud before it is detected? Abma cites a colleague who argued that we should seriously consider the possibility that Stapelâs fraud is actually a research trial, involving his peers and colleagues as research subjects, and that we should not be surprised if he (Stapel) at a certain point decides to publish an analysis of his results (2013, p. 157). What is pointed out here is that the technique of deception of research subjects (which is accepted practice in social psychology) is applied by Stapel to the research community as such. What is the crucial normative difference between these two instances of deception?"

376,453,0.379,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The richly interconnected view of resource systems in an SES stands in opposition to strategies that attempt to reduce system complexity by focusing on only a small number of target resources, species, or indicators as is typical of maximum sustained yield and steady-state natural resource management (Holling and Meffe 1996). History has shown that these types of management strategies are often ecologically unsustainable because of unrecognized slow system change, sudden unpredicted disturbance, and/or unknown interconnections. On the social dimension, these approaches often fail as a result of an inability to understand what people want from natural resources, a lack of capacity to govern human resource use, and the broad perception of an accompanying policy or distribution of benefits as unjust. Given the evolving nature of complex adaptive systems and their lack of predictability, much of the work on SESs in rangelands and elsewhere focuses on developing responsive policy and governance that supports system resilience (e.g., Walker et al. 2004; Armitage et al. 2009) rather than attempting to provide specific and relatively inflexible resource management prescriptions. Social groups do not maintain consistent or uniform relationships with their surrounding environment, but change in either social or ecological patterns cannot necessarily be attributed to a corresponding driver in the other system (Vayda and McCay 1975). Resource management and governance policies must therefore monitor and be responsive to ecological and social processes that may or may not create new drivers of change within the SES. It is the inclusion of both ecological and social variables within the frame of analysis that makes the SES framework useful for management. Changes in the price of beef or altered land tenure policies, for example, have to be considered alongside fluctuations in climate and vegetation composition when planning management actions or policies for a rangeland SES. Problems that cross scales or levels within SESs can prove challenging for two reasons: perception and communication. First, the occurrence of a phenomenon at one level must be perceived as having been caused by a driver at another level. Second, that observation has to be communicatedâpersuasivelyâto the person or organization capable of solving the problem, and that person or entity has to decide to address the problem. Solutions involving changes in policy need to be effectively communicated to the affected population, ideally with buy-in from the affected populations. The perception problem can be met with a combination of thorough cross-scale monitoring and diverse information networks. Communication problems require adaptations to governance structures and strategies that facilitate information sharing and learning across sectors and hierarchical levels. An increasing number of groups, such as the Sustainable Rangelands Roundtable (http://www. sustainablerangelands.org/) and the California Rangeland Conservation Coalition (http://carangeland.org/) in the USA, are devoted to encouraging this type of communication about rangelands and range management. Inclusion of various stakeholders in goal-setting, planning, monitoring, research, data interpretation, and decision making is one way that managers can create"

This chapter provides a guide through the remarkable diversity of cross-cutting approaches and tools in the gigantic puzzle of the SOLAS realm. Here we overview the existing prime components of atmospheric and oceanic observing systems, with the acquisition of oceanâatmosphere observables either from in situ or from satellites, the rich hierarchy of models to test our knowledge of Earth System functioning, and the tremendous efforts accomplished over the last decade within the COST Action 735 and SOLAS Integration project frameworks to understand, as best we can, the current physical and biogeochemical state of the atmosphere and ocean commons. A few SOLAS integrative studies illustrate the full meaning of interactions, paving the way for even tighter connections between thematic fields.

72,132,0.376,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"To conclude, three epistemological issues raised by the development of the CRISES Database on Social Innovations should be mentioned. These relate to the nature, validity and interpretation of data. The case studies included in the database so far are mainly based on qualitative research methods that take into account the (inter)subjective interpretation of the phenomena under study (AnadÃ³n and Guillemette, 2007). This is reflected in the dominance of interviews as a way of learning about the point of view of key actors. To deal with this issue, the proposed database is designed to allow for a transition to a quantitative analysis of data, namely by reducing and formalising the information. Yet, how can it be ensured that their intended meaning does not get lost in the process? On the other hand, the creation of a database of case studies raises the question of the triple interpretation of data: that of the interviewees who provided the information to the researchers conducting the case studies; that of the researchers who collected, organised, analysed and published the data; and the interpretation of the team of researchers who re-conceptualised and organised the information from the case studies for the creation of the database. Given these multiple interpretations, what reading can be given of the results of the comparative analyses generated by the database? Finally, faced with these multiple levels of interpretation, how can the codification of normative evaluations be prevented, in other words, those comprising value judgments rather than facts? Nonetheless, the case studies all have a common focus: social innovation. Moreover, the three to four data collection templates used in the various research programmes at CRISES through time share many common concepts and dimensions of analysis. The case studies concerned observations that were relatively limited in time (thirty years) and space (QuÃ©bec). A number of contextual (institutional, demographic, sociopolitical, etc.) variables are, therefore, common to many of them. In short, the many case studies produced by CRISES constitute a source of knowledge and information that has been underutilised to date. Aside from representing a unique opportunity for research of its kind, the project to create a relational database requires formalising a conceptual framework of social innovation to advance the theoretical analysis underlying its work. To create a quantitative approach and a relational database is a novel way to research social innovation. It is a new way of gathering data in order to develop theories about the generation, emergence and life cycle of social innovations. Should other researchers in the world opt for a similar conceptual framework and relational database model,"

166,185,0.375,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"1.1 The Couple Relationship as the Primary Resource of Social Support Implications for the couple relationship can be seen from the womanâs perspective. One way to cope with the stress related to the illness is indeed to receive support from significant others, especially from the partner (Ell et al. 1989; Manne et al. 2004; Pistrang and Barker 1995). Social support plays an important role in oneâs life at two inter-related levels (Cutrona 1996; Weiss 1974). First, at a general level, it allows the fulfillment of interpersonal needs in everyday life. In this perspective, social support is an ongoing resource that increases well-being and acts as a resiliency factor that lowers the probability that daily life events will be perceived as stressors by the individual. Second, at a more specific level, social support refers to the assistance that an individual receives during times of adversity when she has to face and cope with a critical event. In this perspective, social support is conceptualized as a moderator factor which influences the link between a critical event and an individualâs health. In case of a somatic illness like cancer, support is sought especially from the partner (Ell et al. 1989; Manne et al. 2004; Pistrang and Barker 1995). Three types of supportive social interactions have been traditionally distinguished: emotional, instrumental and informational. The first one is of primary importance in stress situations: it refers to reassurance and love needs that a person will have when facing a challenging situation. In the case of a breast cancer, this is usually the first need women report that they expect from their partner. The second one refers to pragmatic help, like money or assistance in the realization of daily tasks. Women expect this kind of help both from their partners (daily shopping, household chores) and from the larger social circle or even from institutions (having money for the medical treatment). The latter refers to advice or information which is mainly expected from medical staff. Womenâs satisfaction with the social support they receive from their partners is an important predictor of the enhancement of their mood and quality of life (Giese-Davis et al. 2000; Helgeson and Cohen 1996).

As16: Philosophy helps us foresee the impact of new technologies (or gives us the tools to do so). Challenging social norms Humanities research can often be the source of challenges to widely accepted social values and traditions. In this way it may actually be in tension with social cohesion. This role overlaps with critical thinking, being a specific instance of it, so we shall have more to say below. But for the moment, here is one of our interviewees testifying to the critical value of the humanities in a social context: As2: I would just say that it is only in the humanities and social sciences that we still produce a âcritical discourseâ. Science, technology and even economics have stopped performing that function. The curricula in these areas have no element of criticism per se, making it difficult for them to contribute to the formation of critical citizenship. It has proved more than once in the course of the last century that pure science and economics have failed to produce an understanding of the symbolic life that makes us social and therefore human. This point was also stressed at our Latin American workshop. Institution building Finally, it is worth recording three interview responses (from India, Lebanon and Russia) that linked the humanities to the creation and nurturing of strong institutions: ME3: The humanities are essential for building strong institutions. As6: You need some insight into the relation between the subject and the world in order to make institutions stronger.

28,255,0.374,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"sociological studies that focus upon the particularly intractable management problems presented by these patients, problems that are increasingly reduced to âcuttingâ. Despite these management issues, Simpson becomes increasingly confident that the behaviour is essentially a response to tension, even if also learned or contagious. He argues that â[t]his form of a response to tension can be learned and propagated in a hospital or institution and is often sustained by the widespread conflict and guilt such acts tend to arouse in the staffâ. Any focus on the social or administrative setting is secondary to the essence of the behaviour, which is characterised as a âresponse to tensionâ. The focus on internal, emotional states is combined with a desire for solitude, leaving any wider social or communicative significance out of the reckoning: âThe patient feels depressed, angry and tense, and wants to express the extent of her feelings, but feels unable to do so in words. Tension becomes the predominant affect ... she will seek solitude if she is not already aloneâ.91 Simpsonâs study illustrates the lack of concern for the social setting with his assessments of lethality, the focus upon the subjective experience (phenomenology) of the cutting, and it shows the management issues that persist in assessments of self-cutting. Again, the focus is upon individual, intolerable tension as motivating the cutting incidents. Simpsonâs literature review of self-mutilation, published in a collection about suicide, reports a âvery clear composite picture of the typical cutterâ as being a young, attractive, intelligent woman. He mentions Offerâs and Barglowâs analysis, which ranges from the interpersonal and social settings to internal motivations. According to Simpson, they propose âseveral motives such as gaining attention, the need to be loved and cared for, attempts to control aggression, tension reduction, and gaining prestige among the social group in the wardâ. Such an explicit mention of the social setting merits significant disagreement: Simpson claims that â[e]lements of such motivations may well play a part in the dynamics of self-mutilation, but they are inadequate explanations â Why choose to gain attention or express the need for love by cutting oneâs wrist?â92 Note that it is the social, communicative motivations singled out for their inadequacy, rather than (for example) the observations about aggression or tension. However, he also mentions that many authors have focused upon issues of loss and abandonment as precipitants for cutting incidents. The social focus of this behaviour comes through most clearly in a passage where in Simpson discusses how âcutting behavior can be learned and propagated in a hospital, clinic or institutionâ and how patients may"
99,203,0.373,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Debates about social innovation have given rise to a large body of literature in the social sciences. The concept itself is ambiguous and has become a confusing âbuzzwordâ, as underlined by Moulaert et al. (2013, p. 13): In our opinion, the lack of clarity about the term âsocial innovationâ can be attributed not only to its evolving analytical status but also to its over-simplistic use as a buzzword in a multiplicity of policy practices associated, for example, with the rationalization of the welfare state and the commodification of sociocultural wellbeing. The appropriation of the term by âcaring liberalismâ, in one of its new incarnations, has added to a Babel-like terminological confusion. (Moulaert et al. 2013, p. 13)"

Meanwhile, we retain an inexhaustible reservoir of vision and of contrariness. Once this power of resistance enlists practical ingenuity and living social forces in its service, it can do more than may seem feasible. The fact about us is that we are the beings who never entirely fit into the social and conceptual worlds that we build and inhabit. There is always more in us than in them. Although we can improve them, we can never improve them enough to lose reasons to resist them. We can â indeed we must â deny them the last word, and keep it for ourselves. We can â indeed we should â see, do and create more than they countenance. Social innovation is the creation of a new way of acting and cooperating in some part of society. As society is divided into distinct domains that are arranged according to different rules and conceptions â the worlds of business, of politics, of social services, of the âthird sectorâ, of the academy or of the media â the practice of social innovation must always begin in one of these areas. It must identify a problem that has not been solved in that corner of society and that cannot be solved by its conventional practices and established institutions. It must exemplify, through a practical initiative, a way of understanding the problem and of dealing with it. It must do its work in such a way that the initiative does more than address the immediate problem. It must also suggest a path for the reform of the part of social life in which it began, with implications for the larger society. For example, if it begins as business it must be successful as business and yet effective as well in the advancement of a concern that business, as now organised, commonly fails to share. Its innovations must point beyond themselves. Today the opportunity for such a practice is likely to be greatest in departments of social life that are orphaned by both the state and the market, or that lie in a netherworld between economic and political action, or that require initiatives that neither business firms nor political parties seem capable of conceiving and promoting. Such an activity cannot take place unless it has an agent. Social regimes are organised to reproduce themselves. If they allowed no room for their own reshaping, social innovation would be impossible â except through individual and collective rebellion, in the favouring circumstance of crisis. If they had done much more to open themselves to challenge and change than they have, social innovation might be unnecessary. It is in the real, intermediate situation that social innovation becomes both needed and possible as a practice bidding to become a movement. It takes its cue from the failure of political parties and of business firms, and more generally of all established organisations in society, to do what needs to be done to address the unresolved problems of society."

267,36,0.371,"Microfinance, Eu Structural Funds and Capacity Building For Managing Authorities : a Comparative Analysis of European Convergence Regions","financial crisis â an increasing number of people deal with poverty issues due to factors such as immigration, unemployment, inactivity and marginalisation. By âmicrocreditâ we refer here to âmicrocredit for businesses/entrepreneursâ, although the term is normally used to designate two types of financial activities: the so-called social microcredit (mainly aimed at social inclusion of excluded subjects through the provision of financial support to their current expenditure as well as social services, training courses, etc.) and microcredit for businesses (supporting start-ups and self-employment initiatives), which obviously has different goals. The traditional microcredit target groups are highly risky and cost-intensive; as a result, commercial banks are not interested in catering to some customer segments, which thus end up being non-bankable. This means that the microcredit business is quite different from traditional banking. It includes innovative and customised elements such as different collateral requirements or no collaterals at all, as well as alternative methods for creditworthiness assessment. In many cases, microcredit is granted not only for economic reasons and/or to make a profit but also to serve a broader purpose of social cohesion by trying to reintegrate disadvantaged people into their communities (Leone and Porretta, 2014). In fact, different kinds of credit guarantee schemes, usually created with EU structural fund, support microcredit initiatives in several EU countries. As is known, under the programming period 2014â2020 of the EU structural funds, the role of the European Social Fund (ESF) is further enhanced, in the attempt to promote social inclusion and prevent and fight poverty, through the mobilisation of a number of policies dedicated to economically and socially disadvantaged individuals. Among the latter, there are longterm unemployed, people affected by disabilities, migrants, ethnic minorities â as well as new sectors of the society, such as women, young couples, single-parent families â who, until a few years ago, enjoyed conditions far from what today are perceived as severe social risks. The current economic crisis has severely hit the Italian economy and prompted policymakers to implement public policies focusing on the increasing risk of social disintegration, which is leading large sectors of the population towards a deterioration of the conditions to access fundamental citizenship rights, such as employment, housing, a satisfactory social life, territorial mobility and new technology. The need to prevent further social inequalities strongly calls for improved public policies able to identify the needs of the European population, especially those segments at risk of social exclusion, and thus implement instruments and programmes to meet such needs, starting from a solid and shared idea of European social citizenship.

99,451,0.371,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"The programme Citizenâs Agreement for an Inclusive Barcelona (CA) is an example of social innovation that fits in with a new form of governance. It establishes both a new form of participation and policy-making. The CA is not only based on new practices but also introduces changes in social responsibilities (public and private) in the local welfare system. By bringing about a new culture in the management of the welfare system, it also affects attitudes and values within local government. It is an example of social innovation resulting from a two-way process: (1) A top-down process, in the sense that it was proposed by the municipal government, which (2) intersects with a bottom-up process based on the effort and interests of different organisations and social networks that work within the cityâs social welfare system. We consider that this is a programme with great potential, and it could be implemented in other cities with similar conditions. The programme was established in April 2005. The ultimate goal of the programme is to redistribute responsibilities in the social welfare sector in Barcelona through a broad agreement among representatives of the main social agents in the sector. The intention is to create a strategic framework shared by all participating entities. This is a new philosophy, which integrates the diversity of activities that are carried out in the local social welfare system into a single framework or joint strategy. It is based on a policy decision to coordinate the diverse activities of different social actors. No one loses their space for action; rather, it is possible to improve results by combining efforts."

The necessity to combine the different methods is discussed. Comments will be illustrated with a project conducted in Switzerland funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation that formed part of the National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) âLIVES â Overcoming Vulnerability: Life Course Perspectivesâ. This project examined couples facing breast cancer using a mixed method approach. Indeed the studies reported above have shown that women do not cope alone with their illness, but within their marital relationship, and that mutual social support between partners has an impact on the patientâs as well as partnerâs adjustment (Kayser 2005). It is of primary importance to gain and refine knowledge about the way each partner copes with the disease and the social support they provide one another, in order to help them to avoid inadequate adjustment to the illness and to identify variables which may be used to set up psychosocial and psychological interventions. Although it is known that interventions addressed to the patients or couples facilitate social support within the interactional relationship, several questions are left unanswered (Kayser 2005), such as: What kind of interventions should"
347,28,0.37,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Over the last few decades, the term âgovernanceâ and the specific topic of this book â âenvironmental governanceâ â have become prevalent in the social and environmental science literature (e.g. SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). The concept of governance, first established in public administration and taken up in political science, is used to depict a shift in responsibility from state to non-state actors (e.g. private or voluntary sectors) that affects structures and processes for collective action and decision-making (Stoker 1998). It emphasises social and political steering and acting in polycentric networks on different levels â local, regional, national, European and global (e.g. Delmas and Young 2009; Rosenau 2003; Wagner 2005). However, there is a great variation in how governance is defined and used. In other words, it refers more to a perspective than a coherent theory (e.g. Pierre and Peters 2000; Rhodes 1996). Our definition in this volume includes both structures â such as policy contexts, existing power relations among key actors, regulatory frameworks and organisational forms of decision-making, reflexivity and participation â and processes. Processes comprise aspects such as the evolution of organisations and interactions between, for instance, science and policy, as well as communication and interaction among policy-makers, scientists and other stakeholders. Processes also include the development of strategies, framings, communication and learning. In many respects, EAM shares with environmental governance an interest in similar core topics, e.g. multilevel and multi-sector institutional interactions, knowledge integration and stakeholder arrangements and partnerships (SÃ¶derstrÃ¶m et al. 2015a). In addition, it offers several additional focal areas and assumptions of value to the comprehensive analysis of environmental governance aimed for in this book. To begin with, there is a fundamental ecosystem-based focus in EAM that assumes that sustainable management of human activities and pressures can only be achieved if it is based on the sensitivity and complexity of the ecosystem in focus.

329,192,0.369,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"For most of the twentieth century, nonprofit organizations relied on a static funding model: foundations supplied grants to charities that delivered services otherwise not available for a variety of reasons, including budgetary constraints (for example, health care for the poor) or because of the innovative but still unproven nature of the work (for example, new models of helping at-risk youth). Beginning in the early 1980s, nonprofit organizations evolved and diversified, taking on new characteristics throughout the 1990s that would change the way philanthropists and nonprofit organizations now think about and act on their work. Many of these changes result from an increased understanding and application of the tenets of social entrepreneurship. In 1981, Bill Drayton introduced the concept of a social entrepreneur when he created Ashoka, now a global leader in incubating talent and ideas in the social sector. Drayton put forward the idea that a social entrepreneur is someone who takes the passion and rigor of an entrepreneur and applies it to a social problem. This was a new idea in two important ways. First, most philanthropy up until that point focused on the organization rather than on its leadership and talent. Second, it introduced the notion that nonprofits should still follow basic business tenets, including sound management, transparent accounting, and strategic planning. R.A.

99,323,0.368,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In transitional countries, civil society is a space for the self-organisation and mobilisation of citizens to protect and to promote their interests. Civic norms, values and networks produce a necessary level of social capital to build trust among local stakeholders and to strengthen social cohesion. In this case, there existed a fertile soil for social innovations and, after a certain period of time, social entrepreneurship. RODA was established as a successful social innovation because it was in possession of certain social capital mostly from middle class citizens that were its key actors. Also, they were among the first organisations that actively worked in family policy area counting on engagement of families. They became recognised and branded themselves so they are now the organisation that almost every mother has heard about, which contributes to their success as social innovation. It is obvious that developmental capacity of this innovation, being owned by a civic organisation, increases on a steady basis. Empirical evidence says that civil society is a space for self-organisation and selfpromotion of the middle class, which is the core of âurban citizenshipâ. It brings the issue of fragmentation of the space of civil society as a relevant topic for further research. Important question is the one of capacities and inequalities. What are the differences in possibilities of organisations with developed social connections and social capital derived from their middle class status as opposed to the organisations founded by lower class citizens? Also, what are the differences between urban and rural based organisation? The case made impact on the local and national welfare systems in terms of policy making process and governance producing new welfare culture in this field. Besides such promising development of the analysed social innovation in the space of civil society, the social welfare system, which is in the hands of government and the city, has still not become the space of viable social innovations. Overregulation and paternalistic style of government, where the authorities own public policy, remains the major obstacle for developing social innovations (BeÅ¾ovan et al. 2013). Some earlier research (BeÅ¾ovan 2010) identifies the problems of a lack of coordination and poor cooperation between different local stakeholders.

247,249,0.367,Humanities World Report 2015,"addressing profound current societal challenges and applauds the mainstreaming of the humanities across all six priorities of Horizon 2020: European Social Sciences and Humanities are world class, especially considering their diversity. They are indispensable in generating knowledge about the dynamic changes in human values, identities and citizenship that transform our societies. They are engaged in research, design and transfer of practical solutions for a better and sustainable functioning of democracy. Their integration into Horizon 2020 offers a unique opportunity to broaden our understanding of innovation, realigning science with ongoing changes in the ways in which society operates. Furthermore, the Vilnius declaration supports assessment of impact as one of the basic quality criteria of good science, although it is not made perfectly clear whether such assessment is to be one of the criteria for the allocation of research resources, or if it is a post festum measure to find out if research results are disseminated and implemented.44 So, looking at policy developments in the EU and comparing them to the US, we might find some cause for optimism, even a model for other regions to follow. But, as we saw above, these same developments have their critics. As the authors of this report, where do we stand? The more positive view â in favour of greater engagement between humanists and policy makers â fits well with some of our findings in Chapter 2, where over half of our interviewees identified âsocial valueâ as the most important extrinsic justification for the humanities, defined as a broad concept ranging from moral values to informing social decisionmaking and contributing to or contesting social cohesion. Another very frequently stressed value was âcultural heritageâ, implying the preservation and critical evaluation of material as well as immaterial leftovers of the past. We also saw in Chapter 3 that much humanities research genuinely engages with the social in terms of the themes selected for study. But there are at least two problems with which we should close. First, in this chapter we have also seen that some policy makers take a much narrower view of the contribution (if any) that the humanities have to make, particularly in promoting economic growth and innovation. The problem is that, as we saw in cChapter 2, our interviewees rarely identified such values and showed very little appetite for seeing them as a goal for humanities research. So, whenever the more narrow-minded policy makers have the upper hand, there will be a serious rift with the humanists. Second, even when policy makers take the broader view and stress"

In other words, the prevalent development model promotes the integration of remote communities into the market economy through industrial development approaches based on the use of fossil fuels, either directly (through the industrialisation of agricultural production) or indirectly (through specialised machinery). This appears to be the only means of escaping poverty.2 The ecological crisis of our current times cannot be understated. The crisis is global: 60 % of our ecosystems have been degraded (MEA 2005; Steffen et al. 2004), and in many respects, we have exceeded the safe operating space of the planet. The distortion of the nitrogen cycle is primarily attributed to industrial agriculture and the use of fertilisers (RockstrÃ¶m et al. 2009). As we head towards the erosion of our own natural resource base on a global level, these current development trends run counter to the increasingly accepted notion of sustainable development. A more sustainable global future therefore requires a broader search for pathways where short- and long-term benefits for people come at the lowest possible environmental cost and the lowest possible burden and stress on individuals in terms of working time (Haberl et al. 2004, 2011). Guided by this focus on sustainable development, our primary aim is to gain a better understanding of these transition processes âat the peripheryâ along with the transformative potential and impacts that are generated at the society-nature interface thereof. The conceptual framework of sociometabolic transitions (Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007) is an attempt in this direction. In this context, local rural subsistence communities have been empirically investigated to understand the systemic interrelations between food production systems and the resulting environmental pressures. Comparing and contrasting these cases in terms of their demographic, sociometabolic, and agro-ecological profiles has aided the modelling of development trajectories for larger regions. A variable that is often left out from such analysis is âtime useâ and its link to sociometabolic transitions. While we have previously illustrated our findings on the environmental pressures triggered by the specific material, energy and land use activities in the different communities (see Fischer-Kowalski et al. 2011), the focus of this chapter is the social pressure on individuals in terms of working time and how the burden of labour changes with agricultural development. To this end, we revisit Boserupâs (1965, 1981) theory of agricultural change in subsistence systems and, in particular, her hypothesis on increasing area productivity at the expense of labour productivity as a consequence of technological intensification in traditional farming systems. Boserupâs theory provides a framework for comparing the burden of labour among four contemporary subsistence communities in the global south that are in different stages of agricultural development. We will first provide a brief overview of Boserupâs hypothesis, followed by our sociometabolic concept of human time as a (limited) biophysical resource. What follows is a brief description of the four case studies and methods used for data collection. We then present the main findings and conclude with a brief reassessment of our hypothesis."

They have turned to social entrepreneurs to alter patterns of demand and supply in labour markets. The hope is to improve labour supply by funding and promoting social enterprises engaged in training and retraining the hard-to-employ, those excluded from the labour market or those without the necessary skills. Social policy communities have also sought to increase demand for workers by supporting the creation of many types of social enterprises that provide, often in the welfare and environmental sectors, for needs that go unmet or services that are not equally accessible when only commercial firms are active in their provision. They have also turned to social entrepreneurs to provide the key services identified by the social investment perspective for modern social policy. These are not only employment services but also childcare that serves the double function of enabling parental labour market participation and, even more importantly from this perspective, adequate investments in human capital from the pre-school years onwards via accessible and high-quality early education and care. Social innovations, especially social entrepreneurship and quasimarkets, are now and increasingly presented as positive ways to do social interventions, avoiding the limits of both âbig businessâ driven by profitseeking and âbig governmentâ driven by the practices and controls of Weberian-style public administrations. Thus, as the claims increasingly go, effective social investments will be more likely, at least to be identified and first implemented, if they are left to these market-making and market-modelled innovators. A range of mechanisms and policy instruments have been deployed across different jurisdictions, but many share the characteristic that they allow the market corner of the welfare diamond to expand by becoming more active in the provision of services. One key way that this move has been undertaken â usually at the local level â is by providing public funds for provision of what might have been or used to be public services. Thus, community-based social entrepreneurs have increasingly provided employment integration services or immigration integration services which in the past â if provided â were usually public. Similarly, as childcare services have increased significantly in number and the amount of public spending on them has risen concomitantly, the dominant position of public provision has given way to a multitude of market-based actors often operating as social enterprises in many countries. Such changes constitute significant change in the relations between state and civil society and within civil society itself."
232,347,0.366,Resilience: A New Paradigm of Nuclear Safety: From Accident Mitigation to Resilient Society Facing Extreme Situations,"well as collective representations and narratives about a societyâs past, present, and futureâhas become a common analytical tool in such ï¬elds as anthropology and sociology. Two recent insights regarding collective imaginaries are of particular relevance in thinking about the Fukushima disaster and its aftermath. First, social imaginaries are consequential for a groupâs social resilience. Reviewing empirical works (including their own) on groups facing various adversities (e.g., poverty, health disparities, discrimination, marginalization), Hall and Lamont [11, 12] argue that social imaginaries are constitutive of the collective capabilities of a community or society, as they not only bind its members with narratives of its past accomplishments and a vision of what it means to belong to it, but also indicate how its members understand what they are capable of doing together. Deï¬ning social resilience as âthe capacity of groups of people bound together in organizations, classes, racial groups, communities, or nations to sustain and advance their well-being in the face of challengesâ [11], they argue that imaginaries can provide signiï¬cant resources for such a capacity. For instance, social recognition and status of a groupâi.e., where it stands in collective imaginariesâshape capabilities of its members by influencing how they can secure support from others, as well as how they perceive their own efï¬cacy [11]. Put another way, how collective imaginaries specify and support group identities and deï¬ne who qualify as valued members of the collectivity can be direct sources of resilience for group members [12]. Conversely, when these imaginaries stigmatize a group, they constrain capabilities of its members. At the same time, groups might turn to collective imaginaries for tool to cope with difï¬culties: In coping with discrimination, members of marginalized groups in the United States often rely on such cultural resources as principles of equality as a key American creed (e.g., [26]), whereas a strong group identity has been found to alleviate the impact of adverse experiences. In sum, imaginaries serve as important resourcesâor constraintsâfor social resilience, independently of and consequentially for a groupâs access to material resources. Second, imaginaries play a signiï¬cant role in the way a society addresses science and technology. Jasanoff ([17]; also see Jasanoff and Kim [18]) argues that visions of future developments in science and technology are inevitably and intricately connected to collective visions of good and attainable futures, positing a concept of âsociotechnical imaginaries.â Deï¬ned as âcollectively held, institutionally stabilized, and publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technologyâ [17], this concept allows us to explore and better understand the complex interplay between developments in science, technology, and society. For instance, examining the development and regulation of nuclear power in the United States and South Korea, Jasanoff and Kim [18] identify different ways in which nationhood and nuclear power have been imagined together in the two countries, as well as how such different imaginaries illuminate their different responses to nuclear disasters and the spread of"

We should âbe much more direct about what it is that [we] mean to sayâ. Neuroscientists and experimentalists would, in fact, warm to âa list of facts or statements separated by periods with the occasional transition term to hold it all togetherâ; at the moment, it was hard to â[extract] the message out of what seemed like an artistically-written piece that made use of many unconventional phrases and secondary definitions of otherwise common wordsâ. The second reviewer came from quite a different angle â arguing that there was âsomething peculiarly paradoxical in [the paperâs] very conceptâ. We, the authors, were trying to set ourselves up as âexperimentally, experientially, and intellectually outside of the âblack boxâ â, but in actual fact, we were held captive by âthe tools of cognitive neuroscience, i.e., on a scientific apparatusâ. No matter the âdepth and authenticity of the joint collaborative exerciseâ for which we were advocating, we were pinioned by the inescapability and irreducibility of the scientific laboratory. For this reviewer, the point of âthis âfourth wayâ of neuro-engagementâ was far from clear. For the scientist, the rhetorical style in which the âartistically-writtenâ paper was written obviated the chance that its arguments would be received by those coming from different, scientific, traditions of research writing. For the second reviewer, whom we assume to be a social scientist or humanities scholar, it conceded far too much to the sciences. This is a fairly consistent refrain. And yet, in general the two of us, as well as many of our collaborators, have been quite successful at publishing significantly interdisciplinary papers in relatively high impact journals â a success that we attribute at least in part to such papers having a certain currency among editorial board members at some journals. We do not want to prejudge whether this enthusiasm is necessarily shared by the editorial board members of many mainstream neuroscience journals. And for the collaborating neuroscientist, being published in a high impact social science journal, which may have both a relatively long time from submission to date of publication, and a relatively low âimpact factorâ compared to even mid-ranking journals in some biological and medical fields, might represent poor return for her labour. (Letâs note at this point that while the 2014 impact factor of the leading journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience was 31.427, that of Social Science & Medicine (a very highly regarded social science journal) was 2.890.)

Supranational organizations, such as the World Bank, may also exert their influence on educational systems, particularly in developing countries. But is education around the world really becoming increasingly similar? Does evidence exist to support the notion that the curricula developed by ministries of education and educational practice in schools are increasingly conforming to a set of âinternational standardsâ and, if so, is it possible to identify these benchmarks? Where research studies on the globalization of curricula do exist, they have tended to focus on mathematics curricula as opposed to science curricula (Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2009; Zanini and Benton 2015). Science education is an important subject to investigate from a global curriculum perspective because science has always been an international discipline, with important discoveries and advances being made all over the world, but with the need for a central body of understanding for these to be interpreted and presented as a school curriculum. Therefore, internationalized thinking has long been an influence on the development of science curricula, arguably more so than in subjects such as literature or history, which are more likely influenced by national cultural and historical perspectives. Many of the topics taught as science in schools are directly influenced by global factors, such as human health and disease, environmental impacts including climate change, and the future of food and energy supplies. It can also be argued that scientiï¬c development is the predominant driver of economic growth and quality of life. Consequently, understanding how science is intended to be taught provides insight into how future citizens are taught about the nature and role of scientiï¬c advances. The IEAâs Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has collected extensive data on intended mathematics and science curricula of participating countries since the 1990s (Mullis et al. 2016). While the intended curriculum is not necessarily what was implemented or achieved, it nonetheless has a strong influence on the implemented and achieved curricula of an education system. Twenty years of collected data provides a valuable opportunity to directly explore the effects of globalization on countriesâ science curricula over time. Given the global nature of science and science curricula, this study aimed to address three central research questions: Have there been changes in intended science curricula over the last 20 years? To answer this question, we conducted a coding exercise in which changes in the intended science curriculum of countries participating in TIMSS were tracked using responses to the TIMSS curriculum questionnaire. This not only enabled the identiï¬cation of changes in the curriculum but also enabled the nature of changes to"
72,192,0.365,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Introduction Informal settlements, such as favelas (slums), are complex social ecosystems, characterised by their lack of basic services and by their particular social ties. Favelas in Rio de Janeiro are undergoing rapid changes, and new organisations and relationships are beginning to appear. This is largely as a result of the Rio de Janeiro governmentâs policy of âpacificationâ â a strategy to occupy the favelas formerly controlled by drug dealers, aimed at extending citizensâ rights (and duties) in these areas (Fleury, 2012). This chapter discusses these transformations, considering in particular if and how new services are emerging. This discussion is based on one significant case study â Light Recicla. Light Recicla, in Favela Santa Marta, Rio de Janeiro, is a service operated by the cityâs energy company that seeks to reduce the electricity bills of local residents by exchanging recyclable materials for energy credits, helping them to adjust to the new reality brought by pacification. Under the framework of the pacification strategy, commercial companies and favela residents are establishing new relationships. Light Recicla aims to define a new mode of collaboration between the energy company, Light, and its customers that addresses this new set of social relations. Lightâs initiative is considered in this chapter as an example that highlights specific issues related to social innovation, particularly in terms of new social relations. The focus here is on social innovation âas new ideas (products, services and models) that simultaneously meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborationsâ (Murray et al., 2010, p. 3). In the context of the emergence of new market-based relations within the pacification process, the Light"
128,160,0.364,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"which are relevant for research on solidarity. We label the first one as a thesis about the consequences of the level of social capital. According to this argument, the more dense and diverse the social networks of an individual are, as well as the more trusting a person is, the more prone he or she is to get involved in cooperative behavior (Coleman 1988) andâconsequentlyâin solidarity action. The second stance may be labeled as a thesis on the consequences of the type of social capital. It assumes that the type of structural and normative elements of social capital affects individualâs propensity to engage in solidarity action. Two types of social capital are differentiated in this context. The so-called bonding or thick social capital is based on relatively homogenous relations with family and friends. It entails strong norms of mutual support and thus might be exclusive. It is claimed that, for example, closed self-help groups may be based on this type of social capital and due to the effects of this form of social capital is named by some authors an âinwardlookingâ social capital. Extreme form of this asset is close to traditional familialism (Banfield 1967; Portes 1998). On the other hand, the so-called bridging social capital, based on horizontal, crosscutting social networks and values of openness and generalized trust, positively contributes to social cooperation and public good at a systemic level (Putnam et al. 1994; Granovetter 1973). When explaining causal mechanism which constitutes relation between social capital and solidarity action, a more general framework of its role in shaping political participation may be referred to. Following van Stekelenburg and Klandermans (2013), three mechanisms arising from diverse components of social capital may be pointed to in this regard. Firstly, the structural element of social capital refers to whom people can reach in actions of political participation. For example, engaging time to support the rights of refugees living in the camp in oneâs country may result from personal networks to volunteers already engaged in helping this group. Secondly, the relational component of social capital refers to informational, physical and emotional incentives toward solidarity action. Thus, the bigger and more diverse oneâs personal network is, the more information one has about, for example, significant adversity that other people are experiencing, methods of action to engage in help, possibilities to pool resources for action. Finally, the cognitive element encompasses shared representations, interpretations, systems of meaningâit may lead to consciousness raising or shaping oneâs political beliefs. This aspect of social embeddedness contributes to individualsâ beliefs about whose and which"

Changes in Patterns of Work (or workplace innovation): Holt (1971) focused on social innovation within organisations, conceived of as new social patterns of employee interaction. This work was echoed in the activities of the Netherlands Centre for Social Innovation 30 years later (see Pot and Vaas, 2008). 4. Diffusion of Social Change: From within sociology, there are analyses of the micro-level structures of innovation and diffusion that affect society â for example, how medical innovations spread across groups of clinicians â that have been classed as social innovation. Henderson (1993) was interested in the relationship between social innovation and political change in terms of diffusion processes. He explored how citizen movements catalyse social innovation â conceptualised as distinct from dominant cultural norms â from fluid positions outside of conventional societal structures. 5. Urban Studies: There is a significant cluster of work within urban studies exploring innovative responses to social exclusion as social innovation under the heading of Integrated Area Development. Much of this work centres on innovation within social relations in urban contexts, and as a body of work, it explores the potential of public, private and civil society models, interventions and interactions.

175,1046,0.363,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","Social performance criteria are often not easily deï¬ned as direct functions of hydrological attributes. Most social objectives are only indirectly related to hydrological attributes or other measures of water resource system performance. Economic, environmental, and ecological impacts resulting from water management policies directly affect people. One social performance criterion that has been considered in some water resources development projects, especially in developing regions, has been employment. Where employment is considered important, alternatives that provide more jobs may be preferred to those that use more heavy machinery in place of labor, for example. Another social performance criterion is human settlement displacement. The number of families that must move from their homes because of, for example, flood plain restoration or reservoir construction, is always of concern. These impacts can be expressed as a function of the extent of flood plain restoration or reservoir storage capacity, respectively. Often the people most affected are in the lower-income groups, and this raises legitimate issues of social justice and equity. Human resettlement impacts have both social and economic dimensions.

72,186,0.361,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"bridging the gap between welfare politics and social innovation, four points are of particular importance. First of all, it should be taken into account that many social policy textbooks have a narrow focus on just state policies, debates and decisions on reforms within state institutions, whereby societal actors are brought in through their role within social movements and pressure groups that try to influence the nature of state decisions on welfare â in other words by protest, negotiation and deliberation. However, when it comes to welfare provision (i.e., socio-economic contributions), organised societal actors often get little attention in mainstream textbooks. It is usual to find the state, the market and the family cited as the three pillars of welfare provision (e.g., Esping-Andersen, 2002). Civil society and the third sector, which contribute to new and innovative welfare arrangements not only through participation in the decision-making process but also by creating and preserving all kind of social services, are typically not mentioned. There is, therefore, a need to learn more about the history of welfare as a history of social innovations â a feature of a civil society. There has always been an important role for many social movements and organisations in inventing and creating welfare arrangements of their own â mutual organisations in the field of social security, co-operatives as early social enterprises and voluntary associations that have run all kind of services. This rich history of a social economy of invention, innovation and creation throughout Europe (Evers and Laville, 2004) was not simply a forerunner of the âreal thingâ in the form of state-based social security and service system; rather, it entailed a voluntary, not-for-profit and community sector that has, right up until the present day, included an important role for social innovation. Therefore, when discussing potential links between social innovation and welfare, welfare systems and welfare mixes (Evers and Wintersberger, 1990; Evers and Guillemard, 2012; Jenson, 2012 and in this volume) that encompass this third sector should be seen as the framework of reference and not just state action alone. Second, strategies that want to give more space for social innovation have to rethink the balance between equality and diversity. In various ways, historical welfare policies have sought to ensure greater equality in society. It is generally agreed that all people should have access to the same institutions and facilities, whether in health, social support services or education. Standards should be guaranteed in both urban and rural areas, and the same quality and procedural standards should ensure that this is always the case. This idea of equal provision was primarily linked with hierarchical systems of decision-making and administration."
347,33,0.361,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The interactions between the primarily science-based assessment sphere (i.e. generation of knowledge on environmental status, pressures, risks and problems) and the management sphere (i.e. decisions on and implementation of actions) have been described as key processes in environmental governance (Renn et al. 2011; Rice 2005). Science has since long been seen as the primary provider of knowledge and advice to guide environmental policy-making, especially in the case of managing environmental risks stemming from industrial technologies and pollutants (Karlsson et al. 2011). This has also been the case in the Baltic Sea region, both nationally and in relation to the activities of international organisations such as HELCOM and ICES (Udovyk and Gilek 2013). However, interactions over science-policy interfaces (e.g. connected with the evaluation of what constitutes good environmental status and unacceptable levels of risk) are usually complicated by severe challenges connected with complexity, ignorance, uncertainty and ambiguity (Renn 2008; Stirling 2007), which frequently result in controversy in both society and science on appropriate risk assessment and management. It has been argued that scientific uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements and conflicts are particularly problematic for marine environmental governance when implementing holistic management approaches such as EAM and MSP (Linke et al. 2014; Rice 2005; Wilson 2009). Observations of impaired public trust in science and recognition of other legitimate knowledge providers, such as practitioners, stakeholders and experts based elsewhere than in traditional research organisations, have also been linked to cases of severe scientific uncertainty (Irwin and Michael 2003), in combination with a common politicisation of science (e.g. Eriksson et al. 2010; Weingart 1999). In response, Stirling (2007)2 has argued that different types of environmental issues characterised by uncertainty and ambiguity require an expansion of traditional strategies in science and policy, to include precautionary and participative approaches. As a consequence, the relationship between science and policy is changing on both a theoretical and practical level, particularly with regard to complex environmental issues such as marine governance. It is, however, despite a long and Stirling (2007) differentiates between four types of scientific incertitude: risk (quantitative data and knowledge exist), uncertainty (qualitative understanding of outcome, but not probabilities), ambiguity (poor knowledge about potential outcome) and ignorance; see Linke et al. (2016) for further explanation."

113,218,0.359,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"WHAT MAKES A WITCH A WITCH AND A SORCERER A SORCERER? It should be noted that even within Melanesia, as well as in comparative African contexts, the distinction between what I here describe as sorcery and witchcraft are not so distinct. Indeed, in some cases, these terms seem to be used interchangeably, as they do not seem to fit the âclassicâ definitions. However, as mentioned at the outset of this paper, in the Trobriands case there is surprising accordance with Evans-Pritchardsâ descriptions, according to the ways in which my interlocutors described each of these forms of malevolent power. In both the comparative literature I cite here, and in the other contributions to this volume, it is important to distinguish just what is meant by the selection of and use of one or the other of these terms. Stephen (1987) attempts also to distinguish witches from sorcerers, based on a variety of ethnographic examples from various societies in PNG. She shows a great diversity in manifestations of both sorcery and witchcraft, again demonstrating that the insider/outsider binary is insufficient to capture the complexity of ethnographic reality. She rather asserts that the key difference between the two is in the social roles their practitioners hold: sorcerers use destructive mystical power to gain social influence, while witches are outcasts whose actions lead to social ruin (Stephen 1987: 288). However, she acknowledges that the southern Massim, including the Trobriand Islands and Dobu, are exceptions to her argument, thereby leading her to suggest that Trobriand witches are better described as female sorcerers (1987: 286). While this certainly helps to make her distinctions more applicable, there are difficulties with her argument. She suggests that: Melanesian societies usually draw sharp distinctions between male and female roles and spheres of action; it is thus only to be expected that female sorcery will differ from male sorcery. Given the general association in Melanesia of masculinity with order and control, it is appropriate that female sorcery should be less deliberate and less fully controlled than male"

These should be designed to learn from social competences, accumulated through the change makers that have invented and carried them through (Then and Mildenberger 2014). In the debates on the persistence of hierarchy (Lynn 2011) and new forms of governance that are sensible for this challenge, some have labelled such an approach âdemocratic experimentalismâ (Sabel 2012). Nudging change and preparing reform in this manner should be higher on the policy agenda. These critical remarks point towards the conclusions of the second part of this chapter, which discussed how social innovations change once they become part of a local welfare system and spread from one place to another. Specifically, it focused on how diffusion of social innovations in local welfare is qualitatively distinct from the diffusion of other types of innovations. Typical of social innovations is their strong link to specific contexts. Exactly because they evolve within social relationships and rely upon the collaboration of various different actors, they are relatively hard to transplant from one context to another. Furthermore, those who invented a new local social innovation are often not primarily interested in diffusion since they were originally motivated to solve a local problem. This is a fundamental difference with innovations in a business context because there the objective is to spread products as far and wide as possible. The process of winning importance also appears to be different from the marketing of innovative products and purposeful mainstreaming by policymakers and administrators. Theoretically, one would expect the bottleneck in social innovation in a complex field such as welfare to be flaws in adaptation processes, but this does not appear to be the case in practice (as compared, for instance, to the diffusion of governmental innovations). One possible explanation is that social innovations tend to have a strong bottom-up element that allows them to evolve organically, with large contributions from local people and voluntary organisations. This is part of a transformative process prior to the adoption of an innovation that changes local social relations, for instance, by giving the voluntary sector a greater role in shaping local services. The actual innovation is just the final stage of this process and not necessarily the most important part of it. The findings point towards a bias in the research on diffusion. It tends to emphasise the adoption of an innovation, failing to cover the process of transformation in social relations that occur ahead of adoption. By implication, it overstates the role of organisations involved in the direct transfer of innovations (particularly professional networks) and underestimates the role of actors involved in the wider process of local transformation, including citizens and voluntary organisations. Arguably, the cumulative effect of small initiatives is of far greater importance to society than the few examples that achieve wider and more visible impact. In any case, research on social innovation should not restrict its focus on success (in the sense of being taken up and mainstreamed). Where social innovations survive in more difficult environments, their impact on mainstream welfare is more indirectâ as one element in a cultural turn that may be quietly successful in the long run, even if many innovations fail at the first attempt."

Second, scholars have tended to privilege the charitable dimension of solidarity by focusing on the (financial) help to the needy. While this aspect is significant, it does not consider the political dimension of solidarity. In fact, people reveal solidarity with other needy persons when participating in collective actions (e.g. political protests, public claims making, lobbying, communication campaigns) that aims to improve the situation of these groups by mobilising public support, lobbying stakeholders, and/or changing public policies on their behalf (Giugni and Passy 2001). Finally, previous studies are an important source of inspiration in order to identify factors that can influence solidarity practices. First, scholars have highlighted the importance of socio-demographic factors and social traits (e.g. age, gender, education, social class) for grasping the conditions, structures, and dynamics of solidarity (Hechter 1988). Some studies (Neill and Gidengil 2006; Valentova 2016) have shown that voluntary engagement tends to replicate the public/private divide by focusing especially on male-dominated and âpublicâ activities. It has been revealed that younger and older citizens are more active in social movements, because of different levels of âbiographical availabilityâ in the life course (Beyerlein and Bergstrand 2013). Furthermore, different levels of commitment in solidarity actions can be patterned by citizensâ differentiation in terms of personal resources and skills, such as income and education, by the respondentsâ social status and affiliation to social class (Verba et al. 1978; Cainzos and Voces 2010). Second, education and subjective class position are also a measure of social centrality, usually linked to social capital, and previous research has shown that social capital measures are particularly important for our topic (Putnam et al. 2003; Jenkins 1983; Bourdieu 1986). In particular, we wish to highlight the role of interpersonal trust, informal networks, and social relations. The assumption is that social capital is the necessary âglueâ of social cohesion (Chan et al. 2006; Jeannotte 2000; Delhey 2007), and it is tightly associated with values such as trust in others and with frequency of social connections. Several studies have shown that trust in others is associated with a wide range of positive outcomes in areas such as personal wellbeing (Helliwell and Wang 2010), crime rates, and even mortality rates (Lochner et al. 2003). Also, social trust can determine how much people in a society are willing to cooperate with one another, thus fostering solidarity actions. Similarly, having a good frequency of social"

They provide rigorously oriented computer scientists with wings of imagination, allowing overlap of their technical / scientific disciplines with the humanities and behavioral sciences. In Slovakia, these two study branches have already their study programs: Artificial intelligence at the Faculty of electrical engineering and informatics, Technical university of KoÅ¡ice, and Cognitive science at the Comenius University in Bratislava. For more than ten years, the Czecho-Slovak conference Cognition and Artificial Life brings together experts from different fields of science (computer scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, psychologists, doctors, ...), who are unified by their interest in learning about the cognitive processes ongoing in the human brain and the modern simulation methods of artificial intelligence: neural networks, evolutionary algorithms and multi-agent systems. The series Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science aims to present the results of this community, achieved in artificial intelligence and cognitive science, in order to help undergraduate students in particular, but also more advanced students. The contents of the book Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science IV shows that these sciences have found a base both in philosophy, social science, as well as in natural sciences, and computer science oriented researchers in the areas of philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, and artificial life.

In coming to understand their project, the authors set themselves against a recent, high-profile account of collaboration (between natural scientists and social scientists) gone wrong, by Paul Rabinow and Gaymon Bennett (Rabinow and Bennett 2012). Whereas Rabinow and Bennett had argued for rather more frank speaking in highly-charged interdisciplinary spaces, DF and his colleagues suggested, in deliberate contrast, that: [our] success might have come precisely because we did not speak frankly; we did not seek the truth; we totally failed to acknowledge â let alone discuss â the consequences of our experimental situation. What we did, instead, was to try to work and live within a zone that was just about ambiguous enough to keep everything together â that was sufficiently averse to frank-speaking to keep the worst of the resentments at bay.

192,94,0.358,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"it is actually a play about science, first and foremost about astronomy (cf. Olson and Olson 1998). More precisely, the play stages a collision between scholarship and politics, as well as between the discourse of the Master and university discourse. This schema will be further elucidated with the help of a second literary case study namely Carmen, published in 1845, a novel about an archaeologist who travels to Andalusia, but deflects from his research because of an encounter with a different kind of object a (namely the gaze and voice of a living being, instead of an archaeological find: a â a), so that his scholarly research becomes transformed into an âarchaeology of the presentâ (i.e. psychoanalytical discourse). The final two literary documents to be discussed in this chapter date from the late nineteenth century and are written by two contemporaries, namely Henrik Ibsen (1828â1906) and Jules Verne (1828â1905). Henrik Ibsen is generally regarded as one of the greatest psychologists of world literature and as a precursor of psychoanalysis. His oeuvre represents a literary psychoanalytical clinic avant la lettre. Indeed, as Lacan phrases it, Freudâs oeuvre, focussing on human desire and gender relationships, emerges in âle contexte ibsÃ©nien de la fin du XIXe siÃ¨cleâ (Lacan 1986, p. 18). But Ibsenâs plays also analyse how science and technology transform the world of fin-de-siÃ¨cle culture. In other words, whereas most Ibsen scholars use his dramas to study issues in the realm of psychology and gender, I see his prose plays as literary laboratories, so that Ghosts explores end-of-life decisions and genetics (Zwart 1993), while The Wild Duck studies the emergence of photography and animal research (Zwart 2000b) and The Lady from the Sea reflects the impact of cruise steamers on art and tourism (Zwart 2015c). Enemy of the People (1882/1978), the play that will be discussed in this chapter, raises the question how researchers may safeguard their integrity while navigating a complicated societal landscape. The title already refers to the question whether scientists are benefactors or enemies of the people, or both. To explain Verneâs role in this book, some misunderstandings regarding his work must be addressed. First of all, although Jules Verne is often regarded as the âfather of science fictionâ, most of his novels (rather than anticipating the future) actually address scientific and technological developments of his own era, so that his novels contribute to a diagnostics of the present. And indeed, in his immense oeuvre (encompassing ninety novels) a panoramic encyclopaedia of research fields and research technologies is fleshed out (Zwart 2008a, p. 233 ff.). Moreover, Verne sees technologies not only as products of science (which are subsequently transferred into the societal realm), but first and foremost as enablers of research. Nemoâs submarine and the capsule that is designed to travel to the moon, to mention just two examples, are basically mobile laboratories, which allow researchers to conduct their experiments while moving towards the things themselves (Zu den Sachen selbst), allowing them to attain unprecedented proximity. In other words, what Verne reveals in his novels is the technicity of science, emphasising the crucial role of instruments and machinery. He describes how new research practices are opened up by new contrivances. Indeed, most of the machinery described in his novels is used for scientific exploration and experimentation. Also, Verne is often mistaken for an unequivocal advocate of science whereas in fact his attitude towards science"

Who the entrepreneur knows, therefore, becomes important for his or her ability to find suitable support to develop and grow a social enterprise. Networks, in other words, are central. In a country such as India, with multiple hierarchies, vast geographies and a large number of communities and religions, who you know and where you belong has historically been important. Today, while not as important as it has been, much of the activity in the economy still relies on trust, especially in the informal sector (Harris, 2002). Networks, and social ties, therefore, are particularly important not only to access new knowledge and financial and non-financial support but also because of the social capital that can be built. This chapter1 sets out to look at two interrelated areas: the role of networks for individual (social) entrepreneurs and the impact of these individual networks on social innovation at the system level. It does so by providing case studies of three social entrepreneurs and their organisations: Amit of Rose Computer Academy, Naveen of SMV Wheels and Vijaya of Under the Mango Tree. The case studies detail the kind of stakeholders on whom the three social entrepreneurs rely within their networks, as well as how those networks have evolved over time."

Individual experience is always unique, but shared or similar life conditions may produce social patterns in feelings across the individual singularity: we often understand the feelings of our contemporaries much better than the feelings of those who belong to our parentsâ or our childrenâs generation, and we recognise more immediately the feelings of those who belong to our own social groups than of those who do not. Different patterns of feelings reflect relational experiences and opportunities characteristic of the time and place of living. Hence, feelings are no less social than cultural meanings or social structures, but they represent the social in another form. Stephen Frosh says that people âexpress in their feelings the dynamics of the social order itselfâ (Frosh 2011: 9). This includes, I would add, the dynamics of change of this social order. My concern in this book is that the social transformation of gender also involves the work of feelings. Gender attains emotional meaning through the life course and in the transmission between generations at a particular time. I want to explore the link between generational transition and the negotiations and calibrations between women and men belonging to the same generation. To understand this dimension of social change, we must look into subtle and gradual historical processes working on the level of gender identities and gendered subjectivities, including motivations/capacities for autonomy in women and emotional intimacy in men, which may have provided a psychological readiness for structural and cultural changes and political interventions. The empirical basis for the analysis is a longitudinal research project that explores the feelings of gender across three generations of a sample of white, heterosexual women and men of different class backgrounds as they moved from childhood and youth to adult life, and what impact these feelings had on changing gender practices. New life projects gradually came into being, not only as outcomes of externally imposed norms, but also as the work of subjective feelings of gender. The personal and the social are often thought of as complementary, mirroring the academic disciplines of psychology and sociology, as if individuals could exist without a society or a society could emerge without"

This research would most certainly not be picked up in a systematic review. We have called this group of theories the âcapability approachâ (CA). Once again, this literature uses complex concepts and language, potentially limiting accessibility and opportunities for holistic multi-disciplinary thinking. Barbardâs paper addresses âcapabilitiesâ from the perspective of the development of the European Union and its associated legal institutions. It is concerned primarily with the conditions necessary for the realisation of the European Councilâs strategic goal of becoming âthe most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesionâ (2001: 464). At ï¬rst sight we may dismiss this work as somewhat peripheral to our concerns (with professional voluntarism and health systems in lowresource settings). The language used is more up-beat; less about âproblemsâ and more about knowledge for foresight and innovation. However, the immediate link with âinvesting in people and combating social exclusionâ lies at its heart. What initially interested us was the quite different approach to the concept of capabilities. Here they are not reduced to intrinsic or raw attributes of individuals but linked to concepts of agency and âproactive securityâ (2001: 467). Barbard ï¬rst critiques neoclassical economic theories which conceptualise what they call âindividual self-sufï¬ciencyâ as a function of individual endowments, âconsisting of genetically-inherited capacities for work, and the ï¬nancial and other resources made available to themâ (2001: 465).

The term âsocial economyâ was not widely recognized in the UK until the 1990s (Amin et al. 2002) and is not widely used. In recent years, a robust âsocial enterpriseâ sub-sector has emerged, consisting of entities that use market-type activities to serve social purposes, but these take a variety of legal forms. In short, there is no commonly accepted concept of a third sector in the UK, and the plethora of terms and concepts in use raises questions about whether a coherent conceptualization of the third sector is possible, even in a single country, let alone across national borders. At the very least, different definitions may be appropriate for different purposes. By contrast, in France and Belgiumâas well as throughout Southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece) and in parts of Eastern Europe, the Francophone part of Canada, and throughout Latin Americaâthe concept of âsocial economyâ has gained widespread attention.5 In contrast to conceptions prevailing elsewhere in Europeâwhich underscore organizational features like charitable purpose, volunteer involvement or a nonprofit distribution constraintâthe social economy conception focuses on social features, such as the expression of social solidarity and democratic internal governance.

334,249,0.355,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"The main idea introduced in this chapter is that solidarity protests vary with regard to their ideological background and the scope of their claims. The theoretical foundation for this argument is an in-depth study of civil society protests against the deportation of rejected asylum seekers in Austria (Rosenberger and Winkler 2014). Rosenberger and Winkler observe that these protests are nearly always strongly linked to particular deportations presented by the protesters as unjust with regard to the beneficiaryâs life story. Protesters put forward the good civic and social integration and thus the âdeservingnessâ of the beneficiary to argue their âindividual right to stay [that] is presented as an exception of the general ruleâ (ibid., 180). Yet, Rosenberger and Winklerâs findings suggest that the law governing migrantsâ stay in the host country and deportations is not contested or challenged. To explain how these altruistic and case-specific protests emerge in a context described as unfavorable, the two authors emphasize emotions and social ties. Here we expand on their approach in two ways. Firstly, we argue that social ties â obviously a crucial element in the emergence and persistence of protests â need to be described in a more differentiated way. We refer to Granovetterâs (1973) distinction between âstrongâ and âweakâ ties. Strong ties refer to close and affective relationships between persons who know each other well and who frequently interact, whereas weak ties can be described as"

The Global South is both experiencing phenomenal development in some places (with the attendant environmental and social challenges) and still facing deep poverty and hunger. Some of this is, in turn, partly but never exclusively related to socio-demographic changes, including ageing societies virtually everywhere around the world, and increases in lone-parent families (ILO, 2011). Global population flows, whether from the Global South northward or within the European Union from poorer to richer member states (whether from east to west or north to south), are also creating new wealth for some and precariousness, poverty and even misery for others (Dustmann and Frattini, 2011). Historically marginalised groups facing prejudice â Aboriginal peoples in many countries and Roma almost everywhere they live â find their lives increasingly difficult (UN, 2009; European Commission, 2011a). Many of these changes can be summarised under the label of ânew social risksâ (Bonoli and Natali, 2012). The structure of these new risks challenges previous configurations of the welfare diamond and associated social policy programmes, practices and ideas about the proper and possible balance of spaces for markets, states, families and communities. In effect, the market corner of the welfare diamond is being exhorted by social policy communities to expand, by recognising the contributions of â and contributing towards â the social economy and social entrepreneurship more generally. But often practices of social innovation also include reworking both the responsibilities of the community corner of the diamond and aligning it in ground-breaking ways with respect to the market. As it does so, social innovationâs status as a quasi-concept is very clear. Numerous ways of understanding it co-exist as markets are re-imagined."

In addition, such discussion is also important when setting up objectives and targets. Goals to improve productsâ environmental and social performance will also have an effect on customersâ expectations and responses.

And indeed, these social investment interventions continued even during the first five years of the economic crisis (Kvist, 2013). However, much of this growth has been achieved via reliance on social enterprises, considered to be most innovative. The social investment perspective on modernising social policy18 diagnoses the challenges facing families with children and prescribes strategies to increase parental employment as well as to provide services focussed on the human capital of children in order to âbreak the intergenerational cycle of disadvantageâ.19 The social policy analysis underpinning the social investment perspective rests on two main themes (Esping-Andersen et al., 2002; Jenson, 2012). The first is that it is better for children that their parents are employed than that the family is workless. Following from this perspective, lone mothers and underemployed mothers are a prime target for integration into the labour force and, therefore, as clients of the work integration enterprises described above. The second theme is that the emerging knowledgebased economy requires significant investment in human capital and that this must begin with the youngest children and early childhood education. This focus is examined here. Childcare services have expanded significantly across Europe, with stable or greater public financing of childcare services between 1998 and 2009 in every European country except Luxembourg (OECD, 2014, PF3.1). Nonetheless, while spending increased or remained at least stable, many jurisdictions reduced or limited their own direct service provision and provided incentives to social enterprises to organise services. Thus, public funding has gone to non-public actors to develop services needed to implement the social investment perspective. For example, Sweden is a country often identified as an early adopter of the social investment perspective (Esping-Andersen et al., 2002). In the 1980s it began to innovate in forms of service provision in the name of âchoiceâ (Blomqvist, 2004).20 With respect to services for children, this involved reducing the dominant position of the municipal childcare centre, which had been virtually the only form of service provision used when the system expanded from the 1960s.21 In the 1980s, Sweden turned to parental and personnel cooperatives to broaden the variety of childcare (Duane-Richard and Mahon, 2001). By the 1990s, the range of providers widened again. Changes to legislation at the time meant that most municipalities would continue to provide services directly,"

First, let us consider the sentence, âThis room is filled with neuroscience playa haters.â FC believes this to be a moment of diagnosis, in which there was the identification (correct, FC believes) of some sense of grievance and envy on the part of at least some of those in the social sciences and humanities; as well as of a disparity in power between the neurosciences (strong) and those enviously attacking it (the weaker humanities and social sciences); as well as of the strangeness of running a conference about neuroscientific evidence that was filled with so many people âoutsideâ of the field and that contained so few practising neuroscientists. The sentence, on the one hand, can be interpreted as a powerful means both to gesture to a recent transformation in disciplinary hierarchies (the neurosciences were thrust into the limelight at the same time as the humanities were feeling increasingly anxious about their status) and a means to install (not wholly ironically) anyone issuing the sentence close to the heart of interdisciplinary power. But there is more going on here, too. The term âhaterâ, as it has emerged in the last couple of decades, conveys a complex mesh of affects: the âhaterâ not only is unable to be happy about the success of the person she or he is âhatingâ, but rather wants to undermine that person by attempting to expose her flaws or inadequacies. Here, then, is an acute analysis of the shape that critique of âthe neurosciencesâ, on the part of humanities and social science scholars, can sometimes take. FC remembers the atmosphere in the workshop as, indeed, at times, hostile against âneuroscienceâ â and hostile in a way that refused any real engagement with the heterogeneous methods or epistemologies of the neurosciences, and that was forcefully committed to trying to identify as many flaws in âneuroscienceâ as possible. She surmised that the use of the term âhaterâ, to describe some"

Indeed, âgood governance is crucial for researchâ¦ Absence of regulation is not beneficial for researchâ¦ Regulatory oversight adds another layer to the web of quality control in researchâ (Gottweis and Triendl 2006). In other words, in this third round of comments, the ethical infrastructure was suddenly regarded as an integral part of excellence in science: âHave your ethics in place!â In dialectical terms: on a more advanced level of comprehension, science and ethics became reconciled again. Both were acknowledged as complementary dimensions of good scientific practice (academic Sittlichkeit). Hwang still functioned as a foil, but now for highlighting the (self-perceived) ethical robustness of Western research practices. From a macro-perspective, the Hwang case must be regarded as symptomatic for a broader, even global development. Frank Miedema (2012) professor of immunology and Dean of the Medical Faculty of Utrecht University, distinguishes three stages in the recent history of science. Science 1.0 (M1, dialectically speaking) was a type of research that was autonomous and curiosity driven. Increasingly however, a different type of research seems called for (Science 2.0: M2), producing knowledge that is relevant for societal stakeholders and entailing economic value (Miedema 2012, p. 24). This implies new (post-classical) quality criteria, but also growing tensions and contradictions between the inherent dynamics of academic work and the societal and economic expectations involved. But eventually, according to the author, a situation of co-creation is evolving (â M3), in which the questions and interests of science and society become more adequately aligned and knowledge production becomes coproduction: Science 3.0 (M3) (cf. Gibbons et al. 1994; Nowotny et al. 2001; Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 2001)."

315,332,0.351,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"The advantage of having access to biographical narratives at two points in time became clear as it allows for a comparative analysis of the changes or continuity in the biographical structure and the dominant patterns of interpretation. Our specific focus on the young peopleâs social networks in the biographical interviews turned out to be another advantage, as it provided us with a rich source of diverse information about the genesis and the relevance of social networks in the transition into adulthood. And the relatively large sample for our case-reconstructive project has proved to be an excellent base for further differentiation of our findings and to identify statements extending beyond the individual case. On a final note I would like to point out that working with biographical material always encourages us to question the ideas and standards used by the publicâand often also by researchersâto assess biographies and in particular the transition into adulthood. What seems to the outside world to be an easy transition into the workplace because it happens quickly and âquietlyâ does not always prove to be the transition that is subjectively experienced as the one that is most satisfactory to a given individual and that meets his or her requirements for an independent life. And the opposite is also true. Those biographies and transitions that seem to be very difficult and plagued by personal crisis can provide a great deal of subjective satisfaction and hold potential for social innovation.

192,384,0.351,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"(Stapel 2012, p. 102). An important ingredient of theatres in general (and of the social psychology theatre in particular) is deception. Research subjects (usually psychology students) must be naÃ¯ve. As soon as subjects are aware of the (objective of) the experiment, this will affect their responses and ruin the results. Ideally, research subjects believe that they know what the research is about, but this actually proves to be an illusion, a distraction; a lure. Like Claudius in Shakespeareâs Hamlet (Act III, scene 2), they are lured into a mousetrap. According to Hamlet, mousetrap is title of the play performed by the actors in Shakespeareâs drama. While research subjects erroneously believe to know in what kind of situation they are becoming involved, they are suddenly exposed to an unexpected stimulus, while their responses are being meticulously monitored (as happened to Claudius as well, cf. Chap. 3), so that these responses may be considered as an indication of a disavowed flaw (racial prejudice). The experimental set-up of Stapelâs fictitious Science experiment at Utrecht train station is a cunning exemplification of the mousetrap theme. The respondents believe that, by filling in a questionnaire, they are participating in a survey, and that the chair is merely placed there for their convenience (filling in questionnaires while standing upright seems rather impractical). Thus, they are unaware of the fact that the row of chairs is actually a mousetrap. By keeping their distance vis-Ã -vis the black male, they betray their obfuscated prejudices. So, in other words, Stapel is social psychologyâs Hamlet, who masterfully inserts a play into a play (the row of chairs representing the mousetrap scene), while Utrecht station is the theatre of life, where a plethora of prejudices are steering our daily behaviour (in subliminal, unconscious ways). In order to come to terms with them, social psychologists must design a device that captures them. The problem is, of course, that Stapelâs âplayâ has never been performed, that his experiment has never been conducted. Like Shakespeareâs Hamlet, it is fiction. Stapel is actually a playwright and his article a form of drama, parodying the vernacular of fashionable science. The respondents (playing the role of Claudius, but in a contemporary setting) were not really put to the test. But this means, dialectically speaking, that the prejudices attributed to the research subjects (in the Science article) actually reflect the prejudices of the researchers themselves. It is the prejudice if the researchers that their research subjects will prove prejudiced (by keeping their distance to the non-Caucasian male). In other words, the prejudices and stereotypes enacted in this paper are actually the (prejudiced, stereotypical) expectations of the researcher (Stapel) himself, projected onto the research subjects. He wants and expects his research subjects to be prejudiced, to be biased, even if (all too often) this proves not to be the case, for otherwise he could simply have conducted the experiment instead of fabricating it. In Lacanian terms, the hidden prejudice, which must be there, proves so difficult to capture because it is the âobject aâ of social psychology. It is that which somehow must be brought to the fore (with the help of mousetraps), an objective which is considered so important that it even legitimises the use of deception. To paraphrase Gospodin Gregg (Chap. 4), social psychology is bent on exposing the Mr. Hyde in us, the evidence of prejudice, the object a, something which somehow remains hidden (first"

188,146,0.349,Responsive Open Learning Environments : Outcomes of Research From The Role Project,"Conclusion and Future Work Developing an evaluation framework for PLEs is challenging, since technological, organizational, psycho-pedagogical and social aspects need to be considered in an integrated manner and with a diverse set of stakeholder perspectives being taken into account. Our attempt was to propose a unified framework encompassing the main valid constructs (derived from relevant theoretical models), yet at the same time providing a flexible and adaptive methodology that is capable of accommodating the changes that are inevitable in an emerging field. In order to achieve this, we have elaborated an integrated framework that is by nature case study based and follows a multi-method approach. Furthermore, we recommended concluding the cyclic evaluation with a cross-case analysis in order to consolidate data from different contexts so as to establish a holistic view. A number of metrics and possible methods have been identified and located in the proposed unified framework. The metrics, criteria, methods, techniques, and tools proposed are subjected to further refinement and improvement. A process model ensures the possibility to do so in a well-defined manner. Obviously, more research efforts are called for to investigate the complex phenomenon of PLEâand this contribution provides the methodological basis on which such future endeavors can be built.

99,274,0.349,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"process can set a new practice into motion and address broader networks of civil society, political and administrative actors, possibly market actors as well. Are they willing to pay attention to such messages? What determines the different degrees of readiness among these actors to take up messages? And moreover, what influences the capabilities to âreadâ and the ways of interpreting them? All this may concern innovations and innovators themselves, the degree to which they actively care for broadening their action and winning support, but it mainly concerns contexts and the ability of systemsâhere welfare systemsâto adopt innovations. The second part of this chapter will reflect on these questions, focusing on the difference it makes once an innovation is non-market based and in its essence non-technical, such as social innovations, taking shape in local milieus and welfare systems. Obviously the metaphor of âmessagesâ may in many ways be insufficient and questionable. Studies of innovation usually prefer the âdiffusionâ metaphor, and we also use it in this contribution. It takes account of the fact that innovations are a kind of âmessage into the openâ, without any specific or exclusive addressee. Many effects and messages of innovations are beyond the control of the innovators. However, speaking about âmessagesâ has the advantage of including not only processes (of diffusion) but also issues related to content (new values, practices, policies). Furthermore, looking for âsendersâ and âreceiversâ allows us to study not merely systems and structures but also the actors who are responsible for dealing with a message, its contents and readings. What are the main messages we found in the approaches and instruments used in local social innovations studied as part of the WILCO project? The first part of the chapter will deal with this question. What can be said about the processes of transmitting, accepting, rejecting or reading such messages (what is mostly called the process of diffusion)?What are the challenges when it comes to linking social innovations and social policies? This will be taken up in the second part of the chapter."

347,278,0.348,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"The five cases of environmental governance studied in this project have been identified as key large-scale environmental problems and risks in the Baltic Sea (see Gilek et al. 2016; HELCOM 2010): fisheries, eutrophication, invasive alien species, chemical pollution and oil discharges linked to marine transportation. However, as revealed throughout the previous chapters, they differ substantially in terms of the complexity of risk sources, the available knowledge and the uncertainties connected to assessing environmental effects for advising decision-making, as well as with respect to the degrees of ambiguity and sociopolitical controversy involved in policy and management (Gilek et al. 2011). In this chapter, we investigate the interactions between risk assessment (science) and risk management (policy) in the five different cases. We analyse and compare these interactions using a theoretical framework on science-policy interfaces described in Sect. 8.2. Specifically, we study how organisational structures and processes of science-policy interactions adapt to key challenges of science and management in environmental governance by focusing on different forms of uncertainty, as well as on stakeholder conflicts and disagreements involved in science and/versus policy in the five cases. We also trace the respective management reactions to these challenges in each of the cases using a typology of different kinds of incomplete knowledge and their consequences for management responses as described below (Sect. 8.2.2). Through this comparative study of science-policy interfaces across the five cases, we point out institutional and procedural hindrances, challenges and prospects for improving science-policy interactions for a more effective and sustainable environmental governance of the Baltic Sea. Following the discussion on our theoretical framework, we present the results of our analysis of the five science-policy interfaces (Sect. 8.3). The two sections thereafter discuss the outcomes of the study (Sect. 8.4) and provide conclusions and recommendations (Sect. 8.5), respectively."

192,44,0.348,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Before addressing Lacanâs views on scientific integrity and research misconduct, I will first outline his views on science as such. For Lacan, science basically entails a process of symbolisation which proceeds via instruments and gadgets (1972â 1973/1975, p. 104), producing discursive âemissionsâ on a massive scale. Modern science eliminates (âdecomposesâ) the world as we know it from naÃ¯ve lifeworld experience, replacing it with a completely different kind of universe, composed of symbols (signifiers) referring to concepts (molecules, electrons, quarks, etc.) that represent enigmatic entities whose ontological status (whose materiality or realness) poses a challenge to human imagination (1972â1973/1975, p. 49). The progress of science is the progress of the symbolic order, consuming, incorporating, transforming and obliterating nature as described by Aristotle (1980), namely as ÏÏÏÎ¹Ï: that which emerges, comes forward on its own accord, having its own inherent principles of change, that which is simply there, without our doing. Nature becomes obliterated and dissolved in the course of the ongoing symbolisation or hominisation of the planet (Lacan 1953â1954/1975, p. 291). Science notably entails a symbolisation of the phenomena of life (1954â 1955/1978, p. 43). Rather than understanding life as such, the aim of science is to understand specific bio-molecular processes with the help of instruments and contrivances, such as clocks, microscopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD), etc. (1954â 1955/1978, p. 96, p. 344) resulting in symbols (letters, figures, formula, graphics, etc.) of various kinds: a form of understanding which does not allow us to see living nature as it is, but rather aims to control and manipulate biological processes. Scientific explanation depends on the use of signifiers (discursive elements which are easily modifiable, notably when sitting in front of a computer screen) which structure scientific experience (1955â1956/1981, p. 216). Thus, symbolisation is the language of precision technology and relies on technologies of knowledge Â© The Author(s) 2017 H.

309,424,0.347,Food Anxiety in Globalising Vietnam,"1. The concept of âfood social spaceâ describes the social dimensions of food. It corresponds to the area of freedom left to human eaters by two sets of physical constraints: biological constraints related to their status as omnivores, which are essential but relatively flexible, and the ecological constraints created by the biotope in which they live, which become economic constraints in the industrialised world and which progressively tend to be reduced due to our technological control of nature (Poulain 2017 [2002]). âFood social spaceâ is in line with the Maussian notion of a âtotal social factâ, that is, which âsets in motion â¦ the totality of the society and its institutionsâ (Mauss 1950). It is possible to distinguish various dimensions of social food space: the edible order, the food system, the culinary space, the consumption patterns, food temporality and the social differentiation space. Its main interests are to show the variations of the social dimensions of food between two cultures and in the frame of one culture, and to study the interaction between social and biological infrastructure of nutrition as well as the environment (for a systematic presentation see Poulain 2017 [2002])."

Obama. In fact, as change creation and wealth creation continue to fuse in the remarkable narratives of a new generation of entrepreneurs in Kenya, it has become evident that the entrepreneursâ motivation is grounded in a complex nexus of goals and values, in which financial goals are just one among many others and are quite often not the primary ones (Rindova et al. 2009; Baker and Pollock 2007; Ruef 2010). Put differently, âstudies across a number of nations have consistently shown that values such as desires for autonomy, to express creativity for its own sake, to pursue innovation, and to be oneâs own boss typically dominate financial goals in motivating entrepreneurshipâ (cited in Rindova et al. 2009, originally from Baker and Pollock 2007). As a result, entrepreneurship is not a schizophrenic endeavor divided between societal and financial goals. It is much rather in its essence both, about social change and about wealth creation. Note that the label social entrepreneurship, despite its normative push toward recognizing and making the social aspect of entrepreneurship even more prominent, is, given this understanding, ânot only unnecessary but potentially not valid, since many entrepreneurs seek to improve their economic positions through the impact of broader social changeâ (Rindova et al. 2009). As Eleanor Marchant showed in her chapter, key actors in Kenyaâs technology sector creatively combine a socialchange agenda with wealth creation to remove constraints for themselves and the wider ecosystem. It makes them pivotal actors in the scene. Against this background, I will undertake a brief synthesis of the bookâa few key takeawaysâthrough a closer look at four overarching themes that are grounded in (though they also have relevance beyond) Kenyan entrepreneuringânamely, mindset change, creation of newness, critical reflection, and location as a comparative advantage. These are of central importance, because none of the chapters or conversations could have done without at least one of them.

346,395,0.347,"History Education and Conflict Transformation : Social Psychological Theories, History Teaching and Reconciliation","SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL COGNITION AND HISTORY TEACHING A range of potentially relevant and established social psychological theories can be identified as relevant to history teaching in a divided society, including social categorisation and Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1986), stereotype threat (e.g. Steele 1997) and attribution theory (Heider 1958). Categorisation has been dubbed âthe cognitive foundation of all forms of prejudiceâ (Brown 2010, p. viii). Using an information processing analogy, one of the prime strategies used for the purpose of avoiding information overload is categorisation, which allows us to understand the environment rather more easily than if we had to evaluate each stimulus individually to identify it. Categorisation in terms of social cognition, then, is nothing more than the brain taking useful short cuts to understanding. Yet this universal cognitive process has huge implications for those teaching in subject areas such as history, because of its close associations with prejudice via stereotyping and with Social Identity Theory (Tajfel and Turner 1979), which has been widely applied to research in NI. Social Identity Theory research over the last three decades has produced evidence of potential interest to teachers of history and other disciplines where identity issues may be significant. It is now well established that individuals simultaneously hold multiple social identities, may develop new identities and can embrace superordinate identities. In NI, the possible utility of a Northern Irish superordinate identity for reducing sectarian attitudes has long been discussed (Trew 1998). Recent census data (NISRA 2011) indicate that this identification is on the increase although it must be remembered that those espousing a Northern Irish identity might still simultaneously maintain a strong affiliation to traditional British or Irish national identities. As a result of research in contested spaces, it is argued that a âhotâ rather than a banal form of national identity (Billig 1995) is actively constructed (Stevenson and Muldoon 2010) although as Skey (2009) points out these are neither fixed nor discrete, and Jones and Merriman (2009) have suggested âeveryday nationalismâ as an alternative, more dynamic term combining banal and hot elements. In such circumstances, it is clear that the same contextual information (such as historical events) may be construed by different groups (including political actors) to support"

277,8,0.346,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"In this context, the social sciences have played an important role in shaping public understanding of immigrant integration processes, and in many cases also in shaping government policies. When this started to happen and the way in which this took place, however, varies from one country to another, and from city to city. The specific role of social scientists in shaping policies also varies greatly: in some cases researchers have been quite active both in the scientific process of formulating the content of policies and in the political process of getting policies established. In other cases, social scientists have distanced themselves, or have been kept at a distance, from policymaking. Between these two positions many variations also exist. Scientists may have influenced policies, but the reverse may also be the case: policymakers may play a role in shaping the production of knowledge. Policymakers may solicit the knowledge they wish to have in many ways and with varying degrees of scientific freedom for researchers. Major differences exist between European countries in the way relations between policy and research on immigrant integration have evolved. Nowadays, however, a feature common to many European countries is that the body of scientificallybased knowledge on immigrant integration has increased substantially, while at the same time public authorities seem to have become less interested in making use of the assembled knowledge. The current relationship between migration research and policymaking seems to have led to a certain disenchantment about researchpolicy dialogues. Although the idea of âevidence-based policymakingâ has gained wide recognition discursively, strong evidence also exists that politicians and policymakers often use scientific research for symbolic rather than instrumental purposes (Boswell 2009). Clearly, in parallel with the increasing politicisation of the field, earlier optimism about the value of academic expertise in guiding rational societal steering has yielded to a growing cynicism about the validity of research and the credibility of researchers (Scholten and Verbeek 2014). At the same time, various scholars have indicated their disenchantment about the policy-driven orientation of research in this area and the lack of theoretical development in this research field (Favell 2003; Bommes and ThrÃ¤nhardt 2010). They see this as an effect of the intense contacts between researchers and policymakers that have existed in several countries. Critics have coined the term âmethodological nationalismâ to describe research fields where choice of topics, questions to be answered, conceptual and theoretical approaches, and the sources to be used largely depend on political and policy framing by national governmental actors (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002). This, in turn, has led to a call for more independent, theory-driven and (international) comparative research (Penninx et al. 2006). This book aims to develop deeper insights into how research and policymaking in the field of migrant integration have developed historically and how this interrelationship plays out in the strongly politicised climate of opinions on migration in Europe. We do this firstly by developing a conceptual frame for analysis of research-policy dialogues (in this introductory chapter). This is followed by a comparative analysis of empirical cases in the rest of the book: Part I presents comparative case studies of different forms of dialogues and their functions, while Part II systematically analyses the development of research-policy dialogues in"

166,19,0.345,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"Along the same lines, institutions other than family are also supposed to become less important, at least in their capacity to frame peopleâs life courses and impose age- (and gender-) related norms. There is a consensus that formal recognition of vulnerability is a categorization process that often has negative drawbacks in terms of loss of self-esteem for the person or group being categorized, who become exposed to social stigmatization (Ruof 2004; Thomas 2008). There is also a general agreement that individualization implies an increasing role for the state and its various welfare components, which should be important in preventing vulnerability, and are particularly important in responses to so-called âsocial risksâ, old or new, and consequently in the public management of vulnerable situations and individuals (Leisering 2003; Ranci 2010). We can cite the education system, unemployment offices, hospitals, and institutions caring for the elderly as examples considered in this volume. They all tend to be affected by the âactivationâ paradigm which is coherent with the values of individualization, and it is now recognized that like family configurations, institutions can be a source of support but also of stress (Bonvin et al. 2014). Stress is also present in the two main theoretical approaches discussed previously. Pearlin (1989) explicitly associated a lower position in the socioeconomic structure with greater exposure to stress. More recently, as we discussed briefly earlier, postmodern or post-industrial societies have also been seen as structural producers of stress through their demands for flexibility and competition (Rudisill et al. 2010) and, more generally, through the ambivalence of the ideal of self-realization (Giddens 1991), the burden of being the actor of his or her life (Ehrenberg 1998). Pressure, insecurity, chronic strain, daily hassles, incivilities are obvious sources of vulnerability when their effects accumulate over time. Their impact is maximized by contexts of discrimination, xenophobia, or other attitudes that challenge fairness. These negative associations are specifically discussed in chapter âCareer Pathways and Professional Transitions: Preliminary Results from the First Wave of a 7-Year Longitudinal Studyâ by Christian Maggiori and colleagues in the context of professional life. From a survey research perspective, the challenge for researchers interested in measuring vulnerability is to properly locate individuals in a web of social interactions that is more or less dense, with different actors that have to be identified. It is also to analyze those interactions from an individualâs subjective point of view, in terms of perceived social support or discrimination (chapters âA Survey of Couples Facing Breast Cancer in Womenâ and âCareer Pathways and Professional Transitions: Preliminary Results from the First Wave of a 7-Year Longitudinal Studyâ). It is finally to identify and measure chronic strain and daily hassles. Psychologists are of course the main contributors in relation to the latter (see chapters âA Survey of Couples Facing Breast Cancer in Womenâ, âCareer Pathways and Professional Transitions: Preliminary Results from the First Wave of a 7-Year Longitudinal Study, and âStudying Youth Transitions Through a Social Network: First Impressionsâ) but all social scientists recognize the importance of subjective perception since another widely accepted definition of vulnerability is simply low levels of well-being (see chapter âRepresentation of Vulnerability and the Elderly. A Total Survey Error Perspective on the VLV Surveyâ)."

169,18,0.344,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"(Kagalou et al. 2012). Gari et al. (2015) conclude that two factors explain the widespread use of DPSIR, especially in the realm of policy-related science: â. . .it structures the indicators with reference to the political objectives related to the environmental problem addressed; and . . . it focuses on supposed causal relationships in a clear way that appeals to policy actors (Smeets and Weterings 1999).â However, the use of DPSIR has been complicated by discrepancies in its application, such as the placement of the same variables in different categories (Gari et al. 2015). As applied by the EEA (2003), the categories of the DPSIR framework are described as follows. Driving forces are created by the patterns of production and consumption that emerge from the intertwined social, demographic, and economic developments of society. These forces of societyâs metabolism drive the pressures that impact SES, e.g., emissions of chemical, physical, and biological substances and agents and shifts in land use and land cover. In response to these pressures, the state of an SES can shift physically (temperature), biologically (ï¬sh stocks), and/or chemically (atmospheric CO2, water column nitrogen). Impacts resulting from shifts in ecosystem state are reï¬ected in diminished functioning of the environment, e.g., lower human or ecosystem health, resource availability, and/or biodiversity. Any or all such impacts can precipitate responses to mitigate or adapt, which can emerge at the level of individuals and groups at different levels of organizations (Gari et al. 2015). Management decisions to hold steady or change course beneï¬t from precise measurements, but such choices grow out of many critical decisions that come beforehand. What should be measured, how, to answer what questions or policy dictates, and whose perspective should be included in the discussion? These are among a plethora of decisions that face river managers. With regard to measurements, who decides how to deï¬ne the space and time dimensions of the reference condition? What is the baseline in time against which one measures change (degradation or progress) in ecosystem properties? For example, radically different conclusions can be drawn from the number of salmon found in 2002 in the Northwestern US Columbia River basin depending on when one sets the baseline. The baselineâs date can inspire optimism (200% increase since 1930) or pessimism (90% decline since 1866) (Olson 2002). To shape sound research as well as policy, management must account for the false optimism inherent in such a shifting baseline syndrome (Pauly 1995), which can be reversed if management can integrate ecological restoration within the larger social context, restoring habitat connectivity, local ï¬sh populations, as well as local ï¬sheries (McClenachan et al. 2015). Constructive and effective engagement with these questions can help build a comprehensive overview and a ï¬exible approach that managers need to deal with uncertainty. However, the global decline of river socio-ecosystems reï¬ects a history of management that did not meet these challenges but defaulted to convention and tradition based on previous knowledge and historical relationships. Historically, river management regimes have evolved as complex webs of relationships that reinforce each other and create a momentum carrying them down a development path. In this way, a river system advances along a trajectory determined by complex feedbacks of interacting actors, policies, technologies, and concepts (Sendzimir et al. 2007)."
223,106,0.344,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"To the budding geographer the time-bound message could not be misunderstood: Capture the power of social relations in a net of scientific laws and then, like your friends in physics, chemistry, and medicine, you too will have acquired the means not merely for understanding the world but for changing it as well. If the natural scientists know how to construct rockets that take them to the moon, if they know how to generate energy by enriching uranium, if they know how to save lives by transplanting hearts, then your duty as a social scientist is to discover similar techniques for eradicating poverty! Before you accept that challenge, though, be sure to ask yourself first why no one now reads Plato and Aristotle for what they had to say about physics or medicine, then why so many continue to return to the plays of Sophocles and Shakespeare for their insights into the human condition of hopes and fears, love and hate. How does the circumstance that we have accumulated knowledge in some areas and not in others relate to Aristotleâs remark that we should look for precision in each class of things just as far as the nature of the subject admits and that it would be equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician as to demand scientific proofs from a rhetorician? No small order given to a young man inexperienced in the actions that occur in life and therefore prone to pursue each object as passion directs. And yet, how could I possibly have ignored the challenge? GO ON, GO ON. The list of required readings included the classics of location theory, cognitive science, decision theory, systems analysis, matrix algebra, probability theory, spatial statistics, and a sprinkle of historical geography, all of it somehow yoked together in Walter Isardâs conception of Regional Science and its extension into Peace Science, the latter firmly anchored in the Quaker-thin interface of scientific knowledge and political action, John Deweyâs pragmatism and the collections of the Barnes Foundation never far away. A formative experience it was, the handsome fellowship that in 1963â1964 took me to North Armorica and the intellectual hubs of the Wharton School, Berkeley, and Northwestern. Great. Yet, in hindsight, the seeds might well have been planted 10 years earlier by the odd gymnasium teacher who did whatever he could to introduce his rowdy pupils to the concentric rings of von ThÃ¼nenâs isolated state and the cost curves of Alfred Weberâs isodapanes. Perhaps I was the only one to pay attention, but the truth is that I can still feel in my body the boyâs excitement when he literally saw why there were so many gauchos on the Pampas and so many steel mills along the Ruhr. The rhetorical power of geometric construction on the high wire, von ThÃ¼nenâs agricultural landscape depicted as an archerâs target with the bullâs eye as the central city on a homogeneous plain (more correctly the Junkerâs own estate), Weberâs factory finding its place of least cost, the Archimedean point that is located at the center of a Euclidean triangle whose corners are the concepts of transportation, labor, and agglomeration. Deep roots it has, the subsequent definition of geography as a geometry with names, essentially an exercise in the drawing and baptizing of points, lines, and planes.

Framed differently, having sufficient disposable time for engaging in social and cultural activities is a measure of well-being. Contrary to Boserupâs claim of incremental agricultural development progressing from long fallow systems to multiple cropping, the sociometabolic theory presents a different view of âtransitionsâ between regimes: the shift between energy regimes is instead associated with a major transformation of society (such as the Neolithic and Industrial Revolutions in the past). Sociometabolic regimes are not viewed as static. Instead, they consist of a set of opportunities and constraints within which certain dynamics occur. However, if the dynamics transcend or are pushed out of the boundary conditions of the regime by exogenous forces, turbulence will ensue with an unpredictable outcome anywhere between a collapse of the social system (Leemans and Costanza 2005; Tainter 1988) and a transition into another sociometabolic regime (Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl 2007)."

Adequate levels of trust and promoted norms and values are shared by all members of the association, especially the ones practicing volunteer work. In that way, the contribution to social capital multiplication has been made, as a basis for social innovation in the association and beyond. âMobilisation and organising around a shared vision of changeâ (Moulaert and Mehmood 2013, p. 448) is an added value of this innovation. In this case, social change is visible in an area that used to be the area of privacy and the space of few government services. It was a framework for social innovation that strengthened the social cohesion in general public. RODA has passed their knowledge and skills to the organisations in South East Europe, in Sarajevo, Belgrade and other cities. However, it has been impossible to implement such a programme in these countries, as there is neither willingness nor need for volunteer work. So in this case, it can be clearly stated that social innovation emerged from civil engagement and volunteer work of citizens, as a kind of collective action (Habisch and Loza Adaui 2013), making effort to protect and promote their interests."
13,93,0.343,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Reading Feelings A last methodological issue to be considered is how it is possible to read âfeelingsâ out of research interviews. This question is especially pertinent when the theoretical perspective on feelings draws on psychoanalytic theory, which is developed for and validated in a clinical setting. An in-depth study of emotional meanings is admittedly hard to accomplish in empirical research outside of clinical practice. This has been a target of much debate in the field of psychosocial studies, where some argue that it is not only a possible but also a vital resource for social researchers to make use of transference/countertransference processes in the reading of the informantsâ unconscious processes, while others have been critical to this (for the discussion on this, see, for instance, Walkerdine 1997; Hollway and Jefferson 2000; Bornat 2004; Frosh and Emerson 2005; Roseneil 2006; Frosh and Baraitser 2008; Hollway 2015; Woodward 2015). My position on this is that using psychoanalytic perspectives in social research does not imply that the researcher should relate to their informants as psychoanalysts to their patients. One issue to consider is that even though qualitative interviews as compared to surveys, experiments and tests may be seen as rich materials and âthick descriptionsâ, they are indeed very âmeagreâ, as Chodorow (1999) puts it, when compared to clinical data that stems from often many years of clinical encounters between the patient and the analyst. Another issue is that most social researchers lack proper training in handling and interpreting what goes on in the transference in the interview situation, so the danger of âwild analysisâ cannot be excluded. A third issue is that the analyses of interview transcripts are not (and in my opinion should not be) validated in an interpersonal space that includes the informant. What social researchers basically work with are texts, and texts are not persons (and definitely not when analysing interviews that are 25 years old). However, when psychosocial methods are implied in social research, it is not primarily the psychobiographical specificity of individual stories"

The consequences of eutrophication in the Baltic Sea may ultimately be an ecological regime shift â i.e. a situation where the ecosystem shifts from one relatively stable state to another with unknown thresholds between the states â with associated risks of detrimental effects on ecosystem services and an unknown degree of resilience (Ãsterblom et al. 2010; Ãsterblom et al. 2007). Traditionally, the governance approach toenvironmental problems and risks has presupposed that various phenomena in natural systems can rationally be dealt with by straightforward science-based management (Linke et al. 2016). The basis for this view has been a reductionist scientific approach, within an international framework of environmental governance, fragmented into sectors and countries and divided into national and international levels (Mee 2005).

99,123,0.343,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Moving on to the incubator example, Coompanion Incubator serves as a greenhouse for young and unemployed people and is financed by the European Social Fund. The target group is claimed to be challenged, inspired, and educated, and motivated by the Coompanion Incubator to set up their own business, be it private or organized as a cooperative. Only young and unemployed people registered with and directed by the national employment office are eligible for support, however, and it is the officer at the national employment office who decides whether or not a young unemployed person should be offered the support. The incubator could also offer the service of acting as an employer and managing mundane administrational tasks, enabling the individual to focus on the business idea. The combination of two features could be argued to function as the innovation in this example: the greenhouse service and the focus on a particular target group, young and unemployed people. Finally, the employment and empowerment project, Yalla Trappan, is described as a labour-integrated social enterprise. The idea behind the project derives from an initiative financed by the European Social Fund that focused on womenâs entrepreneurship, integration, empowerment, education, and equality, and was later made permanent in the shape of Yalla Trappan. Today, the overall aim of the project is to provide work for women who otherwise would have had severe difficulties entering the labour market. In terms of activities, the project provides the local community with a conference centre, a coffee shop, a restaurant, a design and craftsmanship studio, and catering and cleaning services. The target group is offered employment and employment training in the various activities organized by the project in addition to Swedish tuition and education in health care. The project is organized as a cooperative enterprise. In terms of innovative features, the main contribution to the field of social innovations could most likely be linked to the focus on a particular, previously ignored, target group in combination with the project being organized as a cooperative enterprise. The three highlighted social innovations in MalmÃ¶ address social problems of political interest: stagnation, unemployment, and segregation. Common features across the three social innovations include training, entrepreneurship, empowering individuals, and collaboration among various actors and organizations. Portrayed in in this way, the three social innovations could be argued to represent new ideas and new ways of addressing social problems in the local context of MalmÃ¶ (Nordfeldt and Carrigan 2013). Using the framework developed by Evers et al. (2014), these innovations could also be seen as focusing on the strengthening of individuals by, for example, investing in capabilities rather than targeting deficits, and by bridging the gaps between professional services and peopleâs life worlds. At the same time, when approached from the perspective proposed in this chapter, it could be argued that these innovations have developed in clearings, rather than being the outcome of certain enterprising individuals or being embedded within and supported by the legal and administrative framework of the overall welfare regime of MalmÃ¶."

287,56,0.342,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"The networking of theories allows for explicitly working with different theories in order to beneï¬t from their theoretical strengths with a speciï¬c focus on informing practice as well as being inspired by empirical situations of practice. To network theories means to build relations among theories. This approach is not a new idea. There are forerunners: for example, in 1992, Bauersfeld presented an integrated analysis of a teaching and learning situation using various theoretical approaches (1992b). He has also used strategies to compare and contrast radical constructivism and activity theory in order to clarify their (in-) compatibility (1992a). In 1998, Maier and Steinbring published a comparison of two theoretical approaches on processes of understanding based on the same empirical episode. These examples show that German researchers used the strategies of comparing theoretical approaches and integrating theoretical aspects to comprehend practice. Such strategies, called networking strategies, have been systematized, resulting in a landscape of four pairs of complementary strategies (Fig. 5.1). This landscape orders these strategies according to their potential for integration between two poles, non-relation of ignoring other theories, and uniï¬cation of theories globally. The ï¬rst two pairs (understanding and making understandable, comparing and contrasting), acknowledge the theoriesâ identities and the diversity of the theories as a resource in the ï¬eld. They point to the basic necessity of understanding theories. This ï¬rst pair may take place in a deepened way while comparing and contrasting theories. The second pair, comparing and contrasting, leads to awareness of differences and commonalities, thus learning from other perspectives. The third pair, combining and coordinating, is a step towards bridging theories. Its strategies allow working with different theories to build a conceptual framework or include complementary views into researching a problem. The fourth pair, locally integrating and synthesizing, leads to more comprehensive theoretical frameworks. Local integration may occur when a concept can be interpreted from different theoretical views, thus integrating the concept into other theories. Synthesizing is meant when two or more theories can be imbedded into a more holistic theoretical framework. While there are some cases of local integration, a case of synthesizing has not yet been achieved (see Bikner-Ahsbahs and Prediger 2010). During the last decade, research methods using networking of theories have been developed in a number of projects. These methods encompass repeated exchanges"

87,150,0.341,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","related to some subjective meaning or intention. Even further, a social action refers to an âactâ which considers the actions and reactions of other individuals. Thus, according to Parsons, the basic elements of a system are âactsâ. An act requires an actor, an end/outcome, a future state of affairs towards which the process of action is oriented and an action situation, which is defined by âconditionsâ of action, and actorsâ âmeansâ, and that allows alternatives or choices. The latter implies that actorsâ individual orientations are relevant. Actions are usually not isolated events but must be seen in relation to the actions of other individuals. Thus, a âsocial system is a system of processes of interaction between actors, it is the structure of the relations between the actors as involved in the interactive process which is essentially the structure of the social system. The system is a network of such relationshipsâ (Parsons 1991[1952], p. 15). One important point is that social systems develop stable patterns that are rather independent from the individual actors. Through stable patterns emerging from repeated interactions, rules or norms evolve. In more complex social systems, such norms become generalised, appear as collectively shared knowledge and form complex normative structures rather independent from individuals. Thus, social systems are emergent phenomena, which are constituted by norms, roles and institutions. From the perspective of an individual, the social systems appear as given structures. Actors will orient their actions not only towards action outcomes, as utilitarian (economic) theories suggest, but actions will also follow a normative orientation taking third-party actions and expectations into account. Parsons thus distinguishes motivational orientations that refer to needs and benefits of individuals and normative orientations. Since there are many possible action situations, actors face the problem to interpret situations, to know, which rules to apply. Therefore, actors must share knowledge and understand signs and symbols, which help to identify the nature and the meaning of situations. These shared knowledge and beliefs and the expressive"

245,801,0.34,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"3 Comprehensive Evaluation Approachesâ EUROSTUDENT and PL4SD Although the social dimension has not been able to translate into an implementable policy item on the European level, the inclusion of social dimension in the Bologna Process has initiated discussions and debates on the underrepresentation of certain groups in higher education. Indeed, the social dimension could be reconceptualised, not as an implementation policy, but as an evaluative perspective on educational policy and practice. Alongside the Bologna Process Implementation Report from 2012 and its forerunner from 2009 (Eurostat and Eurostudent 2009; Eurydice et al. 2012), a major source of data on aspects of studying related to the social dimension of higher education in international comparison has been the EUROSTUDENT project (Orr et al. 2011). The full set of EUROSTUDENT data covers the topics of demographics, including social background; access routes; study programs; accommodation, funding, and living costs; time use and employment during studies; and temporary mobility during studies. The data are drawn from harmonised national student surveys in more than 25 countries. In sum, the EUROSTUDENT data set provides a strong source of data on important aspects of student life in Europe within a comparative framework (Clancy 2010, p. 93). In this, EUROSTUDENT attempts to deal with the ï¬rst problem of the social dimension mentioned above, i.e. provision of data suitable for indicators. An alternative approach is to look closer not at the students, but at the whole education system and how it works for different student groups. This approach has been taken by the project Peer Learning for the Social Dimension (PL4SD). PL4SD is a three-year project (2012â2015) funded by the European Commission through the Lifelong Learning Programme (Erasmus Multilateral projects).1 The objective of the project is to provide policy-makers and practitioners with resources to develop effective measures for improving the social dimension of the European Higher Education Area. The instruments used to fulï¬l these goals are a database of policy measures and three national country reviews, which look at the combination of measures and processes in an education system and assess their appropriateness for improving the social dimension of higher education. Three Country Reviews were carried out in 2014. The approach of PL4SD recognises the second problem of the social dimension mentioned above, i.e. understanding how various levels of an education system and various stakeholders work together to influence learning opportunities and choice."
28,236,0.34,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"patients â supposedly for reasons of brevity â as âcuttersâ.40 In this study the behaviour of âcuttersâ is significantly differentiated from socially embedded hysterical, cry-for-help communications as well as earnest suicidal attempts. There is a sense in which this behaviour is new and unsettling (repeatedly labelled âbizarreâ) and that it repeatedly (if subtly) confounds existing categories. This clinical object is not self-evident, but is the result of human analysis and intervention. McEvedyâs separation of this action from the social setting is based upon a differentiation between âspontaneousâ and âsusceptibleâ cutters â between those who perform the action on their own initiative, and those who try it in response to another patientâs actions. There is a subtle relationship between these groups, but there is little doubt that the copying is â ultimately â secondary to the unity of the syndrome of cutting. McEvedy notes, with regret, that he would like to re-categorise the patients in order to separate out those who perform the act without any imitation of others. However, isolating these nonimitators requires too much of a reworking of the material. He has no doubt that some of his Bethlem group are only classed as repeated self-lacerators (those with five or more cutting incidents) because they happen to be present during the self-cutting epidemic.41 This makes it clear that the key to the syndrome is in the internal impulse, not the social imitation. McEvedy argues that the most notable aspect of behaviour is the apparently unprovoked mood swings â bringing emotional states to the fore. These are distanced from the social environment in the case of Kay R., who is said to have cut herself over and over, regardless of environment or levels of stress. McEvedy finally distances cutting from a socially motivated phenomenon because the impulse (presumed to underlie all the behaviours â from cutting forearms to swallowing dominoes) seems so unorthodox that it cannot be explained by mere social pressure or stress. He reasons that there must be something preventing the (supposedly suicidal) impulse from being conventionally expressed.42 That it might also be connected with hysterical, susceptible imitators does not change the fact that the behaviour begins in a pathological, emotional, internal impulse rather than a disordered social setting. McEvedy is not entirely sure what might replace the powerful aetiological force of the social environment or imitation, but he speculates thatthe so-called âspontaneousâ cutterâs personality has not only a high level of hysterical traits, but also something that he labels âhostile tensionâ.43 This is the first mention of âtensionâ as a key motive force for âcuttersâ in Britain â something that is well established in the"
341,318,0.34,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"An inclusive, systemic approach to freshwater governance begins by making the distinction between situation and system; no one governance situation is the same so contextual design and application are needed even if some of the principles and practices employed are held in common across contexts. When individuals, groups, organisations and governments engage with freshwater situations, almost overwhelmingly they bring their historical framing choices to the situation. Too often new terms are quickly adopted uncritically and used in ways that do not make clear the underlying conceptions held by different users of the language â in our research this applies to the concept âsocial ecological systemâ, âcomplex adaptive systemâ and the emerging discourse about natural capital, environmental assets or assetbased management (Coffey 2015). Language and concepts used unreflexively undermine inclusivity by capturing a particular framing at the expense of othersâ framings, or by undermining effective collaboration because people speak at crossed purposes. It is because of the importance of initial starting conditions in a given context, and the need to know what these are, as well as paying attention to what will help create an effective governance performance (Ison and Wallis 2011), that we have devoted considerable attention to framing issues and the role of language in this chapter. In achieving sustained systemic governance, these are important practical considerations, not unimportant theoretical musings! As we noted at the beginning when citing Lakoff (2010), all metaphors bring forth an associated system. In other words, language precedes system; in fact the choice to see a freshwater river as a system is a framing choice â the system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter and in our research, we hope to have presented a narrative that supports our normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance."
140,193,0.34,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Similarly, a report by Freedom House ï¬nds that 75% of recent democratic transitions were initiated in part (or in whole) by high levels of active civic pressure from below (Karatnycky & Ackerman, 2005). And campaigns of civil resistanceâor nonviolenceâare more likely to usher in democratic transitions than their violent counterparts (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011). Indeed, in recent private correspondence, Jay Ulfelder has suggested that he now sees protests as a necessary (but not sufï¬cient) condition in bringing about democratic transitions. According to two separate studies by Johnstad (2010) and Celestino & Gleditsch (2013), such nonviolence-initiated democratic transitions are exceedingly durable. Rummelâs omission of nonviolent resistance from discussion is ironic on several counts. First, his ï¬eld theory explicitly argues that democratic politics enjoy social ï¬elds, which involve âa high level of nonviolent conflict across the society, the stuff of democratic politicsâ (Rummel, 1997: 147, emphasis in original). Indeed, nonviolent conflictâand nonviolent resistance in correcting democratic politics when necessary âis clearly linked to the key mechanisms through which Rummel argues that democracies are more paciï¬c than authoritarian regimes. Rummel clearly knows and understands the literatures on nonviolent conflict, which he cites briefly in a footnote (1997: 102). Yet he totally sidesteps these literatures, seeing nonviolent resistance as an outcome of democracy rather than a cause of it. There is but one mention of Gandhi in the book, but only as a passing reference to charismatic leaders existing within social ï¬elds (1997: 156). Nor does Rummel appear to see constructive program (or parallel-institution-building) as a viable way through which societies can pursue models of democracy that suit their own interests. Rummelâs volume offers a people-powered explanation for the functioning of elite politics, yet he misses the most potent source of change witnessed in recent history: the people power movements that brought down many of the tyrannical governments he so deplored. At the same time, Rummel underestimates the plural nature of authoritarian regimesâand the degree to which social ï¬elds exist in authoritarian regimes. The past several decades of scholarship on social capital, civil society, and authoritarian regimes, reveals that even in authoritarian regimes, people practice everyday forms of resistance, which can develop into collective outbursts of nonviolent civil disobedience at seemingly a momentâs notice (Scott, 1987; Kuran, 1991). Rummelâs omission is somewhat ironic, given that he recognizes that democratic governments are not monoliths either (Rummel, 1997: 17). In fact, in many of the authoritarian regimes he cites as having anti-ï¬eld qualities (USSR, Iran, Chile), people power movements developed and challenged seemingly impenetrable regimes that had, indeed, ruled with excessive brutality (Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011). In other words, social ï¬elds may be a cause rather than a consequence of democracy."

The social aspects assessed are generally related to: (1) the behaviour (e.g. decision taking), (2) socioeconomic processes (downstream effects of socio-economic decisions), or (3) impacts on human, social or cultural capital (BenoÄ±tÌ and Mazijn 2009). In sLCA, sub-categories are defined as socially significant themes or attributes. Two complementary sub-category classification schemes have been proposed: classification according to stakeholder and classification according to social impact pathway. These lead to two methods of categorising social impact categories (BenoÄ±tÌ and Mazijn 2009): 1. Classification of social impact categories according to the stakeholder affected e.g. worker, consumer, local community, society, value chain actors not including consumers (see Table 8.1). The indicator results of the sub-category are aggregated into impact categories. However, there are no characterization models available for this that are generally accepted by sLCA practitioners. 2. Classification of social impact categories according to the social impact pathway, e.g. human rights, working conditions, health and safety (see Fig. 8.21). Results can be aggregated over the life cycle, for example 75% of the life cycle of a certain product are free from child labour. At each geographical location in the value chain, the social and socio-economic inputs may be performed by five main stakeholder groups: workers, local communities, society (national to global), consumers and value chain actors (see Table 8.1). A stakeholder category is a cluster of stakeholders that are expected to have shared interests due to their similar relationship to the investigated product system (BenoÄ±tÌ and Mazijn 2009, p. 101)."

Neither is it of much worth if we search for a more nuanced understanding of the Bolivarian revolutionâs successes as well as difficultiesâand how these came about. It is my belief that through exploring these questions we can achieve a fuller comprehensionâalso on a more theoretical levelâof the difficulties inherent in processes aimed at fomenting deep social change and political transformations. This is a lesson that can be valuable for political struggles elsewhere and at other times. Thus, this book tells a lot more complex tale, taking as a point of departure a broad analysis of social and political change in Venezuela seen from the point of view of the barrios (shantytowns) of Caracas where the majority of ChÃ¡vezÂ´s supporters were found.1 By exploring political history and social life in the barrios, local arenas for political activism as well as the relationship between barrio communities and the Venezuelan state under ChÃ¡vez, I will argue that the popular sectors2 under ChÃ¡vezâs passed through a significant transformation. In simple terms, they moved from a state of historical marginalization to feeling part of a project of social development and nation-building. However, the processes taking place in Venezuela also brought out in stark relief the challenges in altering social relationships, political dynamics and cultural imageries in accordance with the ideology of radical social transformation that the ChÃ¡vez government, and many of its supporters, articulated. Through in-depth explorations of peopleâs hopes, aspirations and actions, this book shows how the Bolivarian process was in essence a struggle over attempts to create new moral economies, new cultural values and new forms for social and political life. Indeed, to social activists in the Venezuelan shantytowns, âthe Bolivarian revolutionâ or âSocialism for the twenty-first century,â3 as"
256,371,0.339,"Supercomputing Frontiers : 4Th Asian Conference, Scfa 2018, Singapore, March 26-29, 2018, Proceedings","Study from DARPA [2] and Top Ten Exascale Research Challenges from DOE [12] have identified power consumption as one of the major constraints in scaling the performance of HPC systems. In order to bridge the gap between required and current power/energy efficiency, one of the most important research issues is developing a power management framework which allows power to be more efficiently consumed and distributed. Power management is a complicated process involving the collection and analysis of statistics from both hardware and software, power allocation and control by available power-knobs, code instrumentation/optimization, and so on. For large scale HPC systems, it would be more complex since handling these tasks at scale is not easy. So far, these tasks are mostly carried out in a discrete and hand-tuned way for a specific hardware or software component. This fact causes several problems and limitations. First, the lack of cooperation/automation makes power management very difficult and time-consuming. It is desirable that power management process is able to be carried out under a common convention with little effort from users and system administrators. Second, though there are many existing tools to be potentially used for power optimization, each of them is usually designed for different purpose. For example, PDT and TAU are used for application analysis, RAPL is dedicated to power monitoring and capping while cpufreq targets mainly for performance/power tuning [10,18,23]. It is necessary to have a holistic way to use them together. Third, different HPC systems have different capabilities for power management, resulting in system or hardware-specific ad-hoc solutions. Of course, these are not portable. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a generalized interface for portability and extensibility. Fourth, power management sometimes needs a collaborative effort from both users and administrators. Many existing solutions fail to draw a clear border between them. To address these problems, some of power management related tools and APIs such as GeoPM [5] and PowerAPI [8] have been developed. These tools/APIs are user-centric and need hand-tuning efforts for efficient power management. Hence, we design and implement a versatile power management framework targeting at power constrained large scale HPC systems. We try to provide a standard utility to people of different roles when managing/using such systems. Through this framework, we provide an extensible hardware/software interface between existing/future power-knobs and related tools/APIs so that system administrators can help supercomputer users make full use of valuable power budget. Since the framework defines clear roles for people participating and software components, power management and control can be carried out securely. The framework contains a very simple domain-specific language (DSL) which serves as a front-end to many other utilities and tools. This enables users to create, automate, port and re-use power management solutions. This paper makes the following contributions: â We design and implement a versatile framework to meet the necessity of performance optimization and power management for power-constrained large scale HPC systems."
28,232,0.338,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"Only after this lengthy, socially focused list do they add their hypotheses about how âaggression and anger were then turned against the selfâ.29 What is important here is that a particular psychiatric symptom (called scarification and self-mutilation) emerges from a psychiatric inpatient facility in the course of sociological analysis. Nevertheless, psychoanalysis can resonate with the social setting and interpersonal relationships, through concepts such as transference (the transfer of feelings from one social relationship to another, e.g., feelings for a parent transferred to a therapist), or cathexis (the investment of emotion into a person or object). The scarification is viewed in terms of how it affects staff and staff relationships, its status as contagious, and the roles of competition, bragging and attention-seeking that might fuel it. It is an overwhelmingly socially embedded symptom, with internal psychopathology subordinate to its social meaning and social effects. Thus it has more in common with British communicative self-poisoning than with Aschâs âWrist scratching as a symptom of anhedoniaâ (1971), or with contemporary literature on self-cutting as tension-regulation. There is much British literature that focuses on the relationship between inpatient institutions and psychopathology â for example, Russell Bartonâs Institutional Neurosis (1959), and John Wingâs and George Brownâs Institutionalism and Schizophrenia (1970). Illustratively, the opening chapter of the latter is entitled âDisease and the Social Environmentâ. This period also sees the dawn of so-called anti-psychiatry, in which the sociological anthropology of Erving Goffman is so influential. Indeed, as one historian expresses it, this is a time when âthe diagnosis was socialâ.30 As we have seen in previous chapters (especially Chapter 2), this socially focused outlook has roots in the Second World War. Tom Main, heavily involved in the second Northfield Experiment, addresses the British Psychological Society in 1957 in what becomes one of his best-known publications. Simply entitled âThe Ailmentâ, Main draws attention to the ways in which certain psychiatric inpatients absorb disproportionate energy and attention from staff, creating problems, cliques and divisions within and between clinical staff.31 Despite this established seam of sociological influence, the inpatient literature"

Microplastics are a by-product of exactly these modernization processes, being distributed globally by physical processes like ocean currents, and causing effects far from their place of origin. In recent years, the topic has gained great prominence, as microplastics have been discovered nearly everywhere in the environment, raising questions about the impacts on food for human consumption. But are microplastics really a new phenomenon or rather a symptom of an old problem? And exactly what risks are involved? It seems that the phenomenon has accelerated political actionâthe USA has passed the Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015âand industries have pledged to fade out the use of microbeads in their cosmetic products. At first sight, is it a success for environmentalists and the protection of our planet? This chapter deals with these questions by adopting a social-ecological perspective, discussing microplastics as a global risk. Taking four main characteristics of global risks, we develop four arguments to discuss (a) the everyday production of risk by societies, (b) scientific risk evaluation of microplastics, (c) social responses, and (d) problems of risk management. To illustrate these four issues, we draw on different aspects of the current scientific and public debate. In doing so, we contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the social-ecological implications of microplastics."

Since some microinsurance risks are, by their nature, social security-oriented, governments should determine the scope and level of a minimum guaranteed package of social security for all and organise access to it through legislative and regulatory means. Microinsurance could then be used by national governments to deliver this social protection package and thereby extend social security to uncovered segments of the population (IAIS, 2007, pp. 14â15). While these are the undeniable strengths associated with microinsurance, conversely, the presence of several weak points cannot go unmentioned:"

99,26,0.336,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"for establishing a back and forth between the political administrative system and social innovations has still to be developed. Part III of the book focuses on distinctive types of innovations, describing two basic aspects. The first concerns their internal characteristics, approaches and instruments used. The major goals of innovators and innovations will be sketched, as well as the internal governance and organisation of innovations. The second aspect concerns the context of the innovation and the ways the innovators deal with it. The creation of innovations is to a large degree contingent and their dynamic risky. The focus is on their interplay with the urban and city context of the innovation, the climate(s) of a city and the locally prevailing political strategy and its role in the policy field where the innovation is located. Contributions in this part represent a choice of more detailed and elaborated case studies carried out as part of WILCO, published in an e-book in 2014 (see: Evers et al. 2014). The introductory chapter to this part on the nature and relevance of local social innovations by Adalbert Evers and Taco Brandsen deals with two issues. First of all it identifies and analyses recurring approaches and instruments in local social innovations that differ from those dominating in the past and prevailing presently. These include the search for new ways of addressing users and citizens; the emphasis on new risks and related approaches to the issues of rights and responsibilities, ways of organising and working; and finally the concern with issues of governance. The features of these local innovations may have significance for welfare systems at large, going beyond the introduction of special new items in special fields. Secondly, the chapter discusses the kinds of typical relationships of innovations with their environments, as they are embedded in local contexts, reaching from tolerance to policies of mainstreaming. This helps to determine the local conditions and support innovations required for innovations to unfold, blossom and become part of changing local welfare systems in various ways. For the discussion of policies on social innovation, that is, approaches and instruments, and of politics of social innovation, shaping the processes of their development over time, a common metaphor is used: understanding social innovations as messages with a content that may be read and understood differently by the addressees in the (local) contexts, assuming such messages find their ways, are read and interpreted with some degree of interest. The next chapter in this third part is on the MaMa Foundation, Warsaw, described by Renata SiemieÅska, Anna Domaradzka and Ilona Matysiak. It is a non-profit organisation established in June 2006 by young, highly educated mothers. Its activities are based on the idea that mothers and fathers with young children should be able to increase their participation in local public and social life through the elimination of cultural and architectural barriers. MaMa Foundationâs modes of working include social campaigns, such as âO Mamma Mia! I cannot drive my pram in here!ââa campaign for adapting public spaces to prams and wheelchairs; campaigns for employeesâ rights, such as âHorror Storiesâ, which lists examples of dismissing mothers from their jobs; legal and psychological advice; and workshops for female refugees. MaMa Foundation starts many cultural and artistic initiatives as well as educational projects. It also supports local momsâ clubs organising workshops for mothers and local leaders and promotes the economic value of womenâs housework."
222,72,0.336,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This book builds on insights from a multidisciplinary perspective on ecosystem services and their importance to human well-being and applies these ideas in deltas in an integrated manner to inform decision-making for poverty alleviation. There is, of course, a wide variety of approaches and unresolved questions and relationships between elements of wellbeing and the underlying ecosystem processes (Norgaard 2010; Pascual et al. 2017; Suich et al. 2015). But at their core, the key scientific issues relate to how ecosystems bring multiple benefits to society, both in material terms and through other pathways. The benefits from ecosystem services include those associated with direct economic use, with protecting health and mitigation of hazards. The book explores the issues outlined in this chapter in detail for delta environments in order to give context to the broad assessment of the sustainability of a range of possible future trajectories within deltas, focusing on both the biophysical processes of their productivity and the prospects for securing ecosystem services for poverty alleviation objectives. The following chapters also, for the first time, explore in a systematic manner how social processes such as migration, access and property rights, and social relations interact with ecosystem services to result in the distribution of well-being in deltas. The book highlights the leverage points for action on these mechanisms that have been uncovered through integrated modelling and an increased understanding of delta socialecological systems. Integration across diverse knowledge domains and model simulation is a key and novel aspect of the research, and as such the findings in this book, linking biophysical changes to human wellbeing within a coupled model framework. This allows the exploration of possible futures in a participatory and policy-relevant manner that can engage with national stakeholders."

245,792,0.336,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"2 Discussion Despite its large number of problems, the evolution of the social dimension has provided positive developments. The progress made with regards to the affordability and portability of loans and grants, identiï¬cation of some underrepresented groups and the commitment to improve access to higher education and completion rates, as well as the collection of data can be seen as a success. It is not so much the CommuniquÃ©s or the ministerial meetings which are problematic for the social dimension, but rather that political promises have often not been followed by political action back home in the ministersâ own countries, in order to really achieve what was agreed during the meetings. The social dimension is a rather complex area of work within the European Higher Education Area as it allows several interpretations of even the basic deï¬nition provided in the London CommuniquÃ© (2007). The real challenge for the future of the social dimension is the gap between the political promises made in the CommuniquÃ©s and the actions actually taken to fulï¬l these promises. There are not many opportunities for stakeholdersâexcluding voting against or demonstrating againstâto encourage legislators to be more active with regards to the social dimension. Investment in and commitment towards a social dimension will not provide short-term beneï¬ts and the retention of beneï¬ts might go well beyond legislative periods of government. In the long term, the commitment to a social dimension is a pre-condition to achieving the original intentions of the Bologna Processâcompetitiveness and attractiveness. The so-called European dimension (EHEA 1999) itself is innately linked with the social dimension; OECD data shows us a tight correlation between democratic participation, perceived (in-)equality, and educational status (OECD 2012a). One step which we hope will be taken after the next ministerial conference is the development of lower-level targets towards overarching goal of mirroring the composition of society within higher education (EHEA 2007). Breaking down the end-goal to smaller increments would not only make it easier to begin to work on the implementation of the social dimension, but also make partial achievements more visible. Furthermore, it would provide ministries, higher education institutions, and all other relevant stakeholders the time to adjust to a more diverse student population and to learn to be able to serve this population. The time for adaptation is not inï¬nite, as more and more areas of Europe will be diversiï¬ed, or in some cases minorities will be the new majoritiesâas Crul et al. (2013) reports it is already the case for some cities like Amsterdam. The EHEA should urgently ï¬nd strategies to adapt to this change."

277,333,0.335,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"11.2.2 From AuslÃ¤nderforschung to Migration Research Early research on labour migration in the 1960s was focused on labour market issues and was done mostly by economists (Wilpert 1984: 307). It started under the term Gastarbeiterforschung, but was re-named AuslÃ¤nderforschung soon afterwards (Bommes 2010: 134). According to Treibel (1988), the number of publications on the âAuslÃ¤nderproblemâ rose noticeably between 1970 and 1973. The mid-1970s and the early 1980s can be interpreted as the main research phases of the German AuslÃ¤nderforschung, not only in terms of the quantity of studies and publications, but also with regard to the development of research and funding structures (Treibel 1988: 34). A common characteristic of the various studies during the AuslÃ¤nderforschung phase was their âsocial problemâ orientation. Migration research in the 1970s was mainly designed as applied science reacting to social problems of labour migrants, such as housing issues, health, political participation, education in schools and occupational training of the second generation (Treibel 1988: 38; Angenendt 1992: 189f; Bommes 2010). Research on foreign children and youth â an area called âAuslÃ¤nderpÃ¤dagogikâ â considerably expanded in this period as well. This approach can be characterised by a focus on educational and social problems connected with the underachievement of migrant children. Today this often rather descriptive and often quite normative approach continues in the education of social workers. The research programme âGuest-worker Research â Migration and its Social Consequencesâ established and funded by the Volkswagen Foundation in 1974, marked a step forward in the development of scientific research on the topic. Addressing return migration, social integration (with an emphasis on the second generation, families and women), and"

Google Analytics was not reporting social referral before Oct 2011, so there is a limited time series, which we can to some extent enhance with log data. The limited data we have show that there was a slight peak in social referrals around the time of a new portal launch in October 2011 (thanks to associated publicity one presumes), but after that it settles down to around 1,000 per week; since August 2012 there has been some irregular growth and the base-rate is now nearing 1500 per week. Between OctâMarch 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 the overall year-on-year general visitor growth is 90 %. However if we look at the âsocial segmentâ the visitor growth is 34 %. Exclude blogs and visitor growth falls to 25 %. Looking at blogs alone [the visitor growth rate is 58 %. The social element is a little more significant on the exhibitions site and predictably significant for blog.europeana. In April 2013 Social Referrals only accounted for one per cent of all visits to the site, a bare 0.02 % higher than a year previous. It could be that Europeanaâs social media activity takes place solely within the context of these sites and entirely bypasses Europeana.eu. In such a context we cannot refute claims for the efficacy of âsocial mediaâ, nor can we support them. In the context of the Europeana.eu website however social referral is not at present significant and is not growing above the trend for the site as a whole. So the action has to be happening elsewhere, on the social media sites themselves."

222,89,0.334,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"Assets, income, nutrition- and blood pressure-related health indicators and subjective well-being vary with location. Waterlogging, high salinity and access are significantly associated with poverty in the study area with different spatial patterns apparent for these three variables (see Chap. 21 and Amoako Johnson et al. 2016). Soil salinity is significantly associated with poverty around the Sundarbans, waterlogging in the centre of the study area, while the lack of access dominates in the east of the study area. For example, the factors associated with asset poverty vary across the study area. Considering all social-ecological systems, the probability of being materially and subjectively poor decreases as household dependence on ecosystem services for income increases. However, the irrigated agricultural zone showed the opposite relationship, with increasing dependence on ecosystem services being associated with a higher probability of being materially poor. Similar spatial and social-ecological system-based differences are found in the health indicators (Chap. 27) and in how individuals perceive their own well-being. Levels of malnourishment are higher than the national average but vary across the study area. For example, food consumption varies across the study area and by social-ecological system. Irrigated agriculture areas show the lowest protein intake and one of the lowest calorie intakes. In comparison, households living in the char and rain-fed agricultural social-ecological systems also have low calorie intake levels, but the protein consumption (from fish) is much higher and child undernutrition lower. This indicates that fish consumption appears crucial to health in some social-ecological system."
356,189,0.334,Re-engineering the Uptake of ICT in Schools,"Multi-criteria Recommender Systems In traditional recommender systems, the utility function considers only one criteria, typically a global evaluation of resources or a valuation from the user. Depending on the systems under consideration, the utility function may be a valid approach though it is rather limited, since the utility of a given element for a particular user may depend on multiple factors. Taking this into consideration, in the past few years the study of multicriteria recommender systems has increased (Lakiotaki et al. 2008, 2011; PlantiÃ© et al. 2005). Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a very mature and active research area (Figueira et al. 2005). It focuses on studying methods and management processes in systems with multiple conflicting criteria in order to identifying the best possible solution from a set of available alternatives. Starting from research and theories from that area, (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2010; Lakiotaki et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2011) propose approaching the problem of recommendations as one of MCDA, following the methodology that was developed by Roy (1996) for modelling these kinds of problems."
108,9,0.334,Bordieuan Field Theory as an Instrument for Military Operational Analysis,"This was a young researcher still strictly empirical, creating the foundation for his theories. Just recently his book Algerian Sketches was released post-mortem where he writes about Algeria, the Algerian conflict and his theories. Later on, Bourdieu found that much of the social mechanisms he had found among the Kabyle were present in all manners of other social contexts. Bourdieu was one of the foremost French thinkers of the late 1900s and had great influence on many humanist and social science disciplinesâmainly in Europe. Those who have not read his work consider his thinking to be post-modern, but strictly speaking, he is not of the deconstructive school. He saw himself as post-structuralist, which was partly an acknowledgement of structuralism, but which also showed that it was not as embedded in his thinking with the degree of rigidity normally imposed by structuralism. He has, for example, done extensive research in the fields of art, literature and even studied his peers, the professors in Paris as empirical material. Bourdieu might at times be hard to understand, but his theories are based strictly on empirical material which he then has generalised to theoretical systems. With the passage of time, he introduced new terms, for example the term field, which we will return to later on. For more than a decade, I myself have used and expanded Bourdieuâs theories and found that there is a case to state that they are valid for studies and practice regarding Military Operations as well. This text should be seen as an introduction of the theories into the military field, especially regarding the field of intelligence analysis. In military context, the theories can be used to make social patterns visible. If you have good empirical material and a good analysis, then you will be able to see how actors (collective as well as individual) relate to each other. In the end, one can be both able to predict what will happen (with a certain degree of certainty) and able to make the other part (enemy or not) behave in a certain way, without them knowing that you are manipulating them. I would like to underscore that this text is primarily focused on the theory and not the empirical aspect. It only serves as a way to exemplify the theory and show its usefulness in operational analysis. I recommend the bibliography at the end for those interested in the empirical events briefly explained in this text. It should be stressed that field theory is more of an object than a tool in the text. The text is primarily a tool for training, inspire primarily military officers how to use field analysis. The overall aim of this text is to present an alternative approach to"

Engineering approaches largely ignore or supplant the functions of biophysical systems. Through the SETs lens these approaches tend to be located fully within the technological domain with little input from ecological domains. Grey infrastructures provide an important means of adapting to biophysical challenges including hazards and climate driven extreme events, but are often costly to install and maintain, have long-term effects on ecosystems, tend to have low flexibility, and when they fail can generate catastrophic impacts on social and ecological domains of urban SETs. Despite this, in some cases grey infrastructures might still be needed. For instance, Khazai et al. (2007) reviewed the role and effectiveness of coastal structures in reducing damage to coastal communities from tsunamis and storm surges caused by cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons, finding that concrete seawalls are the most durable protection against various types of storm surges. Still the he SETs framework helps elucidate the need to recognize that grey infrastructures are not isolated systems but embedded in and affect social and ecological components of the urban system. In urban systems, habitat loss is often a direct consequence of the hardening of coastal and inland water systems. Grey infrastructures for coastal defence have also been criticized for inhibiting normal coastal processes (Khazai et al. 2007). Social and ecological systems are co-evolutionary (Norgaard 1994; Kallis 2007) in the sense that they evolve while influencing eachother thus creating sharp contrast with fixed, long-lasting grey infrastructures that lack flexibility to be. For these and other reasons tied to the long term impacts engineered infrastructures, such as sea walls or wastewater treatment plants, have on neighbouring social communities, these projects increasingly encounter high resistance by residents especially those concerned with the environment, health and sustainability. Though engineered systems can have enormous benefits (clean water, sanitation, etc.) they can also lead to undesirable system lock-ins and path dependency which make their negative impacts, and even the infrastructure itself, difficult to reverse (Dawson 2007). Expanding cities increasingly rely on grey infrastructures for their protection with sprawling areas and informal settlements are often located in hazardprone areas. A false sense of security generated by these protective infrastructures can in fact lead populations to further expand in unsafe areas increasing their exposure to hazards and further aggravating risk (Mitchell 2003). Grey infrastructures can fail, especially when confronted with climate driven extreme events. Ready examples include the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in New York City in 2012. These types of weather-related hazards overtopped levees, sea walls, and storm barriers engineered to protect people and ecosystems from hurricanes and storm surges, and ultimately failed with disastrous consequences. Climate change creates uncertainty and system non-stationarity. Thus future risk is not easily taken into account in planning and building of infrastructures (Hallegatte 2009). For example, a levee designed to accommodate a certain future level storm"

166,267,0.333,Surveying Human Vulnerabilities across the Life Course (Volume 3.0),"1 Introduction Involuntary job loss often comes as a shock for the affected individuals. Dismissal not only hampers individualsâ health (Kuhn et al. 2009) and life satisfaction (Oesch and Lipps 2013), but may also negatively affect their occupational trajectory. Displaced workers are deprived of the positive components of work â they lost not only a source of income but also their social contacts, an important determinant of their social status, and the time structure implied by an economic activity (Andersen 2008). Threatened by the risks of financial deprivation and social exclusion, displaced workers are in a state of heightened vulnerability. Yet not all individuals are exposed to these threats to the same extent: some are more disadvantaged than others. When trying to determine workersâ occupational trajectories after job dismissal, researchers face a number of methodological problems. The fact that workers displaced individually are probably a self-selected group of people makes the causal analysis of the impact of job loss on the ensuing work career tricky: the same factor causing the workers to lose their jobs such as poor health or lack of motivation may also reduce their re-employment prospects (Brand 2015).

284,76,0.333,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Ecological distribution conï¬icts are struggles over the burdens of pollution or over the sacriï¬ces made to extract resources, and they arise from inequalities of income and power (Martinez-Alier and OâConnor, 1996; Douguet, OâConnor and Noel, 2008). The concept of ecological distributive conï¬icts is born of the intersection between the ï¬elds of ecological economics and political ecology, which links the emergence of environmental conï¬icts in the global South with the growth of the metabolism of societies in the global North (which includes parts of China). Political ecology focuses on the exercise of power in environmental conï¬icts. In other words, the question is: Who has the power to impose decisions on resource extraction, land use, pollution levels, biodiversity loss, and more importantly, who has the power to determine the procedures to impose such decisions (Martinez-Alier, 2001, 2002; Robbins, 2004)? Ecological distribution conï¬icts emerge from the structural asymmetries in the burdens of pollution and in the access to natural resources that are grounded in unequal distributions of power and income, and in social inequalities of ethnicity, caste, social class and gender (MartÃ­nezAlier, 1997; Martinez-Alier et al., 2011). As processes of valuation surpass economic rationality in attempts to assign market prices and chrematistic costs to the environment, social actors mobilize for material and symbolic interests (of survival, identity, autonomy and quality of life), beyond strictly economic demands of property, means of production, employment, income distribution and development (Leff, 2003). Sometimes the local actors claim redistribution, leading to conï¬icts that are often part of, or lead to, larger struggles of gender, class, caste and ethnicity (Agarwal, 1994; Robbins, 2004). Hence the concept of âenvironmental justiceâ is important. It was born in the USA (Bullard, 1990) and it has gained growing acceptance in extractive industries, water use and waste-disposal conï¬icts all over the word (Urkidi and Walter, 2011). Not all conï¬icts are born from immediate metabolic needs. Demand for certain commodities such as gold arises in part from the search to have an investment outlet that furthermore allows for speculation. Other metals, such as copper, can also be stored and used as guarantees for speculative loans. The fact remains that both energy-carriers (coal, gas, oil) and metallic minerals are inputs for the industrial economy and that their use, in total, grows more or less in proportion to the growth of the economy. In this chapter, we analyse the material ï¬ows of Latin American countries and their implications in terms of socioenvironmental conï¬ict. First, we present an overview of recent material-ï¬ow studies"
201,29,0.332,The Pathologisation of Homosexuality in Fascist Italy,"Segregation is identified as a crucial issue of the law. From the midnineteenth century the European bourgeoisie had tried to tackle the increase of social problems created by massive urbanisation. Criminality, prostitution, alcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis and mental alienation, all linked with impoverishment of urban working classes, were among the many tangible social threats that modern life brought. To define these worrying and constantly increasing social phenomena a term came in use, degeneration, that could explain moral decay and the connected tendency to commit crimes.8 As a response to these new impending social threats, scientists started formulating the basic principles of eugenics, a utopian theory whose aim was to identify ways in which human-kind and societies could be improved. Founded in Great Britain by Francis Galton, nephew of Charles Darwin, it spread successfully across Europe, and found in Italy very fertile ground in the second half of the nineteenth century.9 An improved human race would ideally have to rely on reproduction by its best and fittest elements, the ones who had successfully fought and won the battle for survival, according to Darwinian theories. However, after World War I, it became painfully evident that also the fittest and best young men perished. Consequently, the following generation would bear the genes of those who did not fight: the sick, the old, the disabled. Research found a new impulse in trying to avert this natural decay of society. The theoretical debate gradually came to two main positions: the so-called ânegativeâ eugenics, that developed in Protestant Northern European countries, theorised the need to eliminate unfit members of society to improve the âstockâ. This had extreme consequences as it led to compulsive sterilisation programmes in Sweden and Germany, and to the suppression of disabled people during the Nazi regime. Catholic-inspired âpositiveâ eugenics concentrated on ways to cure the unfit, to isolate them and transform them into âbetterâ human beings. How to cure, modify and prevent, therefore, became the most important aspect of the debate in Italy, which involved criminal anthropologists, criminologists, psychiatrists and politicians. Apart from a few voices of dissent, at the beginning of the twentieth century the Italian answer to questions of degeneration was a vigorous demographic campaign that aimed at inverting falling birth rates trends, together with a firm focus on preventative medicine, pre-maternal and"

The value of MTBD can be assessed more precisely by geologically-based study. Price elasticity, which determines the resourcefulness of the system, will be lowered aggressive introduction of emergency power source although cost-effectiveness of their installation should be considered, of course. Assessment on these policies through energy model analysis will give the potential contributions and beneï¬ts of them. Concerning scenarios planning and model reï¬nement, the design of systems has a key role. Social activities in todayâs world are supported by highly complex and interdependent system, and so, risks surrounding us are very systemic. Fukushima nuclear power plant accident is such a kind of risk. Therefore, targeted system should be comprehensive enough to consider their inter-relations although the system considered in this paper is limited within electricity supply system. In addition, more kinds of risks should be considered because our challenges to be dealt with now in this world are not only nuclear usage. Finally, to address above requirements, the most important seems to learn effectively from accidents and update our social scientiï¬c knowledge base. The implement of what we have learned into energy model makes it more sophisticated and the model will tell us how to design resilient systems.

99,57,0.332,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Today, there are two core beliefs that are widely shared by MÃ¼nsterâs business community, chief administrators and key representatives of the two major parties. The first is an âinvestment frameâ according to which any policy has to pay off in the long run. Hence also in the area of social policies, any initiative has to either be an âinvestmentâ, for example in human capital, or aim at enabling the respective individual, group or local community to become self-sustainable. The second is a so-called prevention frame, according to which action, in particular in the area of social policies, should be taken at an early stage in order to prevent a downward development. Thus, the two frames correspond and are related to each other. In order to attain legitimacy, social innovations have to be in accordance with both. However, social innovations also have to be initiated and promoted by âthe right peopleâ in town. The results of the WILCO project show that there is a relatively small circle of stakeholders in MÃ¼nster who meet regularly in the various roundtable and working-group settings initiated by the municipal administration in which crucial policy issues covering a broad range of topics are discussed. Indeed, the local parliament long ago stopped being the central forum for decision-making. Since MÃ¼nsterâs business community is very homogeneous, consisting primarily of retailers and representatives of saving banks and insurance companies, the municipal administration constitutes âthe spider in the netâ: it sets the agenda and promotes new initiatives. Newcomersâsocial entrepreneurs that are not mainstream and do not belong to the inner circle of decision makersâfind it difficult to be acknowledged and accepted in MÃ¼nster and to have their proposed social innovations validated. Hence the city is characterised by a co-operative governance arrangement as regards social innovation, but innovative concepts and new ideas have to make their way into the âinner circleâ of decision makers in MÃ¼nster in order to be heard and recognised. The second type of governance, called governance of growth, gives priority to economic policies. The orientation is anti-urban, and politics are strongly influenced by economic interest groups. This growth-machine orientation (Molotch 1976) privatises social problems as individual faults. Pamplona, Dover and Birmingham are examples of the predominance of this kind of governance. Birmingham in the UK, analysed in this book by Nadia Brookes, Jeremy Kendall and Lavinia Mitton, is a fine example of a city that follows this model in its attempt to reconcile social and economic policies. In the nineteenth century, the city used to be the âworkshop of the worldâ. Even today, Birminghamâs political and welfare culture is consistent with the paradigm posed by Adam Smith, according to which a vibrant economy is the most effective underpinning for community development. Accordingly, governance of growth assigns social policy a subordinate role. In the case of Birmingham, this subordinate role is consistent with the tradition of a liberal welfare regime in which the market constitutes the prime source of individual wellbeing. Hence, as Brookes, Kendall and Mitton argue, âthe city council has focused over the years on the promotion of local economic development, and the two policy priorities of economic growth and labour market activation and social inclusion have usually been dealt with separatelyâ."

170,282,0.331,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"1 Introduction Information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) projects are not implemented in a vacuum. Rather, ICT4D interventions can potentially influence the existing socioculturalâtechnical systems. In turn, the systems themselves can influence the evolution and adoption of the technology. Scholars have emphasised that human agency and technology have a bidirectional relationship and that evolution of technological intervention depends upon the interaction between human agency and technology (Orlikowski 1992). The interaction between human agency and technology is determined by institutional forces. âInstitutions are the rules of the game in a society or, more formally, are the humanly devised constraints that shape human interactionâ (North 1990: p. 3). The institutional perspective is opportune in highlighting the socioculturalâtechnical aspects of the ICT4D interventions. Introduction of an ICT4D initiative juxtaposes two different institutional systems, that of the project designers and implementers and of project users. The outcome of the project is then determined by the evolution of this institutional dualism (Heeks and Santos 2007). Previous research has highlighted the importance of sociocultural factors as critical determinants for realisation of benefits from ICT usage (Chib et al. 2008; Miscione 2007; Walsham et al. 2007). The holistic assessment of impact of ICT4D initiatives, however, needs deliberation on how the ICT4D initiatives shape the existing institutional systems and how the institutional systems shape the technology usage and adaption. Scholars have called for research on the interaction of technology itself with specific aspects of social, economic, and cultural contexts (Walsham et al. 2007: p. 323). While most of the assessment frameworks used to measure the impact of ICT4D projects highlight the economic aspects of âimpactâ (such as in Arul Chibâs introductory chapter and Kathleen Diga and Julianâs May chapter later in this book), the institutional perspective is opportune in assessing the softer aspects of impact of ICT4D initiatives, such as the behavioural, cultural and social dimensions of the impact (Heeks and Molla 2009).

Hybrid institutions can be addressed from different theoretical perspectives. Instrumentalist approaches assume that actors are political and social entrepreneurs who actively use their social capital to build institutions that strive for optimal resource management. It is usually claimed that, to use social capital appropriately, institutions must be properly embedded in the cultural and social context from which the norms to support purposive decision-making are drawn (Ostrom, 1990). However, it has been claimed that concepts of embeddedness foster a functional and static conceptualization of culture and tradition that obscures the complex dynamics of institutional construction and evolution (Cleaver, 2001). Cleaver (2002: 17) claims that âthe evolution of collective decision-making institutions may not be the process of conscious selection of mechanisms ï¬t for the collective action task (as in Ostromâs model) but rather a messier process of piecing together shaped by individuals acting within the bounds of circumstantial constraintâ. In her studies of institutions for common property resource management in Tanzania, Cleaver (2001, 2002, 2013) develops the concept of âinstitutional bricolageâ as a process by which people consciously and unconsciously draw on existing social and cultural arrangements (rules, traditions, norms, roles and relationships) to shape institutions in patch-together institutions to change situations (Cleaver et al., 2013). In this dynamic, the resulting institution is a mix of modern and traditional, of formal and informal practices. Institutional bricolage offers a compelling approach to understanding the way in which hybrid institutions can be the result of a complex and dynamic assemblage process where contexts, conï¬icts, needs, scales, actors, and formal and informal institutions come into play to produce a particular hybrid institution. Environmental Justice Movements (EJMs) Latin American anti-mining movements and organizations played a central role in the emergence and spread of consultations. In this section we outline some key features of this actor, its central demands and its scalar dynamics. Latin American anti-mining movements have been framed as EJMs because they demand socioecological equity and fair decision-making processes in the governance of mining activities (Urkidi and Walter, 2011). Recently, questions of participation and voice have been at"

Even though explaining the outcome of some of the observed protests turned out to be difficult in some cases, we were able to identify patterns for success. Second, we engaged ourselves with another old debate within social movement studies and the political opportunity structures approach, specifically the relationship between exogenous and endogenous factors that lead to social change. In our cases, the interaction of contextual factors with protestimmanent mechanisms proved to be instructive, showing how existing opportunities are seized and transformed into effective protest strategies by actors."

As of this writing, the Dempster et al. (1977) article had more than 45,000 citations in Google Scholar. Also falling under causal inference was Rubinâs work on matching. Matching was developed to reduce bias in causal inferences using data from nonrandomized studies. Rubinâs (1974b, 1976a, b, c, 1979) work was central to evaluating and improving this methodology. Besides landmark contributions to causal inference, continued development of IRT was taking place. Apart from another host of papers by Lord (1970, 1973, 1974a, b, 1975a, b, 1977), several applications of IRT were studied, including for linking test forms (Marco 1977; see also Carlson and von Davier, Chap. 5, this volume). In addition, visiting scholars made seminal contributions as well. Among these contributions were ones on testing the Rasch model as well as on bias in estimates (Andersen 1972, 1973), ideas later generalized by scholars elsewhere (Haberman 1977).

376,482,0.33,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Rangelands around the world operate under a broad array of governance systems and property rights regimes. Thus far the SES concept has been used far more effectively to analyze past and present situations than in providing clear steps for future work. Future research should go further in determining how these different components are linked, and further suggest policy improvements that might better support ranchers, pastoralists, and rangeland managers. The effect of large-scale economic and political forces on local environments lends itself well to SES analysis. For example, in the USA, zoning laws discourage conversion of private rangeland to other uses within certain geographical areas, but ranch conversion is not otherwise prohibited and ranches are rarely the most profitable land use. Alternatively, many European countries have national laws that ban the conversion of certain agricultural landsâincluding dehesaâto nonagricultural uses. In the western USA, there is growing interest in conserving âworking rangelandsâârangelands that produce ecosystem services as well as commodities. Yet there has been little research to date comparing the effectiveness of various national land policies on maintaining working rangelands or supporting their active management at the household scale. Comparing the effects of land-use policies on the ecology of working rangelands would provide needed policy-relevant information. At a recent national workshop on âusable science,â participants, including scientists, livestock operators, and land managers, ranked 142 identified issues proposed by five working groups (water, animals, vegetation, soils, and socioeconomics). The number one-ranked issue overall came out of the Socio-Economics Working Group: understanding and managing for variability (climate, drought, fire), adaptation, and recovery (Brunson et al. 2016). This topic is admittedly broad, but the SES approach is a good fit for analyzing key components: ecosystem change, adaptive capacity, and resilience in rangeland systems. Rangelands are subject to high variability of climate, vegetation, and market influences of livestock and feed prices, and dealing with such variability is a constant challenge for livestock operators and land managers. SES frameworks might productively be used to increase the resilience of working rangelands by identifying beneficial ecological traits but also by constructing social and economic support systems for livestock operators and land managers. Research exploring the use of SES frameworks to help practitioners and managers anticipate and manage variability and change in environment and society is a needed contribution. Trade-offs and synergies among the various goods and services derived from rangelands need more attention in general. On public lands, agency interventions on specific allotments could have impacts on entire landscapes: examining these crossscale effects, and the trade-offs among them, requires greater attention. Designation of a park or preserve may be of great benefit in meeting conservation and recreation needs, but might have devastating effects on individual livestock operators, and lead to a transformation in nearby communities with various ecological and social outcomes at diverse scales. SES analysis could help anticipate these effects, providing a fuller picture of the opportunities and trade-offs of the change. This type of research is hampered, however, by the difficulties of cross-disciplinary research. SESs are inherently interdisciplinary, but different disciplines use different research"
244,686,0.33,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","Messick, usually in collaboration with Jackson, carried out a program of research on response styles from the 1950s to the 1970s. The early work documented acquiescence on the California F scale, a measure of authoritarianism. But the bulk of the research focused on acquiescence and social desirability on the MMPI. In major studies (Jackson and Messick 1961, 1962b), the standard clinical and validity scales (separately scored for the true-keyed and false-keyed items) were factor analyzed in samples of college students, hospitalized mental patients, and prisoners. Two factors, identified as acquiescence and social desirability, and accounting for 72â76% of the common variance, were found in each analysis. The acquiescence factor was defined by an acquiescence measure and marked by positive loadings for the truekeyed scales and negative loadings for the false-keyed scales. The social desirability factorâs loadings were closely related to the judged desirability of the scales. A review by Fred Damarin and Messick (Damarin and Messick 1965; Messick 1967, 1991) of factor analytic studies by Cattell and his coworkers (e.g., Cattell et al. 1954; Cattell and Gruen 1955; Cattell and Scheier 1959) of response style measures and performance tests of personality that do not rely on self-reports, suggested two kinds of acquiescence: (a) uncritical agreement, a tendency to agree; and (b) impulsive acceptance, a tendency to accept many characteristics as descriptive of the self. In a subsequent factor analysis of true-keyed and false-keyed halves of original and reversed MMPI scales (items revised to reverse their meaning), two such acquiescence factors were found (Messick 1967). The Damarin and Messick review (Damarin and Messick 1965; Messick 1991) also suggested that there are two kinds of socially desirable responding: (a) a partially deliberate bias in self-report and (b) a nondeliberate or autistic bias in selfregard. This two-factor theory of desirable responding was supported in later factor analytic research (Paulhus 1984). The findings from this body of work led to the famous response style controversy (Wiggins 1973). The main critics were Rorer and Goldberg (1965a, b) and Block (1965). Rorer and Goldberg contended that acquiescence had a negligible influence on the MMPI, based largely on analyses of correlations between original and reversed versions of the scales. Block questioned the involvement of both acquiescence and social desirability response styles on the MMPI, based on his factor analyses of MMPI scales that had been balanced in their true-false keying to minimize acquiescence and his analyses of the correlations between a measure of the putative social desirability factor and the Edwards Social Desirability scale. These critics were rebutted by Messick (1967, 1991) and Jackson (1967). In recent years this controversy has reignited, focusing on whether response styles affect the criterion validity of personality measures (e.g., McGrath et al. 2010; Ones et al. 1996). This work has had lasting legacies for both practice and research. Assessment specialists commonly recommend that self-report measures be balanced in keying (Hofstee et al. 1998; McCrae et al. 2001; Paulhus and Vazire 2007; Saucier and Goldberg 2002), and most recent personality inventories (Jackson Personality Inventory, NEO Personality Inventory, Personality Research Form) follow this practice. It is also widely recognized that social desirability response style is a potential threat to the validity of self-report measures and needs to be evaluated (American"
164,53,0.33,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","factors underlying poverty (Meinzen-Dick et al. 2004; von Braun et al. 2009, 44). These shortcomings led us to the development of a more inclusive and interdisciplinary research framework, that of marginality. Kant (1819) noted that a concept is a general representation that is common to several specific objects. Accordingly, the concept of marginality is an abstraction of the idea that the causal complexities underlying peopleâs living conditions interact in ways that are at systemic margins. These conditions are far from what would be considered optimal, in balance, just, equal, sufficient, good, or fairâattributes that describe conditions and positions in human life that are enabling and supportive, and that are used to define poverty. Despite the critiques of marginality in social science (Cullen and Pretes 2000; Del Pilar and Udasco 2004), the persistence of marginality as a concept (Dickie-Clark 1966) should be regarded as an indication of the demand to express observations of a similar kind across different epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina 1999), and to find solutions, here, to the phenomena of poverty. The problem of measuring the degree of marginalization is that the reference is not fixed or unknown, and therefore when used as a theory marginality has been criticized for the lack of construct validity (Del Pilar and Udasco 2004, 11). In their critique, however, those authors reviewed the use of marginality as a theory and came to the conclusion that âmarginality cannot work [as a theory] if it has multiple levels of meaning.â This critique of the marginality concept as a theory also rests on the belief that a concept must be a âuniform kind of mental representationâ (Weiskopf 2009, 145). Weiskopf rejects this assumption in psychology and outlines a pluralist theory of concepts in which they are constituted by multiple representational kinds. In the following we present a framework for the investigation of marginalityânot a theory of marginality. Although poverty can be observed in many different forms and is caused by many different factors, all forms of poverty can be described through the concept of marginality. Someone who is poor will always be marginalized in one or more dimensions, whereas the socio-cultural context and individual perception will define in which and in how many dimensions someone needs to be marginalized in order to be considered poor. The aim of establishing a concept of marginality is therefore to better understand the various causal complexities of poverty by deepening and broadening the scope of scientific investigation through: 1. identifying common causalities of poverty across scientific disciplines, and 2. including phenomena that are not typically considered as poverty or contributing to poverty alone (e.g., living in harsh or resource scarce environments). Deepening and broadening the scope of investigation thereby also includes incorporating theories and models from other (non-social science) epistemic cultures and scientific disciplines. In that sense marginality is not only a concept, but also a conceptual framework. It is a framework for different theories of poverty within which various models can be tested. Frameworks. Theories and models are understood as ânested set[s] of theoretical concepts, which range from the most general to the most detailed types of"

Such explanations ignore the wider social context of higher education, and how being an educated person can make one vulnerable to jealousy, resentment, and violence. Upper secondary schools, colleges, and universities in PNG are important sites for the socialization of an educated elite that understands itself as distinct from the rest of the countryâs largely rural populationânot simply because of the things they learn and the professional roles they eventually take up, but because of how the experience of education disrupts their connection to place, complicating their relationship with the potentially dangerous forces, human, and otherwise, inhabiting rural spaces. I argue that the financial demands of kin and the perceived threat of retributive violence from clients encourage health workers to see themselves as social outsiders. Students narrate their experience of higher education itself as being punctuated by occult violence and Satanic trials, which Pentecostal (and other) church social groups give them the power to resist. Pentecostalism, in this analysis, is less significant for its theological or epistemological stances than for the social function it fulfills: providing alternative forms of belonging that can mitigate the dangers of living between rural and âeducatedâ ways of being. These encounters with diverse forms of evil can be productively mapped onto a Pentecostal universalism that demands direct intervention and resistance: an âinsistence on taking control of the forces of life and death with universality as a key techniqueâ (Rio et al. this volume, 7). As other contributors to this volume have suggested, Pentecostal movements take a strongly practical and active stance against evil. They embrace fully the invisible world and take control of it. They describe the different forms of life and creatures that exist in it, and they offer techniques for taming it and making the invisible visible (Rio et al, this volume). Nursing education encourages a similarly practical approach to the various microscopic threats to human wellbeing, teaching health workers to make them visible and knowable to their clients. If Pentecostalism in Melanesia and Africa is âabout cleaning, dividing, dissecting, observing and healingâ (Rio et al. this volume, 27), then so too is nursing, a profession whose members frequently describe themselves as instruments of Godâs healing power. âWe treat,"

242,18,0.329,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Migration scholarship has been traditionally influenced by a twofold methodological bias inherited from positivist sociology and its epistemological orientations. Until recently, this bias treated the nationstate and the individual as relatively fixed units of analysis and shaped a large core of theoretical explanations about contemporary patterns of internal and cross-border movements (Wimmers/Glick-Schiller 2002). The central focus of migration studies has been the monitoring of stocks and flows of migrants, later extended to their patterns of remittances and their capability of assimilation and social integration in host societies. Refugees have been handled as a separate category, through different procedures of status determination and classification, thus producing the field of refugee studies as a distinct entity. Migration research, by and large driven by policy concerns, is often structured more by ideas concerning what should be rather than what is actually happening and emerging. Assumptions that are disconnected from the social worlds of migration can obscure significant aspects of ongoing social transformations. The intensification of various migratory flows since the 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall and processes of economic liberalization worldwide has posed huge challenges for policymakers and researchers. In particular, the transformation of the state from society-led to market-led, coupled with the rise of social network theories and theories of the in-"

Adaptive governance is a form of governance that incorporates formal organizations, informal groups and networks, and individuals at multiple scales for purposes of collaborative environmental management (Folke et al. 2005). Bridging organizations, enabling legislation, and government policies can also contribute to the success of an adaptive governance framework; governance creates a vision and management actualizes the vision (Folke et al. 2005). Adaptive governance works via sharing of management power and responsibilities and promotes a collaborative, participatory process. It is dependent upon adaptive co-management, and adaptive co-management in turn is dependent upon social networks for success. Social networks have the capacity to allow for development of new ideas, to facilitate communication between entities, and create the flexibility necessary for the interplay of the fluid (ecological systems) and the rigid (organizations) to be successful for environmental management (Folke et al. 2005).

In my own work on the Arctic I use both a intersectional and a security analysis approach. Both concepts are actively present politically and socially across the region, and they are intimately tied to environmental use (or exploitation) and change. The term security invokes power, whereby the utmost priorities of the person, state, social group are linked to the survival of values and practices for the future (Hoogensen GjÃ¸rv 2017). Many are quite familiar with the narrower, militarized understanding of security that focuses on the use of the military for purposes of defending one actor, the state, from existential threat (Walt 1991). However, when we think in terms of actors more broadly, and diverse practices to ensure survivial (and the diverse ways in which survival is understood), a much more complex analysis results. Through intersectional analysis, it is possible to best understand the dynamics and tensions between priorities and perceived futures for the Arctic. This can be exemplified with the concept of âhuman securityâ which has been increasingly employed in Arctic research to articulate linkages between individual and community values and prerequisites for survival, and political and social policy. Human security was popularised in the 1994 United Nations Human Development Report, expanding the notion of security to include dimensions of food, health,"

223,358,0.329,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Connecting aesthetic approaches to the analysis of the construction of social space therefore enriches the understanding of the relational processes of generating shared meaning and agreeing on how to behave in the current situation. Furthermore, the aesthetic dimension of experience plays a role in defining the scope for future social space because it has the âcapacity to animate actorsâ imaginations and actionsâ (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 46). In this chapter we use this integrated relational conceptualization of social and physical space to analyze data from a series of action experiments we organized in 2009 in Israel. We invited people in small mixed groups to explore together how to envisage a future social space in the same setting. We consciously intensified attention to the aesthetic dimension of the process from the outset by choosing a fine-arts studio as the setting and by providing art materials for the participants to use there, sharing the assumption that âcreative activity with portable, discrete objects allows an extension of potential spaceâ (Woodward & Ellison, 2010, p. 50). For this chapter we have decided to apply an aesthetic approach to the data analysis by focusing only on the visual documentation in order âto avoid committing the cognitive and rational error of ignoring the bodies of the people involved in the decision process and only considering their mindsâ (Strati, 2000, p. 20). Our objective is, therefore, to explore how much one can learn about processes of constructing current and future social space, in which physical relations are integrated, by including aesthetic dimensions of the experience in the analysis. The next section of the chapter describes the context in which we conducted the action experiments. It is followed by an explanation of the methodology that was used to collect and analyze the data. We then present an analysis of the sessions, in which we identify different configurations that evolved during the interactions of the participants with one another and with the physical aspects of a studio.

Moreover, like others, I found that applied work enlivened the basic one. Thus, when I tried to sort out when privacy should yield to the common good, for instance, to protect public health, I found it helped me think through more generally how one is to deal with clashes between two core values (Etzioni 1999). Most of what follows is applied. To some, the term âethicsâ evokes values such as veracity, loyalty, and truthfulness. However, the ethics domain is much vaster. It concerns itself with individual rights, social justice, peace, and much else. Cases in kind follow. They all deal with current challenges both in societies and on the global level. Part I asks how we can determine what a good life is. Many measure it by how happy people are. Happiness in turn is assumed to be derived from high income that enables one to lead an affluent way of life, mainly viewed as being able to consume a lot of goods and services. However, evidence shows that by and large (there are always exceptions when one deals with social science data), once income rises above the level at which peopleâs basic needs can be met, it adds little to their happiness. Other social scientists studied whether what one does gives meaning to life. However, meaning can be gained by joining a gang or ISIS. At least from an ethicistâs viewpoint and, as I see it, from most peopleâs personal viewpoint, something is missing, something rather profound, namely, the sense of doing good. It is a sense that leads people to make sacrifices not for self-glorification, not to feel good about themselves, but to service others. I am not writing about saints, but about parents who take care of a severely disabled child, about spouses who take care of their partners with cancer or Alzheimerâs, and about volunteers who go into places that are unsafe to help those in danger (see Chap. 1). The three Abrahamic religions have a clear perception of what human nature is; I call it one of a moral wrestler. Although they differ on the weight they accordâand the ways they depictâthe forces that make us stray, they share the basic understanding of human nature. For Catholicism, the original sin plays a greater role than the yetzer hara (bad instinct) in Judaism; and neither embraces the Protestant notion of predestination. Islam emphasizes humansâ inherent goodness (fitrah), which must be upheld against base desires and sinful outside influences. However, all see life as a struggle between doing good and being tempted to violate our sense of what is right; all see room for some form of punishment as well as redemption. Social science by and large, with notable exceptions, has moved away from this view of human nature. This is not true merely for economics but, we shall see, also for psychology, sociology, and anthropology. If we could do more to incorporate the concept of the moral wrestlers into the social sciences, we might be able to learn more about what makes for better human beings and better societies (see Chap. 2). Part II is dedicated to an examination of human nature. Are we out to maximize ourselves and does society work well when each person focuses on what they consider good? On a basic level, this issue has been debated as the difference between homo economicus and homo sapiens. Those who adhere to the rationalistic paradigm, the one that treats people as homo economicus, assume that humans have"

Regardless of where one turns in the region, there is an increase in the number and intensity of conï¬icts between groups committed to promoting economic development (i.e. growth), and those claiming to speak for the planet and/or the welfare of the large majority of the population or particular minorities, who feel excluded from these processes and are bearing the brunt of the negative impacts of these activities. This chapter addresses some of the underlying causes of these conï¬icts by giving voice to some of the actors who are actually involved in developing their own alternatives to the development proposals of the hegemonic forces driving the transformations in their societies. These alternatives emerge from groups whose organizations are shaped by different cosmologies, products of their multiple ethnic origins, and by the profound philosophical and epistemological debates of the past half-century that emerged from numerous social movements proposing different strategies for achieving progress, improving wellbeing and conserving ecosystems. While many past confrontations among social groups have produced compromises modifying individual development projects, few have created some space for the emergence of alternative social and productive structures that respond to the demands for local control of the governance process to assure local wellbeing and responsible environmental management. The analysis draws on an important emerging literature that proposes a different epistemology and methodology, reï¬ecting the direct participation of a diversity of communities around the world in research about themselves and their possibilities for implementing different approaches to improving their wellbeing. In spite of the widely separated regions and traditions from which they come, there are striking commonalities in their reï¬ections on how research should be conducted and how they might collaborate with âoutsidersâ in their search for ways to advance in their pursuit of an improved style of life and their ability to govern themselves. A notable early contribution from this intellectual and academic current was published by a Maori sociologist (Smith, 2012), reacting to the tendency of scholars from the principal academic institutions in New Zealand to make assumptions about local social structures, production possibilities, and the possibilities of and competence for innovations of their âaboriginesâ. Since this early text, a burgeoning literature has emerged, not only emphasizing the methodological limitations of much Western scholarship in the Third World but also extending the critique to epistemological, ethical and cosmological planes. The contributors to this process argue that since social"
99,488,0.328,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"social innovation was not an explicit priority in this city, it was met with sympathy even when it challenged dominant views in the political sphere. The concept was linked to actions of limited scope as offshoots of mainstream programmes, as a way to expand social action without expanding or containing direct public provision. Another example was the city of MalmÃ¶ in Sweden (Carrigan and Nordfeldt 2014). Innovation was made a key discursive concept in the policy arena around local welfare in MalmÃ¶. Political actors considered the concept a cross-political one and used it in the hope of attracting people and organisations from various ideological backgrounds. In both these cities, the concept of social innovation was supported by varied political coalitions, albeit for different reasons. At the same time, other social innovations among the case studies in the WILCO project were limited in their development because others downplayed the contested nature of their work or because they were bogged down by local political conflicts. It was sometimes impossible to distinguish successful from failed cases because there was no consensus on what their goals should have been. In the case of neighbourhood revitalization innovation in Zagreb, for example, a lack of coordination between local government offices and local city companies affected the visibility of the innovation in a negative manner (Bezovan et al. 2014b). Public strategies or social marketing were consequently not on the agenda due to political conflicts, including an unstable political situation, resignation of a mayor and local elections. Another example of political conflicts disabling social innovations was found in the city of VaraÅ¾din (Bezovan et al. 2013). The role and recognition of civil society in the development of social innovation has strengthened over time. However, as argued in the research, political turbulence and changes to power structures hindered the development of more systematic cooperation from being established. There are examples of cities and local contexts, such as Lille, in which the local political arena for social innovation remains weakened by attention paid to a limited number of other priorities due to economic crisis and budget cuts (Fraisse and Bia Zafinikamia 2013). There are also cities, such as MalmÃ¶, in which local political disagreements hindered the implementation of particular innovations (see Chap. 6 in this book). Even though there was political consensus about the need for new solutions in local welfare in general and the promotion of social innovation as a concept in particular, different stakeholders and coalitions disagreed regarding the methods and instruments to be implemented, affecting the emergence and development of social innovations. If the practice of social innovations has more to do with changes in social relations than products or processes, they are necessarily also conflict-ridden and political by nature. Those who claim to study the phenomenon with any seriousness must at least incorporate this much. Resistance and opposition, risks and dangers, as well as negative effects and misuse need to be taken seriously, regardless of the normative good of social innovations (Borins 2001). Such conflicts are rarely discussed in the current mainstream of social innovation literature. Ironically, in its denial of politics, social innovation literature is profoundly political. Being aware of the local context and by implication of the local politics was one of the hallmarks of the WILCO projectâs approach."

314,230,0.328,Building a Resilient and Sustainable Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa,"overlap through adaptive capacity (Berman et al. 2012). Some scholars view resilience as an integral part of adaptive capacity, while others consider adaptive capacity as a main component of vulnerability (Cutter et al. 2008). Moreover, there are scholars that see resilience and adaptive capacity as nested concepts within an overall vulnerability structure (Cutter et al. 2008). Cutter et al. (2008) viewed resilience and vulnerability as separate but often linked concepts. As for Turner (2010), vulnerability and resilience constitute different but complementary framings. Some researchers employ the term âresilienceâ to the coping capacity component of its framework, whereas others view vulnerability as an antonym of resilience (Turner 2010). Resilience can be considered as adaptive capacity in the case that it is used with an emphasis on society while also integrating environmental characteristics (Malone 2009). In this chapter, resilience is investigated through adaptive capacity, although resilience is not assumed as a synonym of adaptive capacity. Scholars recognize the potential of social protection in reducing poverty and moving people into productive livelihoods (Davies et al. 2008). Social protection refers to all initiatives (public and private) which have the potential to reduce the economic and social vulnerability of poor, vulnerable, and marginalized groups, and social protection interventions can be classified as protective, preventive, promotive, and transformative measures (Devereux and Sabates-Wheeler 2004). Consequently, social protection can reduce poverty and move people into productive livelihoods, and is of paramount importance in helping the poorest to reduce their exposure to current and future climate shocks (Davies et al. 2008). Land tenure security is integral part of social protection (Mahadevia 2011). In SSA, the livelihood of rural communities depends on land as key natural capital (Scoones 1998). Therefore, land tenure appears to be central to vulnerability and resilience research, although it is often overlooked (Berman et al. 2012; Chagutah 2013). Land tenure varies across households, communities, and individualsâ characteristics such as gender and social groups. Higher levels of tenure security are considered to be associated with higher living conditions, human development achievements, economic status, and access to entitlements (Mahadevia 2011). Through land tenure security people have protection against their involuntary removal from their land without process of law (Mahadevia 2011). Secure land tenure militates for diversified livelihoods and favor investment in appropriate technologies and"

Rosa, whom we got to know in Chap. 3, recounted that she had been asked by a neighbor: âWhy do you continue to work when you have two children working for the government?â Rosa told me this to exemplify la mentalidad (the mentality) that circulates among many people. If you have children working for the government they are able to pull strings in order to provide the things you need. And as government workers they are well positioned for getting their hands in the honey jar one way or the other. However, I suggest that it is a highly fictitious intellectual exercise to separate corruption at state level from corruption in other spheres of society (be it the business community or any other public or private institution or enterprise). Corruption is part of multi-vocal bundles of social practices that are thriving upon ambivalent norms and values, socially codified strategies for regulating supply and demand and historical formations of power and privileges. Thus, in essence, we need to understand how templates of corruption are historically dense and intimately intertwined with broader processes of state formation and social relations, forming part of a broader set of discourses and practices embodying and articulating social and political moralities. As this chapter has demonstrated, the Bolivarian discourse harbored on the one hand, a profound tension between everyday realities of social and political life, and on the other, ideals and visions of a different moral order that could engender a more just and harmonious society."
315,66,0.327,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"els of comparison tend to study various immigrant groups in the same place, either an immigration country or a city.9 These models, which stress the specificities of each group included in the comparison, are most often found in national research. Whilst allowing an in-depth focus at the group level in a specific place, convergent models tend to wipe off the changing historical conditions of social and economic participation for each group in the host countries. Divergent models, on the other hand, study one immigrant group in various destination places, allowing for a focus on contextual factors shaping the opportunities and barriers for integration. In her methodological essay Green explained that âdivergent studies [, which are rare,] locate the explanation of difference at the point of arrival and not at the point of departureâ (1994: 15). The examples cited in this chapter suggest that European data contains a mixture of convergent and divergent models. For the data comparing similar groups across places (such as SCIICS and TIES), the comparative strategy seems to be that of an extensive divergent model of comparison, moving beyond the observation on one specific group across countries and extending it to a certain number of specific groups. For the data comparing different groups across different places (such as CILS4EU and EFFNATIS), we can also talk about an extension of convergent models. The trend towards divergent models of comparison appears to have become more common in European research in the last decade (Ersanilli and Koopmans 2009; Huschek et al. 2010; Fleischmann and Phalet 2012). Two different sets of factors may account for this trend: theoretical and political. On the one hand, the change toward divergent research designs, especially those focusing on the local level, was triggered by the sharp critique of methodological nationalism, âthe assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern worldâ (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002: 302). The nation-state is obviously an important actor in setting out rules and regulations with regard to the entry and settlement of migrants. It should not be ignored when studying migrants and their descendants (Guiraudon and Lahav 2000; Teitelbaum 2001). However, critiques of this viewpoint questioned the ânaturalizationâ of the geo-political frame of nation-states as encompassing societal phenomena in general. In the specific case of the study of migration, it was argued that the focus on nation-states might be counterproductive for understanding migration and integration experiences (Vertovec and Cohen 1999; Bommes 2005). Focus on migration research at the national level also entailed a critique of an undue leveling out of differences within the âimmigration societyâ by its focus on national-level outcomes rather than more refined, and complex, outcomes at a more local level. Moreover, the development of the segmented assimilation theory of Portes and Zhou (1993), which focused on the importance of contexts of reception in shaping integration outcomes among the second generation, and the rise in popularity of transnationalism approaches (Levitt and Schiller 2004; Levitt It is important to note here that in her article, Green discusses convergent models with regard to the city as the chosen place, which aligns quite well with Glick-Schiller and Cagarâs (2009) argument that the city should be the main focal point for studies of integration."
17,13,0.327,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"and on being able to control or possess it (âgetting itâ). Thus these metaphors presuppose a static âbankingâ model, interpreting understanding as the acquisition, ownership or possession of knowledge (Sfard 1998). But secondly, there is an ideological assumption that understanding a concept or skill is better, deeper and more valuable than simply being able to use or perform it successfully. Skemp (1976) distinguished ârelational understandingâ from âinstrumental understandingâ, and posited the superiority of the former. However his co-originator of the distinction Mellin-Olsen (1981) used it to distinguish the modes of thinking of academic students from that of apprentices, thus bringing in a social context and even a social class dimension to the distinction, and imposing less of an implicit received valuation. If we want to assert the superiority of relational understanding over instrumental understanding it needs to be done on the basis of a reasoned argument, and not taken for granted as obvious. Skempâs own argument was based on the psychology of schemata, based on Piagetian theories, but this have been challenged by a number of alternate theories of learning including socio-cultural theory and social constructivism, drawing on Vygotskyâs theory of learning. According to Vygotsky knowledge is not something that the learner possesses but is a competence inferred from the learnerâs manifested ability to complete a task, either unaided, or, with the help of a more capable other, in what is termed the learnerâs zone of proximal development. Given current challenges to the underlying theories of learning, the assumption that relational understanding is superior stands in need of justiï¬cation. Some scholars have challenged the unquestioned pre-eminence of relational understanding. Hossain et al. (2013) question the accepted good of the related notion of âunderstanding mathematics in-depthâ because, as they show, its role in the identity work of some student-teachers is troubling to them.1 for example, one student teacher with the pseudonym Lola experiences a conflict between the imposed good of relational understanding, when studying England, and her own success within the norms of instrumental understanding that she internalized in her Nigerian upbringing (Ernest in press). Others have challenged the uncritical promotion of understanding within the mathematics education community because of its incoherence. Llewellyn (2010) questions âunderstandingâ partly because of slippage in the use of the term so that it encompasses both its relational and instrumental forms. However, her deeper critique is that in use it carries with a whole host of problematic assumptions about who can own âunderstandingâ in terms of ability, gender, race, class. Understanding is produced as hierarchical, particularly in relation to gender, social class and ability. It belongs to the privileged few, the ânaturallyâ able, which are often boys (another unhelpful and unnecessary classiï¬cation). To suggest that girls have a âquest for understandingâ is over simplistic and gendered and in the ï¬rst instance we should unpack how each version of understanding is constructed. â¦ Finally I suggest that student teachers In later work Skemp (1982) refers to instrumental understanding as âsurfaceâ and relational understanding as âdeepâ understanding, thus preï¬guring the depth metaphor in the more recently coined term âunderstanding mathematics in-depthâ."
28,189,0.326,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"a most important element in understanding the patient and his illness ... As we have seen, treatment in psychiatry is not solely concerned with the patient. It is concerned with the patient in his total environment which includes his family, his home, his work and all other areas of his existence that affect his mental wellbeing ... it is necessary to learn a great deal about the patientâs social constellation.59 This social constellation is not static. Changes are apparent during the 1960s as social workers are advised: âUnless financial hardship is patently a factor in the patientâs mental disturbance it is not usually necessary for the psychiatrist or the social workers to obtain minute details of family income and expenditureâ. In addition, it is ânot enough to record the district or municipal ward in which the patient lives as an indicator of his social statusâ due to housing shortages, housing policy and increased social mobility. Instead, âit is better to discover whether the patient is suited or unsuited to his home area and whether he and his family are happy to conform to the prevailing standards of the neighbourhoodâ. From implied previous concerns around poverty and fixed urban spaces (which are also traditional sociological concerns), the issue becomes one of adequate psychological adjustment within any given social environment: âThis account of the patient in his social milieu is a valuable background to the more detailed information on the patientâs emotional environment which the psychiatrist will gather from the patient himselfâ. Given McCullochâs interest in the subject, it is unsurprising that this co-authored textbook, Psychiatry for Social Workers, should accord a special place for social worker interviews around attempted suicide. It is noted that âwe [have already] described a schema for a standard social history, but in the case of attempted suicide there is a good deal of additional information which must be obtained before the significance of the attempt can be adequately assessedâ.

So-called dynamic capabilities should enable building and reconï¬guring internal and external resources including competencies (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000). The goal is resilient behaviour based on organizational agility (cf. Worley and Lawler 2010; Kirchmer 2011). In change management projects IT-afï¬nity tend to dominate (cf. Sambamurthy et al. 2003; Overby et al. 2006; Ngai et al. 2011; Kim and Suh 2012) although stakeholders1 and their communities play a crucial role for succeeding in those projects. Korpelainen and Kira (2013) revealed âthat most of the problems were identiï¬ed in the social context and only one ï¬fth of the problems were related to the employeesâ experiences of a lack of skills and competencies in using the IT-systemsâ. Apparently, it still holds what Hammer (1996, 1999) found out already in the context of Business Process Re-Engineering when revisiting the original, model-centric concept of Hammer and Champy (1993). Moving from adopting IT systems to organizational design involving human-centred work models and semantic process analysis (cf. Prilla et al. 2012) can be facilitated by business process modelling notations. Such a stakeholder-centred procedure needs to include the opportunity to transfer human experience and ideas into a process model for effective work support (Aschoff et al. 2003). Capturing work knowledge requires a context-sensitive BPM approach (cf. Ates and Bititci 2011; Silva and Rosemann 2012). Following the human-centred approach for organizational development has a cognitive, a content-oriented and social perspective. From the cognitive perspective, a semantically valid representation of work knowledge is required when stakeholders create models and when eliciting/documenting work processes. From the content perspective, models represent the baseline of organizational development. From the social perspective, an intelligible and executable version of models is required. They allow sharing, reflecting and experiencing processes through different roles and stakeholders (Fig. 3.11)."
169,459,0.325,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"sides have motivated and informed experiments to improve AM. Policy makers in general found the core AM cycle (Fig. 16.1) far too simple in its appreciation of the diverse inï¬uences that create the policy world in which they operate (Walters 1997). For example, Weick (1995) claims that a key challenge to adopting and implementing AM is that the basic concept may aim for the key management goal, but it does not give enough attention to one of the founding tenets of AM: the diversity of perspectives and goals among stakeholders. Many of them are driven by very different goals, which are tied to politics, business lobbying, or ideological stance and which are in turn linked with broader organizational and social contexts. Understanding these interactions is critical to a successful application of AM. Innovators in business management reached the same conclusion as government policy makers: the science of trends and causal mechanisms is critical to identify potential paths and related causes, but it must be complemented by appreciation of the most powerful factors that drive those causes and trends, e.g., the goals, paradigms, and mental models that drive the stakeholders (Senge 1990). Paradigms and mental models are like archetypes or basic templates of how we see the world, and we use them to ï¬lter information into categories like true or false and believable or incredible. For example, some see the world as a collection of individuals, whereas others see a hierarchical structure of power relations that connects everyone (see Kahan 2008; Yazdanpanah et al. 2014). The structure of relationships and the trends they generate arise out of these goals and mental models of society. How we interact and how those relations generate trends depend on how we think. How we think and what goals we use can be changed as part of the decision-making process. AM has been applied to foster this by creating a space thatâs safe to reveal our underlying thoughts and open the door for innovative compromises in thinking, policy, and action. Efforts to make business organizations more adaptive revealed a hierarchy of relationships between the factors that inï¬uence how stakeholders consider evidence (Fig. 16.2). Moving from the top to the bottom one encounters factors of increasing inï¬uence on how we perceive how our world works. Shallow analysis never goes beyond the tip of the iceberg, the events that periodically appear with no pattern that connects, and makes sense of them. Historians and statisticians might look deeper for those patterns that show us trends that brought us here or that suggest where we are going. Looking deeper one searches for the ways that we interact, the patterns of behavior, that create those trends. The network of such causal mechanisms is also referred to as the system structure. At the base are the most powerful forces that determine all the patterns above: the myths and paradigms we nurture or the goals that we as individuals or as members or an organization develop and follow. To summarize a vast and rapidly expanding ï¬eld in applying cognitive psychology to management, one still must pursue rigorous science and technical implementation, but achieving mutual understanding of the science and policy based on very different goals and underlying paradigms is essential. Science only becomes useful as the different perspectives in any dispute come to agree on how to deï¬ne the means to interpret and then implement science."

97,110,0.325,"Nature-Based Solutions To Climate Change Adaptation in Urban Areas : Linkages Between Science, Policy and Practice","There is still considerable need for fundamental research on the ecological characteristics that could mitigate the effects of extreme events and climate change. Sound ecological knowledge is the first building block for understanding how to design NBS to meet different needs. These needs can be understood as the âdemandâ for protection, and are very much determined by socioeconomic factors and cannot be captured by a biophysical assessment alone. An ecologically suitable NBS will only deliver expected solutions if it is sufficiently sized and adequately located (cf. Andersson et al. 2015). The answers to both these questions need to be sought in the larger social-ecological system â as is clearly demonstrated by the literature on vulnerability and exposure (e.g. Adger et al. 2005; Folke 2006). According to IPCC âvulnerability describes a set of conditions of people that derive from the historical and prevailing cultural, social, environmental, political, and economic contextsâ and âthe propensity of exposed elements such as human beings, their livelihoods, and assets to suffer adverse effects when impacted by hazard eventsâ (IPCC 2012, p. 71 and p. 69, respectively), while exposure refers to an âinventory of elements in an area in which hazard events may occurâ (ibid., p. 69). While the literature and common usage sometimes conflate the two they do capture different aspects. To be vulnerable you must be exposed to the risk, but exposure alone is not sufficient. Awareness of exposure together with appropriately planned and implemented adaptation measures may at least reduce the vulnerability of people and property. If NBS are to contribute to making communities less vulnerable they must be sized to match the magnitude of the disturbance and the extent of the exposed area. For example, bioswales and other types of green infrastructure being employed around the world in cities to provide NBS for mitigating surface flooding may fail if overwhelmed by large or extreme precipitation or flood events. Second, they need to be located in the right place. There are several possible spatial relationships between the source of the insurance capacity â the NBS â and where people and property may benefit from it (see e.g. Fisher et al. 2009; Renaud et al. 2016). Most usually, the insurance is achieved by the NBS providing a âbufferâ between the exposed area and the potential risk, e.g. wetlands upstream or along the coast outside a city (see Haase 2017, Chap. 7, this volume). This connection between the NBS and their beneficiaries is mediated by social structures such as built infrastructure"
72,155,0.325,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Notes 1. Linguists focus on these same dimensions. They recognise quasi-conceptsâ polysemy and describe such concepts as those which are not yet stabilised or are in the process of being destabilised (Bartsch, 2002, p. 50). For a more elaborate presentation of social innovation as a quasi-concept, see European Commission (2013). 2. In this group are other useful notions such as social cohesion (Jenson, 2010a; Bernard, 1999), social investment (Jenson, 2010b), social inclusion (Levitas, 2005) and social capital (McNeill, 2006). 3. The notion of welfare diamond presented here is clearly an extension of GÃ¸sta Esping-Andersenâs popular âwelfare triangleâ, which identifies the state, market and family as the three sources of well-being. I believe that it is a mistake and misleading to try, as he did, to subsume the welfare-generating community sector under the family corner of the triangle and to restrict the production of welfare to âmarkets (purchased welfare), families (the reciprocity of kin) and government (solidarity)â (Esping-Andersen, et al., 2002, p. 4). Hence I propose a welfare mix with four corners that make a diamond. For this representation, see also Evers, Pijl and Ungerson (1994) as well as Evers and Guillemard (2012). 4. The recognition that there is no single form led, among other conceptual exercises, to the large literature on welfare regimes (e.g., Esping-Andersen et al., 2002) and welfare mix (e.g., Evers and Guillemard, 2012). For a recent review of the results of such choices in local welfare systems, see Evers, Ewert and Brandsen (2014). 5. The OECD has been tracking mounting inequalities both in the OECD world and in the Global South for almost a decade. See, for example, OECD (2011, p. 22). 6. For one recent discussion of such examples, see Nicholls and Murdock (2012, especially Chapters 3, 5, 6). 7. It is interesting to note than an early precursor was Piore and Sabelâs Second Industrial Divide (1984), which argued that innovation for the late 20th century could come not from firms organised around the social relations of Fordism but from those harking back to the 19th centuryâs personalised social relations of craft production. A decade later, Charles Sabel led the team assessing the potential for social innovation of the Irish Governmentâs experimental âcreation of urban and rural area-based partnerships to address issues of social exclusion in a more flexible, decentralised and participative wayâ (OECD, 1996, p. 5). This assessment of partnerships with various civil society groups as well as local authorities concentrated in disadvantaged areas was quickly followed by a number of OECD studies of the innovation potential of local partnerships for local development (OECD, 2001). 8.

245,769,0.325,The European Higher Education Area : Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies,"In a somewhat more declaratory tone, the social dimension was further developed in the Bergen CommuniquÃ© (EHEA 2005) where the ministers committed: â[â¦] to making quality higher education equally accessible to all, and stress the need for appropriate conditions for students so that they can complete their studies without obstacles related to their social and economic background.â This commitment is made more generally to the social dimension of higher education as a whole. More notably, by delegating a responsibility to the Bologna Follow-up Group (BFUG) to collate data on the social and economic situation of students in participating countries, the ministers had set an expectation that, at the following conference in London in 2007, they would be presented a report on the progress towards this goal: âWe also charge the Follow-up Group with presenting comparable data [â¦] on the social and economic situation of students in participating countries as a basis for future stocktaking and reporting in time for the next Ministerial Conference. The future stocktaking will have to take into account the social dimension as deï¬ned above.â (EHEA 2007). The follow-up group delegated the tasks speciï¬c to the monitoring and developing of the social dimension to a newly established working group on social dimension and data on mobility of staff and students. The terms of reference for the working group (at least those immediately relevant to the social dimension) were the following: â¢ to deï¬ne the concept of social dimension based on the ministerial communiquÃ©s of the Bologna Process; â¢ to present comparable data on the social and economic situation of students in participating countries; â¢ to prepare proposals as a basis for future stocktaking (European Higher Education Area/Government Ofï¬ces of Sweden 2007). The working groupâs report to the London conference of 2007 presented several possible actions to foster the embedding of the social dimension in the systems of participating countries, including measures to promote equal opportunities and equal participation, widen access and participation in higher education. The requirement for national action plans for widening participation in higher education was also taken into consideration in the London meeting. The follow-up groupâs own mandate to the working group in 2005 to distil a deï¬nition of the social dimension from the pre-existing ministerial communiquÃ©s to date ï¬nally reached the most widely cited deï¬nition we have for the EHEAâs social dimension in the London communiquÃ©: âWe share the societal aspiration that the student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels should reflect the diversity of our populations. We reafï¬rm the importance of students being able to complete their studies without obstacles related to their social and economic background, while stressing the efforts [â¦] to widen participation at all levels on the basis of equal opportunity.â (EHEA 2007). Among the priorities for the following period until the ministerial conference in 2009, action plans and measures on the social dimension were introduced, as well as the intention (once again) to â[â¦] develop comparable and reliable indicators"
329,204,0.325,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"In such cases, some organizations employ impact analyses that adhere to local situations. For example, to buttress arguments in favor of microfinance, the Grameen Foundation created the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI). Aris Alip of the Center for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD) says of PPI, âNow we have objective poverty data on our clients thanks to the Progress out of Poverty Index and Grameen Foundationâs guidance on analysis; the results challenge us to do better.â14 The challenge with the PPI is that it measures changes in poverty, but cannot show causality with the loans that the borrowers received. Another similarity between the social enterprises in our study is the extraordinary degree of international acclaim and attention they have garnered. Telapakâs awards are listed above. Tree Planet has received the Reddot Design Award, Google Innovation Award, and the iF design award, among others. Landwasher was picked by Fast Company as one of the 50 most innovative companies in 2013. That isnât by accident. We wanted to study successful social delivery organizations (SDOs), and since international acclaim is one indicator of success, itâs only natural that our case studies found firms garnering accolades. But there is more to it than that. Because there are few successful social enterprises in Asia, those that do succeed reap a great deal of attention and kudos. These high-performing organizations ride the wave of interest in impact investing amid a scarcity of alternatives, especially in East and Southeast Asia. Lastly, all three social enterprises in our study benefit from a larger phenomenon of excitement about social enterprises, especially among young people. The Royal Bank of Scotland conducted a study that showed that people between the ages of 18â30 were more likely than the general population to want to start up a social enterprise (27 percent, compared to 20 percent), and more likely to consider supporting social causes that they are passionate about (70 percent, compared to 63 percent of the general population).15 Although no one tracks the actual ages of those running social enterprises in Asia, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence favoring the young. Nini Daing, CEO of MyHarapan, a youth-focused organization in Malaysia, puts it best: âThe challenges we face today require the naivety of our youth, our rebels with a cause, who are redefining success in their pursuit of a more meaningful life. The good news is that young people today are doing just this by rising up to take on these complex challenges to an unprecedented degree.â16"
298,40,0.325,The Globalization of Science Curricula,"It is important to note that our literature review was limited to research on the globalization of science curricula from 2010, with studies making use of TIMSS data extending back to 1995. However, it has been suggested that 1995 may be too late a starting point to detect changes in the globalization of curricula because by this time globalization had already exerted a large influence on science curricula (Rutkowski and Rutkowski 2009). This needs to be taken into account when considering the evidence for globalization in science curricula."
271,57,0.324,Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization,"communicative figuration? How far do practices of communication shift? And what are the consequences of this on a figurationâs relevance frames? Based on the research discussed so far, we can assume a number of possible consequences as a hypothetical set: the optionality, contingency and chances of participation in social domains might increase; social domainsâ communicative figurations might extend spatially; their borders might blur; there might be an acceleration and increasing immediacy within and across them; a disguise of agency might come about; media technology might stabilize sociality in social domains; social surveillance might take place; or all might result in segmentation, exclusion and division. While these assumed consequences are a starting point for future research, it remains an open question as to which of them is characteristic for which social domain, how these different consequences interfere with each other and even if there might be further consequences we are not aware of at present. In addition, we have to consider the different ways in which social domains relate to these trends in deep mediatizationâs changing media environment. They can be supportive of such changes, for example by always appropriating the latest media. Alternatively, by rejecting certain media, they can hinder these trends. For any empirical research, we need to have the dual character of possible consequences in mind. On the one hand, a changing media environment might have âinternalâ consequences for a social domainâ for example, optionality, disguise of agency or segmentation of figuration might take place. This is the case, for example, when relations in an organization change partly owing to the media that are used for"

72,286,0.323,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion Despite the complex nature of social innovation processes and the limited theoretical literature exploring the phenomenon, it is clear from the case studies presented here that collective intelligence has a role to play in promoting social innovation, both directly and indirectly. All three of the web platforms examined here promoted social innovation to some extent. Innocentive â the challenge grant example â featured a small sample of social innovation challenges and at least two examples of successfully launched social innovations. OSE â the innovation community example â took a radically alternative model of production and self-sustainability and not only considerably developed the idea with several prototypes, but also created a global shadow network dedicated to taking it further. Finally, TED â the open innovation platform example â publicised several social innovations and helped them to gain greater prominence and resources. TED also created an online community dedicated to seeing some of these socially innovative ideas realised in practice. It has occasionally helped to build cross-scale networks to support the realisation process. At the same time, no single platform seems to be able to support a social innovation from invention through to implementation. In fact, each of these different types of platform seems particularly strong in one particular phase: invention in the case of TED and Innocentive, and development in the case of OSE. Moreover, none of these platforms utilised all of the mechanisms associated with any one phase and none were particularly active in the implementation phase, although TED seems to have the greatest potential in this area. In many ways this reflects the strengths and limitations suggested by the theoretical literature in the introduction to this chapter. Collective intelligence platforms are indeed good at mobilising resources and sharing knowledge and creativity (e.g., TED and OSE); they can help realise the benefits of applying diverse knowledge sets to a single problem (Innocentive); and they are places where truly radical innovation can thrive (OSE). However, they have yet to demonstrate a capacity to be effective in the implementation phase where the ability to navigate complex political environments and form cross-scale networks composed of diverse interest groups becomes crucial. It is interesting to note how successful OSE was at attracting a truly committed group of volunteers willing to invest a significant amount of time and resources into a shared vision. This is contrary to the expectation that online models are best at forming loose networks and this may be linked to the"
293,118,0.323,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","The Study of Categories and Its Relevance for Policymaking Categories are central organizing structures in all human societies (Hancock 2007, 64). They are key in attributing sameness and difference (Stone 2002, 308), based on a combination of âachieved and ascribed traitsâ (Massey 2007, 1). Achieved characteristics are acquired in the course of living (e.g., being a member of a particular income class or a university graduate), while ascribed characteristics are set at birth (e.g., age and sex) (ibid.). The study of categories is well developed in sociology and public policy. Gender studies and migration and ethnic studies focus on categories in their critical assessments of processes of exclusion and discrimination of women, migrants, and ethnic minorities. In doing so, scholars in these ï¬elds examine social stratiï¬cation, referring to âthe unequal distribution of people across social categories that are characterized by differential access to scarce resourcesâ (ibid.). These resources may be material (e.g., wealth), symbolic (e.g., social standing), or emotional (e.g., love). Stratiï¬cation systems, Massey (2007) argues, order people vertically from a top to a bottom. A societyâs degree of stratiï¬cation is typically measured in terms of inequality, âwhich assesses the degree of variability in the dispersion of people among ranked social categoriesâ (ibid., 2)."
380,162,0.323,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"Manifestations of social inequality Viewing the physical habitat as a surface expression of much deeper social histories and historical-political developments, the city-valley of Caracas is, more than anything else, a testament to the unequal distribution of riches and radical differences in life quality that characterize not only Venezuela, but also the entire continent. Deep poverty and overwhelming luxury are found side by side, as in most Latin American cities. This is nothing new, but rather a basic feature of the continent since colonial times. Latin America and the Caribbean is the region of the world with the highest levels of inequality, characterized by three main features: â[inequality] is high, it is persistent, and it reproduces itself within a context of low socioeconomic mobilityâ (UNDP 2010:19). The continental shift to neoliberal policies in the 1980s dramatically exacerbated social inequalities. Contracted economies, a downscaling of the productive sectors of the economy with the subsequent contraction of job markets, de-regulation and privatization of basic services and the reduction of social spending all led to increasing poverty rates and more social inequalities. As part of this process of social disruptions and economic changes, a redrawing of spatial and social maps has been taking place in urban centers in recent decades. The essence of these recent urbanization processes are new forms of spatial segregation and social discrimination, whereby those who can afford it, that is, the middle and upper classes, increasingly withdraw from public spaces in favor of building âexclusive, fortified enclaves for their residence, work, leisure, and consumptionâ (Caldeira 2000:1). Caracas is no different in this respect. Those who can afford it live in mansions, gated communities and closed-off condominiums, pass their leisure time in expensive private clubs, use private transportation, send their children to expensive private schools and use private medical facilities. Vacations are spent in the USA, preferably Miami, and in Europe, Aruba, the Dominican Republic, or other high-class destinations. These are possibilities and places that are inaccessible for the poor. As a consequence, there are few or no spaces left for public interaction between those at the bottom and those at the top of the class hierarchy. The predominant types of cross-class encounters are those between employer and employee, and service buyer and service provider. âThe richâ know âthe poorâ only as their employees, security guards, maids, bartenders,"
222,87,0.323,Ecosystem Services For Well-Being in Deltas : integrated Assessment For Policy Analysis,"This research dynamically analyses the two most important ecosystem services in terms of livelihoods in the delta: agriculture (including aquaculture where appropriate Chap. 24) and fisheries (focusing on offshore capture fisheries Chap. 25) under future environmental change and management scenarios. The area and species distribution of the Sundarbans mangrove forest are also modelled with a preliminary assessment of ecosystem services including protection against storm surges (Chap. 26). These three key provisioning services were operationalised using seven social-ecological systems, defined as freshwater and brackish aquaculture, irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture, riverine and char environments, the coastal zone and the Sundarbans dependent zone (see Chap. 22, Adams et al. 2013, 2016). The social-ecological system classification recognises that although in certain regions a specific type of service may dominate livelihoods, households usually have more than one type of income source and that these sources may change through the year depending on the character of the ecosystem (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 2010). Households select different ecosystem services from within the bundle at different times of the year. Social-ecological systems are thus the result of human activities to mediate the negative impacts of environmental variability and to manage bundles of ecosystem services (MartÃ­n-LÃ³pez et al. 2012). Social systems dictate the rules of access to resources and influence the winners and losers of trade-offs between different benefits (Walker et al. 2004), ultimately affecting the relationship between ecosystem service dependence and poverty outcomes. The relationship between ecosystem services and poverty changes because social mechanisms and other factors co-vary with bundles of ecosystem services. For example, the presence of opportunities for supplementing incomes with open access resources (e.g. fisheries, forest products), land ownership, opportunities for sharecropping and leasing land, agricultural labour, access to off-farm income opportunities, the level of exposure to extreme events, the impacts of cyclones and storm"
218,0,0.323,Sustainable Development in The Jordan Valley : Final Report of The Regional Ngo Master Plan,"A peer-reviewed multidisciplinary Series of Reference Books and Monographs This book series includes monographs and edited volumes that cross scientiï¬c disciplines and develop common ground among scientists from the natural and social sciences, as well as from North and South, addressing common challenges and risks for humankind in the 21st century. The âhexagonâ represents six key factors contributing to global environmental changeâ three nature-induced or supply factors: soil, water and air (atmosphere and climate), and three human-induced or demand factors: population (growth), urban systems (habitat, pollution) and rural systems (agriculture, food). Throughout the history of the earth and of Homo sapiens these six factors have interacted. The supply factors have created the preconditions for life while human behavior and economic consumption patterns have also contributed to its challenges (increase in extreme weather events) and fatal outcomes for human beings and society. The series covers the complex interactions among these six factors and their often extreme and in a few cases fatal outcomes (hazards/disasters, internal displacement and migrations, crises and conflicts), as well as crucial social science concepts relevant for their analysis. Further issues related to three basic areas of research: approaches and schools of environment, security, and peace, especially in the environmental security realm and from a human security perspective, will be addressed. The goal of this book series is to contribute to a fourth phase of research on environmental security from a normative peace research and/or human security perspective. In this series, the editor welcomes books by natural and social scientists, as well as by multidisciplinary teams of authors. The material should address issues of global change (including climate change, desertiï¬cation, deforestation), and its impacts on humankind (natural hazards and disasters), on environmentally-induced migration, on crises and conflicts, as well as for cooperative strategies to cope with these challenges either locally or in the framework of international organizations and regimes. From a human-centered perspective, this book series offers a platform for scientiï¬c communities dealing with global environmental and climate change, disaster reduction, human, environmental and gender security, peace and conflict research, as well as for the humanitarian aid and the policy community in national governments and international organizations. The series editor welcomes brief concept outlines and original manuscripts as proposals. If they are considered of relevance, these proposals will be peer-reviewed by specialists in the ï¬eld from the natural and the social sciences. Inclusion in this series will also require a positive decision by the publisherâs international editorial conference. Prior to publication, the manuscripts will be assessed by the series editor and external peer reviewers."
56,74,0.323,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"ethnic and kinship groups, with relationships between migrants and non-migrant kin being âwritten in stoneâ rather than being dynamic over time (Lacroix 2013: 1021; see also Sinatti and Horst 2015). As Cassarino (2004: 265) notes: â[T]he transnational approach to return migration seems to encapsulate [migrantsâ] initiatives and projects at home in a fundamental set of mutual obligations, opportunities and expectations stemming from common ethnicity (i.e., the diaspora) and kinship (i.e., the family, the household).â Relying on mutual kin obligations in this way, the transnationalism literature cannot explain why some people are heavily invested in cross-border activities while other compatriots are not. In summary, the transnational approach has value in explaining how people maintain cross-border social ties (transport, communications technology), but it cannot fully explain why they do so. Social Systems By contrast, an emerging approach in migration and integration studies14 employs a theory of society in which there is no longer a place for preascribed membership in kinship and ethnic groups. Instead of society being constituted by large collectivities of individuals â be that in kin groups, tribes, ethnic groups or nations â Niklas Luhmann proposed an alternative theory whereby society is constituted by individualsâ communication in different social realms such as the economy, law, politics, religion, the family, education, and healthcare (Luhmann 1995). Access to such systems operates according to fundamentally inclusive criteria. In his theory of social systems, Luhmann locates a fundamental break between pre-modern and modern societies beginning in Europe during the course of the eighteenth century. Up until this time, society had been structured on the basis of group membership â either in âsegmentedâ clans or tribes, or in hierarchically âstratifiedâ classes or ranks (Luhmann 1977). With the fundamentally egalitarian restructuring of society unleashed by the French Revolution, membership in groups on the basis of ascribed or inherited characteristics became less and less important. Arguably, even membership in the nation-state has in recent decades lost some of those qualities which led Rogers Brubaker to describe citizenship as the âmaster statusâ (Brubaker 1994; Soysal 1994). The organisations of society â with the exception of the national welfare state in the political system â are increasingly unconcerned by demarcations of territory and national belonging (Bommes and Geddes 2000; Halfmann 2000). This is seen for example in the emergence of a global financial system, a corpus of international law, cross-border scientific cooperation, âhealth tourismâ, and supra-national political institutions. At first glance the foregoing may seem somewhat opaque, but Luhmannâs theory of functional differentiation is in fact extremely pertinent both to the question under consideration here, and to migration studies more broadly, for two reasons. Firstly, the theory provides a radical new framework for viewing migration by proposing that international mobility should not be understood as an exceptional act (Goldin et al. 2011), but rather as a perfectly expectable response to the inclusive and deterritorialised functioning of all social systems barring the political system.

299,130,0.322,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"consideration a host of social and psychological variables that influence preference formation. It is additionally beyond the scope of this chapterâand perhaps beyond the scope of human scienceâto present such a comprehensive, consolidated theory. The task of presenting a formal, universal theory is further complicated by the sheer variety of human experience. However, the lesson to be taken from these observations is simple: human preference formation cannot be reduced to a defined set of economic factors. Instead, it must be acknowledged that an indefinite number of environmental, biological, neurological, andâabove all, because how we are socialized determines to a large degree how we respond to the environmental, biological, and neurological conditions of our existenceâsociological variables, through processes that are not yet precisely described, account for vastly more variance in preferences than do economic factors. By taking a step back and considering the big picture rather than remaining wedded to a single disciplineâs assumptions, it becomes possible to sketch out a rough framework for how preferences might be formed and change, and hence the non-economic factors that ultimately affect choice behavior. Developing such a big picture theory would have three main benefits. First, it would go a long way toward helping to organize the sprawling literature on human preference and choice. Once a general framework is established, it will be much easier to understand how each study relates to the others, which, in turn, may help scholars to understand how the thousands of variables they disparately describe interact with each other. Second, it will facilitate a âcrossing of the Rubiconâ between economic and non-economic disciplines that will ultimately yield a stillincomplete but wiser, interdisciplinary approach to preference formation divorced from the âtheory-induced blindnessâ and jockeying for influence that is characteristic of todayâs theories. Third, such a framework would be much better for policymakers, who need a way of thinking about preferences that is universally applicableânot because it is a comprehensive theory of everything with models that are theoretically elegant but clumsy and unwieldy in the real world, but because of its flexibility and the ability to âplug inâ variables in the appropriate location when needed."
147,49,0.322,Trailblazing in Entrepreneurship : Creating New Paths For Understanding The Field,"ronment. In line with our comments earlier regarding the unique domain of entrepreneurship, although discussions about the specific definitions of âsocial entrepreneurship,â âsustainable entrepreneurship,â and âenvironmental entrepreneurshipâ are stimulating (as an example, see a review of multiple definitions of social entrepreneurship by Zahra, Rawhouser, Bhawe, Neubaum, & Hayton, 2008), these discussions should not become a perpetual debate that restricts or destroys interesting research because a study does not correspond to a pre-specified category of âsustainable,â âsocial,â or âenvironmentalâ entrepreneurship. By being more flexible about the boundaries of topics within the entrepreneurship field, we provide the space for scholars to explore these themes more freely, thus opening up the field to contributions that can expand our understanding of entrepreneurial phenomena (which, over time, might also converge into a commonly accepted definition of the field of interest). Compassion Organizing Positive psychology research has improved our understanding of how to alleviate peopleâs suffering (e.g., Dutton, 2003; Dutton, Workman, & Hardin, 2014; Dutton et al., 2006; George, 2013; Kanov et al., 2004; Lilius et al., 2008). A subset of this research has studied compassion organizing, âa collective response to a particular incident of human suffering that entails the coordination of individual compassionâ and recognizes that the structures and routines an organization uses for normal work can be repurposed to alleviate a memberâs suffering (Dutton et al., 2006, p. 62). Suffering, or âthe experience of pain or loss that evokes a form of anguish that threatens an individualâs sense of meaning about his or her personal existenceâ (Dutton et al., 2006, p. 60; see also Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003), can be caused by a number of factors, such as personal tragedies, work-related events, and disasters (Armstrong, 2011; Frost, 2003; Rynes, Bartunek, Dutton, & Margolis, 2012). Organizations are particularly well positioned to respond compassionately to member suffering. More specifically, through existing relationships with organizational members, organizations are able to collectively identify a memberâs suffering, feel that memberâs pain, and respond by repurposing current routines to lessen that memberâs suffering (Dutton et al., 2006; Kanov et al., 2004; Lilius, Worline, Dutton, Kanov, & Maitlis, 2011; Rynes et al., 2012). While much research has already been done on compassion organizing, scholars can add to and expand positive organizational research to"

This path dependency and the resulting inertia of science and policymaking can also be seen in the chemicals case, where the traditional primacy of risk-based approaches (e.g. the âTDG machineâ) is strong. This phenomenon cannot be observed to an equal degree either in the case of eutrophication, where the NEST-HELCOM model offered a comparatively new approach of science-policy interaction, or in the emerging domain of IAS, where an institutionalised form of assessment-management interaction is not yet in place. Furthermore, well-developed institutional structures as they presently exist for EU fisheries management also seem to allow for the establishment of improved deliberative processes, which at least potentially could result in improved analysis of the socio-economic dimensions of the respective domain of marine governance (cf. Linke and Jentoft 2014; Urquhart et al. 2014). However, apart from an incremental âopening upâ of the linear science-policy structures in fisheries, we cannot find such tendencies developed to a similar extent for eutrophication, IAS, chemicals or oil transportation. In the cases of eutrophication, IAS and chemicals, it may also be substantially harder to identify clear groups of actors definable as âlegitimate stakeholdersâ to be included in the policy system than when one particular group of actors, for example, âresource usersâ (fishermen) or oil transporters (shipowners), can be defined as such and often accused of causing problems e.g. by the media. A rather clear identification of legitimate stakeholders, as we see in fisheries management, is not apparent in the cases of eutrophication (where farming only represents one of several important nutrient sources), chemicals (with a complex web of chemical producing and using actors), IAS or oil transportation. Regarding uncertainties and stakeholder disagreements, the observed assessmentmanagement interactions do not seem to adequately address the key challenges posed by the different states of knowledge as described in Fig. 8.2 and the sociopolitical ambiguities involved. With regard to management responses dealing with different forms of uncertainty and stakeholder conflicts, thorough analyses of the specific risk characteristics are not apparent, i.e. of the social and natural knowledge requirements or of the suitability of different management strategies such as a traditional science-based assessment, a precautionary approach, deliberative methods for stakeholder participation or extended peer review, etc. (see Sect. 8.2 and Fig. 8.2). Instead, all the studied assessment-management interactions can be classified as building primarily on traditional science-based assessments, which are then applied to policy- and decision-making (Table 8.1). We see, however, a number of ongoing changes and developments in each of the cases that illustrate adaptive responses to the key management challenges studied here. For example, we detect advancing processes of deliberation and stakeholder inclusion in both the science and management sector in the fisheries case, as an attempt to deal with the principal challenges posed by uncertainty in assessments and management, as well as to address conflicts of interests among the key actors. Concerning eutrophication, we can see similar challenges emerging (i.e. stakeholder"

As a delegated authority it cooperates with the different ministries responsible. In the case of integration of immigrants it cooperates with the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy and in the case of refugees it cooperates with the Ministry of Interior. The institutional setting is recognised as quite complicated (for a deeper analysis see: LesinÌska et al. 2010) and what is most striking is that the responsibilities are dispersed. The Ministry of Interior strongly emphasises that although it coordinates migration policy, the integration issue is beyond its competence. For the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the integration of immigrants is low on the agenda. The Department of Labour in the same ministry also emphasises that its competence is restricted to labour regulations.

242,29,0.322,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Migration, Gender, Social Justice, and Human Insecurity and empirical research regarding womenâs agency in migration. By integrating macro-, meso-, and micro-perspectives, gender research on migration has produced new perspectives on (1) how migration systems evolve from gendered interactions between regulation and the actions of all those involved: migrants, employers, social networks, civic organizations, and law enforcement agents; (2) how the intersecting inequalities which shape the security-seeking actions of particular groups of migrants pose new challenges to justiceseeking actions. We will see this in detail in the chapters that follow. Gender is now approached as a matrix of power relationships operating at multiple levels: 1) as a resilient structure expressed through the various social and cultural meanings of being male and female that are embedded in the ethos of the state; 2) as a set of relationships that have organized the social and cultural reproduction of society; and 3) as the formation of identities and the definition of subject positions in a given social order. A key point of contention is whether the contemporary, economics-dominated framing of migration, and the diffusion of related practices of management, contain emancipatory potentials for marginalized migrants, or whether these have become another apparatus of power that has created new categories of gendered mobile subjects whose identities remain distant from the human rights framework based on citizenship as the main criterion of belonging. This has led to the exploration of the social construction of femininities and masculinities in migration. A small body of literature has now emerged on how transnational migration also impacts on masculine identities, norms, and conventions, and how men negotiate and reconstruct their identities as they encounter different gender regimes, rationalize their experience of racial discrimination, and find new lines of inter-group differentiation (Datta/McIlwaine/Herbert/Evans/May/ Wills 2008). Several chapters in this volume engage with those themes, including the studies by Haile and Siegmann (chapter 6), Sinatti (chapter 11), and Huijsmans (chapter 20). The use of âgenderâ as a heuristic device in several disciplinary interfaces (political economy, law, sociology, and anthropology) in migration studies suggests that satisfactory treatments of the relationship between gender and human rights require insights and angles of multiple kinds. Aspirations for a genderequal world cannot avoid employing epistemic vigilance to discern where and which thinking about âgenderâ is valid and how unjustifiable biases may be cor-"

224,274,0.322,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"Food security as a global field of governance and livelihoods/entitlements as concepts of a âsocial economyâ are very relevant in Africa and can be considered to be crosscutting issues (as are gender and environment). Livelihoods are very often constructed not only by private and public means but are also constructed through translocal systems of social and gender relations. Social security is a system made of gifts and distribution (upheld to a large extent by women) in a manner that links formal and informal institutions (Lachenmann 1997; Tanzania, Steinwachs 2006). Migrants created new and gendered translocal livelihood systems. In the past, only remittances were examined and critics made about the mere âconsumptionâ finality. Typically, money from young male migrants is sent to their mothers (the older women) instead of to the fathers (as I observed in Senegal). However, in some cases, migrants enter into agreements with local traders to avoid conflict within the family. In many cases, there are groups and associations that assist at the sending end in locations such as Paris or New York. A typical case is the shared responsibility for education and health services between different family and social networks, with links to kin living in towns and/or working in the formal sector. Consider the case of translocal gendered relations between two (ex) co-wives in Senegal. One woman takes care of all of their children as a housewife in the reproductive sphere with the support of a formally employed husband who has corresponding connections to state institutions, such as schools and hospitals. The other wife works in a semi-formal job in the peasant movement and takes care of matters in the nationâs capital, such as accommodation and university access for their children. She performs a variety of âself-help jobsâ. Her compensations and per-diems amount to a salary of sorts, and she establishes connections to formal state-authority structures and policies by means of her former work in the community development sector (she lost this job as a result of structural adjustment) (empirical case study by the author). Therefore âgendered social securityâ (social security in the widest sense of the term) or formal/informal connectivity are very important dimensions of embeddedness (Risseeuw and Ganesh 1998). Alternatively, problems of âinsecurityâ and sustainable livelihoods should also be considered. Women should be regarded as active providers/producers instead of passive recipients of social security. Furthermore, it"

Another reason for consensus is economic growth, important for all cities and enhancing the quality of life of residents, usually linked to social inclusion. Although social policy coordination in Birmingham is characterised by partnerships, decisions are not usually implemented without the involvement of local government. The chapter about Geneva by Patricia Naegeli shows that Genevaâs governance arrangements are built on a strong local and cantonal state that uses the support of subsidised non-profit organisations in order to implement local welfare decisions. In the Swiss context, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, this is quite an exception. It can be explained by a strong public administration that influences all local welfare decisions in a conservative way and the presence of a relative consensus among political forces to have âgenerousâ social policies. Yet since the 2000s, newcomer parties have challenged political stability and long-lasting conflicting debates within the city council and the cantonal parliament. Both the influence of neighbouring France, where social policies are centralised and state-oriented and the strong economy of Geneva that can finance âgenerousâ social measures are part of the explanation. However, in the governance of social challenges, social innovation tends to be incremental, and seems to happen within the public sector or at least, under the guidance of the local or cantonal state. Milan, the focus of the chapter by Giuliana Costa, Roberta Cucca and Rossana Torri, can be described as a city lost in transition. For more than two decades, Milan has been ruled by a strongly market-oriented system of governance, following the rhetoric that creating a âgood business climateâ is not only an effective way to foster growth and innovation, but also to eradicate poverty and to deliver higher standards of living. This approach has led to (a) a disinvestment in welfare services directly provided by the municipality, in favour of a more residual welfare system based on non-profit and private involvement and (b) a huge investment in neo-liberal tools of government for the economic development of the city, such as the promotion of international events (Expo2015) and large real estate investments through publicâprivate partnerships. After some scandals as well as a huge increase of social inequalities, municipal elections rewarded a new coalition following a style of governance oriented to a social innovation approach. However, the difficult financial situation of the municipality has reduced ambitions of the current government. The chapter by Benjamin Ewert on Berlin shows that for a long time the city benefitted immensely from the myth to be âpoor but sexyâ. The popular slogan, referring to the coexistence of impoverishment and creativity in the city, expressed very well the Berlin Zeitgeist promising âa good life for little moneyâ. Hence the city has been a home for creative workers, artists, cosmopolitans and young people from all over the world, literally speaking âchange agentsâ that sustainably co-designed Berlin as a place for unconventional life styles and innovative solutions for everyday challenges. This chapter argues, however, that Berlinâs sources for innovative capital may dry up in the near future due to the re-emergence of social challenges that tend to eclipse the improvements emanating from social innovations. There are very different ways of giving innovatory practices and organisations a preliminary place in the architecture of public policies and forms of governance. A new system"

The effect of nanotube breaking can be explained by the mechanical weakening of the nanotube in the area where a large mixed supramolecular system is attached. This phenomenon can also be explained by changes in the electron structure of the nanotube and the supramolecular system bound to it. The dispersion of carbon nanotubes based on their interaction with CR is simple, efficient and reproducible. Supramolecular systems (both pure CR and mixed) allow not only to disperse carbon nanotubes, but can also bind other compounds through intercalation. As carriers of different compounds (e.g. fluorescent dyes, drugs, metal ions), these complexes present an interesting alternative to the currently used systems. They can be used in diagnostics as well as targeted delivery systems for drugs or metal ions.

303,11,0.321,Multiculturalism and Conflict Reconciliation in the Asia-Pacific,"knowledgeable (cultural anthropology and international relations), we can claim without too much controversy that culture and civilization, joined as they are historically, have been threading their way into discussions of difference, appearing at crucial junctures to create seemingly unbridgeable chasms between peoples. This is increasingly evident both in media and in everyday use, as well as in social science analyses, like some unfinished business of the past returning to remind one, almost in a melancholy manner, of the excesses of past misdeeds (Gilroy, 2005). Anthropological discussions that blossomed out of the problem of âWriting Cultureâ (Clifford & Marcus, 1986), and the predicament that culture presents for ethnographers and others (Clifford, 1988) exposed the dilemma of trying to pigeonhole entire peoples under a single unifying term, especially when those doing so were the prominent outsider insiders (i.e. anthropologists themselves). However, the complexity of what to do about the grand scheme of difference remains. Arguments for writing âagainst cultureâ (Abu-Lughod, 1991) and suggestions to âforget cultureâ (Brightman, 1995) meant that anthropologists have in the last two decades been extremely wary of an overarching culture concept unified by the âheroicâ narratives derived from hard-earned research in the field. While some have suggested that culture can still be retained as a reasonable mode of analysis, especially if care is taken to avoid overgeneralizing (Brumann, 1999), the penchant for thinking against culture as a certifiable category for more than convenience is assumed by much contemporary anthropological research. Civilization discourses, bound together with the pathology of 20th century modernity out of control (genocide and racism), have also been similarly viewed with scepticism by many social scientists, including in detailed treatments in anthropology (Patterson, 1997) and global history (Mazlish, 2004). Patterson focused on the (not coincidental) historical overlap of Social Darwinism and the discourses of civilization, industry, and progress, illustrating how these were instrumental in the âinventionâ of barbarian peoples and the ensuing genocidal actions of colonial powers in the Americas through the slave trade and wars with native peoples. Mazlish traced the first usages of the term âcivilizationâ to Victor Mirabeau in 1756 and its link to European colonial ideologyââa racial interpretretation of civilization in favour of Europeâ (Mazlish, 2004, p. 70)âas the 18th century gave way to the 19th century. Nonetheless, despite such critiques, both culture and civilization have steadily found their way back into common parlance, even for some as synonyms of superior models of human development, particularly (but not entirely) through reactions to political events after September 2001.

242,1143,0.32,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","For the research team that has been involved in studying Nicaraguan migrants in Costa Rica, various challenges have come up in the attempt to intervene in policy formulation, the critique of imaginaries, and community work. The first one refers to the ethical dimension, and relates to the responsibility that follows from listening. In other words, listening does not just involve attentively following what the migrants are saying, but it also involves raising questions about the ways in which what was said could be translated to decision-makers. Here there seems to be an important challenge for the social sciences, since needs assessments are frequent, and most often agree in their main conclusions, but there is usually no great willingness to follow up on the demands that are identified. A second challenge consists of the possibilities of creating work teams in which colleagues with different backgrounds can contribute to the research work and the ways in which the main findings can influence public policies, but also to the political work in a broader sense. The demands posed by the communities recall the tensions that arise from the relations between those social science perspectives most centred on analytical or comprehensive perspectives and those most interested in normative perspectives. Such tensions become more alive when what they are dealing with is not so much reproducing the analytical/normative distinction, but linking and articulating findings and policy-making (or politics) based on concrete situations and cases."

There is now great interest in the application of investment methods from venture capital and private equity to social problems, and many claims that these can deliver better â or, at least, different â social outcomes than traditional grant funding or government action.

269,171,0.32,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"(not least the neurosciences), we throw our lot in with those disciplines â that we are, in other words, co-producers of the very epistemic power from which we claim to distance ourselves (Cooter 2011, 2014). Worse (we caricature here): the sciences with which we are entangled have been the source of deleterious discourses on, for example, race, class, and gender; that scholars in the social sciences and humanities had long built up a conceptual armature to counteract such discourses; and that by mingling those concepts with the methods and theories of the neurosciences, people like us actually evacuate the space for such critical work. To the extent that people become raced, gendered, and classed subjects through particular relations of power, and to the extent that scientific research has bolstered and solidified such relations (especially when it is increasingly licensed to talk about social life) â then our dirge for subjugation starts to look hollow indeed. This is a vexed and serious critique that we cannot do justice to here. It is undeniably true that neuroscientific research has been mobilized in deeply problematic ways (we say âmobilizedâ to gesture at the frequent distance between research in the laboratory and its diverse applications). There is now an extensive body of research on the effects of neuroscientific discourses on policy, especially as that policy has been brought to bear on predominantly working-class and ethnic minority families (e.g. Edwards, Gillies and Horsley 2015; Lee, Macvarish and Lowe 2014; Pykett 2015). There is an even more prominent discourse about neuroscience and gender, which is often self-consciously essentializing (e.g. BaronCohen 2003) â resulting in popular claims that are, as the psychologist Cordelia Fine has pointed out, sometimes âspuriousâ or âmisinterpretedâ (Fine 2010, 283). âThe imaginative readerâ, Fine goes on, will not have too much difficulty envisaging how, by reinforcing stereotypes, such claims may affect peopleâs social attitudes in ways that oppose progress toward greater gender equality, just as such claims did in the past.

They analyse the hegemonic narrative concerning this historical process as conveyed by a museumâs exhibits along with the indigenous counter-narrative as registered and supported by the local Mapuche community. Their analysis shows that the hegemonic narrative tends to negate the conflict between the two groups by rendering the indigenous group invisible and representing their identity in an anachronistic fashion. The counter-narrative evidences a tension between indigenous peopleâs need to assert their identification with their ancestors and secure recognition from the dominant group, whilst also allowing for change and transformation in their midst. In Chap. 6 Giovanna Leone describes what happens when history teaching breaks down social denials of past ingroup wrongdoings. These denials often occur when former victims of past violence are weak or isolated. She argues that reactions to teaching dealing with sensitive historical issues have to be set apart from reactions to teaching dealing with historical facts denied in the general social discourse. The article proposes to consider the latter as a special instance of parrhesia. foucaultâs theoretical stance is discussed, who expects that parrhesia may lead to positive effects for listeners able to accept a difficult truth. Then, a case study on reactions by Italians to evidence of socially denied Italian colonial crimes is presented. Michal Bilewicz, Marta witkowska, Silviana Stubig, Marta Beneda and Roland Imhoff (Chap. 7) relate their social psychological research to Holocaust education which is one of the most widely taught historical matters: it is present in school curricula as part of history classes, but also in human rights education, ethics, philosophy and general social studies. Yet, many studies point to the fact that Holocaust education is not effective in providing knowledge and raising an emotional approach to this genocide. This chapter reviews empirical research conducted in Germany and Poland showing the main shortcomings of current Holocaust education and interpreting them from a social psychological perspective. Alternatively, they propose three alternative approaches to Holocaust education based on their findings.

164,558,0.319,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were being set in 2000â2001 social protection was barely mentioned. Ten years later in 2010 at the United Nations âMDGs + 10 Summit,â sessions on every one of the eight goals referenced social protection programs as a means of achieving poverty reduction targets.2 In the short term, well-designed social protection programs reduce poverty levels and ameliorate related suffering, particularly among the poorest (Barrientos and Hulme 2008). In the mid-term they allow many poor people to exercise their agency and pursue micro-level plans to increase their productivity and income. In the longer term, they create a generation of healthier and better educated people who can seize economic opportunities and contribute to broad-based economic growth. Additionally, when sudden crises spread across the worldâas with the 2008 triple whammy of global food, fuel and financial crisesâthese programs help poor families cope with the unpredicted consequences of globalization. Expanding across the Global South is a heterodox analysis that sees welldesigned social protection schemes as contributing to several goals at the same time. Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, India, Indonesia, and China are paving the way, but the idea is spreading via a genuinely southern revolution.3 The focus is on trusting the poor to use money wisely and to pursue objectives that poor people already want to doâsend their children to school, improve their diet, and make small investments to increase their income. Cash transfers work especially well when money is targeted at a relatively large group of people and is perceived as social assistance. Aid donors from developed nations, now calling themselves development partners, have responded after seeing that cash transfers have become an important part of social protection and increasingly recognize them as a legitimate development strategy. Aid donors and some elites in developing countries (especially ministers of finance and business elites), however, have much less trust in the poor. They tend to use terms like âsafety nets,â âhandouts,â and âdolesâ derogatorily, and to view transfers as temporary or short-term solutions, rather than strategic elements that can help raise agricultural productivity, support micro-enterprise, and foster economic activity in marginalized regions. From the USA, where the poor are often blamed for their poverty, the tendency is to emphasize the centrality of conditionsâsuch as school attendance for recipientsâ children or engaging in public serviceârather than to recognize conditionality as one design element of a program. Some programs work better with conditionality while others do not. Schady, one of the authors of the World Bank report Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) is a strong advocate of conditions because he is convinced that the problem is the âpersistently misguided beliefsâ of the poor (Fizbein and Schady 2009, 9).4 Indeed in the USA, many specialists are not aware that unconditional cash transfers are a major element of social Hulme attended the MDGs + 10 Summit and witnessed this by agencies keen to incorporate social protection, social floors, and conditional cash transfers into future strategies.

Also, by equipping them to understand different viewpoints, they make citizens more tolerant of each other (a point that applies across national boundaries, of course, and so the humanities can be seen to be useful in an increasingly globalised world).

376,323,0.318,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Nonequilibrium Ecology and Resilience Theory David D. Briske, Andrew W. Illius, and J. Marty Anderies Abstract Nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory have transformed rangeland ecology and management by challenging the traditional assumptions of ecological stability and linear successional dynamics. These alternative interpretations indicate that ecosystem dynamics are strongly influenced by disturbance, heterogeneity, and existence of multiple stable states. The nonequilibrium persistent model indicates that plant production and livestock numbers are seldom in equilibrium in pastoral systems because reoccurring drought maintains livestock number below the ecological carrying capacity. However, it has recently been demonstrated that livestock are often in equilibrium with key dry-season resources, even though they may only be loosely coupled to abundant wet-season resources. Similarly, state-andtransition models were initially influenced by nonequilibrium ecology, but they have subsequently been organized around resilience theory to represent both equilibrial dynamics within states and existence of multiple states. Resilience theory was introduced to describe how ecosystems can be dynamic, but still persist as self-organized systems. It envisions that community structure is maintained by ecological processes representing feedback mechanisms and controlling variables to moderate community fluctuation in response to disturbance. Appropriate qualification of equilibrium ecology within resilience theory, rather than its complete replacement by nonequilibrium models, provides more realistic interpretations for both plantâherbivore interactions and vegetation dynamics than does complete reliance on disturbance-driven events. Resilience thinking represents a âhumans-in-natureâ perspective that emphasizes human values and goals and it seeks to guide change in social-ecological systems by creating opportunities for multiple stakeholders to adaptively design management strategies and policies.

Structure contributes to the shaping of the individual resource portfolio and can either enhance or limit oneâs exercise of agency. The two-pronged approach of âagencyâ and âstructureâ sounds fine in an abstract conceptual sphere, but how does the approach pan out in practice? Kleine suggests that the choice framework can help development priorities be more participatory, engaging the recipientsâ interest and considering local and cultural elements into programme formation and implementation. It operationalises Senâs capability approach, linking ICTs as the means which are imbedded in agency and structure which eventually lead to individual choices. The choice framework requires greater work in terms of measurability, as the author admits that it is more easily applicable to individual level than at aggregate meso- or macro-levels. Bhatnagar and Singhâs (2010) assessment of Indian e-Government initiatives examines national-level data, accompanied with fuzzy measurability and myriad complex relationships. The framework identifies key stakeholders and client value by measuring cost to the client of assessing services and their perception of the quality of service and governance. The research question investigates values that can both be monetised and those that are intangible, across multiple stakeholders (beneficiaries, implementation agencies and society), thus requiring a range of methodologies to capture the overall rating for a projectâs impact. In the chapter âAn analytical framework to incorporate ICT as an independent variableâ, Dodel presents an analytical framework based on Selwynâs (2010) âImpact Assessment Frameworkâ that includes hierarchical stages of ICT involvementâaccess, usage, appreciation and outcomesâon development. These scholars argue that ICT research would gain greater relevance to non-ICT researchers by including these variables in addition to measures of individual wellbeing. The model was tested on a sample of young Uruguayans, finding that digital skills were a significant influence on their occupational achievements. Supporting such an analysis, Chew et al. (2011) claim that quantitative analysis is more likely to provide rigorous tests of causality. In their study on ICT use in women-run microenterprises, these scholars find a statistically significant, but limited, causal relationship between access to ICTs and business growth. The authors claim that at the macro level, ICTs have had an overall positive impact in terms of economic growth; however, at the micro-level, it is difficult to find such evidence and, in this case, for micro-entrepreneurs, mostly, due to the cost issues in adopting computers. These examples underscore the challenges of validating higher-level abstractions with measurable empirical evidenceâconceptual frames that can bridge local and national-level projects."

381,26,0.318,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"communities; and children in most neighborhoods participated in sports and clubs. But over the past generation or two, social capital has become more strongly related to human capital; that is, those with limited human capital are even more disadvantaged because they often lack necessary social capital, and those with more human capital tend to have the networks, norms, and behaviors that provide the most benefit in todayâs environment. Educational Testing Serviceâs Opportunity in America initiative defines opportunity as pathways to the development of human and social capital. Those pathways may be more or less open for individuals based on the circumstances into which they are born and the trajectory of their lives. The presence or absence of opportunities to develop human and social capital, as well as the choices individuals make to take advantage (or not) of those opportunities, translate into distinctly different life outcomes and, as the generational cycle continues, lead to differential prospects for their children. This transmission of opportunity from one generation to the next is driven by the dynamics of advantage or disadvantage, with one advantage building upon another for some children, while one disadvantage is compounded by the next for others. The result is diverging destinies that are increasingly defined by circumstances of birth. While birth circumstances have always impacted an individualâs life chances, todayâs children are being born into an America that is increasingly polarized along economic, educational, and social lines, an America where it is harder to make up for early gaps in opportunities to develop human and social capital. This is not in anyoneâs best interests. It not only impacts this generation and the next, but also the very quality of our society and, ultimately, our democracy. This volume is an important part of the ETS initiative, which is designed to advance the national conversation about opportunity in America, as it serves as the empirical undergirding for the other parts. The chapters address a number of topics and perspectives ranging from education and demography to economics and political science. The authors shed light on a variety of issues and challenges regarding inequality of opportunity, but they also offer insights into policies and practices that could help us think anew about how to move in a direction that is more in keeping with our national values and ideals. Of course, it is obvious that a single volume, no matter how rich, cannot hope to capture the full complexity of the current situation. There are multiple forces and policies acting at different levels: supranational, national, regional, and local. Supranational forces like globalization, the accelerating infusion of technology into different workplaces, the increasing power and reach of information and communication technology, and even cultural shifts are not easily tamed at the national level. But other forces are driven by policies adopted by various levels of government. They range from national economic and social welfare policies to state laws governing education funding, collective bargaining and right to work, and local zoning ordinances. These forces interact in complex ways over time that shape trends in opportunity. Moreover, the dynamics play out in systematically different ways depending on location, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other factors. Thus, we should always bear in mind that oft-cited national averages can conceal"

The need to further extending life-cycles could also be caused by environmental motives, driven by user requirements or societal push. Inherently long system life-cycles and the push for further life cycle extension motivate the need for repeated system upgrades. Within each cluster the viewpoints of a broad range of actors, such as design engineers, service personnel, sales staff, managers, decision makers, and end users, were taken into account to create comprehensive systems views. The broad scope of the study allowed for applications supporting both a horizontal integration, i.e., through the life-cycle, and vertical integration, i.e., âshop-floor to top-floorâ. In addition, the collaboration between research and practice as well as between seemingly unrelated industries proved beneï¬cial and provided new viewpoints to identiï¬ed problems (Fox and Groesser 2016). This observation is in line with previous research supporting the hypothesis that good ideas emerges from the intersection of diverse social worlds, i.e., across âstructural holesâ in knowledge networks (Burt 2011). The research setting, including the six industry clusters, different research targets and multiple actor viewpoints, provided the material to study applications on two different levels: ï¬rst, on a generic level to analyse commonalities across the clusters and conceptually develop the UIW-approach for dealing with shared issues. And second, on a cluster-speciï¬c level to analyse individual use cases to provide bespoke solutions based on the tools and methods of the UIW-framework. This two-level approach was designed to ensure the applicability and practice-orientation of the UIW-approach and the transferability of speciï¬c solutions to other industries facing similar challenges."

Individuals need bonding with others to flourish. A considerable number of studies show that when people are cut off from their social moorings, when they are isolatedâin prison cells, in high rise buildings (especially the elderly), or in psychological experimentsâthey show many signs of diminished cognitive and emotive capacity. Scores of other studies show that they thrive when they are involved in lasting meaningful relations with others (see Helliwell 2003; Fratiglioni et al. 2000). That is, communal bondsâwhich are prima facie particularistic, because all communities, including families, local communities, and nations, exclude most peopleâare an essential part of that which constitutes an individual."
35,273,0.316,Aquaculture Perspective of Multi-Use Sites in The Open Ocean : The Untapped Potential For Marine Resources in The Anthropocene,"(see examples given in Barrett et al. 2002; Bunting 2004; FrÃ¶cklin et al. 2012; Isaksen and Mikkelsen 2012; Jentoft and Chuenpagdee 2013; Sandberg 2003; Sievanen et al. 2005; Varela 2001). In many cases the omission of relevant stakeholders and social concerns in aquaculture development projects has contributed to inequity, social conflicts and violence (Martinez-Alier 2001; Nagarajan and Thiyageasan 2006; Varela 2001). The unavoidability of feedbacks between largely structural and technical interventions and the socio-economic systems within which they are embedded, highlights the need for employing more systematic (or ecosystem) approaches to analyse cause and effect relationships and to explore future sustainable, efï¬cient and equitable development scenarios (Hopkins et al. 2011; Belton and Bush 2014). This raises the question, what processes are needed to include issues and concerns that are not currently promoted by active and resourceful stakeholders (Buanes et al. 2004). This is especially important in offshore areas under multi-use conditions, since this is a novel line of resource use which lacks yet experiences on which stakeholder groupâs work well together under which governance and management conditions and what type of socio-economic outcomes can be expected. Indeed, more detailed and context-speciï¬c socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture operations include many important factors which need to be understood: gender, employment and income, nutrition, food security, health, insurance, credit availability, human rights, legal security, privatization, culture/identity, global trade and inequalities, as well as policies, laws and regulations, macro-economic context, political context, customary rules and systems, stakeholders, knowledge and attitudes, ethics, power, markets, capital and ownership (Hishamunda et al. 2009). Certainly, the lack of consensus on the social dimension is striking when compared with the universally accepted general deï¬nitions that exist for the biological and economic dimensions for sustainable ecosystem management (Krause et al. 2015). This is even more so the case of offshore marine management. Based on the existing literature from coastal aquaculture (see references below) we identify these major types of socio-economic dimensions of aquaculture which are universally applicable: (a) Attitudes to and perceptions of aquaculture and its effects (b) Organization of and participation in planning for aquaculture (c) Direct beneï¬ts of aquaculture and their distribution (d) Negative effects of aquaculture production activities and conflicts with other interests (e) Effects on the wider economic and innovation system (f) Effects on cultural fabric and other social aspects As the list indicates, the social implications of aquaculture are multi-dimensional and affect multiple levels. As a starting point of this analysis, we capture what we account as social dimension by stating what aspects of aquaculture we have excluded: The internal organization and efï¬ciency of the aquaculture production units, and the ecological effects of aquaculture production (including biological,"

72,215,0.315,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Whereas both the Reinventing Government movement and the attempt to spur technological innovation in the public sector focussed on a combination of organisational and process innovation, the recent emphasis on social innovation has shifted the innovation agenda in the direction of service and policy innovation. Social innovation emerged as a concept in British and French debates in the 1960s and 1970s but was only recently embraced by the European Commission, which described it as âinnovations that are both social in their ends and in their meansâ (European Commission, 2010). The scholarly definition of social innovation varies, but one of the authoritative sources defined it as âinnovative activities and services that are motivated by the goal of meeting a social need and that are predominantly developed and diffused through organisations whose primary purpose are socialâ (Mulgan et al., 2007, p. 8). There are two important novelties in this definition of social innovation. First, the purpose of innovating is not merely to make the public sector more efficient but rather to develop new programmes and services that aim to meet unmet social needs. Second, innovation is not created merely by actors and processes internal to the public sector but involves deliberative attempts to tap into the creativity of charities, associations and social entrepreneurs in order to find new ways of meeting pressing social needs. The notion of âsocial innovationâ has not caught on to the same extent in all Western countries, and the discourse on social innovation appears to be stronger in the Anglo-Saxon countries than in continental Europe, despite the attempts of the European Commission to promote social innovation as an important response to the economic and social crisis in Europe (European Commission, 2010; 2013a; 2013b; BEPA, 2010). However, the underlying idea that public innovation should both seek to make the public sector more efficient by reforming administrative processes and organisational designs and serve a social purpose by fostering new and better policies and services is shared by policy makers, public managers and public employees in many European countries (European Commission, 2013b). As such, the key question is no longer whether the public sector should aim to spur innovation in policy, services and organisational designs in order to enhance the production of social and public value but, rather, how this can be done."
28,110,0.315,A History of Self-Harm in Britain,"my salvationâ, as his work at Mill Hill on effort syndrome provides the basis for his first such experiment in this kind of therapeutic organisation.57 Rees relates in 1945 that it âoften occurred to me during this war how adequate a machine this child guidance team has been. Quite unconsciously the organisation of the War Office Selection Boards ... has turned out to be on exactly parallel lines. Here also there is a team: a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and the regimental officer whose function is more sociological than militaryâ.58 Here child guidance, the team approach and the war are run together as a powerful innovation. Instead of simply treating symptoms in order to return men to the front lines, Wilfred Bion at Northfield sees the army psychiatristâs task in terms of social adjustment, an effort to âproduce self-respecting men socially adjusted to the community and therefore willing to accept its responsibilities whether in peace or warâ.59 Tom Main, describes âtherapeutic social fieldsâ through which patients would progress on their journey back to adjustment and health.60 The language of community, social field and adjustment pervades these wartime endeavours to treat mental disorder. Kenneth Soddyâs booklet, Some Lessons of Wartime Psychiatry, recommends that a âpsychiatric social serviceâ be established to deal with mental disorder, mental deficiency and maladjustment.61 During the war, James Mackintosh, professor of preventive medicine at Glasgow, argues that â[t]he expected result of this [wartime] work is that local authorities ... will desire to place the whole scheme on a more permanent footing and make their own appointment of a psychiatric social workerâ.62 Invigorated and validated by the war, the concerns of (psychiatric) social work, centred upon the family, the child and adjustment to the social setting go from strength to strength as part of a broad political project in post-war Britain.63 Influential studies from Aubrey Lewisâs Social Psychiatry Research Unit by George Brown, Morris Carstairs, John Wing and others build from this position of strength, focusing upon the role of the family in the course and recovery rate of conditions such as schizophrenia.64 Nikolas Rose describes this post-war project in terms of âminimizing social troubles and maximizing social efficiencyâ and notes that psychiatric social case work, through ideas about familial relations, is able to access and intervene upon âthe internal world of the home ... in a new wayâ.65 Mathew Thomson argues that social workers are seen during the 1950s and 1960s as âshock troopsâ of a movement to spread psychological and psychiatric understandings of self and surroundings, with âan ability to reach into the homeâ.66 Eghigian, Killen and Leuenberger describe a post-war ânew wave of state interventionism ... directed at women,"
36,857,0.315,Bats in the Anthropocene : Conservation of Bats in a Changing World,"and management practices (Law et al. 2015; Meyer et al. 2015; Korine et al. 2015; Williams-GuillÃ©n et al. 2016), urbanization and intensification (Altringham and Kerth 2015; Arnett et al. 2015; Jung and Threlfall 2015; Rowse et al. 2016), disturbance and loss of roosts (Furey and Racey 2015; Law et al. 2015; Voigt et al. 2016), and direct exploitation for bushmeat and medicine (Mildenstein et al. 2016). As human populations grow and encroach on remaining bat habitat, humanâbat interactions are increasing, often with negative consequences for both parties through disease relationships (Schneeberger and Voigt 2016), occupation of human dwellings (Voigt et al. 2016), and conflict over fruit crops (Abdul Aziz et al. 2015). The Anthropocene is named for us, and solutions to our environmental problems rest with us, as Mascia et al. (2003) so concisely put it: âBiodiversity conservation is a human endeavor: initiated by humans, designed by humans, and intended to modify human behaviorââ(Mascia et al. 2003, p. 650). Bat conservation is no different from any other aspect of biodiversity conservation in this regard; attempts to reduce the many threats to bats ultimately hinge on changing peoplesâ behavior (Stern 2000; Ehrlich and Kennedy 2005; Schultz 2011; St John et al. 2013; VerÃ­ssimo 2013; Clayton and Myers 2015). âPeopleâ may range from bat hunters in rural villages to government officials or politicians in administrative centers, but as stakeholders in the issues surrounding bats, they must be motivated to change their actions and decisions (Menon and Lavigne 2006). How do we determine the stakeholders involved and how do we then change peopleâs minds and behavior? The scientific training of most bat biologists leaves us illequipped both practically (St John et al. 2010, 2014) and philosophically (Moon and Blackman 2014) and often extraordinarily naÃ¯ve, when it comes to dealing with people. Surely, if we share our knowledge and âeducateâ people, they will change their ways. Hunters in Ghana and Indonesia will be so impressed by the importance of bats as pollinators of their favorite fruit, or so fearful of disease risk, that they will stop hunting them. US politicians will mandate turbine cut-in speeds that reduce bat fatalities once they appreciate the critical role that bats play in the suppression of agricultural insect pests. Home owners will learn to live with their seasonal âattic batsâ because they are keeping down the summer mosquito population. Unfortunately, providing people with environmental knowledge alone is rarely enough to promote conservation behavior, and there is an enormous body of research from the social sciences, primarily from social psychology (St John et al. 2010; Teel et al. 2015), addressing the theoretical constructs behind behavior change. These constructs have provided frameworks for empirical assessments of attitudes and behaviors toward the environment and wildlife, and new disciplines such as human dimensions of wildlife (Manfredo 2008; Decker et al. 2012) and conservation psychology (Clayton and Myers 2015) have arisen in recent years, as a growing numbers of social scientists specialize in environmental or biodiversity conservation. Indeed, the Society for Conservation Biology established a Social Science Working Group in 2003 (http://conbio.org/groups/working-groups/socialscience), and a recent report from the Group provides an excellent introduction to the conservation social sciences (Bennett and Roth 2015)."

273,148,0.314,Report on Global Environmental Competitiveness (2013),"these aspects must be adequately considered and the indicators of various factors should be rationally determined and distributed, so as to form a structurally complete, logically strict and rationally distributed indicator system; in this way, the evaluation system can comprehensively and precisely reflect the real status of global environmental competitiveness. 2. The GEC factors are mutually influential and interactive. The ecological, biotic and resource environment under the context of global environmental competitiveness are always mutually influential and interactive in between. Changes in ecological environment will influence biotic and resource environment, while changes in the latter will also influence the former. For example, expansion of natural reserve area (corresponding to ecological environment) will increase the variety of biologic species and improve the status of atmosphere and water resources in the reserve. And deterioration of the atmosphere, water and soil and decrease of biotic life will cause such ecological deterioration problems as desertification of land as well as water loss and soil erosion. The relationship between ecological, biotic and resource environment has decided that the relationship between ecological environmental competitiveness, biotic environmental competitiveness and resource environmental competitiveness are also mutually influential and interactive. Therefore, the relationship between the three should be carefully designed during construction of the indicator system to fully reflect the interactions in between. Of course, the availability of data should also be considered. Take biotic environmental competitiveness for example, there is almost no data and therefore the factors are not included in the indicator system. 3. GEC is not only determined by environmental system, but also influenced by the economic system and social system. GEC itself is an indicator reflecting the status of environmental status and hence it is undoubtedly dependent upon environmental system. But environmental problem is never only a matter of environmental issue; it is at the same time a matter of economic issue and social issue. In the entire environment-economy-society system, environmental system is influenced by economic system and social system, and economic system and social system are likewise influenced by environmental system. To be specific, economic system influences environmental system through production activities and environmental system satisfies the resource demand of economic system; social system influences environmental system through human daily life and environmental system satisfies the ecological demand of social system; economic system satisfies the economic demand of social system and social system satisfies the consumption demand of economic system. The relationship between the three is shown in Fig. 4.1. In this system, of course, everything goes on surrounding humans; it is humans that impose the influences on environment through various economic and social instruments. Therefore, the influence of economic system and social system on environmental system must be adequately considered and reflected in the indicator system.

In line with Rogersâ work (1962), it suggests that the more complex innovations are (in terms of goals, assumed causalities, effects) the harder it gets to take them from one place to another. The more resilient the destination context (e.g. due to the strength of a dominant discourse or top-heavy regulation), the less likely it is to succeed. Transfer success also depends on capacity and resources available. The empirical results of the WILCO project show that the same applies to social innovations. Even though there is an already burgeoning literature on innovation transfer, questions about what is specific about the diffusion of social innovations remain. Non-technical and non-market-based innovations are generally more diverse in terms of organisational properties or lifestyles compared to technical innovations designed for mass markets. Yet, to be fair, the difference is not always as drastic as the one between a cell phone and a new mode of participation in urban planning. Many new mass products are sold with varieties that allow marketing geared to the different tastes of consumers in different cultures and regions. Still, the differential impact of âlocalâ as compared to âglobalâ features remains an important topic for research to investigate what is specific for social innovations. Spreading Rather Than Being Sent: The Opaque Nature of Diffusion Processes When the process of diffusion is studied across a wider range of cases, the senderreceiver metaphor quickly becomes unsatisfactory as, however bad the connection, however confusing the conference call, one usually knows who is at the other end of the line. Not so for diffusion because the process is so hard to trace. Johnson dealt with the difference between areas such as the business sector, where innovations can be formalised, sold or withheld by license, and the often taken-for-granted fact that most social innovations develop in the public realm where they are basically free for use (2010, p. 240 f.). However, one of our case studies (Ewert and Evers in this chapter) shows that in the social realm there is also a tension between diffusion by innovation as an âopen sourceâ and diffusion channelled by competition. Projects and organisations such as Lok.aMotion, dealing with innovative concepts for community development and community-based business in Berlin-Kreuzberg, must act under conditions of âco-ompetitionâ where cooperation and competition merge. They often feel that their concepts are not simply taken up, but âstolenâ. This dilemma is hard to overcome because cases where a clear origin and âauthorâ of a social innovation can be identified are hard to find. Many of the case studies presented in this book are innovative in the local place where they crystallise but resemble concepts and ideas elsewhere. This holds true for quite a number of innovations presented in this book: the essentials of work integration enterprises and the variant discussed with examples from Nijmegen, the prevention visits for improving local child protection in MÃ¼nster (Walter and Gluns) or the housing revitalisation schemes from the outskirts of Lille (Fraisse). These are varieties within a national or international innovative stream and orientations. The fact that respon-"

Climate change is also having diverse systemic effects often related to increasing aridity. As rangelands become more economically developed pastoral livelihoods may diversify, food security can improve, and commercial livestock production expands, but wealth stratification widens. Some significant upgrades in rural infrastructure and public service delivery have occurred; telecommunications are markedly improved overall due to widespread adoption of mobile phones. Pressures from grazing, farming, mining, and other land usesâ combined with droughtâcan ignite local conflicts over resources, although the intensity and scope of conflicts markedly varies across our case-study sites. Pastoralists and their herds have become more sedentary overall due to many factors, and this can undermine traditional risk-management tactics based on mobility. Remote rangelands still offer safe havens for insurgents, warlords, and criminals especially in countries where policing remains weak; the resulting civil strife can undermine commerce and public safety. There has been tremendous growth in knowledge concerning developing-country rangelands since 1990, but this has not often translated into improved environmental stewardship or an enhanced wellbeing for rangeland dwellers. Some examples of demonstrable impact are described, and these typically have involved longer-term investments in capacity building for pastoralists, local professionals, and other stakeholders. Research is shifting from ecologically centered to more human-centered issues; traditional academic approaches are often being augmented with participatory, community-based engagement. Building human or social capital in ways that are integrated with improved natural resource stewardship offers the greatest returns on research investment. Our future research and outreach priorities include work that fortifies pastoral governance, enhances livelihoods for a diverse array of rangeland residents, and improves land and livestock management in a comprehensive social-ecological systems approach.

277,288,0.313,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"marked by a narrow understanding of integration, dominated by the MoI, the City of Vienna is seen as a focal point for issues related to education, multilingualism and diversity. Fourth, most interaction is happening between similar kinds of actors, i.e. scientists most frequently interact with university actors, NGOs with NGOs and governmental actors with other governmental and semi-governmental actors. The exceptions to this are few in number, and pertain to the interaction between scientists and âminorâ NGOs. However, all types of actors, i.e. scientists, NGOs and governmental actors, are in contact with the social partners, confirming both the de-facto centrality and continuity of the social partners as an influential group of actors in integration policymaking. Topics discussed with the social partners are mainly concentrated on labour market integration and labour rights, but they are also involved in other political issues such as mosque constructions and religious teachersâ education. Unlike the (primarily self-referential) government and nonprofit organisations, the social partners are in contact with a diverse range of actors. These dialogues structures have a huge impact on the question of how knowledge is produced, consumed and utilised. As the MoI promoted the recent institutionalisation process, dialogue structures are certainly marked by this government department. In the area of naturalisation, as could be shown, the dominance of the MoI is such that it successfully claimed knowledge authority and established itself as a knowledge producer. When confronted with Austriaâs low score on naturalisation policy in the MIPEX survey, the MoI not only ignored the scientific critique but re-interpreted it successfully as a vindication of its restrictive policy model. Only in the area of school education, in which the Ministry of Education has competence, does some sort of national dialogue exist. One may thus conclude that the MoI seems to promote the institutionalisation of dialogue structures between science and politics as a means to consolidate and reinforce its primacy in Austrian migrant integration policies. Overall, three different types of knowledge use in the area of migrant integration could be identified in Austrian integration policymaking: legitimising use (to bolster an actorâs political role or authority), substantiating use (to justify decisions and orientations) and knowledge shelving, i.e. when the results of government-funded research are consumed and archived and, eventually, used for decision-making at a later stage. Indications of legitimising knowledge use were most often referred to by interviewees in the field of naturalisation, but ranked high in general. However, the MoI itself stated that it does not have an in-house competence in all issues related to integration and therefore has established the Expert Council to increase its âauthenticityâ. Interviewed experts instead see the set-up of the Expert Council as a justification strategy used by other ministers to gain competence in an area of responsibility. While most interviewees referred to a legitimising use of scientific and expert knowledge, differences between the three topic areas could be identified: in naturalisation, where continued national research is absent and the MoI established itself as a knowledge producer, little need is felt by policymakers for scientific knowledge. The area of education, in contrast, is marked by the active role of boundary actors"

Another aspect relevant to CIR is the organisational one, as it relates to the organisations and institutions that manage the physical components of the systems, i.e. CI operators or owners. It covers aspects such as culture, people, business continuity, risk, and disaster management at the organisational level. This more business-oriented aspect, which we have observed in the Australian national policy, serves as a way to gather all current business practices under one common goal: the operability of the infrastructure under adverse circumstances. The social dimension encompasses population and community characteristics that render social groups either more vulnerable or more adaptable to hazards and disasters. We observe that national resilience policies recently include, except of economic or even environmental aspects, social aspects in their deï¬nitions of resilience as CI are vital for maintaining key societal functions. These refer to the community and highlight how infrastructures contribute with essential services to it, e.g. as discussed in the aforementioned NIS Directive. Overall, a resilience-based approach for CI is an approach that is gradually adopted by nations in order to face the challenges and costs of achieving maximum protection in an increasingly complex environment and to overcome limitations of the traditional scenario-based risk management approach, where the organisation may lack capabilities to face risk from unknown or unforeseen threats and vulnerabilities."
284,5,0.312,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"Preface This book is the result of the collaborative research project Environmental Governance in Latin America (ENGOV) funded by the European Union (EU). For four years, a team of experts from ten Latin American and European academic institutions investigated how environmental governance is currently being shaped in Latin America. In this joint effort, we were driven by our concerns about widespread ecological degradation, poverty and injustice, as well as by our curiosity about the ways in which the emergence of new political regimes and elites, and innovative steps by communities and social organizations, affects governance practices and natureâsociety relations. To understand the possibilities and obstacles for sustainable and equitable natural resource use, a range of case-studies were carried out in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico. Although some of the research topics and cases are not included in this volume, their ï¬ndings have contributed to the discussions and theoretical reï¬ections in the overall analysis. The ENGOV project has been simultaneously challenging and inspiring. The theme of environmental governance is a huge academic enterprise because it addresses complex social relations, practices and views inï¬uencing how societies perceive nature and use natural resources. Combining methods and theories from different ï¬elds of the social sciences is a prerequisite which in practice is fairly demanding. Furthermore, by encompassing political, economic, cultural and environmental changes, formal as well as informal arrangements, and cross-scale connections, the study of environmental governance can easily become a âmission impossibleâ. Arguably this is even more the case for contemporary Latin America, with its variety of local and national conditions facing rapid-paced changes. Finally, collaborating in an international research consortium of ten institutional partners and more than 25 researchers from different disciplines, schools of thought and generations has also proved to be both daring and rewarding. The fact that we spoke in different academic languages and idiom accents was not only a hurdle to tackle during our group discussions, but also forced us to learn from each otherâs approaches and convictions, and the foundations on which these are based.

Despite tremendous variation in the studies reviewed in this chapter, most if not all point out the need to be attentive to diversity in transnationalism and integration: whoâin terms of characteristics such as socioeconomic status, educational level, gender, ethnicity, religion, and migration motivesâis involved in transnationalism, and who is not (cf.

(2) Assessment at full scale: The ultimate goal of the coming transformation is to rescale human activity to a level that can be sustained by nature in the long run and that allows for future human development at the same time. Identifying the appropriate scale of human activity requires us to study socioeconomic metabolism on the global level, which was not necessary to understand the previous socioeconomic transitions. Socioeconomic metabolism is a nonlinear system, which means that the impact of upscaling small modifications to the system is in general not proportional to the scaling factor. The upscaling of certain sustainable development strategies is subject to local and global constraints for, e.g., land, water, or mineral resources. Moreover, large-scale implementation of certain strategies feeds back into the system and causes structural change. Examples include changing recycling systems, technology learning, or rebound and spillover effects (Hertwich 2005). The total system-wide impact of the strategiesâ potential effect can therefore only be reliably assessed if the latter are studied at full scale, so that constraints and feedbacks can be included in the assessment. (3aâc) Multilayer modeling, satellite accounts, and balancing constraints allow scientists from different disciplines, like industrial ecologists and economists, to use a consistent framework to describe societyâs metabolism and to address a variety of research questions. In multilayer modeling, the physical and economic properties of objects are quantified in consistent parallel frameworks (Pauliuk et al. 2015; Schmidt et al. 2012). Satellite accounts, like emissions to nature or labor requirements, contain additional information about how societyâs metabolism is connected to the environment and to human agents. They form the interface between models of SEM and those from other scientific disciplines, like climate models or environmental impact assessment. Balancing constraints for the physical and monetary layers, like industry or market balances, is the most fundamental way to check the validity of a prospective system description. Prospective models should always respect these fundamental balances. (4) Scenariomodeling with exogenous parameters acknowledges the indeterminacy of future development and reduces system complexity to a manageable level. Only with scenario modeling one can build scientifically credible prospective models of complex indeterminate systems like socioeconomic metabolism. This central aspect of prospective modeling needs some more elaboration. Socioeconomic metabolism is a non-isolated and non-deterministic complex system. It is not isolated, because it exchanges energy and matter with the inner of the Earth and with space. SEM is non-deterministic, because it is controlled by human agents that use their environmental literacy to intervene and divert the system from its current trajectory in a non-predictable"

There are no specific initiatives on the SLCA from the automotive sector. BMW Group is one of the founding members of the Roundtable of Product Social Metrics. In 2013, for the first time, a group of companies decided to sit down together and to define, based on the literature, the ILO Conventions and their strategy in order to develop a common methodology to assess social performance of a product along its life cycle. The project is now running the third phase and the main results of the previous phases are included in the Handbook of Product Social Impact Assessment (Fontes et al. 2014). Six case studies were realized, mainly among the Roundtable members, to implement and validate the methodology presented in the handbook. This initiative, that also involved BMW Group, shows that the SLCA is a feasible and practicable methodology. The main challenge in its implementation is the necessity to directly involve the entire supply chain to collect primary social inventory data. Because these data are very sensitive, a strong cooperation and linking interests between OEM (requesting the primary data) and each 1-tier supplier (data giver) are necessary. This challenge also existed for the environmental LCA 20 or 30 years ago, when software and databases such as GaBiÂ® (PE International 2010) and SimaProÂ® (PRÃ© Consultants 2013) were not available and performing an LCA of a product cost significant effort in terms of time and money just to collect primary data."

212,486,0.309,Life Cycle Management,"The capability maturity model (CMM) concept originates from a quality management maturity grid proposed by Phil Crosby (1979), subsequently developed for numerous functions, such as software engineering, integrated product development, systems engineering and more. The CMMI Institute (cmmiinstitute.com) integrated these models, but they are extremely complex and inappropriate for SME suppliers (Sukhoo et al. 2007). Development of a simpler and more practical LCM CMM is described under Methods. A series of company case studies are then presented to compare the theory of CMMs with the real world practice of LCM. In some cases, the company projects explicitly applied the LCM CMM developed by UNEP/ SETAC. In other cases, the company projects made no direct application of CMM, but were simply efforts to apply LCM principles to address specific objectives. The focus of the case studies is on the change management issues that can promote or inhibit success of company improvement initiatives. These company experiences are then reviewed and reconciled with the LCM CMM concepts to develop a framework that companies can use to tailor LCM to their specific competitive context, environmental constraints and opportunities, and strategic priorities. The basic premise is that a structured approach to help address these softer management issues can be a useful strategy to mainstream LCM in business. Finally, the chapter concludes with recommendations for future research to expand business capacity for LCM and to promote its effective integration into routine business decision-making processes."
376,347,0.309,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","State-and-transition models were introduced as a âmanagement language,â rather than an ecological theory, to organize and interpret rangeland vegetation dynamics (Westoby et al. 1989). They provided an alternative to the range model that had been severely criticized in the 1970s and 1980s for being overly reliant on linear, directional vegetation dynamics that were unable to account for nonreversible vegetation change, especially woody plant encroachment and invasion by exotic invasive species (Briske et al. 2005). An influential report by the US National Research Council (NRC 1994) endorsed development and adoption of an alternative management model based on the STM framework and the Society for Range Management quickly supported this endorsement (SRM Task Group 1995). The US Department of AgricultureâNatural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) formally adopted STMs for rangeland assessment in the late 1990s and established programs to develop and organize these models for all 50 states in the USA. A National Ecological Site Manual was developed and adopted in 2010 to standardize the use of ecological site descriptions and STMs among the NRCS, Bureau of Land Management, and US Forest Service (BLM 2010). State-and-transition models are organized as a collection of all recognized or anticipated stable states that individual ecological sites may support (Bestelmeyer et al. 2003; Stringham et al. 2003). Individual stable states (e.g., grassland or shrubland) include transient and reversible shifts in species composition that occur in response to disturbances or self-regulating processes. These internal state dynamics are referred to as community phases and represent variation in species composition associated with wet and dry years, periodic intensive grazing, and fire frequency. In contrast, individual states are assumed to be separated by thresholds that are considered to be irreversible without management intervention. Ecological indicators of state variables, controlling variables, and to lesser extent feedback mechanisms that underpin state resilience are used to determine if a state is trending toward or away from pending thresholds (Briske et al. 2008). This information can inform managers of the need to implement actions to modify state resilience to achieve desired outcomes (Watson et al. 1996; Bagchi et al. 2013) (Fig. 6.5). State-and-transition models have subsequently been organized around ecological resilience to link them to an accepted ecological theory and to accommodate scientific, in addition to management knowledge (Briske et al. 2008). In relation to resilience, individual states exist within a single basin of attraction that is consistent with engineering resilience and thresholds represent boundaries between multiple"

118,18,0.309,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"the group that studied social scientific topics on nuclear technology was somehow âseparatedâ from the rest of department as conventional engineering research labs were the majority. From the point of view of an observant social scientist, the situation after the 2004 reformation at the UTNEM was just an âadditionâ of the social scientific part, appropriately suggested by the prospectus cited above. This addition model was not a totally meaningless change, of course, but it was not sufficient to cope with contemporary difficult issues centering around nuclear utilization in a so-called post-industrial society. This process of âintegrationâ seems to require a long-term effort to be accomplished. The Fukushima Daiichi accident clearly exposed the incompleteness of the past efforts at âintegration,â as various chapters of this book discuss in detail; even in 2014, three years after the accident, it seems to be still on going. The abilities required of leading engineers in this post-industrial era are not just to pursue technological development as prescribed (typically by governmental long-term plans or other national programs), but to grasp multi-dimensional needs for technology, to develop technology in collaboration with different stakeholders under a more open societal process, and to fulfill their social responsibility in compliance with values shared within society."

99,279,0.309,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Message TwoâAbout Innovations in Regulations and Rights These days, working and living patterns are changing and less continuous; zones of transition between life situations and life stages are becoming more complicated (Bovenberg 2008). Traditional services cannot always cope with these complexities. This may mean being out of school but not yet in a job, on the track back to employment but without access to a place to live. Often this coincides with other acute problems that may require immediate help. What some have called ânew social risksâ (Bonoli 2005) cannot be dealt with using the manual of standard risks. Innovative ways of offering a quick fix, often provisionally, may well be the critical missing link when it comes to providing living and working arrangements that keep people âin the gameâ. Quite a number of social innovations studied in the WILCO project involve establishing flexible forms of ad hoc support that meet newly emerging risks short-term. One telling example is the Welfare Foundation Ambrosiano in Milan, Italy (see Sabatinelli and Costa in this chapter), that supported individuals and families who were temporarily in need for various reasons (redundancy, illness and so on) through quick micro-credits, regardless of their previous or current type of employment contract and country of origin. Traditionally, most public welfare services have the status of rights that are unconditional, insofar as they simply require a set of material preconditions to be fulfilled. A new tendency in welfare arrangements (see Evers and Guillemard 2013), particularly in the field of âworkfareâ, is for clients to enter a form of contractual relationship in which the preconditions for support concern their future behaviour. This requires clients to take exclusive responsibility for themselves. Among the set of innovations studied, there were also other types of moves from rights to contracts, defining the notion of âgiving something back for what one gets from societyâ more broadly. People received access to goods and services once they committed to doing something for others in the form of volunteer work or providing clearly defined personal support for vulnerable people in the community. One example of this is Time for a Roof, an intergenerational home-sharing service in Nantes, France (see Coqblin and Fraisse 2014 in: Evers a. o. 93). It offered cheap accommodation to students who entered into an intergenerational cohabitation arrangement. Message ThreeâAbout Innovations in Governance The social innovations under study all represented a combination of new social âproductsâ and new social âprocessesâ, the latter term referring to the internal organisation of decision-making and interaction with the environment, the public, various stakeholders, social partners and political and administrative authorities. Many social innovations that seek to develop new kinds of services also have a governance dimension. However, for some innovations, influencing and changing the system of governance was their main goal (see Moore and Hartley 2009; LÃ©vesque 2013). This is the case, for instance, in the Citizenâs Agreement for an inclusive Barcelona. More than 500 participating entities in spheres such as the economy, culture, education, health and housing worked on a new participative governance structure (see Montagut et al. in this book). Likewise in Bern (see Felder in this chapter) where new integration guidelines that became mandatory for public stakeholders"
99,115,0.309,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Despite ambitions to simultaneously reinvent the welfare regime and the local economy, lingering social problems remain, however, and new social tensions have arisen in the wake of the social and economic transformations. MalmÃ¶ has for several decades struggled with severe social problems, such as high unemployment, high costs of social benefits, and growing segregation (Nordfeldt and Segnestam Larsson 2012). The level of employment is lower in MalmÃ¶ than on average in Sweden, and there are significant differences between people born in Sweden and outside of Sweden, leading to a higher degree of social exclusion and growing differences in living conditions among social groups (Stigendal and Ãstergren 2013). To these recurrent social problems, a list of growing problems could be added. Income inequalities have indeed increased in Sweden overall, but since the year 2000 income inequalities have grown more in MalmÃ¶ than average in Sweden. The dynamic, demographic character of the city has also resulted in a higher degree of illegal immigrants and inhabitants outside of the workforce and the welfare system than in other Swedish cities (Salonen 2012). In interviews with politicians and civil servants in the city council, a set of social problems were highlighted, including unemployment and segregation (Segnestam Larsson and Carrigan 2013). According to interviewed representatives, poverty is affecting peopleâs health, life expectancy, and could be considered a matter of life and death (e.g. interviews 5 and 6). Child poverty is also part of the discourse on local welfare and the proposed main problems. Another major problem in the city of MalmÃ¶ is believed to be unemployment, in general, and youth unemployment, in particular (e.g. interviews 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, and 16). We have had an enormous arrival of people to MalmÃ¶ from other parts of Sweden and we have not been able to catch up. That is simply the case. We have not been able to catch up with this influx of people and we have not been able to identify job opportunities to the degree that would have been needed (Interview 13)."
334,155,0.308,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Social movement literature distinguishes different modes of institutionalized engagement and confrontational participation against governmental decisions. Several concepts are applied to analyze the contention of politics and policies, in particular mobilization, protest, and movement. Despite being central to this literature, social movements remain a poorly defined concept. In our view, a good definition combines two elements: that movements emerge âin reaction to particular issuesâ, as Claudia Tazreiter (2010, 204) highlights, and that movements encompass âsustained and intentional effortsâ to achieve legal or social change, as James Jasper (2014, 5) emphasizes. We understand political mobilization as the process of setting something in motion to promote action. With regards to social movements, a wide range of actors and networks seek to mobilize people in the public sphere and make them take action for or against a certain issue (Della Porta and Piazza 2008; Rucht 2012, 4). A specific form of mobilization is protest, characterized by the direct participation of individuals or collective actors to put pressure on decision makers (Caiani et al. 2012, 11), and to act against government policies or against specific administrative decisions (Kriesi 1993, 3; Opp 2009). A protest is defined by its focus on a specific policy or decision, but in contrast to a social movement, it does not address broader issuesâbe these social or political issues. Protests can take the form of movements or be part of one (Jasper 2014, xi)."
99,100,0.308,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"a guiding principle. From the organizational point of view, cooperative solutions between all local actors (administration, economy and civil society) are privileged in this search process. All actors involved broadly accept cooperation as the leading principle for city matters, resulting in the approach that âthe more allies unite for a specific city matter, the greater the chance to push something throughâ.19 This governance arrangement supports the implementation of innovations and allows âanother way of cooperative work could be establishedâ.20 Apart from the overarching logic of the discursive frame and governance arrangements, several other conditions must be fulfilled before social innovations can be implemented or even stimulated. The first condition concerns funding. Original idea and conditions must attract the interest of sponsors in the project. Sponsors have to be market-compliant, which means that they must comply with the lines of argument found in either the investment or the competitiveness discourse. They have to understand that this represents the dominant basis for decision-making. The second condition concerns legitimation, which means that basic legitimation for social innovation is given and accepted by the people involved. Referring to our results from the policy fields we analysed in MÃ¼nster, an innovation is accepted as legitimate if it is presented within the investment frame. The third condition involves the aspect of appeasement: Any social innovation that challenges the dominant frame will only be supported if the innovators give up some of their resistance against the frame in exchange for financial or advocatory sponsorship. The support granted then serves the appeasement of possible opposition and is considered a win-win situation for all parties involved. Finally, the fourth condition concerns a pragmatic approach towards solving problems at the local level. Social innovations in MÃ¼nster need to demonstrate a hands-on approach towards perceived problems. This relates to tangible target groups, deprived districts and so on, while more visionary approaches hardly have any chance of success. The closed-shop mentality, the local welfare discourse with its focus on city growth, local governance arrangements, several conditions that have to be fulfilled to introduce social innovations as well as specific characteristics of local labour market and housing policiesâall these dimensions can be found in MÃ¼nster and must be considered in order to decide whether the initiation of social innovations is fostered or obstructed within the city. Hence, these dimensions create the context that opens the âwindows of opportunitiesâ for concrete social innovators and social entrepreneurs.

364,464,0.307,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract The current rate of human development poses a major threat to the ecological balance of the environment, and this is exacerbated by climate change effects. It is therefore important for people to understand the ecology of different locations so they can make informed decisions that will not have an adverse effect on the environment. In this regard, students form a significant group for whom sound ecological thinking is necessary as they will be the future leaders and decision makers who can ensure the worldâs continued sustainability. This chapter presents the results of an ecological education project that successfully expanded studentsâ ecological thinking. Evidence of this change is taken from interview responses before and after the ecological education project. The interview was based on a set of six photographs of different situations found in the environment. Responses were analyzed based on an ecological thinking framework developed by the researchers. This framework consisted of two components: understanding of ecology concepts and understanding of the impacts of human activity on ecosystems. The ecological education project succeeded in increasing studentsâ ecological thinking, thereby increasing their awareness of environmental risks.

72,54,0.307,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"how these roles can be strengthened in order to support the generation of social innovation. The chapters in this section underline the importance of collaboration in producing social innovation, even while some also highlight the roles of key individuals in the process, such as Mayor Park in Seoul. In this way, the chapters in this section echo arguments made by Howaldt et al. and McGowan and Westley, which emphasise the roles of different actors within the social innovation process. In Chapter 7, SÃ¸rensen and Torfing argue that multi-actor collaboration in networks, partnerships and inter-organisational teams can spur public innovation. They argue that the principles of New Public Management are giving way to âNew Public Governanceâ, and that the enhancement of collaborative innovation has now become a key aspiration of many public organisations around the world. However, collaborative and innovative processes are difficult to trigger and sustain without proper innovation management and a supportive cultural and institutional environment. Arguing strongly that innovation is produced through collaboration and not through the actions of âheroic individualsâ, the authors describe the roles for public innovation managers that are necessary to enhance innovation through collaboration. In Chapter 8, Han, Kim, Rim and Park provide an empirical case study from Seoul. Led by Mayor Park, a famous social innovator, Seoul Metropolitan Government has developed various communication channels, both online and offline, which have enabled new forms of consultation and engagement between the city administration and citizens. The chapter outlines three communication tools and programmes that reflect the current administrationâs approach and values, and presents a case study of a particular challenge that the city government solved through engaging with citizens. New communication tools often have a limited reach, and the methods currently being used only contribute to solving a limited range of social problems. Nevertheless, Seoul Metropolitan Governmentâs approach offers valuable lessons to other cities that are ambitiously planning to initiate and drive social innovation. In Chapter 9, Tjornbo examines whether the wisdom of crowds can be harnessed to generate social innovation. The development of modern information and communication technologies has led to a renewed interest in the phenomenon of collective intelligence, defined here as the capacity to mobilise and coordinate the knowledge, skills and creativity possessed by large groups of individuals, and combine them into a greater whole. Social innovation is deeply reliant on the capacity to combine the ideas, knowledge and resources possessed by disparate"

128,281,0.307,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"tained social and community involvement enhancing social networks based on relationships of trust and reciprocity (Putnam 2000; van Deth 1997). Interestingly, in Switzerland, the densities of these networks differ substantially through linguistic and cultural regions. Besides, people engage socially in a number of ways within and outside of the political domain. A substantial body of research examines citizenship behaviours and emphasises the importance of solidarity practices to respond individually or collectively to social problems and to common goods dilemma. Particularly interesting for our present purposes are the sociological and psychological perspectives on prosocial behaviour. These studies have centred the attention on the individual interpersonal orientations, traits and motivation explaining why and when individuals act prosocially as well as which social mechanisms, as norms, induce towards reciprocal and altruistic behaviour (Fetchenhauer et al. 2006; Simpson and Willer 2015). The analysis on the interpersonal orientations and emotions underscores the importance of empathic concerns when proving assistance to others (Batson 1998; Batson et al. 1983; Flam and King 2005; Flam 1990). In addition, individual traits as general dispositions of personality are presumably fundamental to engage in collective endeavours showing that extrovert people tend to involve more in collective forms of social participation (Omoto et al. 2010). Much of research on prosocial behaviour motivations conclude that actions as volunteering enhance psychological well-being which is associated with a sense of effectiveness and the expression of personal values (Piliavin and Siegl 2007). Motivation refers to the process that determines the initiation, intensity, direction and persistence of a behaviour (Vallerand and Thill 1993). In the following analysis of solidarity practices, individual factors (socio-economic characteristics and attitudes) and social capital factors are coupled with motivations. We inspire on the Volunteer Function Inventory (VFI) by Clary et al. (1998) to assess the function and the orientation of the motivations of the solidarity practices, as self-regarding or other-regarding and to stress the distinction between altruistic and egoistic behaviour. This motivational orientation investigation might shed some light on the âwhyâ and âhowâ of the solidarity-based behaviour. As mentioned before the venues for citizensâ participation in collective endeavours are multiple. Given the objectives of this chapter, we will use a simple binary typology to characterise citizensâ solidarity-based engagements as civic or political. Under our study and following Bradyâs (1999) definition of political participation, political solidarity practices are actions"

The group concludes that the eight functions which can be assigned as the third mission activities are to be subsumed to two main dimensions. On the one hand, the third mission has an economic dimension, in which resource-oriented economic action patterns can be seen. On the other hand, a social dimension, which can be understood as an increased understanding about science in society. These include, for example, initiatives such as the âNight of Researchâ which has been carried out in Austria for years. Another element in the social dimension is the active participation and involvement in social and cultural life. This comprises, among others, the opening of the university libraries for public or participation of the university choir for singers from the region. The last activity that is designated as âcommissioned work for the public sectorâ is attributed to two main dimensions. Although it is socially relevant, it also carries an economic importance, because resulting beneï¬ts are ï¬nanced by the public. The functions under the economic dimension are mainly the traditional functions of a Technology Transfer Ofï¬ce (TTO) or a Knowledge Management Centre. It is about the exploitation of research and the application of research in the form of innovation. Unfortunately, this innovation is understood in the narrow sense, for example, the ï¬eld of social innovation is excluded from the concept. However, universities have an important role in the development of social innovation and to support it in the future. Therefore, an extension in understanding of the concept within the Prime Network would be necessary. Otherwise, the third mission is reduced to a conventional TTO, which certainly does not sufï¬ciently satisfy the demands of a modern university and excludes socially relevant issues. Another activity within the economic dimension involves the flow of knowledge from the university to industry. Here, PhD students and graduates are meant to have had practical experiences outside of the university during their studies. This may be the research that has been conducted on behalf of the business sector, or work carried out jointly with a commercial enterprise or with a representative of a company. However, a research job can be counted under human resources, as well as contact with industry and thus count twice. This example also shows that smooth transitions exist between the different activities and for measurement a clear structure and allocation is required. In this activity, the main goal does not lie in employability, but in penetration of the science system into the non-university sector."

The mission of the festival is to stimulate and sustain the interest of youth in STEM. In addition to top-level support, festivals include hands-on activities and live performances by science celebrities, explorers, best-selling authors, entrepreneurs, and world-renowned experts. As another example of large-scale public effort to diffuse science in society, the newly established support program in Turkey aims to create awareness of science and technology issues and to promote scientific culture among young people through science fairs at public schools. Based on the Science Fairs Support Program [44], public schools across the country are given monetary support to hold science fairs for students in Grades 5â12 in cooperation with the Ministry of Education. In the first year of the program, 1092 schools were funded. The fairs were attended by approximately one million visitors and 30,000 projects were exhibited by 64,000 students in consultation with more than 15,000 teachers. In addition to periodic large-scale events, such as science fairs, other examples are the Science Centers that remain at the service of the public on a continuous basis. In Turkey, the SCST resolved that a science center is to be opened in every Turkish province by the year 2023, starting with the metropolitan municipalities. The Science Centers [44] will be venues for the interactive sharing of scientific knowledge with the public as well as a means of enhancing scientific culture and increasing the rate of scientific literacy in society. In line with these developments, TÃBIÌTAK launched the Science Centers Development Support Program that is initially being used to support exhibits in metropolitan municipalities in a local partnership model. Following the SCSTâs decision, contracts have been signed with four metropolitan municipalities. The Konya Science Center has recently been opened with the Prime Ministerâs participation in an opening ceremony. The other two science centers are expected to be opened in 2016. All centers are located in modern structures with stateof-the-art facilities. For example, the Konya Science Center is 25 thousand square meters including exhibition areas, training sections, conference halls, and libraries. It is constructed over an area of 100 thousand square meters. The Konya Science Center aims to be one of the three best science centers in the world. Currently, 235 exhibitions are designed internationally and 40 are implemented in the newly opened center. One of the forthcoming exhibitions is âSultans of Science,â which includes 50 exhibition units regarding contributions of scientists and inventors to astronomy, math, architecture, and medical sciences that were transferred to Europe as the scientific advances that laid the foundation for the European Renaissance."
284,61,0.306,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"A Latin American ecosocialism? In the 1980s, new ideas about socioecological politics in Latin America emerged. Authors such as Victor Toledo, Enrique Leff, JosÃ© Augusto PÃ¡dua and Ivan Restrepo formulated more radical ideas about the political context of environmental governance. Augusto Angel Mayaâs explicit message (1996, 2002) was to avoid interpreting environmental problems as exclusively ecological or technological. He understood the environment as an object of study in all the scientiï¬c disciplines, from the natural sciences and technologies to sciences that study human behaviour. Beginning in the 1980s, activist groups such as the Political Ecology Institute (Instituto de EcologÃ­a PolÃ­tica) in Chile, Censat in Colombia, Ecological Action (AcciÃ³n Ecologica) in Ecuador (composed of young female biologists), REDES (Amigos de la Tierra Uruguay/Friends of the Earth) in Uruguay, FASE (FederaÃ§Ã£o de ÃrgÃ£os para AssistÃªncia Social e Educacional/ Federation of Organizations for Social and Educational Assistance) in Brazil with Julianna Malerba, and others have emerged. There is a strong Latin American environmental thinking that enumerates, and denounces the multitude of environmental conï¬icts that the growth of the social metabolism brings with it. Some 20 years later, these views have not only been expressed in writings and manifestos of social actors and alternative thinkers of post-developmentalism, of agroecology and of popular environmentalism, but also in some national constitutions, in the discourses of government ofï¬cials and even by some ministers. After the defeat in 2005 of the US plans to promote the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), new leftwing, progressive governments emerged with the electoral victories of Evo Morales in Bolivia (2005) and Rafael Correa in Ecuador (2006). In the following years it even seemed that an international âofï¬cialâ environmental leadership could arise from South America. The Ecuadorian Constitution of 2008, for example, has been a very important symbol of environmental thinking in Latin America, with the presence of Alberto Acosta â ex-president of the Constituent Assembly â in a multitude of forums. Another example was the radical speech of Ecuador representative FÃ¡nder FalconÃ­, at the failed climate change conference in Copenhagen in 2009, when he made reference to the ecological debt or climate debt of the North with the South. He compared the poor countries with âpassive smokersâ and he defended the Yasuni Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) initiative to âleave the oil below groundâ in front of more than 150 presidents of state and leaders of government.8"
242,6,0.306,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Preface This book emerges from a collaborative effort between partners from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). The empirical data of the book originate mostly from the IDRC research programme on Women and Migration (2006â2011) that was funded as a component of the larger Womenâs Rights and Citizenship programme (WRC). Whereas previous support for research on gender by IDRC has been integrated into broader themes such as agriculture, health, social and economic policy, science and technology, the WRC programme has used the concept of citizenship as an entry point and sought to bring Southern voices more fully into current international debates in the field of gender and development. Built on the vision of a just world where women in the South are acknowledged to have a sense of self that is connected to the ideals of citizenship, the WRC programme has supported work directed at undoing social discrimination based on gender and enabling the realization of the full range of rights and freedoms for women. With the support of IDRC, a team based at the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) of Erasmus University Rotterdam has led the work of distillation and synthesis of the research findings of the Women and Migration research programme, by way of a sustained exchange of knowledge and practice between partners over a two-year period (2011 and 2012). The synthesis project had the title Migration, Gender and Social Justice (MGSJ). It involved an opening workshop at ISS in The Hague in January 2011, followed by individual visits to The Hague for writing and discussion, and a concluding workshop at the Centre for Development Studies, Trivandrum (India) in February 2013. The synthesis of research findings has aimed at promoting long-term collaboration based on reciprocal and selfreflexive learning between partners. It is hoped too that by connecting communities of research and practice the collaboration can contribute to a change in attitudes and views in order to bridge differences in the understanding of migration and thus improve policy interventions. Against this background, the book is problem-oriented and multidisciplinary and connects the research results of international teams working across different research sites, with different emphases and on different scales of analysis. Given the diversity of research approaches, the richness of the findings, and the complex realities of rights claiming, the task of the MGSJ research project has been threefold. 1. The first task of the project has been to distil the research findings of WRC projects, and articulate commonalities and differences in the operation of different structures of power (gender, class, race/ethnicity, generation) and their interaction within the institutional domain of migration (with reference to organizational practices, legal regulations, circulation of material and ideational resources) which produce context-specific forms of social inequality. 2. The second task was to generate critical reflections on the intersection of the different power structures that circumscribe the space for migrants to claim rights, and to relate these perspectives with existing approaches to social justice. For this purpose additional contributions were solicited to cover core issues that had not been fully addressed by the WRC projects, including legal liminality and how the social construction of not only femininity but also masculinity affects all migrants and all women."
56,226,0.306,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"In Chap. 5, several respondents complained that they had âlost their bearingsâ within their families. In this chapter, I will unpack the notion of âbearingsâ and explore its relevance to the issue of re-integration in communities of origin following retirement. Dictionaries attribute several meanings to the term, but there are two aspects which I would highlight as relevant in the context of migration studies. Initially this chapter will explore bearings in the physical sense of the word: âthe direction or position of something relative to a fixed point; awareness of oneâs position relative to oneâs surroundingsâ (Concise Oxford Dictionary 1999). It will be demonstrated how retired hostel residentsâ degree of influence over their physical surroundings in places of origin â notably through house construction and involvement in hometown development projects â in turn has an influence on the second social meaning of bearings, namely âa personâs way of standing, moving or behavingâ (Concise Oxford Dictionary 1999). Above all, it is hostel residentsâ standing and behaviour in places of origin that will be discussed in the latter half of the chapter. Before turning to hostel residentsâ physical relationship to their home places, it will be useful for the reader to have an idea of the physical environment in the two localities where I conducted fieldwork: DembancanÃ© in Senegal and Tiznit in Morocco. These case studies describe the re-integration prospects of a necessarily limited number of respondents in two unique local contexts, but it is noteworthy that the divergent trends observed in DembancanÃ© and Tiznit were reproduced in the contrasting testimonies of North and West African respondents originating from all corners of these two sending regions. Many North African men had lost their physical and social bearings back home, whereas West Africans, being the drivers of physical and social change thanks to their contributions to development projects, were less disoriented by their return trips and found it far easier to re-integrate, hence the central significance to the question considered here regarding late-in-life return."
99,23,0.306,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Part II of the book summarises the overall findings, addressing the topics of how local development and its innovative elements are framed and shaped by urban regimes and local governance arrangements. Contributions illustrate how local context and urban welfare politics with their respective governance arrangements function as a framework that defines room and limits for social innovations. As such, the contributions of this chapter exemplify the general findings of the research as regards specific governance arrangements with a detailed analysis of a city. Each city corresponds to a specific arrangement and thoroughly highlights the identified dimensions. The introductory chapter on urban governance and social innovations by Sandro Cattacin and Annette Zimmer highlights the urban governance arrangements identified by WILCO. These arrangements provide very different opportunity structures for social innovations. They are characterised by following dimensions: â¢ The governance of cooperation is characterised by a general orientation on innovation in politics and economics; the search of synergies between economics and social policies to foster the urban character of the city operates as the main orientation. â¢ The governance of growth prioritises economics and economic interest groups. Social problems are individualised and innovation in the social field is relegated to the self-organisation of groups."

That being said, policy integration at a European level is undermined by the variety of different national housing policies, which are characterised by specific connotations and peculiarities, starting from the different welfare systems in place in each country. Generally, the consistency of social housing, that is, housing dedicated to the weakest segments of the population, can be measured by looking at the percentage of social rented houses owned and managed by the state on the total rental housing.25 Also, there is little doubt that the new policies emerging from the economic crisis are characterised by a strong use of public resources for social housing.

The transformation and system innovation discourse brings the need for encompassing structural change to the forefront and to the titles of flagship reports, while slowly delegitimizing the narrow emphasis on adaptive market magic, money printing and technological breakthroughs. To me, this is part of the window of renewed opportunity for sustainable development. The rapidly growing transdisciplinary transformation research community could become instrumental in helping to use this window strategically. It promises the most telling insights into how the infamous integration of ecological, social and economic dimensions of development can be achieved in practice."

Drawing on the example of myExperiment, De Roure et al. (2008) propose four key capabilities of what they consider a Social Virtual Research Environment (SVRE): â¢ According to the authors, a SVRE should firstly facilitate the management and sharing of research objects. These can be any digital commodities that are used and reused by researchers (e.g. methods and data). â¢ Secondly, it should have incentives for researchers to make their research objects available. â¢ Thirdly, the environment should be open and extensibleâmeaning that software, tools and services can be easily integrated. â¢ Fourthly, it should provide a platform to action research. Actioning research is, in the authorsâ understanding, what makes a platform an actual research environment. Research objects are in this regard not just stored and exchanged but they are used in the conduct of research (De Roure et al. 2008, p. 182). This depiction of a SVRE does of course not exclude mass computation (the third capability in fact endorses the integration of additional services)âit does, however, clearly focus on the interaction and collaboration between researchers.

99,285,0.305,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"nesses, most innovations in local welfare originate in non-market contexts and respective social milieus, like the voluntary sector or social movements (according to some definitions of social innovations, exclusively so). Their social character is specific. This again has consequences for processes of diffusion, scaling-up, popularising or mainstreaming. Taking these specificities into account, we can sum up the problems with transferring messages from social innovations that surfaced during the research in six paragraphs. Risky Journeys: The Diffusion of Non-technical and Non-market-based Innovations The literature on the diffusion of innovations primarily concentrates on the business sector and therefore principally on diffusion in a market context. As we noted before, this is not the realm of all innovations, including most social innovations in the welfare domain, and we will see that it has consequences for the ultimate analysis of the process. Therefore it is useful to consider insights from literature outside market contexts. There is by now a substantial body of literature on innovations in the public sector, under the label of âpolicy transferâ. This work on policy diffusion examines how policies spread across different administrations, adapting (or not) to different institutional conditions (Dolowitz and Marsh 2000). For instance, it has been used to explain the diffusion of monetary policy across member states of the European Union with their own different formal structures and administrative cultures (Radaelli 2000) or the spread of public management practices across different countries, in which the same instrument or policy can have very different meanings depending on where they are implemented (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2004; Brandsen and Kim 2010). Actual diffusion processes differ strongly in terms of what is diffused (e.g. objectives, contents, concepts, structures, instruments) and the degree to which something is diffused (ranging from straight copying to light inspiration, with various hybrid variations in between). Furthermore, it has to be kept in mind that journeys from âsendersâ to âreceivers/adoptersâ are mostly risky and sometimes intricate (Nowotny 1997). There are many reasons why innovations may not diffuse from their place of origin. Others may get lost on the journey, damaged, changed in content or taken up and used by adopters other than innovators had thought of. While research on diffusion tends to focus on the process of adoption, especially of successful cases of adoption, one should ideally also examine failed cases or those cases where an innovation could have been relevant, but was never considered. What also becomes more complex in a public context is the issue of motives for diffusion, which is straightforward (or at least presumed to be so) among commercial businesses. The incentives for policymakers and civil servants are more complex. While they can be driven by the desire for problem solving, they can also be motivated by political gain and/or complex political strategies. Hence, the question of motivation (or lack of it) is important in the analysis of the diffusion of social innovations."
376,373,0.305,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","equilibrium point following disturbance (Holling 1973). In contrast, ecological resilience recognizes that ecosystems may not return to their original equilibrium point, but that they may reorganize around alternative equilibrium points (Gunderson 2000). Resilience is often expressed graphically with âbasin-of-attractionâ or âball-andcupâ diagrams to further clarify this abstract concept. In this graphic representation, the ball represents the structural variables of the system in relation to the controlling variables and feedback mechanisms that are represented by the shape and number of the basins (Beisner et al. 2003; Walker et al. 2012). Engineering resilience emphasizes the depth of the basin which determines the rate of recovery following disturbance. Ecological resilience emphasizes the width of the basin to represent the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand without the ball rolling beyond the rim of the basin (threshold) into an alternative basin. Ecological resilience is most commonly applied to natural resource management where thresholds and the formation of alternative stable states are of major concern. State-and-transition models represent a conceptual advance from the traditional range model that was founded on Clementsian succession by recognizing the occurrence of nonlinear vegetation dynamics and the potential existence of alternative stable states on individual ecological sites. These models were originally introduced as a âmanagement language,â rather than an ecological theory, to organize and interpret rangeland vegetation dynamics. However, the STM framework has become a major tool for interpreting and integrating both management and ecological information. Subsequently, these models are broadly viewed as being supported by ecological resilience and are most appropriately considered equilibrium models because individual states exist with a single basin of attraction and thresholds represent boundaries between multiple equilibrium states. Ecological indicators of state variables, controlling variables, and to lesser extent feedback mechanisms that underpin resilience are used to determine if a state is trending toward or away from pending thresholds (Briske et al. 2008). This information can inform managers of the need to implement actions to modify state resilience to achieve desired outcomes. The adoption of resilience theory has had broad consequences for natural resource management by providing an alternative to command-and-control management. Command and control employs a top-down, regulatory strategy that often ignores variation and the complexity of interactions among ecological and social system components (Anderies et al. 2006). The typical response to uncertainty and surprise is to increase control which often further reduces resilience and moves the system toward pending thresholds (Holling 1973; Holling and Meffe 1996). Management strategies to minimize variability and optimize production efficiency in one portion of the system frequently increase vulnerability in another portion of the system. These top-down management strategies have also been founded on unrealistic assumptions regarding the ability of managers to anticipate and implement actions, often as technological solutions, in time to prevent natural resource degradation or ecosystem shifts to alternative states. In contrast to command and control, resilience-based management recognizes both the inevitability of change and the need for change, such that it seeks to guide change, rather than to control it to maintain a single optimal state.

Second, local approaches deal with unemployed people in groups, acknowledging that they are part of a local community, while mainstream policies address jobseekers as individuals whose social relationships are rather irrelevant. Third, complex approaches offer tailor-made and personalized support packages, while the portfolio of the job centre is limited to managerialist and impersonal devices. To sum up, the key difference concerns the overall perspective of the employment policy: Does it combine aspects of social and labour market integration or is it reduced to the principle of employability?"

Secondly, previous experiments on North American rivers, e.g., the Columbia River basin, the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin river basin and delta in California (Johnson 1999), have proven very costly in terms of time and money invested as well as the institutional complexities that had to be harmonized (Richter et al. 2006). In these cases the process entailed multiple layers (executive, manager, and technical) of decision and review (Walters et al. 2000) and was agitated by the levels of sociopolitical controversy surrounding the signiï¬cant economic trade-offs at hand (Richter et al. 2006). If success requires years of sustaining such effort, many might opt for less costly approaches. Finally, despite some exceptions (Allan and Stankey 2009), there are few, convincing success stories in AMâs history of risky and costly experiments (Lee 1999; Medema et al. 2008). One reason may be that often success is hard to detect when clear thresholds are difï¬cult to establish and measure (van Wilgen and Biggs 2011), though adaptive learning successfully developed ï¬ow thresholds on the Letaba (Pollard et al. 2009) and Kissimmee (Toth et al. 1998) rivers. Another reason is that no history of successfully repeated experiments can be built on the basis of contradictory deï¬nitions or applications of AM (Allen et al. 2011). The slow adoption of AM can broadly be explained by path dependence on conventional, control-centered management strategies. A variety of factors can contribute to this: funding and administrative priorities based on reactive rather than proactive management paradigms (Walters 1997), failure to identify or address the potential to shift goals to acknowledge the increased risk of surprise because of social sources of uncertainty (Tyre and Michaels 2011), defaulting to extant institutional norms rather than reï¬ecting, box-ticking as opposed to learning and favoring competition over cooperation (Allan and Curtis 2005), and resource limitations in terms of funding and human capital. The novel capacities that AM requires of any river manager would be a major barrier to adoption. These capacities include developing new ways for managers and stakeholders to collaborate under high uncertainty, especially in integrating science and policy in participatory processes, considering a wide range of practices over long time periods projected in future scenarios (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007). As opposed to direct administration of agency employees, managers might have to patiently attend to repeated phases of social learning by the community in implementing and then sustaining new and innovative management approaches (Pahl-Wostl et al. 2007)."

The common ground for both above mentioned trendsâthe âdeprofessionalisationâ of science journalism and the âdeinstitutionalisationâ of science communication at largeâis the remarkable amount of laypersons finding their voices online and the self-conception of civil society organisations demanding to be involved in the science communication process. As much as this inevitably shatters the economic base of science journalism and as much as it may force the science establishment to reinvent its communication practice, we should be grateful for the degree of communication from âscientific citizensâ. Thereby the challenge lies less in permitting (or even embracing) bottomâup movements as such, but rather more in resisting the use of public dialogue as a means to an end. While valorising âcitizen scienceâ as an overdue âco-productionâ of authoritative social knowledge, Fuller warns us not to treat broadcasts of consensus conferences, citizen juries, etc. simply as better or worse amplifiers for the previously repressed forms of âlocal knowledgeâ represented by the citizens who are now allowed to share the spotlight with the scientists and policy makers. (2010, p. 292) The questionable success of most of these public engagement campaigns has increasingly been challenged recently. Grassroots initiatives like âWissenschaftsdebatteâ or âForschungswendeâ in Germany criticise openly the fact that pseudoengagement has merely served as a fig leaf excuse for the legitimisation of research agendas which are still being built topâdown. Instead it will be necessary to supplement the dragged-in rituals of âend of pipeâ dissemination with a fresh paradigm of âstart of pipeâ deliberation.

Woodside is âwholly responsible for the field-work. In nearly every case a visit is paid to the soldierâs homeâ.86 The second practice â collecting social data or the social history â enables psychiatristsâ reliable access to the social setting, and Stewart notes that â[p]sychiatrists appreciated such âsocial historyââ.87 In this, much weight is attached to âunsatisfactory parent-child relationships in the first months and years of lifeâ, and âthe social and cultural background of the patientâ.88 The influence of mental hygiene and child guidance is clear.

Looking at these practices and intellectual frameworks in a more abstract and analytical way, we can see how the presenting problem is subordinated to a social constellation â the problem is recast as a symptom of disordered interpersonal relationships. In 1949 John Bowlby argues that âmore and more clearly ... the overt problem which is brought into the clinic in the person of the child is not the real problem; the problem which as a rule we need to solve is the tension between all the different members of the familyâ.90 Toms has many examples of this shift in child guidance: Tavistock psychiatrist Dugmore Hunter writes in 1955 of children being forced into illness by parents avoiding their own problems, and psychiatrist Jack Kahn describes in 1957 the âmaladjustment funnelled into [a child] by the group tensions of the familyâ.91 This kind of shift, from the presenting problem to the (supposed) real issues"
99,241,0.304,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"In this chapter, we have described the transition of the ongoing welfare policies governance system in Milan over recent decades. Milan as a case study yields understanding of the barriers that local governments, especially in the countries most affected by the recession, face in promoting a system of governance oriented to social innovation, and in which social policies (even if weak) are supposed to play an important role in promoting local development. After many years of profound changes, Milan has currently reached deadlock in terms of policy innovation. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the city was highly dynamic in terms of welfare provision, given that the municipal government was a central actor in designing and providing social services as tools for economic and social development. From the 1990s to 2011, the municipal government instead played a weak role as director of a system of governance in which welfare was residual and was based on the involvement of non-profit and private organizations, but only as providers. During those two decades, the right-wing coalition governing Milan adopted a basically market-oriented style of governance (Molotch and Vicari 2009). The period was dominated by the rhetoric that creation of a âgood business climateâ was an effective way to foster growth and innovation but also to eradicate poverty and to deliver, in the long run, higher standards of living to the mass of the population (Harvey 1989). However, those years were marked by a huge increase in the social inequalities characterizing the social structure of the city (DâOvidio 2009). In 2011, municipal elections rewarded a new coalition proposing a style of governance more oriented to a âsocial innovation approachâ. However, the difficult financial situation inherited by the municipality from the past, and austerity measures imposed by the national government, have reduced the ambitions of the current municipal government in regard to social policies. In this chapter, we have highlighted that values expressed in the welfare plan have not yet been translated into effective actions. According to this document, for example, welfare measures are important investments for local development âthat the rhetoric of the economic crisis is not supposed to limitâ (Municipality of Milan 2012, p. 5). However, the efforts to respect the Stability Pact have greatly restricted welfare investments. Moreover, the municipal government has been pressurizing the national government to redesign the Stability Pact so that it was able to afford the public costs of the forthcoming International Expo 2015, while pressures to support welfare services have been weaker. Indeed, also the new municipal government regards this event as the main chance for the cityâs future economic and social development. Within the dimensions proposed by Cattacin and Zimmer in Chap. 2 of this volume, we can argue that Milan has been following a pattern of local development based on a concurrence of public investment in economic or social initiatives, while the rhetoric and values of the electoral campaign and the coalition programme have been more oriented to governance of social innovation."

I thus avoid the notion that there are a range of essential male traits that engender stoic, unemotional and independent behaviour, instead arguing that male customs were (and still are) often constrained by social structures and institutional gendered practices. As a historian, I would also contend that there are still advantages in employing the concept of hegemonic masculinity. The version of masculinity that was most âhonouredâ during the post-war period required the projection of strength and control â qualities that did not fit well with a notion of male nervous instability. As Mark Micale has shown in his work on male nervous illness in earlier times, these values were a hangover from the Victorian era when âthe spectrum of emotions deemed appropriate for adult men in Britain greatly diminishedâ â a point that will be developed more fully throughout this book. 92 This is of course not to say that all men âachievedâ or complied with this version of masculinity. Indeed, as the testimonies from clinicians in this book will illustrate, much of the male psychological and psychosomatic illness that presented in primary care could be correlated with unsuccessful attempts to live up to this ideal. Of recent years, historians have highlighted a tension that has developed between earlier social histories, which focused primarily upon experience and agency, and more recent cultural histories, which focus upon discourse and representation.93 As Michael Roper has rightly noted what is often missing from linguistic analyses is an adequate sense of the material: the practices of everyday life and the human experience of emotional relationships.94 Historians of masculinity have therefore suggested that future studies would benefit from a focus, not only on broad cultural codes, but also upon how men related to these codes.95 In the words of Roper and Tosh, new histories need to âexplore how cultural representations become part of subjective identityâ.96 This is a challenging task, for we cannot know with any real certainty the subjective processes that operate to mediate between individual men and cultural formations of masculinity. We can only ever hope to âcorrelateâ certain aspects of male behaviour with the set of cultural codes that predominate at any one time. Roper cautions that earlier social histories"

However, visibility can be a doubleedged sword, which on one side can lead to empowerment30 when it is closely related to recognition by others or to access to restricted resources or services. But on the other, it can also facilitate control, exclusion, and discrimination by others, creating an ambivalent situation for migrants. This is the case for migrant women in irregular situations, and women victim-survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Recognition is a form of social visibility with implications for minorities and for those who are socially excluded. Often perceptions of visibility are distorted due to the entrenched social representations of marginal subjects, and so visibility and recognition are not related in a linear way: there may be different ways of seeing and being seen, and the social impact of this visibility will depend on who is more visible and in which social location they are placed (Brighenti 2007). Total âvisibilityâ may lead to total control, as explained in Foucaultâs discussion of the panopticon â a symbol of total surveillance (Gordon 2002). In addition, visibility can lead to regulation, selectivity, or stratification. So the relationship between seeking recognition or visibility and being controlled is a close one. This tension between achieving recognition and suffering control or discrimination generates complexity in the relationship between in/visibility and power, and therefore between migrants and their context. In these terms, visibility does not necessarily lead to relief nor does it imply better life while invisibility cannot only be seen or considered as a lack of power (Brighenti 2007). Invisibility as a strategy for power is reflected in the cases of silence and secrecy. Secrecy is not only centred within power, but secrecy by others also creates the possibility to escape or oppose power (Brighenti 2007; Amster 2008). Silence and secrecy can be key survival strategies, can offer protection, and in some cases can create spaces to renegotiate harmful gender relations and practices. In this respect, it is important to discuss the role of in/visibility in empowerment processes. If we are to consider the active participation of migrants in processes that will allow them access to better conditions of life, and what that might imply in the current context of border controls heightened by international requirements, we need to first question in what manner in/visibility could con30 Empowerment refers to the process by which those who have been denied the possibility of taking strategic decisions in life acquire such capacity (Kabeer 1999)."
293,10,0.304,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","sending states in immigration and integration processes. In that sense, this book should be understood as a state-of-the-art volume that takes stock of and presents existing knowledge to assess the relevance of incorporating the sending states into analyses of immigrantsâ integration processes and policies. In line with recent approaches to the concept of integration, Chap. 2 by Penninx and GarcÃ©s-MascareÃ±as sets up an analytical framework for the study of integration processes and policies. The first part focuses on the concept of integration, introducing an open, non-normative analytical definition and identifying the main dimensions, parties involved, levels of analysis, and other relevant factors such as time and generations. The second part defines integration policies and proposes a distinction between policy frames and concrete policy measures as well as a shift from government to governance so as to account for the complex, multilayered and often contradictory character of integration policies. In the broader context of this book, the analytical framework proposed in this chapter leads us to a twofold conclusion: the concept of integration and integration policies is made dramatically more complex, in particular, by taking a disaggregated approach that considers not only multiple reference populations but also distinct processes occurring in different dimensions and domains. At the same time, immigrantsâ integration continues to be seen essentially as a two-way process involving the immigrants themselves and the receiving society. In Chap. 3, Van Mol and De Valk provide a general background to help us to understand the first key actor of the abovementioned binomial, that is, the immigrants themselves. In particular, the authors analyse the main socio-demographic changes in migration patterns towards and within Europe since the 1950s. Making use of secondary literature and available statistical data, they first describe the main phases in immigration, its backgrounds and determinants, depending on immigrantsâ origins and reasons to migrate and with regard to different European regions. In the second part of the chapter, the authors narrow the focus to the specificities of recent patterns of mobility within Europe. Analysing both migration flows and the residing migrant population across Europe, they distinguish different sociodemographic characteristics of migrants depending on countries of origin and destination. For instance, while Polish migration to Germany seems to be dominated by men aged between 20 and 50 years old, Polish immigrants in the Netherlands are significantly younger and more equally balanced in terms of gender. The analysis of intra-European mobility shows that in North-Western Europe (e.g., in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands) intra-European migrants account for more than the half of total immigration, meaning that a substantial proportion of new immigrants falls outside those categorized as target groups of EU integration policies. The subsequent three chapters focus on the second actor of the binomial, that is, the receiving society, particularly the characteristics and main developments of immigration and integration policies. In Chap. 4, Doomernik and Bruquetas-Callejo distinguish between different immigration and integration policy regimes in Europe. The first is that of North-Western European countries, which evolved from guest worker policies that considered immigrants only as temporary workers to national integration policies that recognize them as permanent citizens and, more recently, to"
133,344,0.303,"A Demographic Perspective on Gender, Family and Health in Europe","Conceptual Framework Different mechanisms have been proposed for the link between family status and health behaviour. In the ï¬rst, partnership and parenting positively influence health behaviour through social control and through social support (Brockmann and Klein 2004; Umberson 1987, 1992; Umberson et al. 2010). Social control in particular seems to be an important determinant of health behaviour, affecting health behaviours directly (e.g., sanctions for deviant behaviour, regulation, and physical intervention) and indirectly (e.g., internalisation of norms of healthful behaviour and facilitation of positive health behaviours) (Umberson 1987). There may also be mechanisms by which having a partner and living with children could lead to a decrease in healthy behaviour (e.g., stress caused by combined social roles, social and domestic responsibilities, increased demands on time, or discord in the relationship) (Brown et al. 2009; Eng et al. 2005; Hull et al. 2010; Nomaguchi and Bianchi 2004). A transition to divorce or widowhood could also be detrimental to health because of the loss of social control or social support provided by a partner. Furthermore, it is also noted that many associations are reciprocal (e.g., a stressful relationship may lead to heavy drinking that, in turn, further stresses the relationship). Another explanation for the link between partnership and health behaviour is that the search for a partner is associated with speciï¬c health behaviours. The need to be attractive and to go to places where potential partners might be found may result in behaviours such as increased physical activity, dieting, higher alcohol consumption, and smoking (Rapp and Schneider 2014). One interesting ï¬nding emerging from the research on family status and health behaviour is that the effects of marriage and parenting are different for men and women. Women are more likely to attempt to control the health behaviours of other family members than are men (Fuller 2010). Consequently, marriage is more likely to be associated with social control for men. Additionally, men engage in health-risk behaviours more often, and this may be a focus of social control in marriage (Umberson 1987). Interestingly, women more often report experiencing social control by a parent or a child (Fuller 2010)âit may be that for women, the experience of marriage as a source of social control is relatively diminished in the context of other agents of social control. A ï¬nal consideration is the socio-economic situation of women and men, which varies depending on living arrangements. Socio-economic status (SES) could be a mediator in the association of partnership and parenthood with health behaviour. For example, single parents often have a lower SES than do partnered parents, and this may contribute to a higher prevalence of health-risk behaviour. It cannot be assumed, however, that the relationships between partnership and parenthood and health behaviour can be explained entirely by socio-economic and occupational factors (Roos et al. 1998). In the same vein, SES could be a moderator, as SES and family status may interact and show cumulative adverse effects on health behaviour."
284,246,0.303,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"the development of scientiï¬c interdisciplinary analysis. More and better participation, and a substantial improvement in training, are a priority for all governments. This aspect was particularly stressed at Rio+20. Environmental governance of the land, patrimonial accounts, environmental assessment of investment projects, evaluation of environmental impacts, strategic environmental assessments and so forth are emerging as important alternatives. According to ECLAC (2010:140), âTerritorial heterogeneity in Latin America calls for selective and targeted strategies. Local development, understood as a bottom-up process, mobilizes endogenous potential to build territories that are better able to create and drive their own capacities.â The objectives of the National Environmental Governance Project in each country must reverse the process of poverty generation and, in turn, give more momentum to tasks already under way to directly improve the situation. Habitat improvement and policies to combat environmental degradation are systematically integrated with the possibility for a better life. In addition, the use of unusual environmental policies in Latin American countries â such as tax policies, credit, tariff or integration â all signify that there is a long way to go. While these ideas are technologically plausible, and are also key for the sustainability of the planet, it is worth reiterating critical doubts that arise from both historical experience and theory. They question the ability of the current model of accumulation and the political regime of domination to advance socioeconomic and environmental sustainable development, without signiï¬cant changes. The historical scenario seems to prolong an insurmountable contradiction between the interests to produce, distribute and consume, and the need to ensure social and environmental human life. Therefore, a greater organization and activity of environmental social movements emerges as a possible alternative. An organizational form for sustainable development within environmental governance involves a holistic view, a direct relationship between research and action. It is a combination of the short, medium and long term, and of a generally high level of participation among civil society and social movements. It proposes implementing the necessary changes and taking actions that can lead to more successful forms of environmental governance and a better quality of life. Economic understanding must be open to all necessary actors, which requires reformulating the conditions for recovery and reproduction of capital with ecological, economic, social, technological and political implications. Only then do the desired reduction of poverty and reconciliation with nature truly begin."

The report describes the evacuation of Towers 1 and 2, and offers an explanation for the variation in the time taken for evacuation of the two towers despite their layout, size, and number of occupants being almost the same. The NIST report includes a description taken from a simulation of occupant evacuations during the WTC disaster and highlighted several concerns that future simulation systems should address. The social psychological factors involved in human behavior are related to the validation of crowd simulation models. A substantial amount of data on pedestrian dynamics was presented at the Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics conference [2]. Zhang et al. conducted experiments on human bidirectional flows at the laboratory level [3]. Helbingâs empirical social forces model simulated interactions among people and resultant behaviors such as the arch-like blocking of an exit and fasteris-slower effect [4]. The results of crowd simulations using these models have been validated with real world data.

Their model is based on Helbingâs work and is composed of geometrical information and psychological rules with a force model resembling behaviors of real people. Durupinar et al. extend the HiDAC model by specifying agents personalities in order to mimic human behaviors from normal and disaster environments [6].

If medical progress required experiments on animals, then the scientistâs cool indifference to vivisecting them signified dedication and self-mastery rather than callousness or cruelty. By the early-twentieth century, vivisection had come to be seen as an indispensable weapon in medicineâs unending âfightâ against disease: to be pro-vivisection was to be for science, progress, and the relief of human suffering, while anti-vivisectionists were enemies of science, whose sentimentality and squeamishness were obstacles to be overcome. To understand the motives of anti-vivisectionists, one must first appreciate the fundamental differences over the nature and goals of science that lay (and perhaps still lie) at the heart of the debate. I have laid particular emphasis on the thesis that vivisection was the expression of a particular view of scienceâobjective, dispassionate, materialisticâ which has now become so familiar it is largely taken for granted, but which was contentious in its time. Anti-vivisectionists also regarded themselves as scientificâthey tried to test their position through experiments such as anti-vivisection hospitalsâbut their idea of what constituted scientific sources extended beyond results acquired in the clinic and laboratory to encompass less palpable forms of knowledge. To them, a scientistâs duty was not simply to investigate physical phenomena but to seek a deeper appreciation of their significance and, by paying attention to ethical and social considerations, to increase the sum of human wellbeing. The spiritual revival, and ânew ageâ utopianism, deeply influenced the anti-vivisection movement. While the most important motives for early anti-vivisectionists were probably their commitment to Christian values and personal virtue, it is striking how many later ones were theosophists, vegetarians, pacifists, and members of various socio-religious orders, unions and groups. For these reformers, vivisection was unscientific because it treated animals as mere matter and ignored the spiritual, aesthetic and moral aspects of life that, though intangible, had to be heeded if humankindâs harmony with nature was to be restored. The idea that the vivisectionistsâ mask of objectivity hid their inability to understand the real consequences of their actions, or even accept"
269,107,0.302,Rethinking Interdisciplinarity across the Social Sciences and Neurosciences,"We want to draw particular attention, in this chapter, not to what this project is doing, but how it came about. Here is one origin story. Not unsurprisingly, it construes one of the authors of this book as one of the central protagonists, and centres on a tight-knit group of surrounding characters. In 2008, FC was immersed in one of the heartlands of psychiatric, psychological. and neuroscientific research. She was also experiencing a certain amount of epistemological and professional disquietude. First, there was the unease she felt at how her role as a social scientist â and specifically as a person whose interests were those of the psychiatric âservice userâ â was being imagined within a large programme of research addressing translational mental health. In this role, FC was someone who, she felt, was often positioned as simply assisting clinical and other academic mental health researchers with smoothing the âtranslationalâ pipeline, or with âunderstanding the patient [or family] perspectiveâ (Callard, Rose, and Wykes 2012). She was considered rather less frequently, she believes, as a researcher whose expertise in social theory and the history of psychiatry might shift some of the logics at work in the translational endeavour (Mol 2002). Second, she was curious about the complexity of the genetic and neurobiological accounts that colleagues advanced in seminars and in the collaborations that she was being drawn into (see e.g. Greenwood et al. 2011) â accounts that challenged her existing, rather static assumptions about the âbiomedicalâ. In the midst of this intellectual quandary, she received an email inviting applications for the first European Neuroscience and Society Network interdisciplinary âNeuroschoolâ, a five-year programme âinvolving leading neuroscientists and social scientists from eleven European countries in collaborative research and debateâ. The Neuroschool was intended to âfoster learning in an interdisciplinary symmetrical environmentâ, taking behavioural genetics as its entry point. Current methodologies of experimentation (as well as the implications thereof within society), the âlatest scientific evidence in the fieldâ, and âthe history and sociology of psychotropic drugsâ were all scheduled for discussion and debate (European Neuroscience and Society Network, cited in Costandi 2008; see also Frazzetto 2011 for a comprehensive account of the pedagogies involved within the Neuroschool). On attending the Neuroschool, FC came to know a cognitive neuroscientist through jointly engaging in experimental practices that are used"

Moreover, it takes into account the multiple conceptualizations of and claims over nature as part of a contested sphere, which we denominate âenvironmental governanceâ. The three parts of this book address the changing context, social interactions and institutional adaptations in contemporary natureâsociety relations in Latin America. Part I introduces the socioenvironmental context through a focus on the historical legacy of Latin American environmentalist thinking, the increasing pressure on the regionâs environment due to the global demand for its natural resources, and the rich ecological knowledge within local communities. These chapters set the stage to analyse the recent transformations of natureâsociety relations in the region. Part II addresses the politics of nature, raising issues related to the role of powerful actors â the state, elite and corporations â and their interactions in shaping discourses and practices regarding natural resource use. These processes are explored through the analysis of new policy models deployed by post-neoliberal governments, the role of new and old elites and their interactions, the narratives around the waterâenergyâmining nexus by contesting actors, and strategies for poverty alleviation. In Part III, new and emerging forms of environmental governance that tackle issues of participation, autonomy and environmental security are examined. The analysis of the implementation of REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), the controversial international compensatory scheme to prevent climate change, addresses how participatory mechanisms have become invited spaces of selected legitimized groups while the bottom-up initiatives of community-based autonomous economies and local consultations to mining projects that address the struggles for effective inclusion, wellbeing and justice emerged from resistance movements. In general, this volume aims to understand environmental governance in Latin America by looking into the ways in which historical legacies and current socioenvironmental contexts are driving new social interactions and institutional adaptations among multiple actors. The chapters cover a range of Latin American countries, mostly based on empirical data from multiple contexts, actors and production systems, and focus on transnational, national or subnational processes. Together they provide an overview of current regionwide trends, and a variety of themes and approaches to environmental governance, which feeds lively and sometimes heated debates in academia as well as in civil society and policy-making circles."

A SAM builds on a circular flow conception like input-output approaches and thus could be used independently of a CGE for macroeconomic analysis (cf. Poganietz et al. 2000). The MAGNET (Modular Applied GeNeral Equilibrium Tool) is a recursive dynamic CGE model developed at the Landbouw Economisch Instituut (LEI; Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands) and builds on the GTAP database. It is the succession model of LEITAP (Landbouw Economisch Instituut Trade Analysis Project). It has a modular set-up with modules for mapping the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and biofuels and evaluates long-term, economy-wide upstream and downstream effects including price (Van Meijl et al. 2006). MAGNET was applied to analyse the macroeconomic impacts of large-scale deployment of biomass resources in the Netherlands (Hoefnagels et al. 2013), the macroeconomic impacts of a bio-based economy in Malaysia (van Meijl et al. 2012), and the global leakage effects of EU biofuel consumption (Smeets et al. 2014). Recently, MAGNET has been extended by additional bio-based sectors such as secondgeneration biofuels, bioelectricity, biochemicals, and biomass supply sectors for both residues from agriculture and forestry and pretreatments of agricultural residues that are utilized by other sectors (Banse et al. 2014).

In this case, statistics captured how the parasite infiltrated the cultural ecosystem of Lebanese society. Dogs were ascribed a variety of roles, from companions to stray mongrels, some welcomed into the human sphere and some excluded from it. In either case, canine relationships with humans became a key ecological factor that enabled or obstructed the parasiteâs passage to humans. In invoking the importance of these domestic social relationships alongside surgical data, Schwabe used ephemeral connections between humans and dogs to follow the parasitic animal as it moved from one host ecosystem to another. The parasitological research tradition had been driven in just this manner, by animals such as E. granulosus, which, in responding to their environments, often created new symbiotic relationships that were based on the biological qualities of the host animalâSchwabe expanded on this tradition in his explicit inclusion of their social and cultural behaviours as well. With his success at AUB, Schwabeâs sphere of influence grew and he increasingly took to the global health stage. In Beirut he had pursued E. granulosus into the human realm, finding that movement between nonhuman and human research gave him a fuller sense of the parasiteâs biology. This work only expanded when the WHO first asked him to travel on their behalf in 1960, contracting him to visit Cyprus and investigate the islandâs endemic E. granulosus. This trip was quickly followed by a series of trips to multiple far-flung centres of E. granulosus infection, from New Zealand to Argentina, which would mark the initiation of the WHOâs global effort to control the disease.36 Most critical for his own career at this time, however, was Schwabeâs trip to Kenya in January 1961, on a fulbright Scholarship that would relocate his family to a home outside Nairobi for the entire year.37 While Schwabeâs explicit goal during his stay in Kenya was to finish writing the manuscript that would become his first edition of VMHH, he pursued the E. granulosus parasite into this new setting as well.

Research and theory about ability factors has continued to advance in psychology since the work on the Kit ended in the 1970s, most notably Carrollâs (1993) identification of 69 factors from a massive reanalysis of extant, factor-analytic studies through the mid-1980s, culminating in his three-stratum theory of cognitive abilities. Nonetheless, the Kit project has had a lasting impact on the field. The various Kits were, and are, widely used in research at ETS and elsewhere. The studies include not only factor analyses of large sets of tests that use a number from the Kit to define factors (e.g., Burton and Fogarty 2003), in keeping with its original purpose, but also many small-scale experiments and correlational investigations that simply use a few Kit tests to measure specific variables (e.g., Hegarty et al. 2000).

For example, McDonaldâs Ronald McDonald House Charities (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001) enables seriously ill children to stay with their parents when receiving medical treatment far from home. Future sustainable entrepreneurship research can contribute to our understanding of the entrepreneurial mechanisms for developing non-economic gains for individuals. Developing non-economic gains for society. Gains to society include benefits for people living in that society; however, they are different from individual gains in that the latter may only go to a select few individuals whereas societal gains are accessible to all (or the vast majority of) societal members. For example, societies realize gains by developing the âwell-being and security of national states, regions and institutions and, more recently, the valued social ties and community organizationsâ (Board of Sustainable Development, 1999, p. 25). The well-being of nations and regions encompasses inhabitantsâ satisfaction with life and happiness (Diener et al., 1995; Vemuri & Costanza, 2006), and security refers to defense against both outside threats (e.g., by other nations [e.g., Steinbruner, 1978]) and inside threats (e.g., through economic [Parkhe, 1992] or environmental [Porter, 1995] decay). Societies can also realize gains by developing social ties and inter-personal relationships between societal members. In poorer regions with decreased human well-being, weak social norms, low inter-personal trust, corruption, and violence tend to proliferate (Narayan & Petesch, 2002), representing significant impediments to societal development (Easterly, 2006). Social entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility studies have emphasized the importance of entrepreneurs in creating non-economic gains for society. For instance, Ibrahim Abouleish, a social entrepreneur, founded Sekem, an initiative that began by growing organic herbs for medicinal use in poor areas of Egypt. Not only did this initiative create jobs for locals, but it also improved the areaâs social structure and enhanced inhabitantsâ trust in society, thereby enabling people to escape poverty and regain control in their lives. By applying organic agriculture techniques, Sekem also helped preserve parts of the regionâs natural environment (Seelos & Mair, 2005). As Burton and Goldsby (2009) argued, entrepreneurs and small business owners are often driven less by profit than shareholders of larger publicly held organizations, thus enabling them to act in more socially responsible ways. For example, one way entrepreneurs can contribute to the development of their local society is by keeping employment locally instead of shifting their operations to less"

Really engaging the students successfully means starting with them where they are, iteratively exploring with them rather than lecturing at themâwhatever the expectations that their own field sets about how education actually works. Exploring in this way is a challenge to do within the framework of their existing curriculum. At least, it is a challenge to do in a satisfactory way. More time and depth are needed to get past the flattening of social science to a set of recognizable tools or a body of largely pre-intuitable societal knowledge. We will need more, and longer-term, engagements if we want to get across its power as a set of alternative methodological strategies for getting a grip on the world. The starting point for the PAGES collaboration was this realization: interdisciplinary collaboration is hard. That proved true all along the way. When it succeeded in PAGES, the outcome had much to do with trust, voice, and personal relationships. The only adequate way to close is with admiration for those colleagues and NE students and postdocs who made it possible for social scientists to engage with nuclear engineers."

Here policy options are seen not as solutions but as hypotheses to be tested under a regime where formalized learning and management are objectives for which experimentation is the key (Rist et al. 2013). Interventions can be risky, especially in riverine SES, which are â. . .open systems that cannot be isolated from their social contextâ (Konrad et al. 2011). However, some river managers do choose to actively intervene in response to some emerging problem. Often a lack of data challenges managers trying to understand and manage how environmental ï¬ows contribute to the serviceable functioning of a river. A history of water control structure construction has almost eliminated naturally ï¬owing rivers. In North America construction of more than 2.5 million control structures have left less than 2% of all rivers naturally ï¬owing (Lytle and Poff 2004), with a similarly small percentage of naturally ï¬owing rivers in Europe (see Chap. 6). This denies most managers naturally occurring reference ï¬ow conditions to use as performance criteria. Social awareness of this extreme state has been heightened by the growing recognition of societyâs dependence on increasingly fragile aquatic resources. Many rivers are stressed and over-allocated in order to serve the demands of growing populations through hydro-engineering (Chen et al. 2015). In response, societal values have shifted to question this history, and managers have been compelled to modify operations of these control structures to mitigate physical and biological impacts on aquatic ecosystems (Rood et al. 2003)."

The Google Analytics âadvanced segmentâ for social media, as personally defined and used by Europeana, contains 20 sources (referrer domains), some of which have registered insignificant or even no traffic at all during the last six months (October 2012âMarch 2013) See Table 2.

The Twitter traffic is identified by âinclude Source containing ât.coââ. Patently, this is too loose a definition as it will not only pick up ât.coâ, but any domain containing that sequence of characters e.g. search.bt.com.

198,433,0.299,Evaluating Climate Change Action for Sustainable Development,"This meta-analysis was conducted using a philosophical lens called critical realism. In evaluation, the realist approach emphasizes underlying assumptions about the way certain interventions are expected to yield certain outcomes in a certain context (Pawson and Tilley 2004). It thus defies the deterministic worldview which is symbolized as âif X happens, it automatically produces outcome Y.â Such a linear, sequential worldview is considered deterministic or positivistic, in that hypothesized theories of change are thought to work regardless of the context within which theories of change are situated. In other words, deterministic theory of change does not give us the explanations as to âfor whom such interventions may work, in what circumstances, and howâ (Pawson and Tilley 1997). Moreover, although the deterministic findings can tell us what interventions may have worked in certain countries under certain conditions (âthereâ), they may not tell us for whom these successful interventions are expected to work, under what circumstances, and how (âhereâ). The realist approach thus resonates with evidence-based policy making in that it is thought to be useful in answering the important evaluation question, i.e. âit worked there, but will it work here?â (Cartwright and Hardie 2012). The following sections, however, first present the results of the meta-analysis that are considered deterministic in nature, immediately followed by non-deterministic ones and how the realist approach is applied. The intention behind this structure is to emphasize the characteristics of critical realism philosophy. Deterministic findings appear to help evaluators to know whether certain interventions work or not for achieving key outcomes, but such a deterministic approach is what a realist approach attempts to defy. The realist approach belongs to the school of theory-based evaluation (Stern et al. 2012). The realist approach is based on a school of thought in a philosophy of science, called critical realism. The concept of critical realism has been most significantly developed by Roy Bhaskar.4 Critical realism can provide a useful lens especially in social sciences for the world that is âstructured, differentiated, stratified and changing,â and recognizes the shift of emphasis âto what produces the events â not just to the events themselves.â (Danermark et al. 2002). An evaluation approach based on critical realism is thus an âintuitively appealing approach to those trying to expose and unpack the complexities of contexts and interrelated mechanisms underlying implementation activityâ (Rycroft-Malone et al. 2012). The use of this evaluation approach is thus considered appropriate in the complex experience of CCA projects. Adoption of critical realism in evaluation field (principally in public health and criminology) has significantly progressed thanks to the work of Pawson (2013), Pawson et al. (2004), Pawson and Tilley (1997, 2004), and Wong et al. (2013) and other scholars. His most notable works include The Possibility of Naturalism (1979) and A Realist Theory of Science (2008)."

Today technologies and the development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow us to easily demonstrate simple geographic spatial relationships and to analyze more complex ones. Mapping and GIS were applied here to illustrate spatial dimensions of marginality at continental and regional levels. We hereby sought to make the marginalized and poor more visible by identifying areas where many poor people live under difficult biophysical and socio-economic conditions. A broad set of variables covering ecological, social and economic dimensions were identified for this purpose and we used existing datasets to describe each variable in the first step of our marginality mapping approach. We focused on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia (SA), where most of the worldâs poor, and in particular the poorest, live (Ahmed et al. 2007; von Braun et al. 2009). The number of extremely poor and hungry people remains unacceptably high. Being excluded from economic growth and other dimensions of societal development are indications of the extreme poor existing at the margins of society, which may trigger a downward spiral into poverty (Gatzweiler et al. 2011). Marginality is frequently cited as a root cause of poverty (von Braun et al. 2009) and is a complex issue that is not amenable to simple solutions or answers. It may be defined as: an involuntary position and condition of an individual or group at the margins of social, political, economic, ecological and biophysical systems, preventing them from access to resources, assets, services, restraining freedom of choice, preventing the development of capabilities, and eventually causing extreme poverty (Gatzweiler et al. 2011, 3)."
87,113,0.299,"Bioeconomy : Shaping The Transition To a Sustainable, Biobased Economy","âDiscourseâ has originally been used as a concept for sequential analysis of the flow of conversations. Then, the concept has become a much broader interpretation by the work of Michel Foucault (a French philosopher, 1926â1984), who defined discourse as âsystems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speakâ. Foucault traced the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimisation and power, emphasising the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault argued that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects and a practice through which power structures are reproduced. Thus, power and knowledge are interrelated, and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power. Foucaultâs analysis has inspired discourse analysis in many fields, and it has become an integral part of political analysis in particular through the work of Maarten Hajer (a Dutch political scientist). He defined a policy discourse as ensemble of ideas, concepts and categories through which meaning is given to social and physical phenomena. It is produced and reproduced through an identifiable set of practices. In a policy arena, different, competing policy discourses may be identified. A policy discourse is produced and maintained by a discourse coalition, a group of actors that, in the context of an identifiable set of practices, shares the usage of a particular set of story lines over a particular period of time (Foucault 1981; Hajer 1995). In EU and in German political discourses, sometimes the idea of a knowledge-based"

Similarly, systems considered to be equilibrial are likely to experience intervals of nonequilibrium between livestock and forage during wet or dry seasons or years when forage production is high or when animal numbers are low. The current status of this rigorous debate is that appropriate qualification of equilibrium ecology, rather than its complete replacement by nonequilibrium models, offers more realistic interpretations for both plantâherbivore interactions and vegetation dynamics than does complete reliance on disturbance-driven events. Resilience provides a framework to accommodate the occurrence of dynamic equilibria within ecosystems (i.e., engineering resilience) and the potential for ecosystems to transition to alternative stable states (i.e., ecological resilience). Recognition of nonlinear and nonreversible shifts between stable states initially focused attention on identification and characterization of thresholds separating these states. However, thresholds have proven very difficult to identify prior to their occurrence which minimizes their management value. An alternative approach that has greater management value focuses on the trajectory of state resilience relative to the proximity of potential thresholds, with the use of ecological indicators, rather than on thresholds themselves (Watson et al. 1996; Briske et al. 2008). State-andtransition models developed and maintained by the USDA-NRCS and its partners represent the major framework for application of ecological resilience to rangelands in the USA and elsewhere. Greater insight into feedback mechanisms and controlling variables establishing resilience, and ecological indicators to assess the trajectory of state resilience, are needed to promote implementation of resilience-based management (Bestelmeyer and Briske 2012)."

By contrast, we argue for the necessity to integrate approaches of deliberation and moralization research for a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of (moral) public debates, communicative practices and constructions of values and their related norms. We therefore propose a framework for analysis of communicative practices that links (a) deliberation theory in the tradition of Habermas and (b) concepts for empirical deliberation research âpost Habermasâ with (c) social and communicative constructivist approaches to moral communication in the tradition of Bergmann and Luckmann (in detail cf.

Recent studies treating themes embedded in WID, WAD, and GAD suggest that elements of all three are useful for the question at hand (Chithtalath 2006). What might have been Boserupâs response? First and foremost, she was versed in both normal science and critical theory. While her professional lens was large, she remained firmly anchored in science and attempted to enlarge or expand economic analysis rather than replace its science base with alternative explanatory perspectives. Boserup explicitly recognized the role of societal structures in the development process. She differed from WAD and GAD positions, perhaps, in that she viewed structural change as taking place over the long term and as endogenous to the development process: âstructures change under the influence of other structures although they may be resistant to such changes for shorter or longer periods, and are changing only when the pressure is strong or persistentâ (Boserup 1999, p. 58). Boserup encouraged economic develop research to incorporate this broader and historical view, even providing a framework for it (Boserup 1996)."

The ï¬rst two discourse models have a technical bias (hard technologies and management technologies); the third and fourth discourse models have ideological-political biases, the last being traversed by ecological worldviews. From the perspective of environmental governance, the positions behind the models point at disagreement. They will be a great source of conï¬ict to the extent that some defend the thesis of economic growth, taking ecological factors into account only as secondary externalities (positions found in the ï¬rst model). Others take an alternative stance, proposing an ecological perspective that focuses on avoiding economic growth and overconsumption in the neo-extractivist Third World (positions found in the fourth model). The analysed discourses, with few exceptions, do not take long-term environmental risks into account. The central grid of this discursive logic is the capacity to control and intervene in water and energy consumption in mining, through technocratic (ï¬rst model), normative and institutional (models two and three), or political-environmental (models three and four) means. The abstraction of the accumulative and latent effects of the long-term environmental impacts of the abovementioned consumption is proof that the autonomized effects of sociotechnical processes as a result of the increased extractive economy in the region are unknown. Our study of discourses conï¬rms that most of the stakeholders who are more likely to defend the expanded reproduction of the waterenergy-mining complex â as the basis of the socioeconomic development of the region â do not take responsibility for the international and global implications of local environmental behaviour. The majority of these actors do not think in terms of a long-term global horizon. Consequently, the problems of climate change and the decisions that they implicate in terms of energy and water policy are considered without taking into account the reï¬exivity of local social processes in overall environmental risks. The structural positions of these stakeholders in developing countries, in the periphery of the world system, thus condition discourses with respect to these global implications. In this chapter we ï¬rst presented the problem of water and energy consumption in the mining sector, situated within the water-energymining complex. We sought to clarify linear, sectorial and reductionist perspectives and to approach a perspective that integrates synergies among discourses, rules, technologies, institutions and interpretations"
244,898,0.298,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","Chapelle et al. (2008, 2010) used the argument-based approach to analyze the validity of the TOEFLÂ® test in some detail and, in doing so, provided insight into the meaning of the scores as well as their empirical characteristics and value implications. In this work, it is clear how the emphasis in the original conception of construct validity (Cronbach and Meehl 1955) on the need for a program of validation research rather than a single study and Messickâs emphasis on the need to rule out threats to validity (e.g., construct-irrelevant variance and construct underrepresentation) play out in an argument-based approach to validation. Mislevy (1993, 1994, 1996, 2007) focused on the role of evidence in validation, particularly in terms of model-based reasoning from observed performances to more general claims about students and other test takers. Mislevy et al. (1999, 2002, 2003a, b) developed an ECD framework that employs argument-based reasoning. ECD starts with an analysis of the attributes, or constructs, of interest and the social and cognitive contexts in which they function and then designs the assessment to generate the kinds and amounts of evidence needed to draw the intended inferences. The ECD framework involves several stages of analysis (Mislevy and Haertel 2006; Mislevy et al. 1999, 2002, 2003a). The first stage, domain analysis, concentrates on building substantive understanding of the performance domain of interest, including theoretical conceptions and empirical research on student learning and performance, and the kinds of situations in which the performances are likely to occur. The goal of this first stage is to develop an understanding of how individuals interact with tasks and contexts in the domain. At the second stage, domain modeling, the relationships between student characteristics, task characteristics, and situational variables are specified (Mislevy et al. 2003a, b). The structure of the assessment to be developed begins to take shape, as the kinds of evidence that would be relevant to the goals of the assessment are identified. The third stage involves the development of a conceptual assessment framework that specifies the operational components of the test and the relationships among these components, including a student model, task models, and evidence models. The student model provides an abstract account of the student in terms of ability parameters (e.g., in an IRT model). Task models posit schemas for collecting data that can be used to estimate the student parameters and guidelines for task development. The evidence model describes how student performances are to be evaluated, or scored, and how estimates of student parameters can be made or updated. With this machinery in place, student performances on a sample of relevant tasks can be used to draw probabilistic inferences about student characteristics. The two dominant threads in these argument-based approaches to validation are the requirement that the claims to be made about test takers (i.e., the proposed interpretation and use of the scores) be specified in advance, and then justified, and that inferences about specific test takers be supported by warrants or models that have been validated, using empirical evidence and theoretical rationales. The argumentbased approaches are consistent with Messickâs unified framework, but they tend to focus more on specific methodologies for the validation of proposed interpretations and uses than did the unified framework."

However, only one of ICMMâs 46 subprinciples refers to the responsible consumption of water and energy in mining. In the reference cases studied, the relevance of the consumption of water and mining is a theme of a âhigh levelâ and experts. It does not, however, seem to be picked up by other social actors. Similarly, references to water and energy consumption in the mining and environmental legislation of the countries studied are scarce (OCMAL, 2012). In the rules and regulations for environmental evaluation and monitoring, these issues are of secondary importance. In short, the analysis of institutional discourses elucidates the importance of the principles and good practices driven by transnational companies. They emphasize the role of international ï¬nancial agencies and institutions, such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC, 2012), and principles of environmental evaluation and report, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI, 2011) and BellagioSTAMP (IISD and OECD, 2009). This study underlines the existence of basic social representations that favour environmental considerations. The interviewed actors in the four countries were asked about the environment, climate change, development models and the relationship of man with nature. They responded in a few typical patterns that show their views on water and energy consumption. Some stress the role of policies of social and environmental responsibility of the mining companies and institutions, reï¬ecting inï¬uential discourses at local and international levels. The alternative discourses, which oppose mining projects, resort to interpretational codes derived from a radical reconceptualization of the consumption of water and energy. They focus on their uses, meanings and valuations as associated with the notions of justice, and social and environmental rights. The statement against which interviewees had to declare their preferences is taken from the mainstream discourses in public policy, saying that â âSustainable developmentâ in the context of my countryâs needs would be an economic growth model that mitigates negative environmental and social impacts.â8 The responses were primarily âstrongly agreeâ, which dominated among senior public ofï¬cials and businessmen, and âdisagreeâ, which dominated among environmentalists and (college-educated) experts.

Indeed, Schuyt (2014) explicitly berates their lack of (notably legal) expertise. A third option is the discourse of the hysteric, criticising the perversity of the system as such. From a psychoanalytical perspective, even the (apparently negative) figure of cynics/hysterics may play a positive role, revealing gaps in established discourse, highlighting blind spots or deliberative routines which rightfully invoke objections, because something of importance has been forgotten or eclipsed, something of value which now has become impossible to articulate (Zwart 2016b). Yet, although the discourse of the hysteric may be effective in the sense that others are pressed into action, it often represents a temporary and unsustainable option, resulting in a deadlock, in self-marginalisation. Ultimately, a Lacanian analysis endorses the discourse of the analyst, taking the floor when others (S1, S2, $) have already spoken, revealing the extent to which these others are spoken and driven by desire, by a truth unknown to themselves (Verhaeghe 2001). The analyst is basically a rhetorician, an expert in the dynamics and modes of discourse (Lundberg 2012; Lacan 1977â1978, p. 4). In the case of university discourse, the analyst focusses on symptoms of professional uncertainty, ambivalence and unease, camouflaged by the expertâs apparent fluency and subtlety. And whereas the use of vignettes (as part of the tool-box of university discourse) often entails the suggestion that it is possible to bridge the gap between problem and solution, the discourse of the analyst will focus precisely on these gaps, because it is precisely here that the real challenges are likely emerge (âmind the gapâ: Verhaeghe 2001). Moreover, the discourse of the analyst is closely connected with education, with the âformation of the scientific mindâ, as Bachelard once phrased it, although now the focus has shifted from epistemology as such (the methodologies and technologies of knowledge production) to academic authorship as a practice of the Self, fostering individuation. The oblique perspective challenges the science â humanities divide (M2 â M3). Instead of vignettes (short, formulaic stories), the discourse of the analyst prefers to work with extended case histories, in the form of science biographies and autobiographies for instance, or in the form of science theatre, science cinema and science novels:"

Qualitative representations can then be iteratively improved. Modeling phenomena with mathematics includes setting up an equation that describes the phenomena. It is important to note that effective problem solvers do not solely model problems qualitatively or quantitatively; rather, they use both sorts of representation, as each informs the other and together can lead to a more effective solution and solution process (Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Van Heuvelen & Zou, 2001). For example, after creating a qualitative model, one may proceed to create a quantitative model. The finished qualitative model will influence how the quantitative model is set up. One should then see where the models are consistent, and where they contradict each other; in this way, the models can be progressively improved. By spending adequate time modeling, one can engage in more effective problem-solving, as it guides subsequent investigations, can activate solution schemas, and can provide the framework by which one can simulate what would happen when a variable is manipulated (Anzai & Yokoyama, 1984; Chi et al., 1981; Jonassen, 2003; Sins, Savelsbergh, & van Joolingen, 2005). Just as it is important to learn to create models, it is also important to be able to interpret the models created by others, especially in terms of what these diverse models say differently about the underlying problems (diSessa, 1988; Seufert, 2003; Wu, Krajcik, & Soloway, 2001). Doing so can lead to enhanced understanding of the problem (Seufert, 2003). This is particularly challenging for K-12 students (BrÃ¥ten et al., 2011; Seufert, 2003). Indeed, learners often simply adhere to the model that is closest to their own early experiences, or the simplest explanation of the underlying phenomenon, even when presented with a more accurate model (diSessa, 1988; Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). This may be explained in part by most K-12 studentsâ lack of familiarity with complex causal models, such as those that explain changes in a factor through indirect action from a combination of factors A and B (Perkins & Grotzer, 2005). While some evidence indicates that reluctance to consider an alternative model is widespread among learners of differing levels of prior knowledge and skill, other evidence indicates that it may be more prevalent among lower-achieving students (Seufert, 2003). Thus, it is especially important to endeavor to increase modeling skills from a social justice vantage point and to broaden participation in STEM (Lynch, 2001). 4.2.1.4.2.3 Argumentation Science is very much a social endeavor, as no scientist works in a vacuum (Ford, 2012). Rather, scientists work in a large community of practice in which they share and defend findings to one another, and build off of othersâ work. At the core of this is argumentation, defined as both backing claims with evidence and models, but also effectively evaluating claims on the basis of evidence and models (Ford, 2012; Osborne, 2010). The argumentation process allows scientific models and theories to be iteratively improved (Ford, 2012). To be able to engage in STEM effectively as citizens, individuals also need to be able to engage in clear argumentation (Aufschnaiter et al., 2008; Jonassen, 2011; Osborne, 2010; Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958). For example, when scientific issues are discussed, citizens need to be able to sort out well-founded claims from"
221,272,0.298,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"Khanna et al. (2011) carried out scenario analysis to demonstrate that a raildominated mass transit system in Delhi can deliver 61 % reduction in energy use compared to 31 % reduction for a bus-dominated system. A cost-benefit analysis of the Delhi Metro calculated a 22 % social rate of return, a financial rate of return of 17 %, and an economic rate of return of 23.9 % including gains from air pollution reduction (Murty et al. 2006). The study reported that Delhi Metro generated benefits to the stakeholders including citizens and government; however, other transport providers suffered from income losses (ibid). The implementation of the Delhi Metro has resulted in social impacts including relocation of people and reduced accessibility of the relocated low-income households (Tiwari 2011). The DMRC faces challenges due to land acquisition issues. Metro infrastructure projects are being planned or are under construction in nearly 20 citiesâseveral of which will follow the Delhi model. It is crucial to address issues of equity and development to minimize adverse social impacts during project implementation. An additional concern is the vulnerability of cities and infrastructures to the risks from climate variability, especially extreme weather events (Garg et al. 2013; Pathak et al. 2014). These considerations should be factored in as far as possible into planning of long-term transport infrastructure."
386,138,0.298,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"4.3.3 Socioeconomic Sustainability Revisited Typically, the environmental pillar of sustainability attracts the most attention, both inside and outside academia. In a textbook concerning the socioeconomics of agriculture, it is obvious that the opposite should be the case. There will be more convenient locations in which to debate the details of sustainable phosphorus or biodiversity management, but there are few more convenient locations to discuss issues related to socioeconomically sustainable agriculture. It is extremely tricky, however, to appropriately deal with economic sustainability. The easiest part is the definition of sound indicators. Meul et al. (2008), for example, consider the production of value-added products, the efficient use of production factors and a low risk in agricultural production to be the core factors. Similarly, Ryan et al. (2016) suggest focusing on different productivity indicators. Such and similar suggestions may provide valuable clues with respect to the state of a farm (or any other enterprise). Yet, sustainability is also used to distinguish âgoodâ farms from âbadâ ones, both for marketing chains and for policy-makers. This is where economic sustainability indicators quickly reach their limits. Obviously, it makes no sense to only buy eggs from farms with high labour productivity or to restrict direct payments to farms above a certain income threshold. Economic sustainability on the farm level has few direct externalities, although a low level of sustainability may raise distributional concerns and might, in fact, be an argument for more rather than less public support. This is different in the case of social sustainability. Social sustainability, to a great degree, refers to the links between the farm business and the outside world, which is a parallel to environmental sustainability. However, the flows in and out of the farm are not flows of nitrogen and pesticides, but rather flows of money as well as flows of appreciation and respect. The affected third parties are both farm workers and their relatives, in addition to neighbours and customers. Farms are a crucial component of the local social fabric and they should know about it. It is a worthwhile exercise to choose 50 sustainability assessment tools in which social aspects are included in order to find out more about any emerging consensus concerning what social sustainability actually entails. When this exercise was completed for this book, it turned out that 24 of the tools were connected to a label, while 26 were assessment tools with a merely informative purpose. All the indicators were recorded and sometimes grouped into larger categories so as to see which subjects were the most frequent. It appeared that there were three main front runners: â¢ Thirty-two of the 50 frameworks contained safety hazards. Apparently, a farm is not socially sustainable if pesticides or machinery are handled in ways that provoke accidents or long-term damage. Indeed, the concept of sustainability is touched at its very core if incidents occur on farms in which some of the workers or even bystanders are harmed. Bennett (2013) reports 621 fatalities in US agriculture in 2010 and, while the figures from developing countries are less widely distributed, they are certainly not lower."

It is perhaps interesting to note that the emphasis at this point is not on understanding behaviour but changing it. Subsequent reference to âbehaviour change techniquesâ reinforce this assumption: dysfunctional individuals lie at the heart of the problem. Michie et al. outline the methods used to develop their model grounded in âsystematic reviewâ. The concept of systematic review is very much linked to the evidence-based medicine movement and derives from methods developed through the Cochrane Collaboration.4 The NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) deï¬nes a systematic review as, âa review of the evidence on a clearly formulated question that uses systematic and explicit methods to identify, select and critically appraise relevant primary research, and to extract and analyse data from the studies that are included in the reviewâ (CRD 2001: 3) There is no scope here to discuss and critique the relative merits of systematic reviews and their claims to objectivity. Certainly their value and approach in understanding clinical drugs trials is undisputed. For us, as social scientists more accustomed to the concept of âliteratureâ or âresearch reviewâ, they present a certain narrowness in focus that may risk excluding highly relevant and innovative multi-disciplinary knowledge and/or grey literature (Benzies et al. 2006). The emphasis in systematic review processes on the âclearly formulated questionâ tends to lead to a funnelling approach, progressively narrowing inquiry to an ever-smaller group of highly similar studies. Whilst this approach may form a key component of the comparability criteria necessary in clinically oriented systematic reviews (to compare like with like and reduce extraneous ânoiseâ), it lies in some tension with more expansive and exploratory âsearchlightâ or horizon-scanning approaches to literature review explicitly seeking new knowledge and innovative insights (as represented in this chapter). Furthermore, the âquality appraisalâ component of systematic reviews is based on the premise that research can be ranked according to its quality, reliability and replicability. In practice, this involves a weighting process based on metrics to assess âthe rigor of the research methodologyâ (Jones et al. 2013: 3) effectively privileging quasi-experimental techniques. At the apex of this epistemological hierarchy (Levels 1 and 2) lies the randomised controlled trial (developed from clinical research) and, at the base, opinion pieces. Qualitative research receives no speciï¬c mention in this schema but presumably falls within the generic category (Level 3) of ânon-randomised,"
244,1156,0.297,"Advancing Human Assessment : The Methodological, Psychological and Policy Contributions of Ets","The first decade of the current century saw increased application of Bayesian methods in psychometric research, in which staff members continued ETSâs tradition of integrating advances in statistics with educational and psychological measurement. Among the applications were posterior predictive checks (Sinharay 2003), a method not unlike the frequentist resampling and resimulation studied in the late 1990s (M. von Davier 1997), as well as the use of Bayesian networks to specify complex measurement models (Mislevy et al. 2000). Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were employed to explore the comprehensive estimation of measurement and structural models in modern IRT (Johnson and Jenkins 2005) but, because of their computational requirements, currently remain limited to small- to medium-sized applications. Alternatives to these computationally demanding methods were considered to enable the estimation of high-dimensional models, including empirical Bayes methods and approaches that utilized Monte Carlo integration, such as the stochastic EM algorithm (M. von Davier and Sinharay 2007). These studies were aimed at supporting the use of explanatory IRT applications taking the form of a latent regression that includes predictive background variables in the structural model. Models of this type are used in the NAEP, PISA, PIAAC, TIMSS, and PIRLS assessments, which ETS directly or indirectly supported. Sinharay and von Davier (2005) also presented extensions of the basic numerical integration approach to data having more dimensions. Similar to Johnson and Jenkins (2005), who proposed a Bayesian hierarchical model for the latent regression, Li et al. (2009) examined the use of hierarchical linear (or multilevel) extensions of the latent regression approach. The kernel equating procedures proposed earlier by Holland and Thayer (1989; also Holland et al. 1989) were extended and designs for potential applications were described in The Kernel Method of Test Equating by A. A. von Davier, Holland, and Thayer (2004). The bookâs framework for observed-score equating encapsulates several well-known classical methods as special cases, from linear to equipercentile approaches. A major reference work was released, titled Handbook of Statistics: Vol. 26. Psychometrics and edited by Rao and Sinharay (2006). This volume contained close to 1200 pages and 34 chapters reviewing state-of-the-art psychometric modeling. Sixteen of the volumeâs chapters were contributed by current or former ETS staff members. The need to describe test-taker strengths and weaknesses has long motivated the reporting of subscores on tests that were primarily designed to provide a single score. Haberman (2008) presented the concept of proportional reduction of mean squared errors, which allows an evaluation of whether subscores are technically defensible. This straightforward extension of classical test theory derives from a"
277,443,0.297,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"long-standing preference for integration dialogues to take place in governmentsponsored commissions. Since the 1980s, such commissions have tended to be launched after significant focusing events, usually an outbreak of disorder or violence, be it race riots, racist murders, or acts of terrorism. We developed this insight by suggesting that independent commissions are an ideal venue to study science-society dialogues, since they involve a wider set of actors than is normally included in policymaking, usually a combination of academics, practitioners, and representatives of civil society (see also Chap. 5 for a comparison between similar commissions in Germany and the Netherlands). Furthermore, evidence-gathering about complex social problems is a primary activity of commissions, and commissions therefore often draw upon social science data and deploy social research methods. Accordingly, we compared three commissions which reported in the 2000s: the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain in 2000 (CMEB); the Community Cohesion Review Team (CCRT) in 2001; and the Commission on Integration and Cohesion in 2007 (CIC). The findings of the CCRT â most subject to government influence of the three â were used for both instrumental and substantiating purposes. The choice of the trusted Cantle as chair, the narrow terms of reference, and the stress on âmaking things happenâ, all indicate it was geared towardss substantiating the new policy paradigm of community cohesion. However, the commissioners drew up a number of detailed policy proposals, which exceeded policymakersâ expectations, and these proposals subsequently contributed to policymaking in an instrumental fashion. The CIC, by contrast, is judged to fit most closely to what we term the âlegitimisingâ function of knowledge use. Its drawn-out launch and proceedings, its broad remit, and the lack of interest paid to its findings, meant that the commissionâs output was not used to rationally adjust policy instruments. Instead, the manner in which findings were disseminated via the media indicates that policymakers were anxious to signal to the public that action was being taken to address what was perceived to be an urgent problem, highlighted by the London bombings. Interestingly, we also found that the amount and duration of media coverage is more important than whether such coverage is favourable or not. This is demonstrated by the history of the CMEB, which was launched not by government but by the Runnymede Trust think-tank (although with close backing from senior government politicians). The CMEBâs composition and workings indicate a partly instrumental and partly legitimising role. On the one hand, its sponsors and supporters intended and expected that it would influence policy. Yet Runnymedeâs trustees and the commissionâs Labour backers also appear to be motivated by a desire to signal the commissionâs authority and significance. Interestingly, the initial media reaction to the CMEB report was extremely unfavourable. Yet the longrunning controversy that the CMEB report generated in the media meant that its various proposals were debated at length. Thus, the CMEB remained in the public spotlight, and therefore on the policymaking agenda. In time, many of its findings and recommendations were in fact implemented, corresponding to what Carole Weiss terms the âenlightenmentâ function of knowledge."

117,410,0.297,Care in Healthcare : Reflections On Theory and Practice,"Space as a Social Product Henri Lefebvre (1901â1991) was a French philosopher and sociologist engaged with existential ideas (Elden 2004). In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than 60 books and 300 articles covering a wide range of topics. In his work, Lefebvre shows an interest in the dialectic and he tends to work with three terms rather than the dualism of the two. He conceives the three as affecting each other simultaneously, without prioritizing one term over another. Instead of searching for a transcendence, a synthesis or a negation, he studies the continual movement between them. Lefebvre has written about space in The Production of Space (1974/1991). In this book, he argues that space is a social product, or a complex social construct (based on values and the social production of meanings), that affects spatial practices and perceptions. â(Social) space is a (social) product [...]; the space thus produced also serves as a tool of thought and of action [...] In addition to being a means of production it is also a means of control, and hence of domination, of power.â Although his work is complex and not about care practices, some of his insights might be helpful to better understand the meaning of space for humanizing healthcare. Lefebvre criticizes the binary notion of objective and lived space for still starting from the subjectivity of the ego. Lefebvre aims to a materialist version of phenomenology in which the epistemological perspective shifts from the subject that thinks, acts and experiences to the process of social production of thought, action and experience. According to him, space is fundamentally bound up with social reality. Space does not exist âin itself â; it is produced. Lefebvre proceeds from a relational concept of space and views space as a social product. This calls for an analysis that would include the social constellations, power relations and conflicts relevant in each situation. This would also imply the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially"
118,357,0.297,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"than that of science, or of technology, or of society is worthy of attention to understand the development of my argument. For example, if nuclear physics is completely successful in understanding a chain reaction, technology such as nuclear engineering could fail in controlling the reaction as in the case of Chernobyl.1 Or if nuclear engineering is almost completely successful in containing radioactive materials within reactors, social decision-making could fail as in the case of Three Mile Island (TMI).2 Or if society is completely successful in setting goals for the development of renewable energy technologies, science and/or technology could fail as in the case of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC).3 In a word, the success or failure of science, of technology, and of society cannot be overlapped automatically [9, 10]. In particular, there seems to be something missing in-between, which has unique characteristics of its own. The concept of âstructural disasterâ is intended to explore this state. What is in-between could be institutional arrangements, organizational routines, tacit interpretations of a formal code of ethics, invisible customs, or the networks of interests of different organizations. The âstructural disasterâ consists of one or more of the following elements [11]: 1. Adherence to erroneous precedents causes problems to be carried over and reproduced. 2. The complexity of a system under consideration and the interdependence of its units aggravate problems. 3. The invisible norms of informal groups essentially hollow out formal norms. 4. Quick fixes for problems at hand lead to further such fixes for temporary counter measures. 5. Secrecy develops across different sectors and blurs the locus of agents responsible for the problems to be addressed. This chapter focuses on, among other things, the interdependence of heterogeneous agents, which come into play in the science-technology-society interface and give rise to secrecy in a specific social condition. This chapter will make clear the interdependence by tracing it back to the hidden prewar accident, which will give us an important clue to the understanding of the Fukushima Daiichi accident from the perspective of âstructural disasterâ as defined above. To understand the social context of this hidden prewar accident, it is necessary to move away from the current social condition of the post-Fukushima situation to the prewar wartime mobilization of science and technology, within which the clarification of this hidden accident can be properly pursued. After the clarification, we will move back to the current situation surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi accident, to present the sociological implications of the hidden accident for the Fukushima Daiichi accident and for potential future extreme events. 1 For a sociological investigation into the relationships between the Chernobyl and Wind scale"

Then, by identifying those patterns, simulations help to understand the causes of current issues and can support decision makers in tackling them. Moreover, applying computational modelling supports the validation of strategic initiatives and their effect on existing business modelsâjust as engineers test new technologies or products extensively in a laboratory before their market launch. In particular, the ability to experiment with different scenarios and strategic initiatives in a computational environment has the potential to reduce erroneous management decisions and reveal overlooked factors and patterns that could become relevant in the future (Groesser 2015a, b, c). And ï¬nally, by amalgamating computational methods with existing business modelling approaches SD provides an insightful, valid, relatively rapid, and inexpensive approach to business model analysis and design (Eden et al. 2000). Moreover, from a perspective of consistency, it is known that humans cannot deduce the behavioural consequences of a system with many interdependent elements (Miller 1956; Forrester 1961; Sterman et al. 2015). Computational modelling is one of the means, amongst others, of reducing the issue that qualitative models seem to be insufï¬cient when systems are highly complex (Sterman 2000). Hence, it enables a deep and integrated understanding of a system through the quantitative exploration of systemic interdependencies. Computational modelling of complex systems is a relatively innovative approach for top management decision makers. Some disadvantages of this method relate to the relative ease of linking variables together to quickly create large, highly complex models. Some users may, however, be overwhelmed by this complexity if they do not exercise a cautious approach to modelling (Groesser and Schwaninger 2012). The existence of user-friendly visual representations has, in some cases, been a disservice by offering the false impression that modelling is always simple and done quickly. In addition, inclusion of uncertain or only hypothesized feedback loops may create complex model behaviour that may be difï¬cult to track, falsify, or validate. Moreover, the empirical evidence about the learning outcomes of computational modelling and its effectiveness is still inconclusive (Karakul and Qudrat-Ullah 2008; Sterman 2010; Qudrat-Ullah 2014). Consequently, it is not yet possible to state that businesses applying computational modelling systematically produce better results than those that do not use it and thus, the requirements of the strong market test are not yet met (Labro and Tuomela 2003). At the same time, this is a call for action to conduct more empirical research to prove (or disprove) the case for computational simulation methods."

In the field of social psychology, Moscovici (1998) makes an important distinction between social representations based on belief and social representations based on knowledge (Psaltis 2016) which captures the epistemological intention that we are implying here. The distinction is premised on the idea that characteristics of beliefs are homogeneous, affective and impermeable to experience or contradiction that leave little scope for individual variation. They are thus similar to the âdogmaâ characteristics that Lowenthal attributes to approaching the past as an essentialist heritage. By contrast, social representations founded on knowledge are similar to Lowenthalâs approach to the past as history since they are more fluid, pragmatic and amenable to the proof of success or failure and leave certain latitude to language, experience and even to the critical features of individuals."
113,20,0.297,Pentecostalism and Witchcraft : Spiritual Warfare in Africa and Melanesia,"Such evangelism proceeds by building universal examples from situations in parts of the world where witchcraft and forces of the invisible dominate peopleâs daily lives. The examples are fed into in a systematic global struggle against the demonic. The demonic, as well as the warfare against it, is presented as an ontological starting point, where Pentecostal energy is dedicated to discerning the presence of Satan in social life anywhere. This always takes place as a war with competing ontological regimesâof science, reason, and the state. Murphy claims: By demonization I mean that Satan, through his evil spirits, exercises direct partial control over one or more areas of the life of a human being. When dealing with the potentially demonized, the typical Western, analytical, reasoned approach towards evangelism will be ineffective. Only a gospel of power will set them free. (Murphy 2012, p. 59)"
223,356,0.297,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"Theoretical Framework Some work has been done in this direction (Baldry, 1999; Edenius & Yakhlef, 2007; Ford & Harding, 2004; Friedman, 2011; Kornberger & Clegg, 2004; Meusburger, 2009; Taylor & Spicer, 2007; Woodward & Ellison, 2010). A review of the growing literature on space in organization studies found the field fragmented but identified three principal streams, each with interesting contributions and shortcomings (Taylor & Spicer, 2007). In one stream scholars conceive of space in terms of distance and proximity between points and have convincingly demonstrated how space makes a difference for important issues at the micro-, meso-, and macrolevels. However, they are âunable to account for the ways in which actors attribute meaning and significance to a space â¦ [and] not able to explain the role which perceptions or experiences of distances and proximity playâ (p. 329). In another stream researchers compensate for this weakness by focusing on the materialization of powerâbut it is questionable âwhether all spaces are necessarily manifestations of powerâ (p. 332). Furthermore, such a focus implies a âsystematic disregard of the ways that space may actually be the product of inhabitantsâ ongoing experience and understandingsâ (p. 333). Scholars in the third stream attend to this gap by exploring âhow spaces are produced and manifest in the experiences of those who inhabit themâ (p. 333). The inherent disadvantages are that power relations are overlooked and that the emphasis on perception undervalues the material, physical aspects of space. Logically, therefore, Taylor and Spicer argue for an integrated approach that addresses all three dimensions by building on the ideas of Lefebvre (1974/1991), who sought to bring together mental, physical, and social modalities of space (see also Ford and Harding 2004, p. 817). Although we agree that an integrated approach is needed, this particular proposal does not take some essential concepts into account. Strikingly absent from the organizational literature on space is the work on social space by two of the twentieth centuryâs most influential, and nonconventional, social scientists, the psychologist Kurt Lewin (1936, 1948/1997, 1951/1997) and the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1985, 1989, 1993, 1998; Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Both placed social space as the cornerstone of their theoretical and methodological work, turning to the philosophical work of Ernst Cassirer (1923/1953, 1944, 1961), who conceived of space in rather relative terms as the positional quality of the material world. Cassirer, Lewin, and Bourdieu adopted the view that there is no empty space, only spaces that are formed by and between objects, and they applied this concept to the creation of social reality rather than to the physical world. At the heart of social space is a relational logic of social reality, which focuses neither on the individual nor the group as the unit of analysis but rather on the processes through which individuals, in interaction with others, construct their social spaces and identities (Friedman, 2011). These interactions are causal loops that link the ways people bring their thinking and feeling into the world through action, to"
99,501,0.297,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"4. Innovations in modes of working and financing consolidate forms of multiprofessional teamwork including volunteers and civic commitment of supporters; produce new professionalism, combining formerly fragmented knowledge through dialogue with and involvement of users; operate on mixed funding, merging resources from stakeholders across sectors. 5. Innovations in how to conceive of (local) welfare systems focus on welfare mixes, reaching out to all sectors of local welfare systems and upgrading its community component; less standardised, more diverse and localised welfare arrangements; a welfare beyond established demarcation lines, that opens up to environmental and lifestyle politics, bridging economic and social policy concerns, welfare and urban politics, focusing less on groups and more on situations and territories. The key words and issues as they are recollected here can be viewed and taken up both as promising solutions to local problems and as messages to all those who are interested in changing the cultural orientations and policy frameworks of local welfare, services and urban governance. This leads to a third argument: social innovations offer good chances for promoting change since they can be quite easily spilled over to similar milieus and settings in other spots and localities. As argued above, it takes specific constellations of factors for local social innovations to emergeânot only pressures and needs but also aspirations and openness of actors in the local context (see Chap. 2). In the academic debate on enabling conditions for social innovations, it is common to point out factors that seem to be specifically local, such as social and cultural movements, traditions of solidarity within the local community, an urban texture where unconventional attitudes merge with entrepreneurial readiness and local elites that open up to new ideas and attempts. This is however slightly misleading, as discussed in Chap. 3 of this book. None of these factors are exclusively local. Movements and projects in a city are usually related to social trends and strands of thinking, values and assumptions present at different points of society. Local experts taking part in innovative processes are usually members of networks that operate on (inter)national levels. Programmes with funding possibilities and their local nudges are often the result of initiatives by state experts at national level that encourage new approaches. Social innovation is multilevelled by nature. Altogether, this points towards a process of social innovation that relies on interplay and contagion across domains, logics and multiple levels."
192,379,0.296,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"Thus, rather than as a symptom of pre-fraudulent cynicism, Stapelâs Jos Jasperâs lecture must be regarded as an (albeit anecdotal and non-normative) articulation of budding epistemological despair. What Stapel is pointing out (albeit in a jocular tone of voice, somewhat reminiscent of Erasmusâs Praise of Folly) is that formal (frontstage) academic accounts of experimental practice in social psychology papers tend to conceal and disavow the continuous improvisations that are actually conducted backstage. Rather than as a cynical swindler, Stapel poses as a disenchanted, divided subject, addressing issues, sharing and discussing his growing discontent in university discourse before an audience of peers. Let me start with Stapelâs concern that social psychological âfactsâ may actually be created by the research paradigm or theoretical perspective we use. This problem was already addressed by Friedrich Nietzsche in his famous exclamation Facta! Yes Facta Ficta! published in Daybreak (1881/1980, Â§ 307). Nietzscheâs exclamation plays on alliteration and highlights an intriguing etymological affinity between fact and fiction, terms which are usually seen as conceptual opposites. The alliteration reminds us of the fact that the word fact is actually derived from the Latin verb facere (to make, to fabricate, to create), while the word fiction actually comes from the Latin verb fingere (to form, to shape; literally: to bring forth with oneâs fingers). Thus, the etymology reveals that scientific facts are fabricated in laboratories. The alliteration emphasises that facts and fictions are related phenomena because âfactsâ (like fictions) are made, are produced, rather than given, and this notably applies to scientific facts. Indeed, all scientific facts are fabricated, in the literal, non-pejorative sense of the term. They are products of laboratory research practices; they are artefacts, produced with the help of experimental set-ups and technical contrivances. What Nietzscheâs alliteration reminds us of, is that all scientific facts are âfingeredâ: they are coloured, tainted if you will, by the knowledge production processes which brought them forth (and whose fingerprints they bear). The etymology reveals that there is something fundamentally artificial about scientific âfactsâ, so that the listing of âfabricationâ as one of the three major forms of scientific misconduct is at least"

The more complex systems, the more direct interventions will induce side effects, and the less they are likely to succeed. Finally, one debate connected with systems approaches is that about the ontological status of a system. There is a position that systems are ârealâ. Thus, a system is understood as existing in the real world; it has ontological status, i.e. exists independent from an observer. The alternative viewpoint is that systems are analytical constructions by the observer. The elements, relations and boundaries of the system are defined by the observer, who has a certain interest in the analysis. Thus, systems can be considered as systems of interests. Science or any other societal community define system perspectives to analyse certain types of problems. In this sense, systems are socially constructed entities (by a group rather than by an individual). For example, from a biological perspective, it seems at a glance self-evident that the human is defined by the boundaries of the body. However, the body is settled by microbes that may be both dangerous (e.g. viruses) and helpful (e.g. millions"

In Solar, plagiarism is a desperate but abortive attempt to conflate the growing divide between real science (quantum physics) and managerial activities (again experienced as reverse sides of a Moebius ring). And Derailment is likewise structured as a (roller coaster-like) Moebius strip, taking the subject from absurdist theatre to university discourse, to despair, deflection and fraud, and via cynicism (the discourse of the hysteric) up to self-analysis (the discourse of the analyst). But these analyses not only result in an inventory of possible scenarios, but also in a further elaboration of the oblique methodology for studying them, presented in Chaps. 1 and 2. In other words, these analyses in terms of the four discourses also have repercussions for philosophy of science itself as an intellectual practice. Philosophy is not regarded as a purely theoretical or apodictic type of discourse, where an autocratic Master (M1) addresses his disciples (S2: the custodians of his truth claims), in accordance with the logic of the discourse of the Master. Rather, philosophy analyses the other discourses, most notably university discourse, from an oblique perspective, focussing on the interactions between researchers and their objects (above the bar), but also on the philosophemes: the basic truth claims (below the bar) which guide or hamper the research, often without being explicitly addressed (S1). The various experiences of frustration may at times result in deflection: research misconduct as a by-product of an âimpossibleâ profession ($). In other words, misconduct is a fascinating phenomenon (from a continental philosophy of science perspective) because it provides a window into the vicissitudes and challenges of contemporary scientific research. In standard integrity discourse, research misconduct is often addressed from a university discourse perspective, by qualified experts specialised in analysing misconduct issues from ethical or legal, economical or governance angles. But this type of discourse is often repetitive and moralistic as we have seen, bent on blaming the individual researcher, or on calculating the costs of misconduct, or on formulating and imposing guidelines and deontological rules. This monograph approaches the problem from a different viewpoint, revolving around the why question. To formulate it in terms of the case study discussed in Chap. 11: in order to come to terms with research misconduct, Stapelâs introspective self-analysis Derailment is more revealing than the formal report published by the triumvirate Levelt, Noort and Drenth. Rather than scrutinising his whole oeuvre (âthe whole of a fraudsterâs body of scientific workâ), as the authors of Flawed science claim to do (p. 5), the triumvirate focusses exclusively on the upper half of Stapelâs university discourse: on the events occurring above the bar: the tinkering of the researcher (S2) with his precious but disappointing findings (a): S2 (the tinkering researcher)"

The considerable volume of content that flows through ABATC make it a virtual popular science magazine, covering a breadth of issues and formats (including blog carnivals and other outreach mechanisms that aim to strengthen connections with other blogs). Zivkovic both relays information from other sources, commenting on it and explaining it to readers, and provides longer commentaries, for example on issues of science policy. He assumes that his readers are interested in science, but does not generally presume in-depth knowledge of scientific topics. This approach is in line with Zivkovicâs own background: while he is a trained scientist and writes from a first-hand perspective, his agenda is not that of someone paid for full-time research. While RRResearch presents both the results of research (rarely) and frames scientific issues for a scientific audience, ABATC translates scientific topics for a more general, non-specialist audience. The issues are much broader there than they are in RRResearch, where they align much more strongly with the bloggerâs own research interests. The latter blog is a window into the mind and daily work of the researcher, not a friendly conversation with a lay audience. This is not to say that RRResearch doesnât engageâits success illustrates how well it achieves this goalâbut whom it targets as its readership and what function it wants to realize remains at least partially unclear. Redfield uses her blog to frame issues for herself and her peers, while Zivkovic blogs for a readership with their needs squarely in mind. Much of the research that he relays is not his own, while much of what is discussed in RRResearch is Redfieldâs own work, or closely related to it. Whereas Redfield regards her blog as an instrument for communicating what she is currently working on or issues she is more generally interested in, Zivkovic provides a service and measures its success, at least in part, by its popularity and the amount of feedback he receives, a form of impact that may well be less relevant to a blogger like Redfield, who might be primarily concerned with her blogâs reception among her students and peers (Fig. 4)."

78,126,0.295,The Onlife Manifesto : Being Human in a Hyperconnected Era,"Less than half a century ago, in almost all western countries as in the socialist world and the developing nations, social roles were well-defined: the teachers were there to teach, the physician to cure, the police to ensure public order, the politicians to govern, etc. During May 1968 in many developed states of Europe and in the United States of America, the young generation contested the legitimacy of the traditional social roles and the genuineness of all kinds of authority. The power of the police, the judges, the doctors, the professors etc. was questioned and debated. In the years that followed, society was traversed by attempts to change the social fabric, in a way that has led to a decrease in the power of traditional authorities. The development of computer networks originated at the same time, in the late sixties, with ARPANET, which was supported by the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). There was no direct connection between the militaries who had funded ARPANET and the political activists at the origin of the events of 1968. Nevertheless, a few years later, in the seventies and in the eighties, people, who had been strongly influenced by the ideas of May 1968 in their young age, greatly contributed to the development of computer and network technologies (Lyotard 1984). In particular, some of them initiated the free software movement, the purpose of which was to institute a new economical order based on a social utopia that was characteristic of that period (Turner 2006). There naturally follows from these considerations a question about the very nature and the origin of the OnLife society, i.e. about of the society that is shaped by the information and communication technologies and, more specifically, by the web: Does the structure of this society correspond to the spirit of free movements of May 1968? Or is it fundamentally different, and why? In favor of the influence of May 1968, one can note that many traditional and well-established institutions seem to lose their credit. The web facilitates retroactions and interactive relations"

341,36,0.295,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"system does not precede the choices that different actors make. In this chapter the authors have presented a narrative that supports their normative position â that it makes sense to see freshwater systems as coupled social-biophysical systems so that, in a human-induced climate change world, the relational dynamic between and within the social and biophysical will benefit from moving towards forms of inclusive, systemic governance. Jennifer McKay presents a portfolio-based approach to planning and management and argues that rapid urbanisation, growing urban populations, environmental issues and climate change all present significant challenges for water resource management, the delivery of essential water and sanitation services and environmental protection. As a result, traditional approaches that have relied heavily on large-scale infrastructure development are making way for new approaches such as the portfolio-based approach to planning and management. In an urban context this includes integration of all components of the urban water cycle, and most state governments in Australia have embarked on implementing this integrated approach by having a mix of water supply sources including demand management and conservation measures. However, effective implementation of this approach depends on policies and regulations and encounters various impediments. Accordingly, this chapter focuses on the City of Adelaide in South Australia and explores the legal and policy challenges for implementing an integrated urban water management plan in Metropolitan Adelaide. Drawing on the results of governance studies carried out in Australia that included a literature review and stakeholder and community surveys, this chapter attempts to better understand the barriers to transitioning Adelaide to a water-sensitive city. With regard to implementing an integrated urban water management strategy in Australia, there is no âone size fits allâ structural arrangement. Although there is growing support for implementing a portfolio of water supply sources, it is also true that there are impediments to implementing this approach. The authors caution that achieving (cultural) transformations to encourage institutional change for implementation of an integrated urban water management approach may take several years, and therefore planners and policy-makers must have a long-term framework for addressing these issues. Looking ahead, there is scope for further research to explore the intergovernmental issues and provide models to enable this transition and hence be a model for the world in portfolio approaches.

The cases of social innovations that were examined demonstrated the mutual relationships that exist between all of these four components of a (local) welfare system â (local) state, business sector, third sector organisations and the, often informal, networks of community and family life. Reaching out to all sectors of local welfare systems Even though there was considerable variation in the level and impact of state funding and support for the social innovations that were studied, overall it could be stated that these initiatives were concerned with establishing links with all sectors and that the organisations involved thereby often took on a hybrid character. It could be argued that most social innovations would have liked to receive more state and municipal support, but equally it can also be assumed that they would not have wished to be incorporated into the public sector. It can be suggested, therefore, that social innovations could best be captured by concepts of welfare that were based on a deliberate mixing and pluralism among actors, resources and responsibilities. Needless to say, the share of state-public welfare contributions of various kinds of third-sector organisations, ranging from associations to social enterprises, from NGOs to community networks and, finally, the level of corporate social responsibility was a matter that involved some controversy and conflict. Such conflicts not only concerned ideas and finances but also power. Aiming for less standardisation, more diversity and more localisation in welfare arrangements Innovation became difficult, if not impossible, wherever the right to act, organise or provide differently was denied. This could be the case in both large private-sector business organisations, which were managed centrally, and in certain market sectors that were controlled by private sector oligopolies. This means that those who wanted a more important role for social innovation would have to secure a degree of decentralisation, diversity, difference and, moreover, the possibility of unconventional mergers between elements that were usually separate. What is more, supporting innovation meant opting for arrangements that allowed for a new balance between guaranteed universality and diversity in localised arrangements. A good example of what is involved in combining and balancing concerns with universalism and diversity could be found in those municipalities that had worked to secure the right to develop their own options for occupational integration strategies, such as the âOptionskommuneâ in MÃ¼nster,"

With a changing climate, policy makers and advisors face challenges on how to mitigate and adapt while taking into consideration societal goals. One of the ways to deal with societal goals in the context of climate change is through nature-based solutions, including a wide range of green and blue infrastructure measures. This chapter focuses on urban gardens, particularly allotments and community gardens, as one type of green infrastructure. Allotment gardens are mostly larger estates divided into plots that are allocated under rental payments to a single person or a family for non commercial cultivation of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants and recreational purposes. They are normally ruled and managed by local authorities, associations, or private or public organizations. In contrast, community gardens are single pieces of land that are gardened and managed collectively by a group of people. Community gardens, may have a permanent or temporary character, and are often characterized by informal claiming of urban voids with the purpose of local community development (Adams et al. 2013). In this chapter, we explore how allotment and community gardens can serve as multifunctional nature-based solutions to achieve both climate-related and societal goals. Throughout the chapter, case studies illustrate how ecosystem services are provided by urban gardens in cities such as Lisbon, Leipzig, Manchester, and Poznan, all set in different socio-ecological contexts across Europe from northern to southern regions and from eastern to western regions.

380,11,0.294,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"In the period between 1999 and 2013, the late president Hugo ChÃ¡vez spearheaded a broad social and political transformation in Venezuela, frequently referred to as the Bolivarian revolution. This concept took inspiration from the nationâs great hero from the Wars of Independence, SimÃ³n BolÃ­var, whose ideas about national sovereignty and social justice also left him with a legacy as a great political thinker. At the heart of the Bolivarian revolution, or Bolivarian process as it is often referred to, was an upsurge of popular mobilization emerging from the countryâs poor and previously marginalized majority. Through participatory social and political policies and legislation, and drawing on decades of grassroots mobilization, the urban shantytowns in particular were converted into a hotbed of social activism. This mobilization went in tandem with government-led attempts to reform the state institutions into being socially responsive and politically inclusive instruments for concretizing the Bolivarian revolutionâs ideals of poder popular (popular power) and social inclusion. When ChÃ¡vez died from cancer in March 2013, the countryâs poor poured into the streets crying. In the more prosperous neighborhoods however, the home of the countryâs middle and upper class, celebratory fireworks went up in the air and champagne bottles were popped.

In accordance with our understanding of social innovation, focus on the axis between specific contexts of local and urban settings on the one hand and innovations taking shape there on the other has been central to our research and constitutes the basis of this book. Part II looks at it from the perspective of urban contexts and regimes, whereas part III is focussing on typical examples of such local innovations and the various ways in which they interact with their local context. To what degree and in which ways the interaction of local contexts and innovations is mediated by national traditions and trends is a challenge for further research. It was not central to this project. The first period of our research work was devoted to mapping the context of social innovations at the local level. We described the historical-institutional backgrounds on the basis of two dimensions: the structure of the overall welfare state and the degree of centralisation and the position of âthe localâ in shaping welfare. For this purpose, we made an inventory of variables that must be regarded as formal preconditions for local welfare policies and initiatives, including key regulations, financial provisions, contractual arrangements and entitlements. Because at this concrete level there were many changes in key variables (e.g. in financial and regulatory conditions), we set a time frame covering the last 10 years. The variables were specified for three policy fields central to the project: childcare, employment and housing. We started with a literature review and conducted six interviews per country (two in each of the three policy fields, with public officials and professionals), 60 overall, to make sure our information was up-to-date. After mapping the national backgrounds to social innovation, we moved to the local level. We chose 20 European cities (two per country) on which we focused our further research. The chosen cities were: MÃ¼nster and Berlin FriedrichshainâKreuzberg (DE), Zagreb and Varazdin (HR), Amsterdam and Nijmegen (NL), Barcelona and Pamplona (ES), Milan and Brescia (IT), Stockholm and MalmÃ¶ (SE), Birmingham and Medway area (UK), Warsaw and Plock (PL), Lille and Nantes (FR), and Bern and GenÃ¨ve (CH). For the 20 chosen cities, we gathered data about social inequality and exclusion in the local labour market, housing market and childcare facilities, as well as more general data on patterns of social cohesion. Specifically, we identified the relative position of age, gender and migrant groups with respect to general patterns of social inequality and exclusion. Data collection consisted of two parts. The first was an analysis of the Eurostat Database Urban Audit that includes data for more than 200 European cities; it constituted the background for our comparative analysis. The second part consisted of 360 intensive interviews, 36 in each country (six interviews for each group mentioned above in each city). The analysis was aimed at describing the living conditions of people experiencing difficult situations and at identifying the strategies they adopt in order to deal with them. This first stage of the project has been the subject of a separate book (Ranci et al. 2014)."

The causes and constraints to change are often incompletely understood, but they can be tested by monitoring the effects of management and restoration actions. These steps allow managers to link information about plant community composition collected during inventory with concepts of ecosystem dynamics to develop management plans aimed at long-term stewardship. For instance, management actions may seek to maintain a desired plant community with high forage quality, to restore native plants and animals that formerly occupied the site, or to create a mosaic of different plant communities favoring wildlife. In this way, STMs can help specify management objectives for a site, and serve as guides to maintain and restore ecosystem services. The diagrammatic and narrative portions of STMs synthesize various sources of knowledge about ecosystem change, including scientific results, historical anecdotes, and local knowledge. The synthesis is used to develop predictions for how ecosystems respond to natural events and management actions (Bestelmeyer et al. 2009b). Conceptual STMs can be expanded into quantitative models by including estimates of the likelihood of change. Well-developed STMs can serve as a basis for collaborative adaptive management (i.e., management by iterative hypothesis testing, involving multiple stakeholders; Susskind et al. 2012) (Chap. 1, this volume). These guidelines can be updated based on monitoring and new knowledge. In this way, STMs can facilitate a shift from rigid prescriptions based on a one-way relationship between science and management toward a constantly evolving set of recommendations based on collaborative learning and adaptation. Collaborative adaptive management is likely to be more effective than rigid rules of thumb as a basis for environmental stewardship, especially as global climate continues to change. Because of the potential for STMs to link science to management, they are being developed with increasing frequency in rangelands and other ecosystems on several continents (Hobbs and Suding 2009). While some STMs were never intended to be used for management, others were developed as a basis for outreach and decision support. The linkage of STMs to on-the-ground decision-making, however, remains limited for a number of reasons, including a lack of adequate detail and specificity in STMs and the inability of institutions to develop and use STMs. Moreover, it is inherently difficult to determine the likelihood of transitions, especially given time lags and long timeframes needed to observe some transitions. Nonetheless, there is continued optimism that STMs can provide useful tools for bridging the sciencemanagement divide (Knapp et al. 2011b). Our approach in this chapter is to (1) review the ecological basis for STMs, (2) outline the fundamental components of STMs, (3) review the experiences in several countries with the development and use of STMs (Australia, Argentina, the United States, and Mongolia), (4) identify and address challenges to the use of STMs for management, and (5) describe recent technical advances that may improve STMs, including participatory approaches in model construction, the use of STMs within a structured decision-"

Even when focusing only on UN partnerships, Carmen Malena notes that âReviewing the literature and talking to UN and civil society representatives quickly reveals that there is little common understanding regarding the meaning of partnershipâ (Malena, 2004). 4. The âideal typeâ as a method for defining social scientific concepts is commonly ascribed to Max Weber. Social reality is usually so complex and varied that no conceptual apparatus can do it justice. Nevertheless, Weber argued, social scientists should define clear concepts that try to capture important similarities of phenomena and thus facilitate analysis and enquiry. Cf. for example, KÃ¤sler (1995), pp. 229â34. 5. Cf. the so-called Bali guiding principles (available at http://www.un.org/esa/ sustdev/partnerships/bali_guiding_principles.htm, last accessed 27 August 2009) and the CSD 11 decision (Commission on Sustainable Development, 2003). 6. âUnter âPublic Private Partnershipsâ verstehen wir Entwicklungspartnerschaften mit der Privatwirtschaft: Die Partnerschaften bestehen aus gemeinsam finanzierten Projekten von Unternehmen und entwicklungspolitischen Institutionenâ (Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Technische Zusammenarbeit, 2004). 7. The concept of corporatism has changed over time, sometimes creating confusion as to its exact meaning. Williamson (1985b), for example, provides a comprehensive discussion of the concept of corporatism and distinguishes three different usages of the term as a body of prescriptive economic and social thought, as a practice of a range of authoritarian regimes and as an analytical tool to examine the relations between organised groups and the state in liberal democracies. 8. Philippe S. Schmitter, a leading contemporary theorist on corporatism, for example, reflects the ambiguous connotations of the term when he states that âCorporatism, either as a practice in political life or as a concept in political theory, has always been politically controversial. It has been heralded as a novel and promising way of ensuring harmony between conflicting social classes. It has also been condemned as a reactionary and antidemocratic formula for suppressing the demands of autonomous associations and movementsâ (Schmitter, 1995, p. 309). 9. This argument has been made most explicitly for partnerships operating at the international or transnational level by Marina Ottaway. To her, recent trends suggest that corporatist solutions at the global level are on the rise. Analysing the historical track record of corporatism, she comes to the conclusion that the main danger of corporatism as implemented in nation states, namely the emergence of authoritarianism, is not a risk at the global level. Yet she still concludes that corporatismâs costs exceed it benefits: âAnd this is what corporatism has always done: it absorbs groups that challenge the status quo in the political system, where they can have some impact on policy reform but are neutralized as vehicles for radical changeâ (Ottaway, 2001, p. 280). For the local level, Vivien Lowndes has emphasised that partnerships have the same shortcomings as the traditional corporatist model. Cf. Lowndes (2001). 10. Cf. Saul (1999). 11. The argument has been made most powerfully for NGOs operating at the transnational or international level. Thus, for example, Anderson and Rieff criticise the standard account of transnational NGOs as constituting âglobal civil societyâ and"
212,83,0.293,Life Cycle Management,"To consider LCM among the key success factors through all levels of any organization, it needs to be a part of the organizationâs policy. Therefore, it should possess the basic characteristics of an organizationâs policies. These are, for example: the policy has to be well known and also well understood by all stakeholders that are directly or indirectly affected from its implementation, it should be stable and not subjected to change frequently, it should be consistent with the companyâs organizational structure at all levels, it has to be formulated within the context of companyâs objectives, and more importantly, it has to be goal-based and visionary with a long-range focus, while also being realistic and concrete, grounded by its ambition level. Setting goals according to the levels of ambition ensures conformity between policy and actions. There are different levels of sustainability ambitions, just to cite a few (Table 4.2): â¢ Internal readiness and commitment to continuous sustainability improvements. This level signifies awareness that environmental and social improvements can be made using management frameworks such as ISO 9001 ((ISO 2008), ISO 14001(ISO 2004) and/or corporate social responsibility (CSR) (McWilliams and Siegel 2001), and that a commitment to improvements of product performance is the first step towards LCM. â¢ Life cycle sustainability performance improvement of products. This includes a safe and resource efficient process, product or system that provide better service to customers while reducing environmental and social impacts. This can be addressed through broadening companiesâ system boundaries beyond their manufacturing level, by including the full supply chain from raw materials selection and acquisition, use of product, distribution and end-of-life â based on a screening of the productâs performance. â¢ Reduce climate change impact and be energy efficient by using low-carbon and renewable energy sources. â¢ Maximize the social benefits by engaging a wide range of stakeholders and also respect the rights of the social community whom the company works with. â¢ Create competitive advantages and maximize economic benefits from promoting products with better environmental and social profile. Establishing such ambition levels can help an organization to understand where to begin the sustainability initiative. Depending on its past sustainability practices and current challenges, an organization can begin with a certain level of ambitions and goes to relatively high level once it acquires knowledge and familiarity on how to make its plan into action successfully."
13,28,0.293,Feeling Gender : a Generational and Psychosocial Approach,"Changing the Norm from Within What may a generational and psychosocial study of the social patterns feelings of gender add to the understanding of the social transformation of gender? I will end this chapter with a short discussion of this in relation to three perspectives on change in contemporary feminist theory taken from political theory, poststructuralist/queer theory and practice theory. In contrast to feminist work in the 1970s and 1980s, which put emphasis on structural change, contemporary feminist theories are more oriented towards agency, practices, processes, symbolic power and meaning. With regard to this, my view is that including the feelings of gender would contribute to improving the understanding of how gender norms and practices are both connected with larger social forces and, at the same time, may be transformed âfrom withinâ. Feelings find their ways into peopleâs agencies during their life course and at specific historical times. Political theory works with the assumption that in order to be political, identities must be explicit and articulated, and that political action is characterised by having a collective and public form. Politics is about"

Portonâs origin as a defense establishment during the Great War was intricately connected with a generation of male researchers who were driven by a deep-seated desire for advancement and social prestige, an emerging âintellectual aristocracyâ with strong social and professional bonds, determined to unlock the secrets of the world through science and experiment and thus realize their visionary ideas of modern society (see also Sturdy 2011). Those who believed in the power of science were men such as Lieutenant Colonel Charles Lovatt Evans (1884â1968) who, according to a friend, âpossessed the great qualities of some of the most zealous and distinguished of the Victorians, who accomplished their lifeâs work by an immense capacity for hard work and a burning zeal for achievement.â27 At Porton, Lovatt Evansâ colleagues included the Cambridge physiologist Joseph Barcroft. Despite his Quaker upbringing, Barcroft felt the need to contribute to the war effort after Germanyâs premeditated gas attack.

170,243,0.293,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"4 Synthesis and Implications This chapter proposed an analytical framework in order to guide the assessment of ICTâs impact on wellbeing. We argued that the amount of polysemy and lack of common basic guidelines in ICT fields constitute one of the main barriers for the incorporation of ICT into a broader research problem spectrum (outside the ICT researchersâ communities) and, consequently, to widen ICTâs impact research. After a synthesis of the historical development of the digital divide concept, we discussed and developed two plausible analytical models to assess ICTâs impact on wellbeing, finally opting for a framework based on Selwynâs approach. We supported the idea that the testing of any ICT-related hypothesis should analyse, at least and when possible, three stages of hierarchical digital achievements (access, usage and appropriation) plus one last divide stage: ICTâs outcomes (measured by the effect of previous stages on the dependent wellbeing variable). Finally, we propose five guidelines for the applications of this framework and present an actual case of use, showing how this framework guided the research design in a study of the effect of e-skill on education-to-work transitions: use an up-to-down strategy from higher to lower stages of the divide, start from a theoretical relevant perspective, assess the possibilities the data or research instruments enable for each stage and repeat this strategy for the lower levels of digital inequalities. To conclude, we would like to emphasize that this document does not aim to become a final analytical framework to research ICTâs impact on wellbeing as it is only a first and basic guide for orientation purposes. We conceive this document as a first step in the task of expanding ICTâs impact research and discourse outside the information society and ICTD community. It is our belief that there is a need to construct quality and cost-efficient research instruments that will enable a wider spectrum of social researchers, those not focused on information society, to introduce ICT assets (access, usage, appropriation) as independent variables to their studies. This would also enhance our opportunity to study ICTâs impact in a much wider and more diverse array of subjects.

169,275,0.292,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"As proposed by Hartmann et al. (2013), hydropower planning should take place on the system scale and consider multiple parameters (Seliger et al. 2016). The selection of criteria depends on the respective conservation goal (e.g. conservation of overall connectivity or of species-speciï¬c migration routes) and can include both qualitative (e.g. habitat quality) or quantitative data (e.g. distance to the next barrier). Opperman et al. (2015) performed multiple dam building scenarios for three case studies and compared them on the basis of hydropower capacity and impacts on connectivity (deï¬ned as the longest connected network in the catchment). They showed that the impacts on connectivity varied considerably between scenarios with the same energy output and that a certain share of the hydropower capacity (or a certain number of barriers) can usually be realized with insigniï¬cant connectivity declines. Consequently, large-scale assessments represent one possible approach to signiï¬cantly reduce the overall impact (Opperman et al. 2015; Seliger et al. 2016; see also Chap. 23). Also the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) developed a two-level approach for guiding sustainable hydropower development in the Danube catchment (ICPDR 2013). Site-speciï¬c mitigation measures can be planned after identifying locations with favourable hydropower potential and ecological criteria (ICPDR 2013). As efï¬cient as large-scale concepts can be for decision-making on new barriers, they can just as well support the planning process for restoring existing dams. Continuity restoration for all existing obstacles in a river might not be feasible or expedient. Due to limited resources (e.g. time, money), it might be worthwhile to identify those barriers where continuity restoration yields the best ecological beneï¬t. This is, of course, only the case if suitable habitats are made accessible. Consequently, the inclusion of habitat quality parameters is highly recommended. Several examples for the prioritization of barriers for continuity restoration already exist (e.g. OâHanley and Tomberlin 2005; Mesa and Magie 2009; OâHanley 2011; Segurado et al. 2013). Also transnational implementations are applicable, as shown by the prioritization index applied for the Danube catchment (ICPDR 2015) assigning decreasing importance from the Danube to the tributaries and including protected areas, length of the reconnected habitat and presence of other hydromorphological pressures. The prioritization index of the ICPDR and many others are based on simple cost-beneï¬t analysis, including a set of assessment criteria to identify barriers of importance. While such scoring-and-ranking systems (e.g. Karle 2005) are easy to apply and comprehend, they assess each barrier independently. On the other hand, detailed GIS analyses (performing âwhat ifâ-type assessments) (Dumont et al. 2005; Gough et al. 2012) and optimization models (Kuby et al. 2005; OâHanley and Tomberlin 2005) which can incorporate cumulative effects remain reserved for specialists (Kemp and OâHanley 2010). Although large-scale concepts represent suitable tools for both protecting and restoring aquatic ecosystems, they are rarely applied, and decisions are all too often"

Nevertheless, effective functionings are the only things researchers would probably be able to assess in the majority of studies: well-paid jobs, formal education achievement, income, etc. This would be the area or dependent variable in which ICT may have an impact. However, Fig. 1 shows that CAâs framework is even more complex, in the way that not all individuals are able to convert or generate capabilities in equal rates from the same features. This is due to differences in their conversion factors, which may be personal (i.e. literacy, cognitive ability, gender), social (i.e. culture, norms, values) and environmental (Zheng 2007: p. 2). Conversion factors may also be considered capabilities themselves, which mediate the conversion of ICTâs characteristics (Alampay 2006: p. 9; Garnham 1997: p. 32): literacies, knowledge on the use of ICT and the understanding of the implications of using information as a resource, to name just a few of them. Moreover, ICT commodities may also act as conversion factors or conversion factor enablers (Heeks and Molla 2009: p. 34). At this point, it is probably clear to the reader that the problem with CA is that as strong and comprehensive its theoretical and philosophical framework is, it is a very difficult framework to understand and apply, especially to a non-ICT researcher. As Heeks and Molla (2008: p. 33) argue, CA is âquite a dense set of ideas that can be hard to understand and translate into practical evaluation termsâ. For the sake of lowering barriers to entry to the ICT field, while CA provides a strong theoretical model on ICTâs impact on wellbeing, it is not the best candidate to use as a firstentry analytical framework."
277,452,0.292,integrating Immigrants in Europe : Research-Policy Dialogues,"independent actors, yet they often lack sufficient funds to build up bold policies on their own. In the communist era, all actions of state agencies were âplannedâ, the âplanâ usually being ignorant of reality, and never based on evidence or scientific expertise. There is no tradition of commissioning research and to add to this, despite ideological declarations stating otherwise, the social sciences themselves are not accustomed to providing applicable research results. The public administration and its officials remain procedure-oriented rather than goal-oriented. All these features of the state may be presented here with a certain dose of simplification and exaggeration, yet these broad brush strokes quite adequately depict the conditions for dialogue on certain issues in Poland. When it comes to civil society in Central Eastern Europe, there are three factors of weakness (as compared to the West) according to Howard (2003): (1) illegitimacy and distrust towardss forms of collective association, which often were obligatory in the communist period; (2) strong bonds of family and groups based on friendship which render formal forms of association less relevant; and (3) increased individualism caused by a disappointment with corrupt and inefficient collective action (Howard 2003). Similarly, Bafoil lists the following features of non-governmental organisations in Central Eastern Europe: âthey are more widespread in urban than in rural areas; they are able to mobilise only a small number of voluntary workers (in comparison with the figures for Western Europe); they are particularly short of funds [ : : : ]; and their relations with the public authorities are often difficultâ (Bafoil 2009:174â5). Non-governmental organisations are not perceived as partners by public authorities, but rather as providers of services. According to Bafoil, mistrust between the state and non-governmental organisations in many sectors has actually risen since the fall of communism, as governments did not wish to share their prerogatives. Howard and Bafoilâs observations need to be supplemented with a reference to the Polish historical context that goes further back than communism: the perception of the state as oppressive originates in the nineteenth-century occupation of parts of Poland by the Russian Empire, and in the feudal social systems before that. The mistrust between public officials and NGO activists hinders constructive dialogue and cooperation. However, such mistrust also seems to institutionalise specific forms of dialogue, such as scandals and symbolic conflict. Non-governmental organisations in Poland have been significantly strengthened recently thanks to the hitherto unknown possibility of acquiring European funds, which provide resources unattainable through private donors or authorities. As mentioned, social scientists in Poland are generally not familiar with applied research for policymaking, despite occasionally expressed ambitions to advance social engineering. Applied research is perceived by some scholars as less prestigious than âpureâ scientific inquiry. But even scholars interested in social policy often develop indicators that are not applicable by policymakers. Expertise provided to authorities is often perceived as decorative in nature by researchers themselves. In relation to public authorities and non-governmental organisations, social scientists often behave like âsupportersâ of NGOs. In the case of research on refugees in Poland it has been shown that authors of publications assume beforehand that NGOs act in favour of refugees, while public organisations are tools of exclusion and discrimination (Pawlak 2012)."

There are areas described by earlier immigrants as more âdecentâ and ârespectableâ, that correspond to the ideal of social order into which they want to insert themselves, and areas from which they want to keep a distance, both physically and symbolically. A good example is the Porta Palazzo market. For many immigrants who live in Barriera di Milano the market has been and continues to be a key reference point where they build social networks, find information, and make purchases (Semi 2006).

56,69,0.292,Retirement Home? Ageing Migrant Workers in France and the Question of Return,"In Chap. 1 I noted the importance of remittances for hostel residents and their families. Viewing migration as a strategy to insure against risks to household income, the ânew economics of labour migrationâ approach is far better able to explain the significance of remittances than the neo-classical approach with its assumption of utility-maximising individuals. A second factor is the ability to re-integrate and gain acceptance by the home community after a long absence: the structuralist literature is useful here. Improved (and cheaper) communications and transport is a further factor of note: a burgeoning literature on âtransnationalismâ has emerged in the last 20 years grounded largely in these explanatory variables. Finally, I underlined the worrying situation facing many hostel residents in terms of ill-health and poverty, and the importance of accessing healthcare and social security benefits: social systems theory provides an innovative framework for theorising such factors. For each of these four theoretical models, the relevant explanatory variables are identified below and then applied to return at retirement, before concluding with an assessment of overall strengths and weaknesses. The New Economics of Labour Migration In Chap. 1, the neo-classical economics approach to return migration was acknowledged as the principle alternative to theories prioritising family localisation and group ties. The neo-classical approach is commendable for its theoretical neatness and predictive potential regarding who migrates and under what circumstances. Yet often these predictions do not match the empirical evidence, most notably when peopleâs migration behaviour does not tally with favourable wage differentials or purchasing power considerations. A further criticism is that in the neo-classical approach, to migrate is only ever an individual decision, a perspective which isolates migrants from their social context. Neo-classical accounts also find it difficult to account for the widespread practice of remittance sending. These latter two points can be more fruitfully unpacked using the perspective known as the new economics of labour migration (NELM). In contrast to the neo-classical focus on the utility-maximising individual, the NELM approach places remittances and the âutility-maximizing familyâ (Stark âStructuralismâ is not a term which Cerase or Gmelch themselves used. Instead, I have been guided in this choice of terminology by Cassarino (2004), who uses this term to categorise their contributions in his typology of return migration theories."
118,663,0.292,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"20.3 Communication on Science and Technology The importance of social aspects in the development and utilization of science and technology has been increasingly recognized not only in the nuclear engineering field but also in other science and engineering fields. The cause for this realization is the increase of social conflicts related to science and technology, such as environmental problems, ethical concerns in frontier engineering (e.g. genetics), etc. [4]. In this context, two cases immediately draw our attention [4]: the study by Wynne [5] on how the general public understands and deals with scientific knowledge about environmental contamination in the vicinity of the Sellafield-Windscale site in U.K., and the circumstances of U.K.âs government response to the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) issue [6]. It is explained, for example, that the âdeficiency model,â which considers that miscommunication and misunderstanding on science and technology mainly rest on the deficiency of the citizenâs knowledge, is not plausible in many cases [5]. Then, not only the importance of the trust in information of science and technology but also the importance of the trustworthiness of an organization which deals with the information are claimed [4]. One of the effective ways to foster the trust and the trustworthiness is mutual communication between citizens and experts, not oneway communication from experts to citizens, such as teaching and enlightening. The mutual communication may include the reflection of public opinion in the development and the utilization of science and technology, public involvement in the decision making process for science and technology issues, etc."
90,25,0.292,"Informatics in the Future : Proceedings of the 11th European Computer Science Summit (ECSS 2015), Vienna, October 2015","Just as the old controversies were settling a new challenge to computingâs identity began to appear. There were a growing number of references to ânatural computingâ, meaning computational processes in nature. One of the influential pioneers was Nobel laureate David Baltimore, who claimed that biology had become an information science (Baltimore 2002). Others argued similar things for economics, physics, chemistry, cognitive science, and other fields in the physical, life, and social sciences (Kari and Rozenberg 2008). The rapid emergence and development of natural computing is an amazing turnaround from the 1960s, when Simon argued that computing is a science even if it studies artificial phenomena, and when many others believed that the field of computing is fully reducible to mathematics. Today scientists in other fields are saying that their fields include information processes that occur naturally. They are telling computer scientists, âWe have information processes too!â This shift has led to a new definition of computing as a discipline as the study of information processes, both artificial and natural. This definition is important because it shifts the focus from the computer to information processes and their transformations. It is also a much more inclusive definition that allows for the computational branches of other fields, including the natural sciences. This definition also accommodates the three intellectual traditions embedded in computing, which we mentioned earlierâtheory, design, and abstraction. The theoretical tradition focuses on mathematical relationships and proofs. The design tradition focuses on the design and construction of computational circuits, machines, systems, and software. The abstraction tradition focuses on experimental work to test algorithms, validate software, find workable system configurations, and support design choices; it was advocated early (Feldman and Sutherland 1979; McCracken et al. 1979) but took many years to develop and earn a stature comparable to the theory and design methods. A combination of these three traditions gained wider currency in computing when other fields acknowledged computing as a third way of doing science and developed computational branches (Denning and Martell 2015). The 1980s experimental computer science debates, which brought methodology to limelight, were supported in the mid-1990s by methodological meta-analyses, fashionable in many other fields. Many people and research groups analyzed journal articles and conference papers in computing and other fields in order to describe methodology in computing and compare computing research with research in other fields (Tedre 2014). Those meta-analyses found great methodological differences between computingâs branches, but also revealed widespread disregard"
169,638,0.292,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"21.6.1 Integration of the ES Approach into the WFD Although the ES concept is not yet explicitly mentioned in the EU Water Framework Directive, the aspect of ensuring the provision of ES is implicitly linked with the WFD objective of âreaching a good ecological statusâ (Wallis et al. 2011). The following WFD articles speciï¬cally refer to the valuation of ES (based on Wallis et al. 2011): â Article 5: assessment of the economic signiï¬cance of water use, current level of cost recovery â Article 4: decisions on derogations â Article 9: assessment of the level of cost recovery and incentive pricing â Article 11: selection of the most cost-effective sets of measures for achieving good ecological status/potential for the programs of measures The clear linkage between the WFD and its principles and the ecosystem approach is also shown by Vlachopoulou et al. (2014). They argue that it has the potential to act in a complementary way. It could, for instance, be applied for the evaluation of different management scenarios and thereby support decision-making processes. In particular, the more holistic management approaches that are supported by the ES approach, such as the spatial mapping of ES or the comprehensive evaluation of multiple beneï¬ts, can potentially assist in achieving the goals of the WFD (Vlachopoulou et al. 2014). In this context, Koundouri et al. (2015) propose an integrated methodology that regards the ES approach as the core aspect to achieve a more sustainable and efï¬cient water management. It combines the ES framework with traditional economic frameworks and consists of a socioeconomic characterization of the river basin area, an assessment of water use costs that are recovered, and a suggestion for appropriate measures for sustainable water management. In order to enhance the WFD implementation, Reyjol et al. (2014) established a list of research needs that also includes the reinforcement of the knowledge on relationships between good ecological status, biodiversity, and ES. They recommend enhancing understanding of ecological processes through developing further research on the links between good ecological status, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning. As the ES concept is still not very well known among water policymakers and managers, they point to the need for easily comprehensible guidelines for these actor groups."

In separate trials, we exposed test mice to a novel object placed in the home cage (counterbalanced with novel-mouse exposure). Nevertheless, VTA activity in response to the novel object resembled peak VTA activity during social interaction, with similar amplitude (mean peak dF/F during interaction: 16.4 %  2.1 % SEM for social, 13.7 %  1.4 % SEM for novel object, n Â¼ 10; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p Â¼ 0.5). While these data were consistent with hypothesized importance of the VTA-NAc projection in social behavior, direct observation of endogeneous activity in the projection during social behavior remained lacking. This would require measuring a previously inaccessible but fundamental neural circuit quantity: native activity in a specific projection during behavior. Fiber photometry was designed for this technical challenge, and we next tested real-time tracking of Ca2+ transients in genetically specified VTA inputs to NAc. Using TH-GCaMP mice, we implanted an optical fiber in medial NAc to detect activity specifically in axon fibers corresponding to the projection in question during home cage social interaction and novel object investigation (Gunaydin et al. 2014). We observed robust GCaMP signals across many social interaction bouts, demonstrating that fiber photometry could be used to selectively record from neuronal projections during behavior (Gunaydin et al. 2014). We observed smaller projection activation to novel object (n Â¼ 11, Wilcoxon signed rank test, mean peak dF/F: 6.9 %  1.4 % for social, 3.5 %  0.7 % for novel object, p Â¼ 0.016). Stronger encoding of social than of object interactions by the VTA-NAc projection (not seen at the cell bodies) supports the hypothesis that there are distinctly wired relevant subpopulations of VTA neurons. We sought to capitalize on this ability to track projection activity during behavior by probing in greater detail the encoding of specific behaviors by the VTA projection to NAc (in comparison with activity in VTA cell bodies) using multifactorial high-resolution quantitative behavioral assessment. We first employed an automated peak-finding algorithm to detect all Ca2+ peaks throughout the 5-min testing period, blind to mouse behaviors, for social and novel object conditions during both VTA cell body and VTA-NAc projection recordings. Next we automatically segmented video clips centered (1 s) around the time of each Ca2+ peak and scored video segments for interaction, approach, withdrawal, ambulation, grooming, rest, burrowing, rearing, and head extension (Gunaydin et al. 2014). Area plots of all VTA-DA Ca2+ peak times subdivided by behavioral category (Fig. 3) allowed direct comparison of total peak activity over time attributable to each category, including as a percent of total overall Ca2+ peak activity (Gunaydin et al. 2014). In the social case, a larger proportion of total Ca2+ peak activity occurred during interaction for VTA-to-NAc projections than for cell bodies, supporting the conclusion that this projection more selectively encodes social interaction than does the cell body signal. For novel object behavior, both cell bodies and projections poorly encoded approach or interaction; interestingly, while the VTA cell bodies seemed to strongly encode withdrawal from the object, the VTA-NAc projection only weakly encoded this specific behavior (Fig. 3). Across the entire 5-min testing period, VTA-NAc projections showed a decreased proportion of Ca2+ peak activity (compared with VTA cell-body data) occurring during"
164,82,0.292,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","Social exclusion long preceded current concerns about economic exclusion. However, social exclusion may be historically rooted in some economic rationale and concerns about social exclusion were boosted because such exclusion is believed to have led to economic exclusion when the pace of economic growth broke away from its historical trend. The term âmodel-dependent realityâ is borrowed from Hawking and Mlodinow (2010), although modelling has long been in practice among economists. Long imbued in âlaws,â scientists are increasingly recognizing the need to rely upon âmodel-dependent realism.â"
0,121,0.291,Library and Information Sciences : Trends and Research,"objects to their pin board, currently featured on the Europeana homepage (and so attracting considerable publicity), surprisingly perhaps comes in at 6th in the social media ranking, with a light traffic flow (681 visits SepâDec 2012). The high number of page views per visit from Pinterest (average 12) and very long dwell time (12 min) suggest âunreal userâ activity, something odd is happening here. We suspect, as this feature on the home page is quite recent, that this may be internal development or testing activity. This should be checked, otherwise a false impression might be provided. We can contrast the traffic flow for the site as a whole with the flow of social media visits using Google Analytics. For the site as a whole most inbound traffic goes direct to a record (about half of all non-search engine referrals) and twelve per cent to âsearchâ. Interestingly, for social referrals half the inbound traffic goes to the homepage and around seventeen per cent to âsearchâ. An informal analysis of âtrackbacksâ provided by Google Analytics suggests that much of the social traffic may be by people involved in development or research in digital humanities and related fields, not a very representative group: insiders. During the period, 30 Dec 2012â29 Jan 2013, when there were 6,628 social referrals, blog.europeana.eu had 8,000 visitors. It is probable the blog users are already familiar with Europeana in which case it is probably not bringing in many new users. âMy Europeanaâ, a personal/customised facility, may also be considered to belong in the âsocialâ category. Between June and December 2012 a total of 1400 users were recorded as having logged in with a userid, less than 300 even in the busiest month of November. Though a few users appear to login and view many hundreds of pages in a month there is little evidence of regular and sustained use of âMy Europeanaâ, less than 50, a tiny amount, have used the feature for three or more months in seven. The majority appear in the record one month only during which they view less than forty pages. Overall logged-in users account for one-half per cent of all page views. Social media, then, is not driving Europeana growth, and unlikely to do from the evidence we have to hand. The example of Pinterest is illustrative. Consider the featuring of a link to Pinterest on the Europeana homepage: this would appear to be of net benefit to Pinterest. Europeana has over 2,000 âfollowersâ on Pinterest and over 600 âpinsâ, but referrals back to Europeana during the last four months of 2012 amount to 680. The big question is what, in the context of Europeana, is social media for? Should we expect it to drive traffic to Europeana, or is Europeana the glue layer that enables Pinterest to be a showcase for Europeanaâs provider institutions? There is scope for a more comprehensive research programme in this area, linking together the traffic analysis of the Europeana web-presence (including blog, exhibitions, API) with similar data drawn from Europeanaâs providers. Of course, all these social media initiatives are insignificant compared to âthe bread and butterâ search engine referral; and not just via Google: pionier.net.pl the Polish aggregator site brought in 37,000 (5 %) referrals, compared to facebook.com 29,000 (< 4 %), with all its millions of members. A study by Europeana (http://pro. europeana.eu/pro-blog/-/blogs/1660413) shows that API use by the Polish partners is proving very successful in sending traffic to Europeana."
373,15,0.291,Introduction to Data Science,"A lot of people believe that the word Data Science is broadly mentioned and used after the publishing of the book The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery [1]. In this book, the first broad look at the way that increasing use of data is bringing a paradigm shift to the nature of science is presented. For reader interest, the four paradigms are empirical evidence (experimental paradigm: thousand years ago), scientific theory (theoretical paradigm: last few hundred years), computational science (computational paradigm: last few decades), and the fourth paradigm is called Data Science (the last decade). Today, Data Science [2] is an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information technology, information science, domain and business knowledge (Figure 2.1). It uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data to solve analytically complex business problems [3]. Data Science is closely related to machine learning, data mining, data analytic, Data Intelligence and Modelling, Business Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, AI-powered systems and usually Big Data [4]. Data Science includes the processes of capturing data, analyzing, and deriving insights from it. Data Science is all about using data to solve real life problems such as identifying which email is spam or not; monitoring anomaly states in systems; predicting the outcome, who will be the next President of the USA; recommendation which movie to watch, which item to buy; healthcare like tumor detection, drug discovery, medical analysis, virtual medical bots; transportation, self-driving cars; risk detection; environmental monitoring; and entertainment and Internet search."
300,226,0.291,"White-Collar Crime in The Shadow Economy : Lack of Detection, investigation and Conviction Compared To Social Security Fraud","The statement did not go unnoticed. Five identical columns in various Norwegian newspapers the following day underlined how one should âbe cautious to signal that social security fraud is not as serious as the majority may thinkâ. One editor called it ânonsenseâ to argue that the police should adjust their priorities in the direction of the big fish: âThe signal effect is substantial. Social security fraudsters should know that NAV is not asleep.â We think this book has shown that white-collar crime is probably a greater social problem than social security fraud in society. In our view, it is neither thorough nor objectively justified in the interests of society if it is the case that the authorities punch harder and more spectacularly at on welfare fraud than on white-collar crime. We would say that such discrimination expresses and segments the predemocratic approach to crime where the criminals, seen from the social elite standpoint, are always âsomeone elseâ, i.e. âthose down thereââthe poor, the unemployed, the marginalized, the foreign, or those the elite in Britain used to call âthe dangerous classesâ. The combination of care for the poor and imprisonment was invented by the emerging modern state to deal with the growing flood of unemployed, beggars, and other poor people. Punishment was not just about reducing crime insecurity, but about dealing with the hierarchical society of social insecurity. White-collar crime is not committed by the poor, the defeated, or the unemployed, but by people in positions of power, often high up the social ladder. There is a danger that white-collar crime is not perceived as real crime, because it does not include violence and is carried out by better-off citizens. Imprisonment is not only removal of freedom, but also a stigma. The penalty is a state-sanctioned deprivation of individual glory. When a member of the elite breaks the law, it can result in a problematic situation for others within the elite. An âeliteâ humanâs crime can threaten the eliteâs chastity in a manner that offences committed by âsub-humansâ do not."

293,283,0.29,"integration Processes and Policies in Europe : Contexts, Levels and Actors","Introduction This state-of-the-art volume taking stock of and presenting existing research on integration processes and policies in Europe was triggered by European Union (EU)-level policymaking on integration. A 2011 European Commission policy document proposes that integration policies should involve not only immigrants and the society of settlement but also actors in immigrantsâ countries of origin (EC 2011). Compared to the Commissionâs earlier deï¬nition of integration (EC 2003), this constituted a shift from a two-way to a three-way process approach. The current volume has reformulated the EUâs policy shift into a broader question for academia and integration research: What does research have to say about (the study of) integration processes and, in particular, about the relevance of actors in origin countries for integration? What does the existing literature say about integration policies in Europe and use of the concept of integration in policy formulation and practice? Does the proposal to include actors in countries of origin as important players in integration policies ï¬nd legitimation in empirical research? With the purpose of answering these questions, we asked experts in the relevant subï¬elds to write state-of-the-art chapters. Chapter 2, by Penninx and GarcÃ©sMascareÃ±as, examined development of the concept of integration in the academic study of settlement processes of migrants and in policies. Chapter 3, by Van Mol and De Valk, analysed changes in migration patterns and characteristics of immigrants as a potential explanatory factor for changes in integration processes and policies. R.

Our evidence (Sect. 5.1) revealed that this has been the case for many countries, so the next step was to determine whether these changes in intended science curricula supported the hypothesis that science curricula were becoming increasingly similar across countries. Our analyses provided mixed evidence to support this hypothesis."
299,96,0.29,Happiness Is The Wrong Metric : a Liberal Communitarian Response To Populism,"Economics is considered by academics as the queen of the social sciences, the most prestigious of the lot. It carries more weight in the public and private spheres than all the other social sciences combined. It is not an accident that the White House has a Council of Economic Advisers, but all suggestions to create a Council of Social Advisers have been rebuffed. Of the 19 public policy schools in the US, at least 18 are dominated by economists. In the private sector, MBAsâwhose training is more based on economics than on other disciplinesâoutrank other social scientists. Economists (to reiterate, many but by no means all or even most) draw on a metaconception of human nature, often referred to as homo economicus. People are assumed to seek to maximize their self-interest, which at least initially was equated with satisfaction drawn from the consumption of goods and services. It is a view that can be referred to as materialistic hedonism. This thesis is often expressed by the use of the term âutility.â The original concept of utility, as developed late in the eighteenth century by Jeremy Bentham (1789), is narrow: All actions are directed toward gaining pleasure or avoiding pain.1 Happiness, satisfaction, and pleasure are treated as synonyms (Gottheil 2013, p. 121). Utilitarian philosophy views pain and pleasure not only as sources of motivation, but also of ethical guides: âIt is for them [pain and pleasure] alone to point out what we ought to doâ and determine the âstandard of right and wrongâ (Bentham 1789). Along similar lines, John Stuart Mill (1863) wrote that âactions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness,â with happiness defined as âpleasure and the absence of pain.â When British philosopher Thomas Hobbes was asked why he gave a coin to a beggar, Hobbes replied that âhe made his donation with the sole intent of relieving his own misery at the sight of the beggarâ (Aubrey 1898, p. 352). Adam Smith (1776) famously argued in The Wealth of Nations that the market as a system relies on each actor pursuing his self-interest: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. (p. 14)"
192,205,0.29,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"His research position at McGurk (where he joins his egoâideal again), his dramatic expedition to the Caribbean and, finally, his retreat into the woods are all instances of a return of the repressed. Having been exposed to the quest for pure science, he cannot really become socialised into normal civil society any more. Indeed, in Arrowsmith, bacteriology is presented as an infectious affliction, spreading from the laboratories of Pasteur and Koch into the United States, with researchers such as Gottlieb as carriers or vectors.8 As Freud argues in Group psychology and the analysis of the ego, there is a strong desire in infected individuals to confer their infection to others, for why should they alone be excluded from the benefits of social life and condemned to an ascetic existence of toil and hardship (p. 134)? But what exactly makes laboratory research so âinfectiousâ (for individuals âsusceptibleâ to it), so alluring?"
128,283,0.29,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"MeasurIng solIdarIty PractIces: Between VoluntarIsM and actIVIsM The conceptual link between solidarity and civic and political engagement has been mainly developed through the lenses of political activism or the study of acts of compassion. Still, these analyses depict solidarity-based behaviour as a connection with others, enhanced by the membership to a group that presupposes some specific duties (Rochon 1998; Wilson 2012). This presupposition of belonging is expected to impact the relationship between the actor and the recipient. As a result, the degree of social proximity and attachment also affects individual motivations and consequently the form of individual or collective engagement (van der Zee 2006). In addition to these factors, social tolerance also plays a fundamental role. Tolerance (social and political) is not limited to the acceptance of diversity but also to the acceptance on equal terms of certain unpopular and target groups (Leite Viegas 2007). Thus, social tolerance as a covariate for explaining solidarity practices (civic and political) relates to individualsâ distance to social groups which is then to be peered to social identification as attachment. The experimental design of the dictator game implemented by Fowler and Kam (2007) showed that social identification and altruism both trigger political participation. However social identification enhances particularised forms of solidarity, as the norms of reciprocity are stronger within groups than between groups. Still, generosity and unilateral giving behaviours have been shown from other experimental research to cascade individual contributions to public goods (Simpson and Willer 2015; Fehr and Schmidt 2006; Fehr and Fischbacher 2003). The perspective of solidarity as prosocial behaviour based on a sole membership/connection (social identification) suggests that additional acts of support or compassion that target the well-being of others are mainly driven by an altruistic concern. In line with these two perspectives, we use social identification and social tolerance to better understand in-bond (within-group) and out-bond (outer-group) solidarity. We assume that solidarity practices are related to both particularised concerns (within-group) and to more general altruistic concerns (outer-group). Hypothesis 1a Individuals reporting higher levels of social group identification are more likely to engage in activities aimed at enhancing within-group well-being."
192,200,0.29,Tales of Research Misconduct : a Lacanian Diagnostics of integrity Challenges in Science Novels,"During his (initially quite unsuccessful) research there, he coincidentally discovers a strange invisible âsomethingâ, a mysterious âprinciple Xâ which destroys bacteria, and he decides to study it meticulously, in accordance with the rigorous methods of his mentor. Unfortunately, while Martin is still engrossed in his analyses, experiencing serious inhibitions when it comes to putting his findings to paper, Felix dâHerelle of the Pasteur Institute announces his discovery of what he refers to as the âbacteriumâeatingâ virus, the bacteriophage. After recovering from this serious drawback (the loss of priority), Martin is urged by Gottlieb to continue his phage research, but to focus on practical applications instead, using these predators of bacteria as âalliesâ in the war against disease. When the fictitious Caribbean island of St. Hubert is struck with bubonic plague, and McGurk is called upon for help, Martin is sent there (accompanied by his wife Leora and a drinking companion, the public health specialist Sondelius) to conduct a field trial designed to determine whether âphageâ can effectively be employed in fighting lethal pathogens. The result is a moral clash between the islandâs administrators (who had expected a lifeâsaving doctor) and Martinâs own objective as a scientist, intent on using the population as âmaterialâ for his trial. Thus, he finds himself confronted with an ethical dilemma: as a physician, it is his duty to vaccinate as many inhabitants as possible, but as a researcher, he is in need of an (untreated) control group to demonstrate the effectiveness of his vaccine. This means: dividing the coloured, illiterate population of a village into two equal halves: the saved and the doomed. Initially, he remains loyal to the experimental rigour instilled in him by Gottlieb, but after the tragic death of both Sondelius and his wife the physician in him gains the upper hand and he contaminates the experiment that was supposed to bring him everlasting fame. He still manages to publish his results, but tampers with his sloppy data so as to make his story sufficiently convincing. He becomes married again, this time to an affluent socialite widow who kindly provides him with a lavishly equipped laboratory of his own. Yet, utter dislike of the social life of the New York elite, in combination with marital unease, presses him to leave both wife and child behind and to escape to the wilderness of Vermont, where, together with another disgruntled colleague, he lives out his mania for âpureâ research, virtually undisturbed, in an isolated forest cabin. In the following sections, key dimensions of the novel will be subjected to a Lacanian reading, treating Martin Arrowsmith as a case study (Fallgeschichte). Successively, I will focus on: (a) the organisational and occupational hazards of a biomedical career; (b) the cupido sciendi of pure science as a âdivine madnessâ; (c) Martinâs grand moment of discovery (the bacteriophage as the intrusion of the ârealâ); (d) the core medicalâethical dilemma (the bacteriologist as a physician and as a researcher) and (e) cabin science: Martinâs escape to a reclusive, scientific Walden, the novelâs final act."

Further, there is limited information on the mechanisms that affect hostâ ranavirus interactions and factors that lead to mortality events (Gray et al. 2009). Various field studies and controlled experiments are expanding our knowledge of ranaviruses (Duffus et al. 2015; Brunner et al. 2015; Jancovich et al. 2015b); however, more research is needed. Properly designed studies (Gray et al. 2015) are a first step to investigating hypotheses associated with ranavirus emergence. Use of appropriate diagnostic techniques is key to identifying ranavirus infections and determining the effects of infection on host species. Understanding the differential diagnoses for ranaviral disease is important, and combining infection data with pathological and environmental information is essential to confirm that ranavirus is the etiologic disease agent. In this chapter, we begin with an overview of the gross and microscopic lesions associated with ranaviral disease followed by a discussion of the current diagnostic tests in use by research and veterinary diagnostic laboratories worldwide. We point out the limitations of certain diagnostic techniques, and identify needed areas of improvement. Finally, we briefly discuss research into treatment and vaccine development for ranaviruses."
77,138,0.289,A Life Course Perspective on Health Trajectories and Transitions (Volume 4.0),"Previous Research on Health Inequalities and CF People with CF from more disadvantaged groups in the UK and US die earlier than those from more advantaged backgrounds. In the UK, the first study to look at social differences in survival in CF found a consistent trend from 1959 to 1986 towards higher age at death in CF patients in more advantaged social groups on the basis of occupational class (Britton 1989). The authors speculated that the observed lower survival chances in lower social classes could relate to lack of access to the appropriate services, poorer nutrition, increased parental smoking, and poorer quality housing. Evidence from the US corroborated these findings, and indicated higher survival rates in the 1980s and 1990s among more advantaged socio-economic groups, measured by Medicaid status and area-based income, compared with their less advantaged counterparts (Schechter et al. 2001; Schechter 2004; OâConnor et al. 2003). For instance the adjusted risk of death was around four times higher in CF patients with Medicaid cover (used as a surrogate for poverty) compared to those without Medicaid cover (Schechter et al. 2001). Two studies from the US showed differences in lung function on the basis of measures of SES. For instance Schechter et al. also showed significantly lower percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (%FEV1 ) at age 5 in the Medicaid patients (9.2 percentage points, 95 % CI 7.1â11.4), and this gap increased slightly in an age dependent manner up to age 20. OâConnor et al. extended the work of Schechterâs team by demonstrating a social gradient in the relationship between area-based income in the US, and mortality rates, lung function and weight (OâConnor et al. 2003). The authors point out the limitations of the ecological (area-based) measure of SES used in their analysis, and suggest that the associations observed may be due to poor adherence to medications, or local environmental conditions. In many chronic illnesses, differences in access to specialist health care by SES are evident. These differences often contribute to the exacerbation of health inequalities, since a bias towards more advantaged groups is widespread across health care (Stirbu et al. 2011). This could be particularly important in the context of inequalities in outcomes for a disease like CF, where treatment advances have had such a profound effect on survival. The studies exploring access to services and treatments in CF have been predominantly from the US, and have demonstrated a mixed picture, depending on the type of treatment under consideration, and the exact measure of SES used (OâConnor et al. 2003; Schechter et al. 2009, 2011). For instance, one study showed greater access to intravenous (IV) antibiotics for older"

The legal framework of human rights is understandably criticized as being too soft in its implementation and too individualistic in its orientation, approaching social justice and the advancement of minorities in terms of, for example, âaffirmative actionâ initiatives rather than by addressing the structural barriers faced by migrants. At the other extreme, efforts by states to administer migration policy regimes in a legal-technocratic manner have proved to be highly unsuccessful, as well as having negative consequences for migrants in terms of social justice. Whether framed by migrant advocates or government officials, narrow legalistic understandings of migrantsâ rights do not adequately address the social justice concerns of migrants. For example, relations of power as well as macro-economic policies tend to be much more significant for ensuring migrantsâ human security than the existence or non-existence of rights in 1.3.4"
386,17,0.289,Socioeconomics of Agriculture,"and lasting human bonds and trust. That was the case in the movement to found Kibbutzim in the early 20th century (Russel et al. 2011), as it is in todayâs attempts at community-supported agriculture (CSA; Henderson and Van En 1999; Cone and Myhre 2000; Schnell 2007). Both are examples where participants attempted to link agricultural production with the creation of social capital, with bridging and bondingâin the case of the Kibbutzim among Jewish settlers, in the case of CSA between producers and consumers. The dynamics of this arrow is often driven by vision, impressively described by Conway (2016): âPeople, when they come together, can share understandings and manage their resources by enforcing norms and rules of their own design! The unconventional idea in many quarters was that people could cooperate beyond markets and states.â C. Mergers, Acquisitions and Integration If there was one clear line in historic development of economic structures, it would be the enlargement of companies through mergers, acquisitions and other ways of integration, described as a âconsistent and growing part of the business landscapeâ (Schweiger and Goulet 2000: 61). That this enlargement of companies is an implicit step from interaction through markets to the strengthening of hierarchies, is often an overlooked aspect. The most visible case of this aspect is probably vertical integration. Prominent examples in the literature are the auto industry and the agri-food chain. Particularly in the United States, car manufacturers have chosen to skip market relations to part-makers, instead integration the companies into the car-producing firm (Blois 2014; Langlois and Robertson 1989). In the realm of agribusiness, poultry production is a case in point for similar decisions. Vukina (2001) explains the tendency for meat processors to use contract farmers by factors like risk-sharing, innovation dissemination, demand for uniform quality and access to capital. D. Outsourcing and âYou Inc.â Management scholars have advocated that companies should focus on their core competencies and purchase all others on the marketplace (Quinn and Hilmer 1994), leading to the outsourcing of company parts to a self-reliant entity. Quinn (1999) describes that this process has begun in the realm of physical support like parts, componentry and hardware subsystems, and is increasingly shifting to intellectuallybased resources which may be purchased more efficiently outside the company. In the extreme case, such processes lead to a situation where hierarchies are entirely replaced by market relations. Self-employment has become a societal trend and has spurred scientific discourses in two directions: in the Anglo-American world, advice has been given on how to turn this self-employment into economic success (Beckwith and Beckwith 2007). Under German conditions, the concept of the âIch AGâ has rather attracted concerns about precarious social conditions under which unprotected individuals may work (Sattelberger 2006; Keller and Seifert 2007)."

349,358,0.289,Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture,"et al. 2012; Duretz et al. 2011). These models are reasonable when evaluating the soil carbon sequestration potential at large scales or emissions of N2O from monoculture fields (Babu et al. 2006), or changes in herd management (Pathak et al. 2005; Bryan et al. 2013; Perlman et al. 2013) but perhaps less so when trying to characterize the GHG impacts of smallholder systems at the whole farm level or for landscape-scale accounting. Smallholder farming systems comprise multiple types of farming activities, often combining trees, animals, and crops in interconnected systems. Human management alters nutrient flows, potentially mitigating or exacerbating emissions from parts of the system; applying sectoral process-based models to whole farms therefore may oversimplify the complex interactions taking place (Tittonell et al. 2009). As of yet, few modeling approaches have been adapted for farm-level modeling of GHG impacts in mixed cropâlivestock systems (Schils et al. 2007; Groot et al. 2012; Del Prado et al. 2013) and to our knowledge none have been applied to smallholder conditions of tropical developing countries. To facilitate the widespread use of process-based models, as a first step the models need to be tested for most locations dominated by smallholder farming, which requires the availability of respective test datasets. Data on site-specific factors such as soil properties, cropping sequences, and fertilizer use are required; information which is often unavailable in many developing countries. In terms of enteric fermentation, the challenge is both a lack of information on animal numbers, species, and breeds, feeding regimes, as well as the quality of feeds and forages even though the models are based on the presumption that the chemical reactions that occur in the rumen are fairly standard and tend to go to completion. However, emission factors and rates currently available which have been obtained so far, donât consider that livestock production in developing countries often involves periods of severe undernutrition with feed qualities being far lower than tested in experiments in OECD countries. It is obvious that there is a great need to generate data that can be used for model parameterization and evaluation for smallholder conditions. Until now, only limited information has been available to independently assess the validity of the emission models for developing country conditions, casting doubt on the reliability of results generated from process-based models."
315,418,0.289,Situating Children of Migrants Across Borders and origins : a Methodological Overview,"we had planned. Taking the role of the narrator also provided the opportunity to show the material and let them comment on the photographs and the stories we had collected to complete the picture further. Recalling places, people, and memories provided a basis for asking about their perceptions of transnational spaces. The photographs helped the interviewees to remember stories and memories they had not told us before. For instance, the beach of Galicia (shown in Fig. 13.4) reminded the interviewee of the fact that he used to go there with his uncle and his cousin to search for crabs. Later, the aunt would cook them for dinner. As this story shows, the pictures and the accounts of the field trip in Spain helped to recall this imagined space that in migration research is called the transnational social space. Asking the interviewees how they perceived this space spared using the word or explaining the notion. Therefore, we drew a first sketch of Switzerland and Spain while talking about people here and there, about places visited, and about connections heard about. The drawing showed in a very simple way what we usually imagine when we talk about transnational social spaces: countries and places within, all connected through social networks. By drawing, we invited them to take a pen and draw their impression of how these connections and social formations could be conceptualized. The drawing (Fig. 13.5) shows the formation created by the transnational networks that link a family on various continents. In contrast to the geographical mapping we had sketched, the person who made this drawing completely changed the order of things. He placed the family in the core circle. Through their linkages, their practices such as calling, communicating through Skype, sending emails, visiting each other, or sending goods across the whole world to each other, they constituted an entity that holds together what is otherwise spatially disrupted. Because of modern communication and transportation technologiesâthey are symbolized by the time warp signs that connect instantly continents and countries as in a science fiction filmâthe distances become irrelevant.

223,29,0.288,Knowledge and Action (Volume 9.0),"two problems to cope with. First, the knowledge and experience necessary for solving a problem or making the right decisions to achieve a certain goal may be available somewhere in an organization, but it may not reach the people authorized to act on it. Second, the nodal points or authorized decision-makers may not have the prior knowledge, experience, and intuition necessary to understand and evaluate the importance of information that has been forwarded to them. Those who decide often not understand those who know. And those who know are often experts in narrow domains only or are not close to those in power. Weberâs (1922/1980) ideal bureaucracy rested on the principles of meritocracy and the absence of nepotism and incompetence. In that system the hierarchy of decision-making corresponded to a hierarchy of competence. High-ranking decision-makers were expected to have broader expertise and more experience than their subordinates; the superiors would at least be able to understand, evaluate, and embrace the information forwarded to them. In large and complex organizations, it happens quite frequently that line managers (immediate superiors) have achieved their position because of merits other than broad knowledge and expertise in a certain domain. In some political systems, ideological reliability and loyalty to a political party, ethnic group, or powerful network counts for more than expertise does when it comes to promotion to a high post. Even if managers understand the relevance and urgency of information, they may fail to draw the necessary practical consequences because they are indebted to a political party or a powerful person or are under pressure from their social environment. Organization theory, especially the research field following the tradition of Mintzberg (1979), and the geography of knowledge have an abiding interest in the organization and coordination of social systems in space and in the spatial concentration of jobs involving high levels of educational achievement and decisionmaking. Originally, region meant a space that was organized, coordinated, controlled, and influenced by a power center or a social systemâs authority (for details see Berthoin Antal, Meusburger, & Suarsana, 2014; Gottmann, 1980; Meusburger et al., 2015). Organization theory and the geography of knowledge have documented how the structure of a social systemâthe centralization or decentralization of decision-making authority, skills, and competence within an organizationâvaries with the complexity of its tasks and the uncertainty of its environment. In summary, a number of research fields have underlined the importance of an environment or spatial context and its possible impact on individual and collective action, but their strands of argumentation have seldom coalesced."
187,127,0.288,Managing The Complexity of Critical infrastructures : a Modelling and Simulation Approach (Volume 90.0),"2 Power Systems At the epicenter of the well-being and prosperity of society lie the electric power systems. Contemporary power systems are operated under heavily stressed conditions due the ever increasing electricity demand and deregulated electricity market. Maintaining the reliability and security of the power systems under such stressed conditions is challenging. The occurrence of severe faults and disturbances in the system needs to be detected timely, and necessary actions need to be taken. In order to prepare for faults or unexpected load changes, power system operators assess the stability of the power system by examining offline several scenarios. The transient analysis that is usually used in the power system control center enhances the situational awareness of the power system operators by providing a visualization of the generator rotor angles, bus voltages, and system frequency during large contingencies. Therefore, operators can plan a set of remedial measures to maintain the stability of the system. The electrical power system is typically divided in three main sections: the Generation in large power plants, the long distance Transmission network, and the Distribution grid. There are several software applications which study the power system and its multitude of components. Some of the most used physical simulators for power systems are described in this Section."
216,276,0.288,Advances in Production Technology,"systems has to be expanded by adaptive target systems and by reactive systems behaviour (Brecher 2014, p. 3). This requires each element of the production system, i.e. human, technology and organization, to have adaptive capabilities. According to Frank (2004), this means that each element repetitively performs these steps: 1. Analysis of the present situation, 2. Determination of systems objectives and 3. Adaptation of systems behaviour. Humans are standing in the main focus of this approach. Consequently, the interaction of humans, production technology and organization elements is a topic under comprehensive study. However, these studies focus mainly on cognitive processes (Brecher 2014, p. 65; Mayer 2012; Mayer et al. 2013). Among other things, in the interaction of humans and technology the conformity of technology behaviour with the human operatorâs expectations is in the focus of these studies (Mayer 2012; Mayer et al. 2013). On top of this, holistic inclusion of humans for the purposes of ergonomic and industrial engineering research also requires direct consideration of the physiological processes involved. This is necessary in order to reach the optimum degree of integration of humans into a production system as demanded by Brecher (2011, p. 796) and, in this way, achieve the required increases in productivity. One possible approach to the inclusion of physiological processes in production systems in real time is presented and its results are discussed below."
118,619,0.288,Reflections On The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident : Toward Social-Scientific Literacy and Engineering Resilience,"scientific analyses of radiation, reactors, and regulations. Starting off the program with these lectures implicitly communicated its priority to the students; it was important to know this information first. Throughout the day, the discussions considered how this kind of scientific information was and was not communicated to the public. Many engineers felt that it was their responsibility to do some of this public communicating and also to act as information gatekeepers. One student, for example, remarked that it was irresponsible to risk panic by releasing data to the public before professionals were able to act on it.3 Students also expressed that their role was to model and measure the available data in order to bound problems, but also expressed concerns about how and what to measure. The second day included lectures on the future of reactor design and on the ethics and âsafety cultureâ of nuclear power plants, which fueled a discussion about engineeringâs reliance on utilitarian reasoning. The first presentations from social scientists began midweek, in which new ways of thinking about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident were introduced. Students were asked to reconsider the challenges of building interdisciplinary awareness across engineering and the social sciences, but also across the more specialized fields within engineering and science (e.g., between nuclear engineers and climate scientists). The social scientists provided students with examples of how to study the institutional and organizational factors that are shaping the ongoing events at Fukushima, including the arrangements between regulatory bodies, industry, government, and academia. Instead of framing the accident in terms that are familiar to engineers, such as safety culture, students were encouraged to consider how social conditions and institutions had shaped the definition of safety. A historical perspective, for example, shows us that nuclear power is judged with great severity, in part because of the public fear of radiation. For this reason, analyses that compare the risks of nuclear power with those of motor vehicles or airplane crashes are not always meaningful. Looking back on the events surrounding 3 Mile Island reminds engineers that severe accidents will happen and that it is important to communicate about them openly and critically. After a day of social science immersion, students had an opportunity to begin in depth discussions with one another. This provided an important space for students to identify issues beyond their professorsâ gaze. For engineering students, this is a necessary exercise to facilitate a pedagogical shift away from lecturestyle learning, and to allow each student to develop a perspective and voice that is different than their professorsâ. A recent study of the undergraduate experience of engineers as compared to students in computer science, science, technology, math, arts and humanities, social sciences, business, and other majors determined that engineering students spend considerably more time preparing for class and have the highest number of credit hours, many of which are spent in lecture [21]. Engineering students quickly learn how to intake and apply the information from lectures wherein the focus is on finding the most efficient way to complete problem sets rather than critically engaging each professorâs views. 3 To protect the privacy of the Summer Schoolâs participants, comments are not linked with individuals."

106,63,0.288,Community-Oriented Policing and Technological Innovations,"Introduction It has been widely proven that in case of emergencies and crisis situations content published on social media platforms, such as Twitter, constitutes a valuable source of information. As stated in Imran et al. (2015), Twitter has been used in various crisis scenarios to identify events, monitor event progress, summarize tweets to give a situational overview and classify them to extract relevant content. In this paper we propose a social media monitoring and analysis framework that provides support to the security sector and is based on the needs of two running H2020-projects in the area of community policing and emergency response, CITYCoP and E2MC. CITYCoP, short for Citizen Interaction Technologies Yield Community Policing, aims at developing applications that facilitate community policing. One idea behind the project is to mine social media platforms to assess the perceived quality of life of the citizens. The purpose of the E2MC project, short for Evolution of Emergency Copernicus services, is to extend the available Copernicus Emergency Management System (EMS) that provides an early warning and rapid mapping services in case of emergencies. By integrating an analysis platform capable of extracting crisis-related information from social media, the quality of the delivered information should be improved and the speed in which the affected area can be located and damage can be assessed should be increased. The main problem we face in both use cases is to flexibly adapt to new scenarios and provide an analysis pipeline that can be operated"

A majority of the research on first- and second-generation residents is based on quantitative methodological designs that mainly focus on different aspects of their insertion into the host society. This type of research takes objective indicators as inspiration such as educational attainment, position in the labor market, social networks, citizenship and, level of proficiency in the host countryâs language. On the other hand, some studies use qualitative approaches to study the lives of descendants of immigrants. The aim of those studies is to understand peopleâs subjective evaluations of life events and trajectories. We think that both approaches study two sides of the same coin. The biographical approach and the life course perspective share many features. Both study the lives of individuals, groups or cohorts using retrospective or longitudinal methodological designs.

224,267,0.287,Ester Boserupâs Legacy on Sustainability : Orientations for Contemporary Research,"I think the basic gender differentiating perspective of Ester Boserup has been very fruitful for various pathways of engendering farming systems in addition to what can be called âfemale economyâ or âthe economy as a gendered structureâ (Cagatay et al. 1995). However, many arguments that refer to the âevolutionaryâ or factororiented analytical approach in addition to the lack of analysis of structural and power relations have been raised. The main critique of Boserupâs approach in the early 1980s (BenerÃ­a and Sen 1981) was directed at the neoclassical foundations as they lacked theoretical considerations and a foundation from a feminist and social science point of view. My view is that all of the debates resulted in very productive advancement in theoretical, empirical and activist work. The term âinvisible womanâ, which showed the marginalisation of womenâs activities in modernisation processes (commercialisation/market integration), was introduced by the first gender adviser of the World Bank (see Scott 1979) following Boserupâs work. This position was created in 1977 and was the starting point of transnational gender development policies (Lachenmann 1996) that have likely led to âmainstreaming genderâ, which is seen as requisite condition in development agencies and programmes. However, it has given transnational womenâs and feminist movements the opportunity to enter the transnational public sphere and pursue political and methodological struggles about âengendering developmentâ (Lachenmann 2008a). The appropriation of respective terms shows the loss of the meaning of the âempowerment of womenâ, a term that was introduced by DAWN Development Alternatives for Women for a New Era. The classical âWomen in Developmentâ and the later marginalised âGender approachâ have not led to fundamental changes (Molyneux and Razavi 2005). However, they have allowed for the engendering of debates and policies about gender orders, relations, constructs. Thereby, Boserupâs seemingly static concept of âwomenâs role in developmentâ, which is often still used without taking into account power relations and only looking at a quasi-natural division of labour, has been overcome. The first concept of âstrengthening womenâs role in developmentâ perpetuated this âsystem of ignoranceâ. The scapegoat of feminism"

376,816,0.287,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","from the socioeconomic system to the ecological systemâthis feedback may positively or negatively affect ecological vulnerability. We have added an institutional component to the model where the exposure term for the institutional subsystem is the vulnerability of the social subsystem. Vulnerability of the institutional subsystem feeds back to the socioeconomic and the ecological subsystems. Institutional components can be market structures, as when collapse of livestock enterprises led to restructuring of the regional livestock market in the 2012 drought in the USA. Institutional components involve government intervention as in the case with drought relief programs in the USA or national relief following dzud (severe winter weather disaster) in Mongolia. These interventions often do not reflect collective learning or desired collection action across the social and the institutional subsystems and thus may not facilitate resilient decision making at the enterprise or individual level (Thurow and Taylor 1999; FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez et al. 2012). As new markets, new government regulations, and climate change introduce new learning opportunities, vulnerabilities can arise at the household unit or livestock enterprise."
298,34,0.287,The Globalization of Science Curricula,"Robitaille et al. (2000) analyzed the changes that were made to science curricula in a wide range of countries following the publication of the TIMSS 1995 results. Countriesâ responses to their performance in TIMSS could be sorted into several broad categories (Table 2.1). For some high-performing countries, such as Japan, the TIMSS 1995 results had minimal impact on their science curriculum. Other countries, which performed reasonably well in TIMSS 1995, used the wide range of data reported in the study to modify speciï¬c aspects of their science curriculum. For example, in the Republic of Korea, the government reduced the overall content of the curriculum to address studentsâ negative attitudes to science, as reported in the TIMSS data. Both the Czech Republic and Latvia modiï¬ed performance expectations to promote the application of science and problem-solving skills. Kuwait introduced a module on environmental science and Romania reorganized its curriculum into a more coherent whole to improve studentsâ abilities to make connections between different curriculum areas. Some changes were more closely related to policy or application of policy than the speciï¬c curriculum. For example, Norway placed a much greater emphasis on strengthening the subject knowledge of teachers, whilst the Canadian province of British Columbia introduced new assessments for Grades 4 and 7, with about half of the assessment questions drawn from released TIMSS items. For several countries, a relatively poor performance in TIMSS 1995 acted as a direct prompt to institute signiï¬cant science curriculum change, in an attempt to improve their performance in future international comparison tests. In Iceland poor performance in TIMSS 1995 started a process of curriculum review where the TIMSS framework itself was used as a curriculum model, leading to an increase in the importance of science and mathematics teaching in Icelandic schools. Similarly, in Iran, poor results in TIMSS 1995 led to the identiï¬cation of factors that merited increased attention in the curriculum, prompting changes to the curriculum again based on the TIMSS framework. These increased the focus on scientiï¬c skills, as well as the cognitive demand of the curriculum, and extended curriculum coverage to include areas such as the environment."
170,204,0.287,Impact of Information Society Research in the Global South,"This is not to suggest that there is a sophistication to the unique study of mFinance. The theoretical models applied to garner understanding are borrowed from other disciplines, and the lack of consensus about the key factors may lead one to imagine that a number of factors are a major influence underlying adoption of mFinance. While such approaches may be an inherent characteristic of the academic approach, there is the potential and fairly serious risk of confusing practitioners and policymakers seeking to guide investment to initiatives that produce impactful results. From this review we consider two issues as significant. First, trust is highlighted as a mechanism factor that leads to adoption. As the poor relies more on physical money and face-to-face relationships and mediations to exchange money, issues of trust may be important for future research, to understand more of its functions and how to manage it. It is important to note how the literature reports that trust can be transferred, being this a remarkable feature to be applied by mFinance practitioners. Second, the review has come through interesting literature, discussing and deepening issues of affordability. Even though it is considered a main barrier for adoption, the literature shows that cost is relevant only for some groups, showing that the poor should be thought of as a heterogeneous group. That being said, it is the rare study that focused on the poor. Indeed, despite the rhetoric (potential is a term much associated in the literature with mFinance) and the related optimism, there is little evidence that mFinance has made a substantive impact on the well-being and empowerment of the poor. Certainly there is evidence that mobile phones are being widely accessed and used by the poor; the uptake of mFinance services is sketchy at best, with little conclusive evidence of their benefits to those at the bottom of the pyramid. Assessing the few papers that focus on outputs from the perspective of the ICT4D Value Chain (Heeks and Molla 2009), it appears to be that almost all the outputs may be categorised as outcomes of financial inclusion, cost savings and improved communication. Nonetheless, there is no study bringing evidence of net beneficial financial impacts, comparing regular finance services and transformational mFinance ones and balancing invisible costs to access the latter. In our opinion the next aims to be assessed in mFinance research projects should focus on development impacts as outlined previously in terms of capabilities and empowerment. Towards this end, the definition of impact has largely been examined within a financial lens, ignoring the changes that are wrought in individual and community contexts. As one example, broadening the impact of mFinance to encompass gender perspectives may contain revelations about the pressures being exerted upon traditional patriarchal structures by the access to savings, investment and entrepreneurship by women with mobile phones and the resultant fissures and power struggles that accompany such transformational social change. Alternative approaches may understand contributions to well-being, including the capabilities approach (Sen 2001) and sustainable livelihood framework, stressing social inclusion and development domains such as improvements in poverty alleviation, living conditions, education, health (World Economic Forum 2011)"
73,93,0.287,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"human and natural systems are inextricably coupled and engaged in continuous cycles of mutual inï¬uence and response. As a process rural design brings science to society and in doing so it can identify new research questions (Fig. 4.6). The 2014 International Conference on Peri-Urban Landscapes: Water, Food and Environmental Security was an exciting opportunity to dialogue about connections and how science and society can more fully interact for social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The authors of this book chapter believe that the Second International Symposium on Rural Design being planned to be held in Australia in the near future (the ï¬rst was held at the University of Minnesota in January 2010) can be an important follow-up to provide a strong evidence-based argument for political and policy changes impacting urban expansion at national, state, regional, and local levels in Australia and worldwide. Rural Design can integrate knowledge across disciplines, and while not directly engaged in research, rural designers can translate and apply research knowledge to the design process, helping bridge the gap between science and society, while improving the social, economic, and environmental conditions of human communities on Earth, as articulated by this diagram of the rural design process (Fig. 4.7)."
