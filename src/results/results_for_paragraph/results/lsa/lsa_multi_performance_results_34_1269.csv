The simulation is performed in the same conditions as Fig. 13.2. The profile of the SIIR curve in Fig. 13.2 looks the same as the curve in Fig. 13.3. Therefore, the cause of the discontinuous final size distribution is the division of the infection period into two stages, and the mobility of I has no effect on the discontinuity."

Table 13.14 illustrates a best effort test (error average 0.806) achieved with the aim of âcreating errors in cell (2,5) and minimising correct classifications in cell (5,5)â. As can be seen in Table 13.14, the desired effect is achievable, however, the consequence of the desired weakness in correctly classifying (5,5) produces more significant errors at both (5,3) and (5,8), which may be the ânext weakestâ points."

372,1642,0.442,Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy : Third Edition (Edition 3),"For longer baselines, other power laws will be more appropriate. With the frozen-screen approximation, the power-law exponent can be determined from the power spectrum of the fluctuations. An example is shown in Fig. 13.17 (see also Bolton et al. 2011). Thus, in extrapolating D+ .d/ from a singlespacing measurement, one does not have to depend on the theoretical values of the exponent of d but can use the measurements of D+ .&/ to determine the range and variation [see Eq. (13.108) and Table 13.2]. For the example shown in Fig. 13.17, the power-law slope for frequencies above 0.01 Hz is 2.5, slightly below the value of 8/3 or 2.67 predicted for Kolmogorov turbulence. The spectrum flattens at frequencies below 0.01 Hz because of the filtering effect of the interferometer. Fluctuations larger than the baseline, 100 m in this case, cause little phase effect. For the corner frequency fc D vs =d, the wind speed along the baseline direction can be inferred to be about 1 m s!1 . Table 13.4 shows a compilation of the measurements of the structure function referred to a baseline of 100 m. The range of values reported for a fiducial baseline"

For the experiment 1280 USPS training images only were used. Test data used included 8192 MNIST test images, 1024 USPS test images, and 4096 DIGITS test images. The results are shown in Tables 13.7, 13.8, 13.9, 13.10, 13.11 and 13.12 inclusive. Tables 13.7, 13.9, and 13.11 show the confusion matrix achieved using the standard classifier on MNIST, USPS and DIGITS test databases with average error rates 0.897, 0.957, and 0.692, respectively. These errors are contrasted with Tables 13.8, 13.10, and 13.12 which show the achieved error performance for test 6 using the new objective function on MNIST, USPS and DIGITS test databases with average error rates of 0.784, 0.893 and 0.538 respectively. As expected, test 6 resulted in some increase in the average errors in all cases. Notably, the misclassifications for each of these databases show significantly different characteristics to what is now seen trained on USPS data. Pivot points for the MNIST test are different to those earlier, now with confusions (7,2) and (6,4) as most significant. Pivot points for the DIGITS test have significant confusions (7,2), (9,3), (1,4) and (1,7). Examining the objective to minimise errors in row 7, this is demonstrated in all three cases. Error confusion (7,2) were reduced from 117 to 31, and 220 to 130 in the MNIST and DIGITS tests and remained the same at 2 for the USPS test. Errors for column 4 increased from 212 to 460 and 204 to 278 for MNIST and DIGITS tests, and from 3 to 20 for the USPS test. This largely fulfilled the aim of the test, however, there are several notable âsurprisesâ. Table 13.8 shows significant error increases for (0,2), (0,6), and (1,6) compared with Table 13.7. Table 13.12 shows significant error increases for (0,2), (2,6) and (4,9)."

In the left panel of Fig. 13.13, we show the open probability of the wild type (solid line), the mutant ( D 10), and the mutant in the presence of the theoretical open blocker. We see that the effect of the mutation is completely repaired by the drug. Other cases are shown in the center and right panels. The effect of the drug is still good but the effect of the mutation is not completely repaired. These observations are confirmed in Table 13.1. Furthermore, we have tested a large variety of parameters and the results we show here (center and right panels) represent the most difficult cases we could find in experiments. Therefore, we conclude that the theoretical open state blocker illustrated in Fig. 13.12 works very well."

The presence of epicardium on the outer face of the myocardial heart tube is confirmed. A pronounced subepicardium in the inner curvature of the looping heart tube at the site of the bulboventricular fold is confirmed, here referred to as epicardial cushion, being almost as elaborate as the adjacent endocardial atrioventricular and outflow tract cushions (Fig. 13.1a). In chicken (Fig. 13.2a, b) and mouse embryos, the presence of the (sub)epicardium is less extensive compared to the turtle. In human embryos at Carnegie stages, 11â15 (3.6â7 mm), the surface of the heart is closely covered by the epicardial epithelium, whereas the inner curvature harbours an extensive epicardial cushion (Fig. 13.1b) comparable to the turtle."

The values of $n and Ä±n are 1:44 "" 10!6 and 0:7 "" 10!6 , respectively. In the atmospheric windows above 400 GHz, where radio astronomical observations are possible only from very dry sites, the refractive index can be noticeably different from the value at lower frequencies. The normalized refractivity is shown in Fig. 13.9. Equation (13.68) is an important result of very general validity. We derived it from a specific model [Eq. (13.58)] that led to an approximately Lorentzian profile for the absorption spectrum. In practice, line profiles are found to differ slightly from the Lorentzian form, and more sophisticated models are needed to fit them exactly. However, Eqs. (13.68) and (13.69) could be derived from the Kramersâ Kronig relation. The low-frequency value of the index of refraction, as given by Eq.

291,65,0.386,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"6.2 Results Figures 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, 6.13, 6.14, 6.15, 6.16, 6.17, 6.18, 6.19, 6.20, and 6.21 (pages 46â65) depict Lexis diagrams of rates of mortality improvements (âROMIsâ), which are the time derivative of age-specific death rates. We argue that those maps are better able to illustrate mortality dynamics than the commonly used âheat mapsâ of mortality. We plotted our first ROMIs on the Lexis surface about 10 years ago (Rau et al. 2008). In the meantime, those plots have become more commonplace, especially among actuaries, to visualize mortality dynamics. Our method can be considered as a descriptive tool. It is able to detect the predominant dynamics of mortality (or of any other phenomenon measured on the Lexis surface). We think that those âROMIâ-maps provide better insights into mortality dynamics than standard surface maps but are equally intuitively understandable. During the 1950s, the first years of our observation period, survival improved tremendously especially for infants, children, and young adults. The most remarkable declines in mortality were recorded for Japanese females (Fig. 6.14, page 58). After the end of World War II, life expectancy in Japan was below the average of western European countries. According to data from the Human Mortality Database, life expectancy for Japanese females rose from 60.9 years in 1950 to 72.3 in 1963. Thus, life expectancy increased by almost 1 year within each calendar year during that time span! But also France (Fig. 6.9, p. 53), Italy (Fig. 6.13, p. 57), England & Wales (Fig. 6.7, p. 51) or the United States (Fig. 6.21, p. 65), to name only a few, gained several years of life due to mortality declines at younger ages."

291,127,0.385,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"The goal of this monograph was to show a variety of possibilities to visualize mortality dynamics on the Lexis plane. While we provided examples of raw and smoothed mortality surfaces, our focus was on visualizing rates of mortality improvement (âROMIsâ), i.e., the derivative of age-specific death rates with respect to time. We provided ROMI examples for national populations covered by the Human Mortality Database as well as for selected causes of death in the United States. These âROMI-plotsâ were quite instructive to detect period and cohort effects. We also illustrated how changes in age-specific mortality contribute to a gain (or loss) in life expectancy. In Chap. 9 we decomposed seasonal data for causes of death to investigate whether the seasonal pattern, measured via the amplitude and the peak moment (âphaseâ), has changed over or age. The previous chapter dealt with survival chances of persons who were diagnosed with cancer. Despite the large number of figures, our list is obviously not exhaustive; here we want to provide a few more two ideas how the Lexis diagram can be used to illustrate not only mortality dynamics. Figure 11.1 adapts our ROMI approach to fertility. The top panel contains a surface map of age-specific fertility rates in the eastern part of Germany. Birth counts and corresponding exposures by single year of age and calendar time were downloaded from the Human Fertility Database (2017). The estimates were (again) generated with Camardaâs R package for smoothing surfaces with P-splines"

Jeremy Kilpatrick states concerning the importance of this work: âDespite the many setbacks he encountered, no mathematician had a more profound influence on mathematics education as a ï¬eld of scholarship and practiceâ (p. 27). Apart from this thematic afternoon as distinctive feature of ICME-13, an extensive publication programme was implemented in order to develop a sustainable congress from an academic perspective. One of our aims with the publication of the ICME-13 Topical Surveys was to display the state of the art concerning speciï¬c mathematics educational themes in the style of independent handbook chapters. 26 ICME-13 Topical Surveys were published, and the important aspect of these Topical Surveys coming out before ICME-13 is that they were available as open access and hopefully formed the basis for many discussions at the congress. They displayed what we knew before the congress. The forthcoming post-congress monographs based on the papers presented within the framework of the topic study and discussion groups describe the academic outcome of ICME-13 in more detail and will hopefully contribute to a sustainable congress. It is our strong hope that ICME-14, which will take place in Shanghai in 2020, will be able to build its work on the insights achieved and published here and can thereby strongly foster the development of knowledge on the teaching and learning of mathematics on a higher basis. The aforementioned books from Felix Klein, Elementary Mathematics from a Higher Standpoint (2016), originated from lectures Felix Klein gave to prospective teachers. His desire in publishing these books was to develop the ability of the prospective teachers to use the rich mathematics they were learning at university as vivid stimulation for their own teaching afterwards. This strong tradition that shaped the German-speaking community has led to many activities in pre-service and in-service teacher education. During ICME-13, three days of German-language activities for teachers were conducted in which scholars participating in ICME-13 worked with practising teachers in workshops and lectures and offered them background knowledge or new teaching ideas. These activities for teachers were supported by the MNU - Verband zur FÃ¶rderung des MINT-Unterrichts (German Association for the Advancement of Mathematics and Science Education), a teacher community, which has supported ICME-13 from the very beginning. The ï¬nal characteristics of ICME-13 to be mentioned are the activities for early career researchers. Early career researchers are our future, because they have to shoulder the task to further develop the science of mathematics education and to implement these improvements at all educational levels. We have seen in the past a strong development towards higher quality standards of research. Publishing a study needs nowadays to fulï¬l many requirements concerning theoretical framework and methodology used. Furthermore, publications have become more and more important in the last years. Therefore, ICME-13 held an early career researcher day with 450 participants where thematic surveys were presented and"

291,42,0.334,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"3.1.2 Cause-Specific Death Counts in the United States The National Center for Health Statistics of the United States provides a unique collection: Individual death counts by sex, age at death, year of death, cause of death, and many more characteristics can be freely downloaded from its web page. The data are available since 1968 in annual files. Additionally, the website of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) provides data since 1959, which we used in our analyses. The last year in our analysis is 2014. With the exception of 1972, when only a 50% sample was taken, each file contains all deaths in the United States. In the analysis by cause of death in later chapters of this volume, we simply multiplied the number of deaths for a given age, sex, and cause in the year 1972 by a factor of 2. Causes of death are coded by the so-called âInternational Classification of Diseasesâ (ICD). Since its introduction in the late nineteenth century, the system has been revised at irregular intervals (MeslÃ© 2006). The tenth revision is currently used. During the first years of our analysis, ICD-7 was used. ICD-8 was in effect in the United States between 1968 and 1978, followed by ICD-9 from 1979 until 1998. Obtaining consistent time series of causes of death across ICD revisions requires meticulous work and care (e.g., MeslÃ© and Vallin 1996; PechholdovÃ¡ 2009). We therefore decided to use only very broad categories for causes of death and followed primarily the coding of Janssen et al. (2003) and of MeslÃ© and Vallin (2006a). Both papers include an appendix with detailed ICD codes across the four revisions required in our analysis. Table 3.2 is split into two halves. The upper panel provides the ICD codes we used to extract the causes of death, whereas the lower panel lists the number of deaths in absolute and relative terms for the selected causes by sex. Our database consists of more than 118 million deaths. Although we have selected very few causes, they account for about three quarters of all deaths (Category 13 âOtherâ is 23.75%). A bit more than 44% of all deaths classified as originating from circulatory diseases. In that category, heart diseases are about one third of all deaths for women and men alike. The almost 10 million deaths from cerebrovascular diseases between 1959 and 2014 represent about eight percent of all deaths. The most common cerebrovascular disease is stroke. Malignant neoplasms (âcancerâ) are the second largest chapter in the ICD. Regardless of sex of the decedent, about one in every fifth death belongs to that category. We"

The reactor pressure reversed to an increasing trend after the HPCI had been shut down, but the depressurization attempt by SRV manual open operation failed after all. The reactor pressure further increased and exceeded the DDFP discharge head, thus disabling the alternative water injection to the reactor. An attempt was made on-site to supply nitrogen gas to drive the SRV via the supply line, but it failed, because the valve on the supply line was an air-driven type and it could not be manually operated due to structural limitations. Further operation attempts also failed to start up the HPCI and RCIC: the HPCI failed due to battery depletion, and the RCIC failed because the turbine trip throttle valve was closed again by its trip mechanism. The measurement of reactor water level was interrupted at 20:36 on March 12 due to loss of power supply. When it was resumed upon recovery of power supply at about 04:00 on March 13, the fuel range water level indicators showed about TAF-2 m. Water injection by S/C spray was resumed by switching over the DDFP from the reactor water injection mode at 05:08 on March 13 in order to prevent pressure increases of the D/W and S/C. At 07:39 the spray lines were switched over from S/C to D/W and the S/C spray was terminated at 07:43. At 08:41 on March 13, the large S/C vent valve (air-operated) was opened and the configuration of the venting line was completed except for the rupture disc. At about 08:40 through 09:10 on March 13, the DDFP stopped the D/W spray and waited for the reactor depressurization by SRV manual open, and then switched to water injection to the reactor again. The reactor pressure, in the meantime, reversed to increase by the HPCI manual shutdown at 02:42 on March 13 and reached about 7 MPa[abs] at about 04:30, and stayed thereafter for about 5 h at about 7.0â7.3 MPa[abs].

291,83,0.324,Visualizing Mortality Dynamics in the Lexis Diagram (Volume 44.0),"change in life expectancy only due to the change in mortality at this given age x. The second part is the sum of an indirect effect and an interaction effect (Preston et al. 2001, p. 64). A geometric explanation might help to understand what is meant by this second component as it often appears to be confusing: Life expectancy can be interpreted as the area under the survival curve. In case of a decline in mortality at age x at time point t the survival curve at this age is higher than at time point t 1. This is meant by the direct effect. For the sake of simplicity, letâs assume that mortality only changed at age x. Nevertheless, the survival curve will be also higher at age x C 1: A survival curve where the survival at age x C 1 was at the same level as at t 1 would require an increase in mortality. This âwakeâ of a change in mortality at one age affecting the survival function at subsequent ages is estimated by the second component. We followed exactly the same procedure as in Chap. 5 to obtain the required death rates: Raw death rates, based on death counts and corresponding exposure times from the Human Mortality Database (HMD, 2017), were smoothed assuming Poisson distributed death counts using Camardaâs MortalitySmooth package (Camarda 2012, 2015). The life table functions lx , Lx , and Tx were estimated using the approach outlined in Chapter 3 of Preston et al. (2001). The values for ax , the mean duration lived at age x by those who died at age x, were taken from the HMD. While any kind of difference in calendar time could be used, we decided to estimate the age-specific contributions within an interval of ten years. I.e., we compared 1960 to 1950, 1961 to 1951, . . . . The years on the x-axis in Figs. 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, 8.12, and 8.13 refer to the latter time point. Thus, the values at any age x in year 1980 denote the contribution of changing mortality at age x between 1970 and 1980. The choice of a ten year difference is, of course, arbitrary but it allowed us also to express the contribution in âmeaningfulâ units: We used days and weeks andâin exceptional cases of substantial improvements or deterioriation in survivalâmonths. The surface maps were plotted using a terrain color scheme: Green indicates moderate contributions to life expectancy. When the color turns to brown, that age alone contributed at least one week to the increase in life expectancy during the decade of observation. Very bright brown areas depict contributions of one month or more. Blue colors denote negative contributions. Just like deeper shades of blue suggests lower depths below sea level on geographic maps, they indicate here changes in age-specific mortality that bring life expectancy down. Again, we have not included the whole set of countries from the HMD but rather a subset of countries with rather peculiar features, which we already pointed at in previous chapters."

Beyond this dimension, the fluctuations in the path lengths become uncorrelated. First, consider an interferometer that operates in the domain of baselines shorter than dm . The measured visibilities Vm are related to the true visibilities V by the"
186,106,0.317,Dignity in The 21St Century : Middle East and West,"According to Kant, âthe dignity of humanity consists in just this capability, to be universally legislatingâ (Kant 1997: 46 [4:440]). Ideally, all human beings would have this capability and therefore the entire species would be blessed with dignity. If this were the case, the only criterion needed for the conferment of dignity would be to be born of human parents. As soon as we saw a fellow human, we would see a carrier of dignity from birth to death. This is what the constitutions quoted previously (Table 2.2) suggest. But not all human beings have the capacity for rational decision-making and autonomy that Kant requires. Kant â¦ [insisted] that persons are ends in themselves with an absolute dignity who must always be respected. â¦ [But] while all normally functioning human beings possess the rational capacities that ground respect, there can be humans in whom these capacities are altogether absent and who therefore, on this view, are not persons. â¦ (Dillon 2014)"
311,586,0.314,The Physics of the B Factories,"where R is the radial parameter of the decaying meson and typically takes values between 1 and 5 (GeV) . In this prescription, F is normalized so that F = 1 for qr = qab . While the P - and D-waves of the decay amplitude are usually well described using a certain number of BW or GS propagators, the actual number depending on the speciï¬c decay, the S-wave typically contains a number of broad overlapping states, for which the isobar model gives a poor description. In that case, more complex alternatives have been adopted, which are reviewed in Section 13.2.2. Figure 13.2.1 illustrates how various intermediate twobody states appear in the Dalitz plot. Unlike the uniform distribution of the phase-space decay (Fig. 13.2.1(a)), scalar resonances appear as bands in the Dalitz plot, as shown in Fig. 13.2.1(b-d) for resonances in bc, ac, and ab channels, respectively. Angular distributions for vector and tensor intermediate states introduce characteristic nonuniformity of the event density along the resonance bands (Fig. 13.2.1(e,f)). Finally, the region where the amplitudes of two resonances overlap is sensitive to the phase diï¬erence between the two amplitudes (Fig. 13.2.1(g,h)). 13.2.2 K-matrix formalism The complex S-wave dynamics, which can also include the presence of several broad and overlapping scalar resonances, can alternatively be described through the use of a K-matrix formalism (Chung et al., 1995; Wigner, 1946) with the production vector (P-vector) approximation (Aitchison, 1972). Within this formalism, the production process described by the P-vector can be viewed as the initial formation of several states, which are then propagated by the K-matrix term into the ï¬nal state that is observed. This approach ensures that the two-body scattering matrix respects unitarity, which is not guaranteed in the case of the isobar model. At the B Factories this approach is most commonly used to describe the Ï + Ï â S-wave contribution to the Dalitz-plot amplitude, e.g. in the BABAR analyses (Aubert, 2008l, 2009h; del Amo Sanchez, 2010a,b) and Belle analysis (Abe, 2007b). In such cases the amplitude is given by Au (s) ="

With tabulate, we can specify the length of the output vector (the number of bins, nbins), but we need to make sure it is long enough, because overruns will be ignored without warning. We also need to remember to add 1 to the random integers generated, so that the zeros are counted rather than ignored. From what we have seen (above), it looks as if 30 bins should work well enough, so here are six realizations with nbins=30: tabulate(rnbinom(100,1,0.2)+1,30) [1] 21 14 10 8 10 6 11 [1] 21 14 13 7 6 10 10 [1] 25 13 16 8 5 7 4 [1] 22 21 12 13 8 5 3 [1] 18 10 13 11 12 6 5 [1] 26 15 9 12 4 7 7"
