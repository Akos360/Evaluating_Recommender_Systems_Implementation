246,312,0.438,Rewilding European Landscapes,"Ever since the creation of national parks and other large-scale nature conservation efforts, the principal objectives of conservation, science, and recreation are bound together in an ever-changing interrelated triangle. Their dependencies, benefits and tensions are in a constant flow, often defined by financial contexts (Kupper 2009). This is also discernible in the current European situation of dwindling subsidies and uncertain finances for nature conservation, which calls for conservation activities that generate revenues to achieve economically sustainable conservation. Several actors in European wilderness conservation are adopting conservation strategies that aim to achieve economic sustainability. For instance, Rewilding Europe included wilderness-based entrepreneurship in their main objectives (see Chap. 9), and the NGO Wild Europe (wildeurope.org) launched an economic benefits group in 2013 to stimulate âa new breed of wilderness warriorâ. Due to the rise of these new European wide conservation initiatives there is a need to train students and professionals in wilderness entrepreneurship. Nature conservationists are traditionally not trained in entrepreneurship and business development as it is often assumed that professions related to nature conservation are principally guided by ecological and sustainable principles. Those fields therefore define the educational design of nature conservation curricula. This chapter describes an exploration into this new field of education in the context of rewilding European abandoned agricultural land."

169,698,0.418,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"pillars: sustainable water management, urban and industrial water stewardship, climate change adaptation, and habitat and biodiversity conservation. Implemented across seven districts of Uttar Pradesh with a geographical focus on the 300 km stretch of the Ramganga (Kalagarh to Hardoi) and the 900 km stretch of the Ganga (Bijnor to Varanasi), this program envisions Ganga and Ramganga as healthy river systems rich in biodiversity and aims to provide long-term water security to communities, businesses, and nature. This builds on WWF-Indiaâs work in the Ganga basin since 1997 with conservation of aquatic biodiversity and the Living Ganga Program (2007â2012), which developed strategies for sustainable energy and water resource management in a critical stretch of 800 km from Gangotri to Kanpur. To restore the ecological health of the rivers, the program works with a diverse range of stakeholders across academia, government institutions, policy makers, civil society members, local communities, and businesses to implement its multidisciplinary conservation strategy. The involvement of various partners, including religious leaders, government departments, and NGOs, in the project, the improvement in the livelihood of the local people, and the riverine habitat have provided additional acceptability for WWF-Indiaâs work. Awareness of the local community toward the environment has helped greatly in motivating the community to work for conservation and climate change adaptation. Studies on water availability and water quality in the Ganga and Ramganga Rivers are being carried out in order to understand the factors determining the ï¬exibility and resilience of ecosystems, including the habitat preference of species, river connectivity and quality, ï¬ow regimes, disturbances, and mortality of the aquatic biodiversity, especially of Ganges river dolphins, gharials, and freshwater turtles. Under the RfLLfR program, the development of a data base and research through GIS and remote sensing is an extremely valuable asset that will support further research and will help to formulate adaptation strategies where required, with the long-term goal to save the ecosystem. The lessons learned from WWF-Indiaâs intervention, particularly its strategy with regard to garnering support from the local communities, has been widely disseminated and accepted by the government and local people as a replicable model."
364,454,0.405,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"designated either as Urbanization-Restricted Areas or Agriculture Promotion Areas. However farmlands and forests in the Kanagawa region are rapidly decreasing due to urbanization and industrial development. In the areas closest to the urban districts the encroachment of housing and manufacturing damages the landscape of rural areas. Inside satoyama areas aging farmers give up farming and forestry and their children move away to work in offices. This results in the devastation of rural landscapes. To save satoyama areas from this deterioration the Kanagawa Prefectural Government enacted a bylaw in 2007, and this was followed by the Satoyama Conservation Action Plan in 2009. The Satoyama Conservation Bylaw aims to enrich peopleâs wellbeing by developing the multiple functions of satoyama in Kanagawa. Satoyama have a multifaceted significance, providing seasonal scenery, biodiversity, cultural heritage, fresh air, safe food, disaster relief, etc. The bylaw underscores the role of community and municipal government in the conservation of satoyama landscapes. It is the prefectural government that selects âSatoyama Conservation Areasâ and accredits âSatoyama Conservation Partnership Agreementsâ between landowners and local action groups. The prefectural government provides financial and technical assistance for local action groups, who purchase grass cutters and chainsaws using subsidies. The Agriculture Division of Kanagawa Prefectural Government hosts programs to raise public awareness of satoyama among people of different generations, including farming experience programs for school children, satoyama symposiums, and other initiatives. In the Action Plan the prefectural government set the goal of selecting 16 conservation areas and 20 partnership agreements by 2013. By 2012 13 areas had been designated as Satoyama conservation sites and 14 local action groups had established Satoyama Conservation Partnership Agreements to engage in satoyama conservation activities (see Fig. 20.1). They range from the smallest Ishikawa-Maruyama area (12 ha) to the largest Kuno area (2,800 ha). The larger areas include mountain forests, while farmlands are relatively modest in size and divided into small plots. Some mountain forests are the common property of landowners. Based on the established partnership agreements, action groups borrow the abandoned farmlands and forest from the landowners to rehabilitate them for use (see Fig. 20.2). Besides the rehabilitation of farmlands and forest, local action groups have utilized the resources of satoyama landscapes in different ways as shown in Table 20.1. The most popular activity is environmental education. Local action groups invite school teachers and students to their satoyama areas to provide a âfieldâ for the study of nature and biodiversity. There is a growing interest in a âhands-onâ approach to environmental education among school teachers, and satoyama offer them the ideal opportunity for this. In some areas action groups hold various events with the local neighborhood organizations to teach traditional knowledge and cultural heritage such as traditional cooking, toys, and crafts to small children. In the Kuno area of Odawara City the action group invites children and their parents living in the city center to plant soba (buckwheat) as shown in Fig. 20.3. After planting the soba a member of the action group plays educational nature games with the children to teach them the various species of insects."

246,319,0.386,Rewilding European Landscapes,"retirees were encountered. Meetings with various local stakeholders were organized to discuss the problems and possible alternatives for regional development and nature conservation. Among stakeholders were: the NGOs responsible for the local nature reserves and Rewilding Europe; mayors of Portuguese and Spanish villages; the president of a hunting association, local entrepreneurs such as producers and retailers of cheese, jam, almonds, wine, and Iberian pig meat products; and the owners of a bar and a bed & breakfast. The main assignment for the IP students was to explore economic dynamics that could contribute to the ecological restoration and future wilderness in the region. In groups of three to four, they articulated a vision for the region, together with a business model that would give both the ecological system and the local community new perspectives. Many of the business models that students produced were in the tourism sector, which is in line with what Rewilding Europe promotes in this region (see Chap. 9). Some student groups perceived the lack of publicity for the area as its main problem. Therefore, they came up with a web portal for local (tourism) enterprises and a marketing brand for the whole region. They also came up with models to expand the local variety of tourist activities. One group proposed to diversify the local economy by introducing a snail farm from which part of the profits would go to nature conservation and education. Two groups proposed ideas to stimulate the use of land, which would perhaps only fit with Rewilding Europeâs vision for the area if these activities were outside of a core wilderness area. One of these groups launched the idea for an organization that could bring conservation volunteers from all over the world to Western Iberia to help maintain the agricultural production on some of the terraces. Another group proposed a company that mediates between local communities and businesses new to the area to smoothen the purchase of land. A final business model introduced the concept of small self-sustaining office units in the landscape to rent to people who would like work in a sustainable office with a great view for inspiration. During a âmarket presentationâ, which was open to the public, students shared their visions and business models with local stakeholders and interested community members (Fig. 10.3). One of the IP students arranged during the IP her return to the region to conduct a MSc thesis research project on the use of social learning to increase levels of local involvement (Leuvenink 2013). Another MSc student helped organize the IP as an internship assignment and stayed in the region after the IP to conduct an analysis of the relation between Rewilding Europe, the Portuguese conservation partner ATN, and the local population (Walet 2014)."
364,181,0.375,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"produced intensive mapping of forest resources and instituted forest patrols to prevent illegal logging and charcoal production. Also, the group initiated tree-planting activities in degraded mangrove areas. Over time, some stands have begun to regenerate naturally. Since 1993, the Pred Nai initiative has focused on the sustainable management of marine resources and ecological monitoring within the mangrove forests. In 1997, the group introduced some regulations on crab harvesting. These rules specified the suspension of harvesting during the crab breeding period in October (UNDP 2012). In parallel with the conservation activities, the PNCFG also initiated a village community fund with the help of a local monk, primarily with the objective of introducing the concept of financial sustainability of community initiatives. Under this initiative, the villagers were encouraged to save part of their income and earn some interest, while at the same time keeping the savings within the village so that the funds could be loaned to other needy households. Later, this initiative won the support of government agencies and NGOs, obtaining donations from international agencies and local institutions such as the Social Investment Fund (SIF), the Thailand Research Fund, the Education Institute, and even from political parties. The village common fund has total savings of more than THB 3 million at present, and regularly receives contributions from crab catchers, local traders, and also from agroâtourism activities, and thus it is sustained year after year (Silori et al. 2009). Over nearly three decades the capacity of the PNCFG has been strengthened through various training programs provided by many organizations. RECOFTC has been one of the key organizations among these. It has been associated with the PNCFG since 1999 and helped to promote the PNCFGâs outreach to communities both within and outside of Thailand. It has also encouraged the exchange of ideas about sustainable utilization of natural resources among the villagers. As a result, the PNCFG has taken the lead in building a network of more than 20 villageâlevel community forestry groups along the four provinces at the eastern seaboard of Thailand to manage mangrove resources. Not only this, but Pred Nai has also received international attention for its contributions in the community forestry sector. Besides attracting a number of study tours from many countries, the PNCFG received the Green Globe Award in 2001 and was nominated for the Equator Initiative award in 2004 (Senyk 2005). According to the villagers, the capacity of the PNCFG to manage the resources, regulate their access and use, and resolve conflicts has increased. At the same time, the relationship with the key government departments, such as the Department of Fisheries, the Tambon (Sub district) Administrative Office (TAO), and the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources (DMCR) has improved. Villagers interact regularly during monthly village meetings. Awareness of the importance of mangrove forests and their conservation has been raised. Also, key government officials are involved in formal and informal village meetings and capacity building activities, and help in conflict negotiations, if any. There can be no doubt that the conservation efforts of the Pred Nai villagers and the PNCFG have had a direct impact on restoring biodiversity, alleviating poverty, and facilitating local economic development. The chief biodiversity impact has been the restoration and protection of 1,920 ha of coastal mangrove forest (UNDP 2012). This substantial regeneration of mangrove forest cover has enabled the return"

The site was built by the Umayyad prince Walid b. Yazid during the caliphate of his uncle Hisham, probably between 730 and 743 AD (111â125 H.), and its interior walls are covered by mural paintings. I explore how archaeology and conservation have contributed or interfered with the understanding of the monument, and how authenticity can be deï¬ned in a site that has seen at least three major conservation interventions. It will also discuss whether the paintings can really be deï¬ned as âIslamic Art,â ï¬tting a narrative of royal power that uses symbols and iconographies that are borrowed from the cultures that preceded the arrival of Islam in the region.

Relevance, legitimacy, and transparency are considered key aspects for the acceptance and implementation of scientific results (Meinke et al. 2006). Before modelling efforts are started, existing knowledge should be examined to determine whether it is sufficient to support decisions and how the existing information can be translated to the relevant decision-making context. Modelling efforts use a lot of valuable resources for data acquisition, processing, model development, calibration, and validation. Usually these resources can be acquired in relation to research projects, but the limitation of resources must be considered if modelling approaches and procedures are transferred to a permanent task like conservation management. In the field of conservation management resources, whether manpower or budget, are chronically scarce and their use must yield the best possible output. Consequently, it is crucial to move modelling work beyond pure prediction (Dawson et al. 2011) and strengthen its integration in risk assessment, protocols of screening and monitoring, and integrated management in protected areas (Bellard et al. 2012). If modelling is to be integrated in management it must be based on an evaluation of the information need in protected areas. An assessment of its use in the management process must be done in order to guarantee maximum usability. The discussion of modelling goals and expected results will also guarantee the relevance and legitimacy of modelling endeavours. There is no doubt that modelling can provide various benefits for conservation management; however, the objectives of nature conservation need to be considered in modelling design, development, and presentation of results. Modelling for conservation management can be useful to: â¢ Structure the discussion about problems at hand and help develop hypotheses on consequences. â¢ Identify driving forces and hot spots where action is needed. â¢ Provide efficient and effective indicators to identify and monitor changes. â¢ Identify critical changes and thresholds to trigger action. â¢ Illustrate consequences of management options."
329,167,0.368,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"aS national exPeRt The founder of Coral Triangle Center (CTC), an Indonesian organization at the forefront of domestic efforts to drive sustainable use of marine resources, is one case in point. Rili Djohani worked for the World Wildlife Fund in developing its marine conservation portfolio and joined the Indonesian branch of The Nature Conservancy to help establish its coastal and marine programs, including one in Bali. From 2004 to 2008 she was TNCâs country director for Indonesia with responsibility for forest and coastal management. However, international NGOs in Indonesia cannot raise money inside the country, which for Djohani limited their ability to be self-sufficient and truly responsive to domestic needs. With the support of prominent backers with a concern for the environment, the Coral Triangle Center headquartered in Bali was established. Indonesian businessman George Tahija and diplomat and government veteran Hasyim Djalal were founding directors, alongside Made Subadia, a top Indonesian conservation official. Djohaniâs expertise and ability to represent domestic interests in international circles quickly raised CTCâs profile as the national authority on issues of marine conservation.

246,123,0.346,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The Current Status of Populations Europeâs large carnivores are currently distributed among 42 nations, each with unique cultural values for biodiversity and different legal platforms for conservation. This cultural, political, and legal diversity within Europe presents major challenges for the conservation of internationally listed species, which often exist in transboundary populations that fall across several international jurisdictions. Management fragmentation is made worse by the fact that many European countries (e.g. Austria, Spain, Germany) are federal countries where responsibility for nature conservation has been decentralised to many sub-national jurisdictions. Large carnivores have all the characteristics of species that are difficult to manage at the scale of Europeâs small administrative units: they live at low densities (typically less than 3/100 km2), have home range size up to 1000 km2 and dispersal distances of more than 1000 km (Linnell and Boitani 2012). In an attempt to facilitate carnivore management at the appropriate scale of biologically meaningful units instead of administrative compartments, the European Commission approved a set of âGuidelines for population level management plansâ (Linnell et al. 2008) and identified the main populations across the continent. The populations were identified based on several criteria such as the discontinuity in distribution, geographic features, the speciesâ dispersal distance and the ecological and management contexts. Out of 30 populations (see below), only four occur within a single country and some span up to eight countries. Kaczensky et al. (2013) recently reviewed the conservation status of the European large carnivores in 2012 using data collected by a network of experts across Europe. The following sections are drawn from their report."

282,73,0.338,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. (Hamilton et al. 1992, Federalist No. 51) Next to periodic elections, Madison proposed âchecks and balancesâ between different government departments as effective mechanisms of control. His claim that governments need to be controlled has been accepted by most subsequent political thinkers. The bulk of the debate has not centred on whether or not accountability is necessary but on which accountability mechanisms are most effective. Standard debates in the normative and comparative political science literature, for example, tackle questions such as which electoral system best enables citizens to express their preferences and control parliament and the executive; how elements of direct democracy can strengthen citizen control; whether federal or centralised, presidential or parliamentary systems are best suited to create accountability while allowing for an effective system of government; and what role independent government agencies play to strengthen or weaken accountability.53 More recently, the tone of this debate has changed. Rather than exploring how the public sector can be controlled most effectively, a range of authors now focus on the negative side effects of existing accountability mechanisms. The predominantly procedural controls, so the argument goes, stifle creativity and discourage public officials from taking risks. As a result, public services are often inefficient. Despite this critique, however, these authors do not simply demand the abolition of existing accountability structures. Rather, they advocate the adoption of different kinds of accountability mechanisms. The New Public Management literature,54 which is at the forefront of this debate, for example, demands replacing procedural accountability with accountability for outcomes. Christopher Pollitt summarises the New Public Management proposals as follows: Responsibility is to be decentralized, targets â not procedures â are to become the key focus for public officials, costs will be cut, bureaucracy eliminated, standards raised, and service to the citizen-customer thrust to the foreground of concern. (Pollitt, 1995, p. 203) Even among the critics of the standard accountability arrangements of governments it is thus widely accepted that a âgoodâ form of government is an accountable one because this protects citizen rights and ensures that officials respect their duty to act in the best interest of citizens.

169,807,0.338,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"27.5.2 Socioeconomic Factors Inï¬uencing Fishery Sustainability As previously noted, SUSFISH was founded in recognition of the history of failure of development projects grounded only on technical and/or scientiï¬c advances. In BF alone we found examples of failure to adopt modernizing technology in the form of abandoned equipment and infrastructure (ï¬sh ponds, refrigerators, ï¬sh weighing scales, ï¬sh shops). For that reason SUSFISH sponsored research into the social, economic, and political barriers and bridges the gap to sustainable ï¬sheries. Our research indicates that, while some encouraging examples exist, there are abundant barriers to sustainable ï¬sheries provided by challenges of governance at multiple levels in BF. Our results conï¬rm that ï¬sh size and ï¬sh community diversity are associated with the degree and quality of management, both of ï¬sheries directly and of the habitat surrounding the ï¬shery. For example, the Nazinga site has relatively unimpacted habitat (land management) and has a closed ï¬shing season that is well-regulated (ï¬sheries management), and it has signiï¬cantly larger ï¬sh and a higher share in adult ï¬sh than any other sampling site. Furthermore, both ï¬sh and BMI diversity are higher in protected areas, e.g., Nazinga, Mare aux Hippo than in others. Just as important to biodiversity conservation as the legal content of policy is its execution at the appropriate level (subsidiarity) by well-organized and led local actors. For example, in Moussodougou the ï¬sheries are directly controlled by a local association that effectively enforces rules. Situations with effective management are associated with an increased biomasses and abundance with large ï¬sh specimens. A prominent overarching challenge is that it appears that ï¬sheries management is not equally applied all over BF but is concentrated in a few large reservoirs of ânational economic interest,â e.g., Ziga, Bagre, Kompienga, and Sourou. Fishing in these large water bodies is dominated by commercial ï¬shermen, who are regulated and in good communication with government ofï¬cers. However, elsewhere in BF communication is not so good for management organs devoted to smaller reservoirs, except for four ï¬shing concessions given to the associations of the local ï¬shermen (Bapla, Moussodougou, Tandjari, and Lera). Aside from these few examples of successful organization of local management capacity, for the most part, there are gaps between national and lower levels of governance. Brieï¬y, a governance system that effectively functions from the central, national level out to the regional and local levels has yet to be established. Often the link between law and practices to monitor ï¬sheries is missing (law is not adopted in practice). Therefore there is little effective police monitoring or enforcement of ï¬shing practices at the lower levels, e.g., smaller-scale ï¬sheries. While efforts to decentralize management authority have been underway for years, the failure to comprehensively bridge institutions from national to local levels is hampered by the frequency of shifts of governance responsibilities (institutional nomadism) for ï¬sheries management at the national level. One salient example of the poor communication that results from such âadministrative ï¬uxâ is the general"

Inversely, the lower the level of government, the more difficult it is to effectively address water governance problems, in particular those that are not strictly local, without having the big picture. Stakeholder engagement can provide platforms to address the mismatch between administrative and hydrological scales. Water-related projects and policies can be driven by local livelihoods tied to local ecosystems or by energy producers making long-term production and investment choices at the national level. Thus, some stakeholders promote hydrological scales that correspond to manageable units in which they operate (e.g. river basin organisations). Others promote conventional administrative levels, arguing that this is where capacity, accountability and legitimacy already exist. In the Great Lakes region of North America, multilevel engagement processes on water resource management between the province of Ontario, municipalities, local NGOs and First Nation communities led to the formulation of common policy directions and long-term strategies for water protection. Fitting stakeholder engagement to place-based needs can help reconcile decisions within and across spatial scales."

In conclusion, neutrino masses are believed to be small because neutrinos are Majorana particles with masses inversely proportional to the large scale M of energy where L non-conservation is induced. This corresponds to an important enlargement of the original minimal SM, where no R was included and L conservation was imposed by hand (but this ansatz would be totally unsatisfactory because L conservation is true âaccidentallyâ only at the renormalizable level, but is violated by non-renormalizable terms like the Weinberg operator and by instanton effects). Actually, L and B non-conservation are necessary if we want to explain baryogenesis and we have Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) in mind. It is interesting that the observed magnitudes of the mass-squared splittings of neutrinos are well compatible with a scale M remarkably close to the GUTpscale, where L non-conservation is indeed naturally expected. In fact, for mÄ  Âm2atm  0:05 eV (see Table 3.1) and mÄ  m2D =M with mD  v  200 GeV, we find M  1015 GeV which indeed is an impressive indication for MGUT .

There is still a lack of transfer from existing scientific knowledge into conservation strategies and measures. Especially, the social effects of climate change and their impact on conservation management are not well addressed, even though they frame its decision context (Heller and Zavaleta 2009). Most of the available concepts and guidelines for the adaptation of conservation management are lacking connection to local strategies and actions. There is an urgent need for more science-practice partnerships to identify strategies that are robust to uncertainty deriving from climate projections and their ecological consequences. In addition, easy applicable tools are needed that provide no-regret options for adaptation, based on available scientific information. The adaptation of conservation management is a huge task and has to overcome multiple challenges on local level: â¢ The lack of resources: local conservation management is chronically scarce of resources like budget and manpower. New challenges like climate change are therefore hard to tackle. â¢ The lack of expertise in adaptation issues: on a local level there might be several experts trained to identifying effects of climate change, but only few are trained in adaptation issues. â¢ The lack of guidance to find suitable data and methods: in the last years an overwhelming amount of data and information on climate change and its effects has become available. A plethora of approaches and data has been published making it hard to identify relevant information and useful methods. â¢ The lack of suitable monitoring methods: signals of local climate change and its effects are hard to distinguish from the noise of natural dynamics. Robust methods helping to disentangle the web of pressures like land use and climate change are still rare. â¢ The lack of management methods: conservation experts in the field need simple, applicable tools and guidance for decision support in everyday management of conservation sites. They need methods to identify climate change related conflicts, to identify robust adaptation strategies, to choose suitable management measures, and to prioritise action. â¢ The lack of tools for communication and awareness raising: effective adaptation of conservation management needs to build public, as well as political, support for local adaptation activities. Tools for communication and participation are needed to foster environmental education, to illustrate effects of climate change, to show the relevance of adaptation measures, to guide autonomous adaptation of other land users, and to include stakeholders and the wider public in the adaptation process. Despite the existing gaps and challenges, local conservation management cannot hesitate to take action and must proceed in the face of considerable uncertainty (Conroy et al. 2011)."
284,118,0.333,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"and Natural Resources, the objective of which is to âassociate the conservation of natural capital with economic and social developmentâ (OCDE, 2013: 40). The dual process involved in the recognition of indigenous knowledge has thus been made part of the development pattern for agricultural and environmental policies. In this dual ministerial context, the Mexican Government undertook the task of integrating the participation of the native and peasant population into its agricultural policy and also into its political agenda, thereby institutionalizing national environmental policy. The Ministry of the Environment has conï¬rmed that âthe native populations that maintain a very close link with natural resources and biodiversity actively support sustainable development through on-site conservation of ecosystems and natural habitats, and the maintenance and recuperation of viable populations of species in their natural surroundingsâ.15 In 1997 the Ministry of the Environment initiated the Conservation and Restoration Programme of soils. In 1998 it launched the National Reforestation Programme and other programmes that sought to combine economic and social development with environmental conservation. The objective was to devote economic resources to National Protected Areas and to the restoration of regions identiï¬ed as priorities from an environmental perspective. The main tools that the government has used have always been aimed at the conservation of biodiversity and of forests, in accordance with the National Strategy for Biodiversity (2000), complemented by the Mexican Strategy for the Conservation of Plants (which has existed since 2008 and was revised in 2012) and subsequently enhanced by the National Strategy combating invasive species. Major programmes within this framework have been speciï¬cally dedicated to native and peasant populations. A twist was introduced, however, when the Ministry of the Environment developed its Regional Sustainable Development Programme (Programa de Desarrollo Regional Sustentable (PRODERS)) in an attempt to link the environmentalist vision to a developmentalist one. The programme was presented as a comprehensive initiative by means of which SEMARNAT contributed to the support of sustainable development in poor rural regions. These regions often include native and peasant populations who live where the major biological and environmental riches are located, far from the rural nodes. The management of this programme was supposed to be decentralized and participative, based on a long-term vision (Toledo and Bartra, 2000)."
320,502,0.33,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"(Smit and Pilifosova 2001). Adaptation of conservation management means adjustments in management practices, decision-making processes and organisational structures (Welch 2005). Although the adaptation process should be started now, it must be planned as a long term process. It will be successful only if as many institutions and stakeholders as possible are actively involved and are willing to support it. Scientists have an important role to play in the development of adaptation strategies, but to facilitate effective implementation of adaptation actions local communities and decision-makers are essential. Expertise and data provided by research are a basis for a transparent and understandable decision-making process, but scientific results need to be translated and presented in a form that is accessible to professionals and decision-makers and local stakeholders (Welch 2005). The scientific information for local climate adaptation must be relevant for the decision at hand and tailored for the decision context. It should be authorised and trusted by the people affected, and transparent in the process of production. Meeting and addressing the needs, knowledge and language of local communities who have to implement adapted management practices is a major challenge for many scientists in climate impact research. Acknowledging this challenge, the project HABIT-CHANGE initiated a science-management approach to plan jointly for adaptation in protected areas. This kind of collaborative research has already produced beneficial results in other areas (Littell et al. 2012; Lonsdale and Goldthorpe 2012). The science-practice partnership for collaborative research proved to be invaluable for testing useful methods, the identification of applicable solutions and the enhancement of practical conservation management within HABIT-CHANGE. It was built on an intensive dialogue between an interdisciplinary panel of scientists and local management and facilitates the co-production of knowledge. In this process several barriers to the practical implementation of theoretical concepts were identified. Much data and many methods provided by science did not fit with planning reality and the decision context of protected area management. On the other hand, many management practices were lacking a foundation in solid facts and evaluation of their success was often neglected. Furthermore, it seems that much of the available knowledge and guidance on adaptation of conservation management does not reach local management. From the experience gained in the project we could see that climate change is rarely perceived and accepted as a high priority challenge on site level. There is often too little awareness that climate change is already a main driver of biodiversity loss and that its significance will increase even more in the future. Usually, neither management authorities nor land users and stakeholders have enough information, knowledge or incentives to plan and negotiate necessary adaptations to climate change. The adaptive capacity of local institutions like the administrations of National Parks or Biosphere Reserves is a crucial component too. The lack of expertise, methods and tools for climate adaptation as well as limited resources prevents proper management and adaptation (Fig. 20.1). The institutional setting of protected areas influences capacity and willingness to respond to new challenges"
380,226,0.33,Grassroots Politics and Oil Culture in Venezuela : The Revolutionary Petro-State,"Under siege Radical political organization in 23 de Enero dates back to the PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez era and his fall in 1959. The colectivosâ later evolution into relatively organized and armed groups came as a response to excessive state violence in the Puntofijo era (see Ciccariello-Maher 2013). In the beginning of the 1980s, 23 de Enero started overflowing with drugs. Several of my interlocutors alleged that this was planned by the government as a means to de-stabilize popular organization in the community. Similar statements have been documented elsewhere (Martinez et al. 2010:274; Ciccariello-Maher 2013:77). To what extent it was a government strategy, is difficult to prove, but what is certain is that lower-level police officers were heavily involved in drug trafficking, cutting deals with, and supplying, local criminals and drug dealers. In any case, the community found itself under siege by both the police and criminal networks. It was the need to respond to these threats that led to the creation of colectivos as distinct, territorially rooted, social organizations. Armed and masked, they would give local delinquents an ultimatum: âDisappear or we will eradicate you.â Simultaneously, the police (the Policia Metropolitana in particular who played a crucial part in the 2002 coup and was later dissolved by the ChÃ¡vez government), famous for its corrupt and violent practices, was a declared enemy."
174,289,0.329,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"for example, as one of the largest religious based NGO in Indonesia has collaborated with other NGOs in the region, including one local NGO in Myanmar, to explore possible areas of peacebuilding where it can participate in dealing with the Rohingya issue.13 Achievements/Measuring Results Despite Indonesiaâs active engagement in peacebuilding in Myanmar, so far the government has not developed any standard monitoring and evaluation mechanisms in order to measure achievements as well as to evaluate past mistakes/failures from the projects. It is indeed a challenging task to measure of what has been achieved so far from Indonesiaâs engagement in peacebuilding in Myanmar for two reasons. First, there is simply no standard mechanism created by the government to monitor and evaluate projects of this nature. What normally exists is internal project evaluation applied by the donor/funding institutions or agencies, which cannot be shared for public consumption. For projects implemented by government agencies/ministries, each implementing body or ministry usually does not have any obligation to conduct any monitoring and evaluation processes. Even if such monitoring does take place, the data collected is usually not shared with the public. Second, and more importantly, Indonesia has been focusing its engagement more on the political aspects of the Myanmar reform process and long-term projects more than working on short-term and specific or clearly defined areas. The âsharingâ approach basically emphasizes the sharing of ideas, knowledge and experiences and it is almost impossible to measure it quickly to what extent such ideas or experiences have been taken and influenced the policies of the Myanmar stakeholders. The best indicator to measure results or achievements, as suggested by Myanmar and Indonesian stakeholders, would be to see the level of trust and confidence shown by the elites in Myanmar towards Indonesiaâs active engagement in the country. For example, the interest expressed from high-ranking military officers, high-level public officials, and also recently from the representatives of ethnic groups from Myanmar to participate in various events that involved Indonesian institutions as resources have shown a considerable success. Based on the interviews with different Indonesian stakeholders, they have been urged to continue the projects or even to come up with new projects.14 But have we seen any changed behaviour?

An important implication of chiral anomalies together with the topological properties of the vacuum in non-Abelian gauge theories is that the conservation of the charges associated with baryon (B) and lepton (L) numbers is broken by the anomaly [336], so that B and L conservation are actually violated in the standard electroweak theory (but B L remains conserved). B and L are conserved to all orders in the perturbative expansion, but the violation occurs via nonperturbative instanton effects [87] [The amplitude is proportional to the typical non-perturbative factor exp. c=g2 /, with c a constant and g the SU.2/ gauge coupling.] The corresponding effect is totally negligible at zero temperature T, but becomes relevant at temperatures close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, precisely at T  O.TeV/. The non-conservation of B C L and the conservation of B L near the weak scale plays a role in the theory of baryogenesis that aims quantitatively at explaining the observed matterâantimatter asymmetry in the Universe (for reviews and references, see, for example, [115])."
10,393,0.325,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"12.6.1 Motivation Motivation refers to the goals and values, external pressure, and orientations that drive the actor in a speciï¬c way. Among nature and conservation actors, the context of water scarcity and drought produces highly varied motivations. In many cases, the motivation of nature conservation stakeholders is triggered to a large extent by their own goals and values. On the whole, both nature organizations and farmers are aware of the implications of water scarcity and drought on nature areas, such as the loss of flora and fauna in river systems, algae blooms and crop failures. Such external pressures on a global environmental change scale serve as a primary internal motivator among these actors. In addition, external governance pressures, such as the requirements set forth by the Natura 2000 regulations provide a strong impetus to implement measures to combat drought. Regulations, incentives and communications play a large role in motivating action among stakeholders. The EU Directives in particular have created pressures on relevant stakeholders (e.g. water boards) to devise collaborative solutions to address water scarcity and drought. Despite such top-down pressures, large regional disparities in resources and water use create cascading pressures at the local level. Lack of resources tends to motivate local led initiatives to develop their own innovative tools for drought-related problems. Despite strong economic interests, governance pressures can override them depending on the strength of the regulation. For example, in the case of Somerset, motivated actors from nature conservation organizations, including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Somerset Wildlife Trust (SWT), developed long-term visions for transforming the landscape from human-centred to exclusively for nature by restoring open grassland landscapes. In the face of strong economic interests, the beneï¬ts of a more resilient and robust landscape in the face of extreme weather outweighed competing pressures. Such harmonization of initially competing motivations is at the heart of sustainable and integrative land and water management as well as coping with extreme weather events, including drought and flood (Robins 2014)."
384,84,0.32,Practical Economics : Economic Transformation and Government Reform in Georgia 2004â2012,"IFIs have fairly deep pockets. If their resources are put to good use, they can make a huge difference for a developing world â improve existing infrastructure, boost private sector activity, and increase the conï¬dence of entrepreneurs and investors. And working with IFIs is not only a source of ï¬nancing, it also provides an opportunity to learn from international experience. Unfortunately, many governments do not fully understand the mechanisms of IFI ï¬nancing and fail to utilize it properly. Without proper coordination by the government of the receiving country, IFI projects have a tendency to take on a life of their own. In fact, the bureaucratic burden can outweigh the actual beneï¬t. This is what happened in Georgia in the early 2000s. But when the government took control of the agenda and started pulling the right levers in a coordinated fashion, the productivity of the assistance soared. After the Russian invasion of Georgia and the donor conference held in Brussels in October 2008, IFI assistance was handled with aplomb and efï¬ciency by everyone involved, resident IFI representatives and members of government alike. It was a successful joint effort. Although it took more than half a decade for the aid to take effect, the political and economic support was a major factor in getting the country back on track. But this was years later, and Georgia had to climb a steep learning curve to get there. 3.3.1.1 Lack of Coordination As soon as the new Georgian government was appointed in 2004, we realized that IFIs had set aside substantial ï¬nancial resources for Georgia but that these resources were not used efï¬ciently. The reason for the inefï¬ciency was two-fold: IFIs were not sufï¬ciently coordinating their work with the government, and each IFI wanted to participate in as many projects as possible. Unless the government takes charge and deï¬nes the agenda, IFIs end up competing with each other, or even with themselves internally, trying to maximize"

For IUCN, partnerships are a key driving force for successful conservation action. The socio-economic and environmental challenges confronting society today are complex and far from clear-cut. Bringing together diverse stakeholders such as governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities and indigenous peoples groups, can help to address these challenges in a comprehensive and inclusive way. The complexity of urban environments underlines the importance of multidisciplinary and multi-scale partnerships in cities. Cities represent a new class of ecosystems shaped by the dynamic interactions between ecological and social systems (CBD 2012). Urban citizens depend on ecosystems both within and beyond cities for a wide variety of goods and services (e.g. food, water, energy, climate regulation), and while cities are increasingly recognised for their role in conservation (CBD 2012), urbanisation also presents a major environmental challenge, for example by driving habitat conversion (McDonald et al. 2013). Nature offers great untapped potential for improving the quality of life of urban citizens and finding solutions to challenges such as rising temperatures (the urban heat island effect) or flooding (CBD 2012). The challenge lies in developing and adopting urban planning and management approaches that ensure the delivery of regulating, provisioning, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services, while also promoting the sustainable use of resources. Ideally, stakeholders from different policy areas and sectors should come together to develop holistic approaches to managing natural capital â the worldâs stocks of natural assets which includes geology, soil, air, water and all living things. In reality however, collaboration between sectors and stakeholders is often hindered by a lack of exchange and cooperation, presenting a barrier to effective policymaking (Science for Environment Policy 2016) and the implementation of successful conservation initiatives. Multidisciplinary and cross-cutting concepts such as NBS have the potential to facilitate cooperation between sectors and contribute to a more holistic approach to tackling socio-economic and environmental challenges. From IUCNs perspective, NBS are interventions which use nature, and the ecosystem services they provide, to address societal challenges such as climate change. Well-functioning ecosystems that deliver services needed by society are at the core of these types of solutions, which include, for instance, the creation or restoration of large ecosystems; investing in natural infrastructure and watershed management for water, food and energy security and climate change adaptation; ecosystem-based mitigation oriented solutions, such as the conservation and sustainable management of forests; and using ecologically engineered solutions, such as intertidal habitats or oyster reefs to protect shorelines and reduce sea-level rise impact and coastal inundation. The aim of this chapter is to profile a broad range of partnerships led by the private sector, local communities and local/regional governments, which have restored, conserved and managed ecosystems to the benefit of people and the environment. The following sections include reflections on key outcomes and lessons that can be"
364,175,0.318,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"stewardship. This is partly because communities often have better knowledge and expertise in the management of local resources than government agencies/private industry. Indeed, the involvement of local people in such development business may help reduce government costs. As such, local participation and decentralization are currently being promoted in many developing countries as an alternative approach to development and resource governance. Brown et al. (2002) argue that such a community-based approach often leads to more equitable and sustainable natural resource management. These authors provided a number of reasons to support their argument. One of those reasons concerns the issue of proximity to resources. Those in closest contact with, and whose livelihoods are impacted by, natural resources are best placed to ensure effective stewardship. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is an approach under which communities become responsible for managing natural resources (forests, land, water, biodiversity) within a designated area. CBNRM gives communities full or partial control over decisions regarding natural resources, such as water, forests, pastures, communal lands, protected areas, and fisheries. The extent of CBNRM control can range from community consultations to joint management or to full responsibility for decision making and benefit collection, using tools such as joint management plans, community management plans, stakeholder consultations and workshops, and communal land tenure rights. Together with decentralization reforms, CBNRM ensures stakeholder participation, increases sustainability, and provides a forum for conflict resolution (World Bank 2006). In Thailand, participation of local communities in natural resource management has been recognized and promoted by government agencies. Evidence of this is provided by the current National Constitution, which contains some articles giving rights to local people and communities to participate in such state-owned development projects. These local communities currently have a say in decision making processes related to natural resource management. In the forestry sector, the Royal Forest Department (RFD) promotes community forestry projects where local communities living in or adjacent to national reserve forests are given usufruct rights to resources within the community forest areas. The RFD also provides them with technical and financial support. It is worth noting here that the most economically and ecologically successful CBNRM is achieved when community participation is accompanied by the devolution of ownership rights over resources. Once a community has been given tenure over the resources they are helping to manage, they are able to gain benefits from the use of these resources and their interest in participation is naturally increased. The village of Pred Nai in Thailandâs Trat province has successfully re-forested 1,920 ha of mangrove forest that were previously converted into shrimp aquaculture ponds in the mid-1980s. Community conservation of mangrove forests in Pred Nai village emerged without outsider intervention more than 20 years ago. Clearly, the initiative by the Pred Nai villagers qualifies as community-based mangrove forest management and numerous lessons can be drawn from it. The successful implementation of community forestry has reaffirmed the role and significance of a communitybased approach in natural resource management. This community-based approach"
320,315,0.316,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"10.6.5 Working Step: Stakeholder Involvement, Communication and Participation Many conflicts in protected areas are caused by land-users and other stakeholders not accepting the objectives and measures of nature conservation because they stand contrary to their interests. It is essential to include and integrate those stakeholders and land users in the process of adaptation. This is vital for the increase of acceptance and to find win-win-solutions that help all parties involved to adapt to climate change. To foster stakeholder involvement existing conflicts and problems with land-users and stakeholders have to be analysed and documented, and suitable strategies for participation and communication must be identified. Furthermore, land-users and other stakeholders will also have to adapt to climate change (for example, artificial irrigation to avoid drought, or snow cannons to extend tourist seasons). Such autonomous adaptation activities might not even be directly attributed to climate change. However, they can be in conflict with protection efforts, increase existing problems or even create new threats to conservation goals. Hence, the autonomous adaptation of stakeholders should be monitored and guided by conservation management. Successful adaptation to climate change requires the close cooperation of diverse stakeholders, land-users, administrators, and scientists. Each of the"
73,853,0.316,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The Trust was hugely successful. Funded to the extent of $3.56 m. a year from consolidated revenue it managed to lever a further $8.5 m in its latter years towards catchment improvement. It also achieved outstanding results in government agency cooperation, was highly successful in community engagement with over 7000 volunteers working on rehabilitation projects, instigated State of the Environment reporting for the whole of its area and supported Councils within its areas to produce their own State of the Environment reports. During the 7 years of its operation it became internationally recognised for its success in cooperative engagement, particularly with the community. The Trust was uniquely structured. Firstly it had a clearly deï¬ned charter which was to make such surveys and general plans for the region and its hydrological catchment as may be necessary to guide and control the extent, sequence and nature of development that would be equitable and economically sound and which would advance the orderly and proper physical, environmental, economic and social management of the designated region. It was relatively small and streamlined in its working processes. It had an executive arm comprised of ï¬ve full-time persons, a Chief Executive Ofï¬cer with strong managerial, communication and people skills and four Program Leaders possessing special knowledge of, and experience in, each of four disciplines of major signiï¬cance to the catchment, viz. Planning, Public Works, Bio-diversity and Community Engagement. Each executive member appointed had such expertise and carried a full practical workload. This leadership ensured strong capability, and a high level of professional integrity. Its board, drawn from government agencies, industry and resident groups, environmental groups and local government performed their role as individuals rather than as representatives of their parent organisation. This ensured a loyalty to the Trust rather than the background they came from. In addition each person had an interest in and commitment to the region. Whilst nobody expected the new Trust to perform miracles in the short term the long-range thinker, the long-term planner had found little support in the previous 20 years. It was obvious to those who led the Trust that the cultural attitude towards nurturing the environment would have to change in a way that would embrace the concept of long range planning and management, casting aside the populist call for âinstantâ solutions. This problem remains today. The proponents of the Trust wanted to vest the organisation with some perceivable authority believing the community would not accept a management organisation that was seen to be another âtoothless tigerâ. What was established was a lean and efï¬cient organisation which, to the greatest possible extent, used existing structures. This provided three major advantages; it was more cost effective, integrated and better utilised the pool of knowledge and expertise already existing within the catchment and, most importantly, it was less threatening to existing agencies. It was also intended that a major function of the organisation would involve planning strategies and outcomes. It would therefore be necessary to provide within the regional framework of the Department of Planning a mechanism by which the Trust could exercise a limited but important authority, not so much as a deliverer of ser-"

242,1141,0.315,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Public Social Science at Work: Contesting Hostility Towards Nicaraguan Migrants in Costa Rica and are characterized by mutual recriminations. It seems that the hostility against migrants and the political polarization of Nicaraguan society has diminished the possibilities of collective action. Additionally, political parties in Nicaragua do not recognize emigration as a challenge for their own agendas and, except in electoral periods, ignore their co-nationals in Costa Rica. What seem to matter are remittances, not those who produce value. The possibility of larger migrant organizations able to produce their own ways of demanding recognition and distribution in different forums (Fraser 2008) seems to depend on the recognition that any collective action project has to be grounded in the communities. Rather than a fixed agenda and rigid ways of working, collective efforts have to be strategic, based on limits and potentialities. Again, translation, rather than a sort of master plan, seems to be the key. However, translation implies actors who are able to be present at different scales. The intellectual division of work between community work and national or international advocacy is without reservation an impediment for translating agendas and the triangulation of efforts. In other words, the challenge not only refers to ideas or proposals but also to the âsituatednessâ of academic, social, and political actors. Migrant communities are impoverished and share a vast number of limitations, but at the same time they are vital to a number of key economic activities. In interviewing women who work in the pineapple industry â Costa Rica is the leading world exporter â they recounted how they stopped a pineapple processing plant because they did not receive a minimum wage. Instead their income was based on the amount of fruit selected, and they received very little money if the number of fruits selected for export declined. So they wrote a letter to justify their refusal to continue working. The managers agreed to change the payment scheme (Sandoval/Brenes/Paniagua 2012). Such experiences have to be channelled into a long-term effort of constituting political subjects, and social science research can contribute to this. The key may reside in the articulation of efforts and mobilizations rather than in mutual disqualification. One step in the linking work may consist of facilitating possibilities for political formation in communities, so that those who participate in community initiatives may also acquire competencies to participate in national or regional networks. In other words, independent of the migratory condition, pedagogical processes need to be facilitated that strengthen what Davis, MartÃ­nez, and Warner (2010: 87) call âsubstan-"
320,300,0.315,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"The adaptation of protected area management to climate change requires consistent definitions and objectives for the manifold activities, strategies and practices that are part of the active management of nature conservation. Management activities affect different stakeholders or require specific data, competencies, cooperation, and strategies. Management of protected areas is limited by financial, institutional, and legal restrictions. In addition, lack of competence within relevant administrations and a limited acceptance or willingness of local stakeholders to support the goals of nature conservation hampers its implementation. These aspects define the decision-making context and need to be considered when adapting conservation management to climate change. The adaptation of protected area management requires an evaluation and revision of existing management practices, strategies and measures described in management plans. According to the IUCN-Definition these plans should document the âmanagement approach and goals, together with a framework for decision making, to apply in the protected area over a given period of time. [. . .] Plans may be more or less prescriptive, depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used and the legal requirements to be metâ (Lausche 2011, p. 29). Management plans provide guidance and standards for all management decisions and for the implementation of conservation goals, and form a basis for transparent and acceptable management decisions. Management plans are usually not so detailed that they define precise and measurable objectives for all protected species and habitats in the area, but they serve as guiding documents establishing a framework for everyday management decisions. To address the specific tasks and challenges in adaptation, management tasks in protected areas can be divided into different groups of activities and strategies, each requiring a specific set of know-how, data, skills or expertise. Based on categories suggested by The Heinz Center (2008) we divided management tasks into activities and strategies related to:"

174,201,0.313,Rising Powers and Peacebuilding : Breaking The Mold?,"Both the NSP and the SDP have their strengths and weaknesses. While NSP is quite participative at the community level, and creates the basic units of democratic choice, though doubts have been expressed about it in practice in different parts of the country, it operates outside the government system. The facilitating/implementing partner gets the credit, not the government as a whole. Its biggest lacuna is the complete absence of ownership outside MRRD, quite unlike SDP. At the same time, NSP has created considerable local, economic assets that are very useful to the community. However, leading from this, its second basic problem is inability to scale up and create projects that bring about sustainable, favourable economic outcomes. Third, what happens to the CDC once the project is over or when the NSP winds down? The resulting frustration could produce cynicism and reversion to more atomised behaviour patterns. The SDP could do well to replicate CDC-like consultative mechanism. It would also do well to look at additional resources, including by diverting from non-productive programmes and by attracting other donors. Better tracking would improve accountability and lead to better outcomes. Both the SDP and the NSP emblemise a different approach to peacebuilding and development than that exhibited by many traditional donors in Afghanistan. Reflecting the belief that âState-building and peacebuilding are primarily internal processes,â (DFID 2010) then-finance minister Ashraf Ghani âdemanded that assistance was to be channelled through the ministries, and aligned with national plans and prioritiesâ (Strand 2014). Many donors including the USAID, Japan and most UN agencies, preferred to execute projects themselves, often without even coordination with the government. The international military in particular with their Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and the Commandersâ Emergency Response Program (CERP) spent very substantial sums of money, for example, US$80 million in three quarters of 2005, aimed at âwinning hearts and mindsâ (Karp 2006). Unfortunately, tactical considerations such as rewarding friendly individuals and groups, or the need to âdeliver developmentâ drove such investment decisions. This was true at both the battalion as well at national levels. In the bargain, basic âprinciples for assistance were set aside for military and political objectives, leading to nepotism and corruption as the Kabul Bank scandal illustratesâ (Strand 2014). The ISAF and PRT approach, though called âwinning hearts and minds,â was a top-down process that did not address an imbalance between areas receiving lots of resources and others that received little or none. They also reflected âquick fixesâ that were less effective"

Stakeholders were identified by way of an extensive mapping process (principally based on a snowball approach (Reed et al. 2009)). Additional stakeholders were identified at the more localised level (i.e. in the project case study areas in the Khulna and Barisal divisions). This process was bolstered through enhanced engagement with a small number of key stakeholders whose interests aligned most closely with the project from the perspective of use and uptake, data provision and cross-sectoral relevance. It became clear that for the mutual benefit of both the project and a small number of these key stakeholders, a more formal relationship would be preferable, and this resulted in the Water Resources Planning Organisation (WARPO) becoming a formal project partner and the establishment of a strategic alliance with the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission of the Government of Bangladesh. Representatives from round 60 institutions were actively involved in the engagement between the project and relevant institutions across multiple scales in Bangladesh. Initially, this engagement primarily took the form of formal one-to-one interviews and latterly through more widely attended workshops.1 The range of stakeholders who were contacted by project partners and who chose to participate included the following: â¢ National government officials in a range of Ministries, the portfolios of which relate to ecosystem services and human well-being (e.g. Planning Commission; Ministry of Agriculture, WARPO) â¢ Relevant non- and inter-governmental organisations at the international level (e.g. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), International Organisation for Migration, Global Water Partnership, CARE) â¢ UN organisations, multi- and bi-lateral donor agencies (e.g. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), World Health Organisation (WHO), World Food Programme (WFP), World Bank, Asian Development Bank)"

233,20,0.309,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Questions This ï¬rst section is composed of chapters addressing some central questions concerning the links between biodiversity conservation and phylogenetic systematics. The ï¬rst, and perhaps the most important of these questions, concerns the nature of the role of phylogenetic systematics in conservation efforts. How do we value the Tree of Life? Why to use aspects of phylogeny in preference to other biodiversity variables? These questions are explored by Lean and Maclaurin in chapter âThe Value of Phylogenetic Diversityâ. They develop the idea that phylogenetic diversity plays a unique role in underpinning conservation endeavor and represents the foundation of a general measure of biodiversity. In a synthesis about the reasons and the types of values that should guide biodiversity conservation and qualify a general biodiversity measure, they propose that phylogeny is the only basis for large-scale conservation prioritization. They justify this argument by showing that phylogeny is the only guide for maximizing feature diversity (sensu Faith 1992) across many different taxa, and also is the best way to hedge our bets against uncertainties related to environmental changes and to humanâs future needs and values."
126,390,0.307,River Basin Development and Human Rights in Eastern Africa : A Policy Crossroads,"â¢ It has become commonplace among development specialists and researchers with extensive ï¬eld-based experience in some bilateral aid agencies (particularly in Scandinavia) and non-governmental organizations to regard cooperative investigation with communities as essential to the production of accurate, thorough and useful analysis of a regionâs socioeconomy and environmental status, as well as identiï¬cation of the local residents' most pressing needs. Multiple forms of community/investigator cooperative approaches to considering livelihood systems, natural resource use patterns in relation to possible development (or conservation) policies have transpired in ways that actually assist communities in improving their life circumstances, rather than undermine them. Local communities likely to be most affected by the development in question need to be included as active participants in all phases of impact assessments and related studies, including: âidentifying the socioeconomic and environmental parameters, or âboundingâ of the task at hand, âgathering information and data (ï¬eld derived components, at least), with ongoing interpretation, and âdrawing conclusions and summarizing the key issues derived from the effort, including their signiï¬cance for the future of local communities and their environment. Much has been learned about cooperative processes between external investigators and local communities that increase accurateness of results. In pastoral and agropastoral contexts, for example, it is clear that local participants need to be selected through dialogue with traditional leaders, rather than government appointed ones. Broad-based and community-held discussions are a critical component and these need to be held in all phases of the work and throughout the geographic area being considered. At community gatherings, local participants, including community leaders, male and female elders and both genders of youth need to actively engage in the above dimensions of the collective effort. Those community members involved in core roles of the investigation have a major roles in planning items for open community discussion and community feedback, while working closely on a daily basis with external investigators. The results from open meetings (as well as from âfeedback surveysâ, etc.) need to be incorporated into the ï¬nal assessment, or reportâincluding its summary and conclusions. Results and conclusions need to be made presented to communities prior to releasing them to policymakers and client institutions. Finally, all such documents must be fully transparent and available to the public. Constructive baseline studies and environmental/socioeconomic impact assessments (ESIAs) and the like need to be unrestricted in their ability to question the project or development approach in question, based upon its ï¬ndings. This contrasts sharply with the existing arrangement for the Omo basin projects detailed in Chap. 6, for example, where implementation of the project is presumed to be a result of the ESIAâa situation permitting opportunity only for âsuggestedâ after-the-fact mitigation or monitoring actions, or additional studies, while the project moved to completion. The Gibe III assessment scenario, unfortunately, is indication of the predominant pattern in assessment related study contractingâone involving major âreciprocityâ and ârevolving doorâ relationships. â¢ Changes in both perspective and method of this order obviously necessitate a signiï¬cant shift in accountability relations. Clearly, investigators have some basic accountability to those who contract them. Yet to assure a cooperative outcome, with accuracy of the work produced, they must also have genuine accountability to local communities which have sufï¬cient authority to ensure that the content and outcomes of investigation represent the realities of their lives and their environments, and authority to guarantee that their voice will be heard well beyond their immediate localitiesâin fact in the distant ofï¬ces of policymakers and politicians. It should be clear that global consulting industry corporations and individualsâparties well-equipped and experienced in accepting accountability only to their client institutions in a system that amounts to a âcontract treadmillâ and too often, a âcomplicity treadmillâ involving very large sums of money, are ill-equipped for such an orientation. â¢ A participatory, community-inclusive approach to studies and impact assessments for consideration of development programs is best implemented by non-governmental organizations, academics (research units or groups, individuals), relatively small consulting organizations, rather than by global consulting industry representatives. Lead investigators should be able to demonstrate qualiï¬cations including: âIn-depth familiarity with the geographic region concerned, including with substantive ï¬eld-based experience in the region or one closely paralleling it. âAppropriate professional training credentials in socioeconomic or human ecological (broadly deï¬ned) ï¬elds. âExperience and commitment to studies weighted to ï¬eld-based investigation rather than âdesk studiesâ with utilization of available printed information, etc., and brief ï¬eld âvisitsâ."

Additional participants in studies, such as technical experts (e.g., for seismic, geological, hydrologic, agricultural or cultural studies) should to be held to the same standard. âFull public transparency of funds received for study and the major parameters of the study underway. â¢ The approaches outlined above for impact assessment and related investigations a may well be objectionable to in mainstream development circles, as âimpracticalâ and âunachievableâ in remote areas and among culturally traditional peoples. To the contrary, there are plentiful accounts by seasoned investigators and aid practitioners that support the conclusion that communities in highly remote and marginalized contexts are not only receptive to genuine inclusion in such processes that help determine their own futureâtheir participation is in fact essential to the success of development or conservation planning with equitable and sustainable objectives. Such understanding is long overdue in major agencies and government policymaking ofï¬ces. Changing the course of existing development and broader social policies directed to the Ethiopia-Kenya-South Sudan transboundary region offers the possibility of sparing the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of citizens and rethinking the regionâs social and environmental future within a human rights framework.

One example for a rule-setting partnership is the WCD. When conflicts relating to the construction of large dams escalated, the commission was convened to develop generally accepted standards for the construction and running of large dams, based on a common assessment of their effectiveness for development. While not considered binding, the standards are now used as a reference point by different stakeholder groups affected by dams. Another example is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).15 ICANN is the coordination body for the domain name system of the Internet. It regulates the technical elements of the Internetâs name and numbering systems in order to preserve the operational stability of the system and promote competition. While it lacks the backing and status of a world government, its regulations are considered authoritative by the concerned communities. Not all partnerships operating with rules and standards, though, are genuine rule-setting or regulation partnerships. Rather than creating new norms and codes, some simply advocate and create incentives for compliance with broadly accepted existing standards. The 4C initiative, for example, is an advocacy partnership that may be confused with a rule-setting partnership. It encourages coffee producers and traders to comply with a set of norms that are derived from major conventions, resolutions or guidelines of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), or from conservation legislation. 4.1.3 Policy implementation partnerships Yet other partnerships have formed around pressing development issues and seek to address them directly. Real implementation partnerships mobilise significant resources and allocate them for implementing policies. By contributing funds or other resources, other organisations or individuals explicitly authorise the partnership to manage and allocate these resources. The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), a joint initiative of international organisations, bilateral donors, industry representatives, NGOs and private foundations to reduce malnutrition of populations at risk, for example, has over 60 million US$ at its disposal for grants, technical assistance and start-up investments.16 The GAVI Alliance, launched in 2000 as the âGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisationâ by a group of governments, donors, health organisations, NGOs, companies and research institutions to increase the rate of vaccinations among children, has an annual budget of 600 to 800 million US$ to support the development of new vaccines and the immunisation of populations in need.17 Other partnerships can only spend resources at a much lower level. As a complement to their advocacy and awareness work, they engage in what has"
282,155,0.302,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"â¢ Disseminate information about the issues addressed as well as the possibilities for submitting contributions widely. This is an important precondition for ensuring broad participation. The dissemination effort should contain two elements. Firstly, partnerships should identify relevant stakeholders and contact them directly. Secondly, they should openly publish information through as many appropriate channels as possible. Depending on the circumstances and the types of stakeholders involved, this may include prominent postings on the partnershipâs website, on newsletters and websites of thematically related organisations, in relevant publications, the media or on local notice boards.64 â¢ Open several consultation channels simultaneously to further increase the number of stakeholders involved. A range of different consultation techniques was mentioned above. These methods can reach diverse audiences and can encourage contributions of differing quality. By using several consultation channels at the same time, partnerships can broaden the scope of both participation and types of submissions. Thus, for example, a partnership may at first hold personal meetings to determine whether and where new standards or rules are necessary. It may then distribute questionnaires among a wider group of stakeholders in order to collect information about their positions. Finally, it may open drafts of the rules to public comments. â¢ Select consultation techniques suited to the needs and skills of key stakeholder groups. When selecting avenues for consultation, partnerships should bear in mind that stakeholder groups can have very different resources and skills at their disposal. Partnerships should tailor their consultation methods to the capacities of important stakeholder groups. This can become relevant, for example, for determining the languages used, for choosing between verbal or written and electronic or non-electronic means of communication. â¢ Ensure a balanced representation of interests by supporting disadvantaged groups. In addition to choosing their consultation methods according to the needs of important stakeholders, partnerships should take measures to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged groups or individuals. Disadvantaged stakeholders are those lacking the resources or skills needed to make their voices heard. NGOs in developing countries may, for example, not be able to cover the travel costs for participating in international meetings and may have difficulties in gaining access to relevant knowledge. Within communities, women or certain minorities may find it hard to speak out. Depending on the identity of the disadvantaged groups, assistance can range from financial support and capacity building to the use of facilitation tools designed to achieve equal participation.65 â¢ Give contributions due and equal consideration and deal with them in a transparent manner. Once partnerships have achieved broad and balanced participation, they have to handle the inputs they receive appropriately."
73,232,0.301,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,This study utilized a âquestionnaire surveyâ followed up with âinterviewsâ to elicit data from the stakeholders about their resource uses. The stakeholders in this study were restricted to the community stakeholders living along the river bank villages. Systematic consultation of representative stakeholders required us to develop a methodology which will neither repeat the spatial areas nor ignore any spatial locality. The methodology designed for the selection of local community stakeholders and conducting the questionnaire survey was the six-step approach given in Fig. 9.4 (Thoradeniya 2010). The importance of this approach is the prominence given to the Governmentâs local administrative mechanism. Establishing connections with the local community stakeholders through the âGrama Niladhari â GNâ (lowest level Government administrative official) was advantageous to develop a trustful attitude towards the research.

282,16,0.301,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"The Political Declaration of the WSSD in Johannesburg, which was so instrumental in promoting the concept of partnership by including it as an official, âtype IIâ, outcome of the summit, contains no more than the following: We recognize that sustainable development requires a long-term perspective and broad-based participation in policy formulation, decision-making and implementation at all levels. As social partners, we will continue to work for stable partnerships with all major groups, respecting the independent, important roles of each of them. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002a, Â§ 26) The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation that was adopted along with the political declaration is slightly more detailed in that it specifies the involvement of âmajor groupsâ in partnerships. At the same time, it constricts the definition to include only cooperative arrangements focusing on policy implementation (rather than policy definition, for example) in the area of sustainable development. [T]he implementation should involve all relevant actors through partnerships, especially between Governments of the North and South, on the one hand, and between Governments and major groups, on the other, to achieve the widely shared goals of sustainable development. As reflected in the Monterrey Consensus, such partnerships are key to pursuing sustainable development in a globalizing world. (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002b, Â§ 3) This definition of partnerships and the subsequent work of the UN are, however, based on a more detailed description of criteria for partnerships. The criteria were developed in the run-up to WSSD and endorsed in the decision of the eleventh meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development. Like the definition proposed here, they recognise partnerships as voluntary, multi-stakeholder initiatives. But they only focus on initiatives designed to contribute to the implementation of internationally agreed development goals and include a range of normative criteria, such as that partnerships should pursue an integrated approach to sustainable development, display a sectoral and geographical balance and be designed in a transparent and accountable manner.5 The WSSDâs focus on cooperation in order to achieve a public policy goal is echoed in the political science literature, for example, in BÃ¶rzel and Risse, who focus on partnerships that transcend national borders: Transnational PPPs [public-private partnerships] would then be institutionalized cooperative relationships between public actors (both governments"

344,590,0.299,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"of government to respond, and attitudes and incentives among officials (Young 2005). Here, the overlap of political context with evidence describes the process of âstrategic analysis,â drawing ideas and information from both government and the research community, past research, and the experience and knowledge of actors involved. How the two become more closely linked also depends on how well they both overlap with where âthe rubber hits the roadââthe beneficiaries and interest groups of agricultural strategies, such as: development practitioners, farmers and trader groups, media, and civil society in general. On the other hand, the intersection between evidence and links can be viewed as one of discourse and dialogue (e.g. through publications, seminars, and media), while the one between the links and political context is more about advocacy (e.g. the world of campaigning and lobbying among local interest groups, media, and the broader electorate or civil society). Finally, the external environment, including the overall socioeconomic environment, as well as the influence of regional and international actors (e.g. donors), can be quite significant in the African context. Effective linkages between evidence, dialogue, and policymaking are supposed to occur at the intersection of all three spheres, and it is here that evidence is expected to influence a policy change. The assumption is that when such links are established early enough, the evidence generated and discussed at this intersection is likely to be viewed as relevant and salient to the local context (Young 2005; Cash et al. 2003). The big challenge in most African countries is getting all three to intersect, given the poor state of evidence generation (from poor quality data, poor training and incentives, weak peer review systems), poor links (from poor communications, capacities), political context (power play, vested interests, top down bureaucracies, and elitist attitudes among officials), and external environment, especially the exaggerated influence of donors. This is what the âknowledge support systemâ component of a country SAKSS strives to achieve, in setting up an active network of key local actors (individuals and organizations) who intersect from all three spheres. Through extensive consultations and interactions in the network, activities involving strategic analysis, capacity strengthening, and dialogue are laid out. The scope of work under each of these activities draws on the active input of all stakeholders: local research partners and analysts (evidence), key government actors and agencies (political context), and stakeholder groups (links)."

Such exemplar species that speak to everyone from layperson to scientist, include the Coelacanth ï¬sh, the Tuatara squamate, the Kiwi bird, the Platypus mammal, the Ginkgo tree, etc. All these species are said to be relict, because they represent groups that are mostly extinct (Grandcolas et al. 2014). The message is that these species should be cared for, because their extinction would cause a loss of information about distinct sections of life on Earth and their evolution. Generally, this powerful message is naively extended to characterize the place where these species are found, implying that the biota as a whole is a kind of Noahâs ark, globally worthy of consideration for conservation biology (see for example, Gibbs 2006 for the case of New Zealand, or Thorne 1999 for Asia). To our knowledge, everyone agrees with these views and even the most hardhearted companies or governments would difï¬culty take responsibility for destroying such emblematical âsurvivorsâ. The public message in endorsing this destruction would be that they are the fools that spoil unique multimillion year antiques, even worse than to break a Vase de Soissons into thousands of pieces or to lacerate a delicate and wonderfully conserved Da Vinci painting. Even if very consensual, such emotive views about relicts and biodiversity conservation are still often presented informally, which prevent them to be fully scientiï¬c, i.e. theoretically justiï¬ed, measurable and repeatable. If then we try to set aside the emotional aspects of these views about relicts, what remains for conservation biology as a rational argument? Do relicts actually represent invaluable species for conservation purposes and why? Are they particularly exotic cases that do not account for most situations encountered by land managers or are they extreme cases of common situations? To answer these questions, we need to carefully deï¬ne relicts with phylogenetic and paleontological tools. The properties of such characterizations need to be explored regarding the most important issues in conservation biology."

Over the past decade, a demand for greater national ownership from G7+ countries has converged with a similar stance among rising powers in the Global South to lead the UN, the EU and OECD countries to commit to national ownership in virtually all documents and discussions of peacebuilding. The emphasis by emerging powers on sovereignty shapes their understanding of ânational ownership.â It means taking priorities first from the central government, and then also channeling resources through the state. For rising powers, this notion translates largely to accepting the government of the day as the embodiment of national ownership, with less emphasis on local or inclusive ownership. Indiaâs peacebuilding priorities in Afghanistan, for instance, are shaped very heavily by conversations between the Indian ambassador in Kabul and the Afghan president. Turkey reaches out more to local leaders, whose priorities determine how Turkish assistance will be used. Typically, rising powers do not invest in much broader consultations with lower level community leaders, civil society, or critics of the government in formulating priorities. They are concerned more about the capacity than the legitimacy of the partner state. Their vision is to invest in the long-term development of the state, regardless of the government of the day. In implementation, countries like India and Turkey may well then reach out to and meet with local beneficiary communities. Indian officials, for instance, seek warm relations of solidarity with partner countries and care about what local communities think of their programs and their effects. They may adapt their programs in response to dialogue with communities. However, in setting priorities, they principally and initially take their cues from the central governmentâs preferences. This approach contrasts with the growing understanding that Western donors have of ânationalâ and âlocalâ ownership that includes nongovernmental actors, especially civil society organizations representative of salient social groups based on ethnicity, gender, youth, and religion. Rising powersâ views on peacebuilding comport less with the trend among intergovernmental organizations, Western donors and the new SDGs emphasizing âinclusive politics.â"

282,156,0.292,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"This implies firstly that partnerships treat submissions as objectively as possible. Secondly, it entails that partnerships either integrate the proposals in their work or provide a justification and explanation for why they were not taken into account.66 Thirdly, partnerships should be transparent in this process. A good way to create transparency is to create a collection or summary containing all contributions together with the partnershipâs reactions. This document should be freely accessible to all interested parties, for example by posting it on the partnershipâs website. Finally, partnerships can strengthen participation by establishing permanent mechanisms that allow interested parties to raise issues or voice concerns. In this case, partnerships do not actively solicit inputs during the rule-making process. Instead, stakeholders can act on their own initiative and trigger debates or certain policy procedures. Permanent complaints and comments mechanisms are a good complement to the active involvement of stakeholders in partnership activities. On their own, however, they are not sufficient for creating an adequate level of democratic accountability for rule-setting partnerships. There is a variety of tools and institutional features providing stakeholders with the opportunity to articulate their concerns and preferences. In addition to its other elaborate channels for participation, ICANN, for example, has instituted several mechanisms to deal with stakeholder complaints. This includes a reconsideration policy, an independent review policy and the office of an ombudsman.67 Thus anybody materially affected by an ICANN action can request the ICANN board to reconsider this action. A special board committee decides within 30 days whether or not it accepts the request and is obliged to justify any rejections. Within 90 days, the committee should forward its final recommendation to the board. All reconsideration requests and subsequent decisions are published on ICANNâs website. The independent review policy covers instances when actions by ICANN or its staff are deemed inconsistent with its articles of incorporation or by-laws. An independent international arbitrator handles these complaints. Finally, ICANN has an ombudsman who deals with any disputes not covered by the other two mechanisms. The mission of the ombudsman is to resolve conflicts informally, relying, for example, on negotiations, facilitation or âshuttle diplomacyâ. Other procedures common in many democratic polities, though not applied by any of the partnerships discussed as case examples here, include formal petitions as well as the possibility to introduce draft norms to the rule-setting process.68 Open comments and complaints procedures create important benefits in terms of democratic accountability: They are usually open to contributions from all interested parties and they allow stakeholders to decide when and on what they want to comment. Thus they complement both main alternatives for the inclusion of stakeholders well. They enhance the democratic"

Within those regulations lies a subordinate set aimed at curtailing foreign funding oriented toward changes in individual rights, freedom of speech, and political engagement. The governments in question find this outside involvement an infringement of authority, and they have little or no interest in permitting foreign organizations to meddle with official aims. The second category includes policies aimed at increasing local philanthropy, particularly when it is in line with the governmentâs agenda, and the third set is of laws endeavoring to create more transparency and accountability. On this last count, many governments are aware that if the trust deficit can be mitigated, increased local giving could result. This chapter examines the policies governing civil society in each of these three categories. The definition of civil society is difficult to pin down. In fact, in 2001, the BBC stated, âThe paradox about civil society is that it covers a vast range of activitiesâyet itâs very hard to define.â In an attempt to address this difficulty, the BBC produced a 12-part series called What Is Civil Society?1 Despite this noble effort, the definition still evades us, although we can all agree that facets, goals, and operating norms of civil society differ across cultural contexts. The details give context to the current legal changes in Asia. Civil society is often thought of as the voice and actions of the people, instead of that of companies and of the government. In the Western context, it is considered a basic tenet of a pluralistic society. While not necessarily the case, the term is often used as a contrarian voice against the government and the private sector. Civil society tends to focus on human rights and social justice. Civic engagement is a different story. Civic engagement is the way in which ordinary people can participate in helping their communities and countries, and the term does not carry an antagonistic connotation. Although civic engagement can utilize both political and non-political processes, it is not about pluralism as an endgame but of the human tendency to help one another. But the distinction can become complex. Many efforts start off as engagement only to become advocacy, and vice-versa. It often becomes clear to those trying to solve a problem that systemic change must include the government, and sometimes that implies the government must also change. Over the past decade, we can see a trend in Asia to channel energy into civic engagement while trying, at times with great conviction, to curtail the growth of civil society.

Contextual Constraints and Possibilities of Conciliatory Textbook Work Evidently, post-conflict textbook work is a hard task which, more often than not, has faced formidable challenges and constraints, especially of a political nature. As worldwide experiences indicate, at all levels from conception to implementation, perseverance and risk-taking have marked these initiatives. The inclusive, balanced and complex narratives and texts that are the ideal product of conciliatory textbook work typically represent counter-discourses and are therefore commonly resisted. Time and again, they have been the object of fierce public debates, political dispute and protest, which have regularly proven fatal to these projects. As a general rule, the most successful initiatives, notably those officially approved, could only be realised after years, if not decades, of dialogue, debate and negotiation. for instance, it took the German-Polish textbook commission over a decade to negotiate and gain formal acceptance of its bilateral recommendations. Similarly, the joint guidelines for textbook authors that were developed by an expert commission in Bosnia in line with a multinarrative and multiperspective model underwent protracted negotiations before being officially endorsed (Pingel 2008: 193, this volume). Several other conciliatory initiatives have been short-lived or never reached fruition, often as a result of vehement criticism from powerful conservative groups. In Croatia, for example, a temporary textbook supplement produced in 2005, which acknowledged Croat crimes perpetrated against Serbs during the conflict in the early 1990s, was swiftly withdrawn following public protests on account of its supposedly ââsacrificingâ the sufferings of Croats in the war for the sake of reconciliationâ (De Baets 2015: 11). The initiative, however, prepared the groundwork for later textbook work, which resulted in new textbooks adopting a comparatively balanced approach to the conflict-ridden past (koren and Baranovic 2009). In some contexts, compromise, possibly induced by a desire to accommodate political and/or societal sensitivities, led to evasion and/or political correctness coming at the expense of historical accuracy in new textbooks dealing with the divisive past.

233,483,0.291,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Similar prioritizations for different taxa are also quite likely to produce different outcomes. Conservation is always driven by value judgments (Vane-Wright and Coppock 2009), and there is even a risk of purposefully setting goals in a manner that produces desired spatial outcomes. Since there necessarily are multiple potentially relevant objectives, a conservative, precautionary strategy would be to assess several of them and focus on areas where most priorities are in concordance, and consider as unimportant only the areas where no high priorities occur. However, in practice different types of conservation actions could be necessary to address the different objectives, and therefore the conflicts may be more apparent than real. For instance, regions with particularly low phylogenetic diversity may also be of conservation concern as they can represent areas of active diversification (Forest et al. 2007), but they might require different type of conservation from âmuseumâ areas with relict species, as these areas and species in them might be threatened by very different processes. Another open and closely related question is at what spatial scales should we operate when measuring and prioritizing evolutionary history? In our case the assumption was that phylogenetic diversity measured as the equivalent number of Raoâs quadratic entropy of the local community was the relevant unit, but especially when assessing the diversity across the study region, the delineation of the study region will have an impact on priorities as described above, but also through âpruningâ of the phylogenetic tree: A specific region will cover parts of a full phylogeny, and regional scale prioritization with such a partial tree may prioritize areas different from a global prioritization with a full tree. Considering the amount of literature on conservation of evolutionary history in general, it is surprising how rarely it is considered in systematic conservation planning applications. Phylogenetic data are increasing and the modern computational prioritization tools are better able to account for such data even at broad scales and for large numbers of species. These developments facilitate the inclusion of phylogenetic diversity into conservation planning. We hope that it will become a routine part of spatial conservation prioritization procedures, and that the message will also better reach the broader public through active communication.

It discusses current policies with relevance for nature conservation in the EU, including the Nationally Designated Protected Areas, the Habitats and the Birds Directives, and the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy. The authors argue that wilderness protection has received little attention in Europe, although there are encouraging recent developments. The chapter discusses on how to build on those developments to widen the scope of policies targeted towards wilderness protection and rewilding. Finally, the authors argue that rewilding can play a major role in achieving some of the 2020 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the EU Biodiversity Strategy. We hope that this book inspires more research on rewilding and more practitioners to push the boundaries of conservation strategies. Nature is resilient but we need to learn how to better support that resilience. We conclude with a personal note on that resilience and on its limits. Henrique has been doing fieldwork in Peneda-GerÃªs National Park in Northern Portugal for over 25 years. Back in the early 1990âs this was an area where observing a wild boar or a roe deer was a rare event. A neighbor of Henriqueâs in Castro Laboreiro shared once that his grandmother, whom lived through most of the twentieth century, had never seen a wild boar. Now, things have changed. Today you can hardly spent more than a few weeks in the region without seeing a wild boar or a roe deer. A combination of farmland abandonment, reduced livestock grazing, and species protection with limited hunting was probably behind this wildlife comeback. Yet, there was a species that would not have come back by itself as it went locally extinct in the beginning of the twentieth century: the Iberian Ibex ( Capra pyrenaica). The species has been successfully reintroduced in the Spanish side of the GerÃªs mountain range in the 1990s and in the Spanish side of the Laboreiro mountains in the late 2000s. They now can be seen in both regions in the Peneda-GerÃªs National Park. And what an amazing sight it is to watch these agile animals climbing the large granite domes! We wish to dedicate this book to all the managers, scientists and last but not the least, the local communities, which made this wildlife return possible. Henrique M. Pereira Laetitia M. Navarro"

Participatory planning tools and techniques enable participants (stakeholders) to influence development initiatives and decisions affecting them. The tools promote sharing of knowledge, building up commitment to the process and empower the group to develop sustainable strategies. The participatory and informed planning process makes use of the âCircles of Influenceâ model (Fig. 13.19) that enables to structure participation to limit numbers but not the influence of speciï¬c groups of stakeholders (Cardwell et al. 2008; Bourget 2011). Under this model trust is developed in concentric circles; planners and managers work to develop trust with leaders and organizations that other stakeholders already trust. That is, those most directly involved in policy analysis activities (i.e., planners, managers, and modelers who do most of the actual work; Circle A) who communicate with trusted leaders and major stakeholder representatives at the next level (Circle B). These stakeholders then in turn provide a trusted link to all other interested parties, who have much less direct involvement (Circle C). Ideally, Circle B participants would be active in professional or issues-oriented organizations and provide links to others whose interests they represent.

At a fundamental level, this is a challenge to the traditional dynamics of NorthSouth models of collaboration. The global flow of ideas in the realm of health is by no means new, though typically only tacitly acknowledged when flowing in âreverse.â Given the ever-present community-academic and North-South imbalances, the Pan Institution Network for Global Health (PINGH)1 employs a participatory governance and research approach to bring a balance of power by featuring local stakeholders as content and context experts. First, PINGH has a rotating governance structure. Each university partner has a champion who represents his/her institution for all PINGH activities. Second, leadership rotates on a three-year cycle. Each institution takes turns leading PINGH initiatives as well as hosting the annual PINGH collaborative meeting, in order to offer an opportunity for all PINGH members to experience and gain insight on the institutional and local cultures of each PINGH member and to defray costs of hosting the meeting for any one institution. These activities also insure participation and contribution from all PINGH members in the global North and South. To promote inclusivity, we invite community stakeholders to our annual meetings to ensure that PINGH objectives are relevant to the local communities in which PINGH institutional members serve. Local NGOs, government policy makers, and other local stakeholders have attended PINGH meetings to help our partners reflect and strategize on how global health research and capacity building can be translated to local policy and practice. Our approach to community stakeholder involvement is discussed in further detail in this chapter."
302,354,0.284,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"5 Citizen Science as Concept Science as a paid profession started in the later part of the nineteenth century [4]. Up until then scientific data were produced by people who collected the data due to interest. Some famous examples of citizen scientists were Benjamin Franklin and Charles Darwin [4]. Todayâs citizen science (CS) is most commonly conducted when projects are specifically designed to combine knowledge and expertise from scientists at research institutions with the work of the skilled amateurs, often within conservation biology and monitoring studies [40]. Silvertown [4] proposed that the expanding use of CS is driven by three factors: (1) greater access to the technical tools needed, (2) bringing in additional qualified labor, and (3) a greater demand for outreach within academia. In a historical context, CS has most commonly been used with conservation biology and nature monitoring programs. Examples such as the Atlas Project in Australia, where BirdLife Australia has used CS to obtain more than seven million bird observations for their âAtlas of Australian Birdâ [41], and Herbaria@home, where museum collections of wild plants are analyzed by citizens in the UK for more than a decade [42], serve as illustrations of such classic CS projects. CS has however also been used to monitor pollution. The Air Quality Egg Project in the USA and Europe is a CS project that aims at monitoring air quality. It is based on a sensor system designed to allow citizens to collect data on NO2 and"
219,90,0.284,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Reforms of the Institutional Environment, or âL2 Actionsâ The level L2 is the institutional environment. It is the level at which the executive, legislative, judicial and bureaucratic functions of the government are organised. This includes the horizontal distribution of power across different agencies (such as different ministries), the vertical distribution across levels (decentralisation), or the set of rules that determine access to and ownership of productive resources (tenure). The L2 provides the infrastructure and the playing ï¬eld in which actors interact and take decisions. The L2 is often shaped by historic events, such as regime changes, crises or major intervention with large political support. While it is mostly the product of historical processes, opportunities for design exist. Horizontal linkages across ministries At the national level, countries responded to natural resource and environmental degradation by forming ministries of environment to address degradation. One of the weaknesses of such ministries was their limited interaction with other ministries and departments (Volkery et al. 2006). Initially, responsibility for the promotion of soil and water conservation measures lay with the forestry ministries. This often led to coordination failure and little outreach to farmers and private land user (De Graaff et al. 2013). Promoting sustainable land management beyond boundaries of ministries might be an important pre-condition to reduce conflicting regulations and harmonise national efforts to ï¬ght land degradation. Decentralisation The lack of involvement of local communities in managing natural resources is often identiï¬ed as one of the major reasons for the failure of centralised governments to effectively manage land resources (Gibson et al. 2005; Robinson et al. 2011). The exclusion of local communities alienates them, which in turn leads to poor cooperation between local communities and natural resource managers. Ostrom and Nagendra (2006) found that locally-managed forests are usually managed more effectively than centrally-managed forests. FAO estimates that around one-quarter of forests in developing countries are in some way managed by local communities (FAO 2011). The share of community-managed forests is increasing, thanks to the promotion of decentralisation and community-based management by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations (FAO 2011)."

The cardinal inviolable laws were supposed to be a collection of general principles, including freedom of conscience, personal freedom, freedom of contract, the principle of subordination of law, protection of property and indissolubility of the Republic.174 However, this latter issue sparked a ï¬erce debate, as the draft absolutely forbade any alienation or even territorial exchange, which probably resulted from the traumatic experience of the ï¬rst partition. Potocki, however, argued that âthe integrity of the Republic cannot be insured with cardinal laws, but with the government, the military, virtue and customs prevailing in the countryâ.175 Stroynowski, a deputy of Volyn, also approached the concept of the cardinal principles in the same debate and objected to Suchodolskiâs intention of introducing a ban on foreign candidates to the throne, saying that he knew no other but this Cardinal Law, which derives from the natural law, or from the divine law, yet these said additional issues were not such, so they should not be included within Cardinal Laws.176 Ultimately a portion of the regulations was approved. Work on the ï¬nal shape of the Form of the Government was drawn out, in January 1791 the deputies continued to bury themselves in fruitless discussions, work on the law of the assemblies, or continue work on the partially ï¬nalized discussion of the Cardinal Laws. In opting for the second solution they emphasized the fundamental role of the Cardinal Laws, âtrulyâ constituting the Form of the Government, for âit is the foundation which determines the structureâ. The Cardinal Laws were applicable to Sejms and assemblies, âand therefore are the source from which the stream of freedom flows, they are the only rule of the Republican Governmentâ. Opponents claimed that regulations concerning Sejms and assemblies were the priority, as the âfoundation of the freedoms and wellbeing of the Republicâ, palladium libertatis. At the same time, it was perceived that the Cardinal Laws in and of themselves provided no protection against foreign aggression, something evidenced by the events of 1773 and the âwatchful and bravely active Government.â It was argued that those adjustments of the Cardinal Laws that had already been made possessed everything crucial for preserving the liberty of the nation. The others should flow from the entirety of the political system, id est detailed regulations on the Form of the Government. Ultimately, on 7 January 1791 the deputies voted to undertake work on an Act on the assemblies with a vote of 174 to 89.

320,299,0.282,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,Current scholarly publications provide numerous suggestions and recommendations for the adaptation of nature conservation management to climate change (e.g. Glick et al. 2011; Hansen and Hoffmann 2011; West et al. 2009). Most authors discuss general problems of conservation management (e.g. Game et al. 2011; Hannah 2003; Lovejoy and Hanna 2005; Araujo et al. 2011). Only a few address the needs and response options for protected area managers (e.g. Lawler 2009; Welch 2005; Baron et al. 2009) or offer guidelines for adaptation of protected area management (e.g. European Commission 2012; Idle and Bines 2005; Prutsch et al. 2010). Many recommendations for adaptation in nature conservation address the policy level or regional and national scale but are not specific enough to be applied to the tasks and capabilities of protected area management at a local level. Other recommendations aim at the scientific community and do not take practical requirements of protected area management practice into consideration. Of the few recommendations that are focused on protected area management even fewer have been tested in the field. In their review of recommendations for adaptation to climate change Heller and Zavaleta (2009) conclude that the majority of recommendations in the published journal literature lack sufficient specificity to direct immediate action to adapt conservation practice. The general recommendations given are not applicable at the level of protected area management; therefore a practice-oriented approach - as presented below â with detailed guidance for the adaptation process is needed.
246,367,0.282,Rewilding European Landscapes,"The current European policy response to pressures on biodiversity can be either with site protection (e.g. SPAs SACs), or with the regulation of the activities of those exploiting the land, which can also be relying on voluntary actions, i.e. with Agri-Environmental Schemes (EEA 2004). Rewilding abandoned farmland can efficiently contribute to reaching European and global conservation targets. But in order to do so, a policy framework must be designed to include rewilding in the land management options given to practitioners (see Chap. 1). To that extent, European conservation policies must aim toward several goals. In places where people still keep a strong link with nature, a wilderness comeback via natural regeneration should not be excessively problematic (McGrory Klyza 2001). Yet, when the link with traditional landscapes is the strongest, as in many regions of Europe, rewilding might be perceived negatively (Bauer et al. 2009; Hochtl et al. 2005). Communication between scientists, policy-makers, decisionmakers, and the public will be essential to allow the implementation of rewilding, and to promote the values of wilderness in a landscape. Development initiatives are also known to ease the transitions between one form of management and another, for instance by increasing the support of local communities for the protected area (Pinto and PartidÃ¡rio 2012). Giving the opportunities to populations to shift their activities from low-income agriculture to ecotourism in rewilded areas can be an efficient way to meet both ends (see Chaps. 3 and 9). The proposed âgreeningâ reform of the CAP could further compensate stakeholders maintaining low productive practices in order to preserve traditional agricultural habitats (Hochkirch et al. 2013). Another option is to maintain payments for farmers that apply environmentally friendly practices on productive soils, and redirect subsidies on less productive lands towards rewilding (Merckx and Pereira, in press). By doing so, Member States will still be able to meet the demands for agricultural goods, yet promoting responsible and green practices on productive soils, while the lands left abandoned due to their remoteness, their lower productivity, and the difficulty to cultivate them (MacDonald et al. 2000; Rey Benayas et al. 2007, and see Chap. 1) will be rewilded and managed for other activities linked with wilderness. Such approach can be seen as land-sharing at the local scale (with"

Indonesiaâs peacebuilding activities therefore value respect for the host countryâs sovereignty and focus on gaining confidence and trust from local stakeholders, who have the resilience to build sustainable peace. While peacebuilding during the New Order era focused on playing a facilitator role, the Yudhoyono administration took a different route by sharing values that can contribute to creating sustainable peace, namely respect for democracy and human rights.

99,417,0.281,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"Labour market policy is largely a function of central government who are responsible for activation strategies in local areas. However, due to Birmingham containing some of the most deprived areas with the highest levels of unemployment in England, various central government initiatives have been implemented locally through the city council since 2000. These initiatives have had addressing unemployment as their sole objective or as part of wider neighbourhood or regeneration strategies. The Working Neighbourhoods Fund (WNF), which came from the national Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Work and Pensions of the previous Labour government, was a key programme for Birmingham. The city was allocated Â£118 million over 3 years from 2008, and almost half of the WNF resources specifically targeted worklessness (worklessness is a wider term than unemployment as it includes everyone of working age who does not work no matter what their circumstances). The funds were allocated as part of a general grant given directly to local authorities. This was not ring-fenced, and so local authorities were able to use it as they saw fit to support the delivery of local, regional and national priorities. Therefore, the remainder of the WNF was allocated to strategic partners to address barriers to worklessness and other key priorities such as supporting business, improving educational attainment and skills, addressing health inequalities, encouraging active involvement in sport and culture, improving energy efficiency, reducing the number of people living in temporary accommodation and making the city a safer place. Significantly, the WNF enabled the development of a targeted approach at a local ward level to select and commission organisations to help people find work (described in the following chapter). It also led to the Worklessness Innovations Fund which provided small grants of up to Â£25,000 for feasibility studies, research and demonstration projects. In 2010, 44 organisations were awarded resources to try new and interesting ways of helping people gain employment, of which TFMP was one. The organisation responsible for YEER, TFMP, is a social enterprise set up in 2009 after identifying a gap in the market for an organisation to support the aims and aspirations of disadvantaged young people in the West Midlands. The organisation works primarily with women and young people, particularly those classed as NEET and from ethnic minority backgrounds. The philosophy of TFMP is to âenable and empower young people to achieve their potential through enterpriseâ. The concept is very much about developing individual ideas and talents, to âopen new gateways to disadvantaged groups who find it hard to engage meaningfully with traditional business networksâ. TFMP focuses on self-employment and enterprise creation and encourages the individuals they work with to develop new social enterprises to benefit local economies. Underpinning their work is that services and opportunities should be those that young people have determined they want themselves, not just with them in mind."

282,56,0.279,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"accountable. Workers in liberal democracies, for example, have the right to unionise, which strengthens their bargaining position in relation to management. In some countries, they even have the right to be represented on the company board. The position of consumers is strengthened, for example, by rules demanding companies to publish the ingredients of products. And many local communities assert their right to influence companiesâ activities by keeping a tight grip on planning permissions. But these examples also show that the main demand of stakeholder theory, namely that stakeholders have a right to participate in decision making, is not being implemented consistently. Firstly, the stakeholder groups mentioned by Freeman are granted access to very different accountability mechanisms. Only very few apart from shareholders and managers are recognised to have a direct right to âdetermine the future direction of the companyâ by being represented on the board. In Germany, Austria and the Scandinavian countries, for example, only employees have a right to representation.15 In countries that are closer to the Anglo-American tradition, not even employee representation is recognised. Secondly, some stakeholder groups are not granted access to any accountability mechanisms at all. Take the employees of a competitor for instance. They are clearly stakeholders because the companyâs policies affect the position of its competitors, which in turn influences the prospects of the competitorsâ employees. Despite their status as stakeholders, their right to hold the company to account is not recognised in any major legal system. Similarly, the rights of communities that donât live in the immediate neighbourhood of a company are not usually protected by law. Different stakeholder groups are thus treated differently in both practice and discourse. Stakeholder theory claims that institutions should be accountable to all those who are influenced by a company or can influence it. This logic contains two options for differentiating between stakeholders: by the degree of influence they wield over the company or by the degree to which they are influenced by it. Neither version, however, provides a sufficient explanation for why stakeholders should get access to different kinds of accountability mechanisms. The first option was later pursued, for example, by the original proponents of stakeholder theory. Edward Freeman and David Reed propose to recognise not only âstakeholders in the wider senseâ as defined earlier but also âstakeholders in the narrow senseâ. The latter are defined as âAny identifiable group or individual on which the organization is dependent for its survivalâ (Freeman and Reed, 1983, p. 91).16 This distinction based on the power of stakeholders generates results that are practically less problematic and provide a better match to current practice than the original formulation. But the match is not perfect. Even using the narrow definition, competitors must be recognised as stakeholders and the demand that they should have a right to hold an organisation"

New local leadership figures emerged, and social interaction and cohesion in the barrios increased (see StrÃ¸nen 2006, 2012). Moreover, it also increasingly socialized the popular sectors into the laws, language and procedures of the state, and created networks between the popular sectors and political figures. Local grassroots networks and electoral committees, organized around election time in support of the government, also added to the proximity between the government and popular sector activists. This became an important reference for the next phase of state-supported popular organization: the communal councils. The communal councils were institutionalized in 2006 through the Organic Law for the Communal Councils.3 The law was revised, also through an extensive popular consultation, and reapproved by the National Assembly in November of 2009. Communal councils are local neighborhood groups, organized around 200 to 400 families in urban areas (significantly less in rural and indigenous areas). They are granted the legal right to plan and implement local social and socio-economic projects as well as projects related to community housing and infrastructure. These projects are funded by the government through various agencies. A communal council is composed by three administrative committees4 and various thematic work committees. The citizen assembly is the maxima instancia de autoridad (highest authority) in the communal councils and composed by all members of the community. All members of the community above the age of 15 have the right to vote, and the elected members of the other committees have to abide by the citizen assemblyâs decisions. Thus, the community as a whole does not cede power to the elected members of the community councils. In order to highlight this aspect, elected members are not called representatives, but voceros and voceras (spokespeople). The members of the communal council are elected for an electoral cycle of two years. There is also a permanent electoral committee responsible for elections and revocation of mandates. It is up to the community to decide exactly which working committees they want to form; those suggested by the law are health, education,"

233,61,0.278,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Human Emotional Responses to the Natural World It is also claimed that biodiversity is valuable because the psychological makeup of human beings causes them to feel an intimate connection with the natural world which might be expressed variously in emotions such as love of, or respect for, nature. The idea that such emotional responses are a result of our evolved psychology was promoted by Wilson (1984) and Kellert and Wilson (1993). We note that the so-called Biophilia Hypothesis has received limited support in the literature (Simaika and Samways 2010 p. 903), but let us assume for the moment that we do share a common innate love of nature. There are two important problems with grounding conservation in common emotional responses. Firstly, such responses are not always reliable guides to rational action. There is after all some fundamental fact about human beings that also causes them to see cigarettes as valuable. We donât think that this implies that we should âconserveâ cigarettes, because we donât think that this common emotional response is adaptive. Human beings feel positively disposed toward all sorts of things that are not actually good for us. But if we must then judge the adaptiveness of our feelings toward biodiversity, it seems that conservation justiï¬ed thereby would not be a consequence of our feelings towards biodiversity, but rather of the utility of biodiversity to human populations (to which we turn shortly). Secondly, people clearly differ a great deal in the extent to which they feel positive emotions toward biodiversity (Einarsson 1993). If a general measure of biodiversity is to be inferred from emotional responses to biodiversity, then it seems that we will either have to discount the responses of outliers or average across a relatively large range of responses. Finally, this style of justiï¬cation for conservation suffers from the same problems as conservation based on intrinsic value. Even if it were true that almost everyone attached the same equally strong positive emotion to the conservation of the biosphere, it is hard to see how we could turn universal love of nature into a practically applicable general measure of biodiversity. For these reasons, we think it"

Freshwater conservation has therefore been a priority among environmental NGOs for decades. In fact, many local or national NGOs and initiatives were formed as a direct consequence of too little to no governmental action toward sustainable management of freshwater resources. Many international NGOs, such as WWF, also started to act because of the crucial role water resources play in the context of human development globally. They function as advocates for integration of local, regional, and international water policies, for a proper scienceâpolicy interface, and for adequate stakeholder involvement in decision-making in order to ensure that the needs of both nature and local communities are being met.

320,311,0.277,Managing Protected Areas in Central and Eastern Europe Under Climate Change,"10.6.2 Working Step: Revision of Existing Management and Management Plan The adaptation of protected area management should be based on a critical revision of the effectiveness of existing management. What must be evaluated is how well a protected area succeeds in managing the area under current climatic conditions, if management objectives and targets are reached and at what cost. Guidelines for assessing protected area management effectiveness (e.g. Hockings et al. 2006; Nolte et al. 2010) can be useful for this revision. Key questions for the revision of management are: â What are the main pressures on biodiversity, what problems exist and what activities and measures are available or implemented for improving conservation status? â Are sufficient data and staff available to fulfil all management tasks? â Is the area accepted and supported by local institutions, stakeholders and land users? Which groups have the strongest influence on the status of the protected area and cause non-climatic pressures on biodiversity? â Does the plan contain sufficient information about planned and implemented management measures for reaching a favourable conservation status of protected species and habitats? â Does it contain information about monitoring techniques and indicators used in monitoring the development of a protected area? Revision of the topical management activities provides important insight into the process of adaption because an adapted management plan should not only target climate-induced pressures and impacts but also cover existing pressures and problems in order to establish successful and efficient procedures. Available conservation plans and programmes have to be checked if they are up-to-date, complete and relevant to the upcoming day-to-day management decisions. They must be updated or amended in accordance with concepts of stakeholder dialogue, systematic monitoring or Adaptive Management activities. Reviews within the HABIT-CHANGE project revealed that most management plans are not sufficiently specific or detailed for climate adapted management. Usually, management activities within the protected areas are not all described in the plans, which are furthermore often out of date and do not contain measurable, time-bound objectives or measures. This makes it difficult to evaluate the success and effectiveness of management. None of the reviewed plans contained any information on climate change and its impacts or a comprehensive monitoring concept as a basis for evaluating management effectiveness and establishing the concept of Adaptive Management. It was also ascertained in the project that financial resources and manpower were often insufficient for fulfilling legal obligations. This is especially true for requirements derived from EU regulation, e.g. the EU-Habitats-Directive. Specific"

In most cases, mayors enjoy great closeness to their citizens and occupy an important position in communicating with the local community. Moreover, their close ties with the electorate result in a comparatively high confidence of the population in local government (Steininger 2006). Considering this framework of competences, we deduce that the disparity in the decision-making process on the one hand and the local responsibility for integration tasks on the other motivates municipal protest activities. Moreover, this gap provides incentives for institutional actors to express resistance against decisions of the upper levels of government in order to demonstrate solidarity with the local constituency."

The oath simply made this responsibility explicit and legally binding. Tielemans implicitly suggested that, by arguing to the contrary, Van Maanen had in fact denied the Fundamental Lawâs authority. He insisted that both ministerial responsibility and royal inviolability were inherent in constitutional government.84 The alternative was non-responsible government, or in other words, despotism. The radical politician Adelson Castiau made a similar argument in two pamphlets on ministerial responsibility.85 Putting the development of constitutional monarchy in a historical perspective, he emphasized the conceptual unity of royal inviolability and ministerial responsibility as a guarantee for responsible government and a bulwark against despotism. The monarch had received his hereditary mandate and his extensive powers from the Nation, and in return the Nation desired responsible government.86 Castiau, too, contented that these principles, although not being prescribed by the letter of the Fundamental Law, were clearly present in its spirit. Ministerial responsibility to Parliament was automatically implied by the idea of representative government, he argued: Let us never forget that representative government means the government of the opinion, and that as long as it will boldly and resolutely follow the constitutional ways opened up to its expression, the reign of unpopular ministers will be short.87"

In these two cases, South Africa demonstrated high-level political commitment, familiarity with the issues, and felt sufficiently involved as part of the key stakeholders to the process, which is in contrast to Darfur and Somalia, where its involvement is in solidarity with the international community and thus a posture in engagement of actors, and less political commitment. Today, with the South African Council of International Relations put in place to lead on discourses around foreign policy, there is lieu and time to broaden this discussion and work with the government toward addressing its challenges in policy implementation evidenced in the case of Somalia where a neat balance needs to be struck between meeting foreign policy objectives and responding to domestic challenges in manners where intervention is appreciated externally and its dividends well received by the South African populace."

329,16,0.275,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"In the chapter on changing government policies we will explain in greater detail why this is the case, but the simple answer is that within the Asian context, there is far less appetite to fund efforts that publicly criticize government. Although there has not been perfect harmony between the views of government and private businesses or individuals, they have often worked in tandem on aligned agendas related to economic growth. While that is true to an extent in other parts of the world, we will see throughout this book that there are important differences between Western civil society and Asian civic engagement. What are the roles of philanthropic and non-governmental, SDOs in Asia? The primary role is to help others in need because it is possible to do so. Helping others is an integral tenet of what it means to be human and has been promoted through the ages in civilizations around the world. The premise and intent are clear. More difficult to determine are the differences in definition and motivation between charity and philanthropy. Are they alike? Charity is the act of giving money, food, or other kinds of help to people who are poor, sick, or need other types of help. Philanthropy is an active effort to promote human welfare. In other words, philanthropy is a formalized and systematic process of being charitable. This book deals with organizations and organized, systematic approaches to helping those in need. The context for such efforts necessarily includes government. Individual and corporate philanthropy is on the rise, but it is a small amount compared to public spending. In the United States, with the largest and most active philanthropic sector in the world, American foundations together spent about $375 billion on all programs and sectors, compared to $3.8 trillion in federal spending for 2015. Of that federal money, more than $1 trillion went to health and human services. Private donations remain much smaller. This means that even in the United States, with the largest and most robust philanthropic organizations, private funds equal only a small fraction of the financial resources spent by the government. As a result, one effective use of philanthropic investment is in areas not ordinarily underwritten by government. This thinking results in pilot projects, basic research, riskier ventures in a variety of sectors, and much of the support for arts and humanities. Our research shows that in Asia, there is an implicit social contract at work. As will be described in greater detail later in the book, Asian philanthropy tends not to go to advocacy organizations, but is in line with"

We have argued that large-scale conservation decision-making would beneï¬t from agreement on a general measure of biodiversity, one that is not tied to particular projects or contexts. We have set out a group of broad categories of measurement strategies with the aim of determining whether one of these might furnish an appropriate general measure. In this section, we set out a similarly broad brush taxonomy of philosophical justiï¬cations for the conservation of biodiversity with the aim of determining whether any of those available might provide a justiï¬cation for conservation based on a general measure of biodiversity and hence might provide us with a basis for inference about the nature of such a general measure. We will argue that the best justiï¬cation is one that respects the plurality of human and non-human interests in biodiversity as well as uncertainty about how best to secure those interests and about future changes both in the environment and in human affairs. Philosophical justiï¬cations for the conservation of biodiversity come in many forms but all such arguments fall into one of four categories."

Then, a peace agreement was reached between the GPH and the MNLF in September 1996 (Sastrohandoyo 2008, 15â30). While it is understood that peace is a process, Indonesia has continued its role as part of the IMT since 2012. Until 2014, at least four teams were sent to monitor peace in this area. Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also played crucial facilitation roles. Muhammadiyah, an international nongovernmental organization (INGO) based in Indonesia, has participated in the International Contact Group, a hybrid mediation support initiative asked to provide support to the parties.6 Indonesia also attempted to act as a mediator in Southern Thailand between the Thai government and the Muslim groups residing in the southern part of the country. The Indonesian government, led by Vice President Jusuf Kalla (who now also serves as the Indonesian Vice President for the second time), managed to host a peace talk in Bogor in 2008 attended by Thai officials and representatives of insurgent groups. The effort did not produce an agreement and was later rejected by the Thai government since it insisted that the talks should be kept strictly domestic (The Jakarta Post 2010). Humanitarian Action While humanitarian action, including disaster relief, is normally separated from peacebuilding efforts, in the context of Indonesia, humanitarian assistance has been utilized to pave the way to conduct peacebuilding. This distinct feature has been created as a strategy to ensure that state sovereignty is respected, since humanitarian action is often considered less threatening than peacebuilding activities that can be perceived as challenging a governmentâs capacity to deal with post-conflict situations. Furthermore, humanitarian assistance can be crucial to gaining trust from the host countries, since such efforts are often viewed as a gesture of good will. Humanitarian assistance can also be utilized to share experiences with disaster and crisis management. Cyclone Nargis provides a good example of the usefulness of humanitarian assistance. In this context, Indonesia played a leading role in approaching the military junta in Myanmar and challenging it to open access to outside humanitarian aid to help the victims.

Most of the Dasanech communities that have been expropriated from their traditional lands along the lowermost Omo have no option but to take refuge within (or nearby) the modern Omo delta. This involuntary movement into the delta region greatly worsens the already crowded conditions there for agropastoralists and ï¬shing communities already settled there.14 â¢ The Ethiopian government forces respond with repressive measuresâoften, with brutalityâwhen Dasanech or Nyangatom communities resist expropriation from their riverine lands. Fear among villagers throughout the region is intensifying. Such political repression and the GOEâs denial of residentsâ access to river waters essential to their survival constitute human rights violations, as deï¬ned by the United Nations and other international bodies. A culture of fear pervades villages throughout the region where communities are already desperately searching for a means of survival. The response of the Kenyan government (GOK) to the survival plight of indigenous pastoralists and ï¬shers around Lake Turkana indicates a predominant attitude of indifference. This view is reflected in World Bank statements in internal documents, for example, citing the high likelihood of the GOK âoverlookingâ impacts of lake retreat on its indigenous population in favor of Gibe III dam electricity generated that is contracted for export to that âpower deï¬citâ nation."

Since the beginning of the 1970s, the Mauritius government has been committed in the SEZ development process by creating an enabling environment for investment and attracting FDI. Since their inception, the government has implemented two models of SEZs as turnaround strategies for their economy, that is, export processing zones and free port zones. The Mauritius government signed agreements to attract investors from China through joint ventures with local companies resulting in export-led growth and quick knowledge transfer (UNDP 2015: 11). In 2006, the government introduced the Business Facilitation Act to give more incentives to players in all sectors of the economy, and today, the whole country is regarded as an SEZ with the highest ease of doing business profile in the region according to the 2016 WB ranking."

72,263,0.272,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Conclusion This chapter has examined the link between citizen engagement and social innovation in the context of Seoul City. SMG was going through a rapid change in the way it worked with citizens under the leadership of Mayor Wonsoon Park. The motto âcitizens are mayorsâ was embedded in the new models of communication and citizen engagement was seen as one of the core elements that could catalyse social innovation. SMG was starting to understand that citizens were âexperts in their own livesâ (The Young Foundation, 2012) and that citizen involvement in the policy-making process helped to draw out social needs and identify potential solutions (Bason, 2010). In particular, the EunPyeoung Mobile Mayoral Office showed that bringing together key decision-makers with residents brought about deeper insights into the problem at hand. Furthermore, this type of engagement forged new collaborations and interactions between citizens, civil servants and policy makers, going beyond usual working partners, âcreating new roles and relationships, developing assets and capabilitiesâ and âbetter using assets and resourcesâ (The Young Foundation, 2012), thereby enhancing societyâs resilience and capacity to act. There were challenges to SMGâs citizen engagement and communication strategies. Due to the nature of the tools, there may have been limited representation of diverse voices. These tools may have been adequate for only a limited range of problems and were resource-intensive to administer. There was a need to ensure that long-term sustainability of these engagement approaches did not depend on one leader. Perhaps the biggest challenge lay in encouraging trust between citizens, public officers, civic groups and experts to work together and co-create new solutions. Past experiences led many South Koreans to think that citizen engagement processes were a waste of time and this created a sense of apathy towards citizen engagement activities."

266,174,0.271,Societal Implications of Community-Oriented Policing and Technology,"policing? While the term is omnipresent in across western policing discourse, an agreed and accepted definition of what it actually entails remains elusive (Cordner 1998). Despite this continued ambiguity, the core philosophy of community policing, and thus a common thread across all of its contemporary manifestations, can be distilled to focus on those activities which seek to forge working partnerships between the police and communities (Peak and Glensor 1996). While working in partnership with the community is a fundamental precept of community policing, actually forging and maintaining these relationships is a more complex and sensitive process than is often acknowledged. Different groups and communities are often so defined by the socio-cultural and socio-economic contexts that bring them together, meaning the requirements, in terms of enablers and barriers to successful collaboration, are disparate from one to the next, with no one-sizefits-all approach that can be implemented holistically. Moreover, community policing is a paradigm shift away from the normality of traditional police practice, meaning officers are often ill-equipped to overcome the unwillingness of communitiesâ to work with them and foster the working relationships which are so fundamental to the success of the approach (Sarre 1997). Thus, the challenge of working with communities that are considered disadvantaged or maligned is further accentuated by these factors, requiring organisational and cultural changes to foster engagement with the public and ultimately empower communities to participate in efforts to tackle local crime-related problems (Cameron and Laycock 2002)."

It reflects the strong commitment to integration and a transdisciplinary approach, embracing disciplines as diverse as physical oceanography, sediment dynamics, agriculture, demographics and poverty. Input of policy experts and a substantial array of stakeholders are also fundamental. This study provided opportunities for substantial learning across standard discipline boundaries, providing co-produced policy relevant outputs and insights. It also fostered a family of researchers who developed a shared understanding that could be applied to this difficult and challenging problem. This included effective sharing of knowledge and learning to question and contribute effectively outside an individualâs specialist field. Integration is core to what has been accomplished here bringing together natural and social sciences in ways that are distinct and groundbreaking. Such integration needs to start as the research is initiated and is an ongoing process. Integration needs to be core to the project with key questions and themes that are properly resourced. To be policy relevant, the research must be guided by the perspectives, needs and expertise encapsulated by local stakeholders, especially the decision-making processes and governance context of the deltas in question. Stakeholders from civil society, the non-government sector and of course agencies of government are all involved in policy formulation. Indeed, one of the outstanding successes of the ESPA Deltas collaboration, which is reflected in this book, has been the engagement with and the impact on the policy context of Bangladesh. The research has raised, for the first time, consideration of ecosystem services, their links to poverty and livelihoods and their influence in the national policy and planning process across a range of government agencies including the Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission and other government partners such as the Water Resources Planning Organization (WARPO). Indeed the Government of Bangladesh has requested continued engagement and further development of some of the modelling tools in the context of the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, which is a new national planning approach. Engaging with policy was always a main aspiration of the research and is perhaps the aspect of which we are most proud. The research provides both the foundation and analyses which has led to some of its most innovative approaches and significant insights. This book offers an overarching and integrated framework to analyse changing"
99,144,0.27,Social Innovations in the Urban Context,"government (1997â2010) maintained the focus on community involvement and promoted a âjoined upâ approach to urban regeneration, and central government funds were allocated on the basis of need. Birmingham has had a wide range of these regeneration and renewal programmes and initiatives over the years targeting both the city centre and neighbourhood areas. The Coalition government (2010â present) greatly reduced the funding available for existing programmes from 2010 and phased out the initiatives of the previous national government which impacted significantly on the cityâs ability to continue welfare projects. Devolved Decision-Making In 2003, the Labour group took a decision to devolve some services and governance; devolved decision-making at a local level or âlocalisationâ was and is seen as the most effective way of defining social problems and coming up with appropriate solutions. Localisation in this context means giving local areas more freedom to design services according to local needs and priorities, services such as leisure, housing, neighbourhood advice, libraries and youth and adult services. In the following year, the political party in control of the council changed and the governing coalition did attempt to introduce a version of devolution at various points in their administration. Alongside this, in 2005 disturbances occurred in certain areas of Birmingham partly as a result of racial tensions which resulted in the council focusing on efforts to engage certain communities with the democratic process. There was a process of capability-building to help the dialogue between the council and the affected communities to lead and shape local programmes to address social issues. It was not until 2008 though that responsibility and budgets for a number of services were devolved to district committees across the city (11 then 10). However, locally there was a view that the policy âlost its wayâ as no real decisions were made about changing the way services were delivered such as using the third sector or basing provision on established local priorities. The loss of funding from central government for neighbourhood management was seen as one of the reasons for this as these council employees based in local areas had initially supported the process. In 2010, there was a consultation about continuing with local decision-making and retaining executive powers with district committees, and all parties were keen to pursue the existing model. The Labour Party since their return to power in Birmingham has set out their intention to âreinvigorateâ localisation, and restructuring of the council included a return to having a local services directorate with a framework to deliver localisation. The aim is for 80 % of council services to sit out with the district committees. This is taking place in the context of a national government localism agenda which as one council officer stated is about âcommunity-led interventions and the state not being so necessaryâ. Social Inclusion In 2010 and 2011, a number of factors came together which led to issues of social inclusion being brought to the fore in a way they had not before. Be Birmingham raised concerns about the continued existence of significant inequalities across the city after the publication of the Closing the Gap report (Be Birmingham 2011); in 2011 disturbances once again occurred in Birmingham, and unprecedented budget"

We mention these technical aspects last not to suggest that they are the least important factor to be considered. We do this to emphasize that they are only among many factors and, probably in the eyes of planners and managers, not the most decisive or influential (Ahearne 1988; Carey 1988; Pool 1990; Thissen and Walker 2013; Walker 1987). So, does the scientiï¬c, technical, systematic approach to modeling for planning and management really matter? We believe it can if it addresses the issues of concern to their clients, the planners, and managers. Analysts need to be prepared to interact with the political or social structure of the institutions they are attempting to assist, as well as with the public and the press. Analysts should also be prepared to have their work ignored. Even if analysts are presenting âfactsâ based on the current state of the sciences, sometimes these sciences are not considered relevant. Happily for scientists and engineers, this is not always the case. The challenge of modelers or analysts interested in having an impact on the performance of water resource systems is to become a part of the largely political planning and management process and to contribute towards its improvement."
341,91,0.27,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"There has been little evaluation of the effectiveness, costs and benefits of stakeholder engagement in the water sector, because this type of analyses is relatively new to the public sector. Evaluation has generally remained on an ad hoc basis, potentially because stakeholder engagement has often been carried out as an âaddonâ to conventional processes, or a tick-the-box approach is frequently being used to comply with existing legislation and rules. Assessing stakeholder engagement should not be considered as an end in itself but should serve a broader purpose of improving the process and its outcomes. It â Strengthen the accountability of decision-makers, by measuring whether public and institutional resources, including stakeholdersâ time and effort, are effectively utilised â Assist in determining whether the engagement process was successful and in drawing up an inventory of the lessons learnt towards future improvement â Map out the potential challenges that may be encountered (e.g. divergent perspectives regarding flood defence measures between land planners, property owners and government authorities or regarding water resource allocation between farmers, industries and environmentalists) Some difficulties may be experienced when evaluating stakeholder engagement. First, there is a lack of comprehensive frameworks of agreed-upon evaluation methods and reliable measurement tools. Second, there is a wide variety in the design and goals of engagement processes; therefore, evaluation frameworks should be general enough to apply across different types of processes, yet specific enough to have value for learning and practice. Third, stakeholder engagement is an inherently complex and value-laden concept; hence there are no widely held criteria for judging the success and failure of engagement efforts both in terms of process and outcomes. Evaluation tools are increasingly being used to measure the success of engagement efforts. Multi-stakeholder meetings help to collect feedback on the level of performance of engagement processes; evaluation reports record the process (successes, failures, lessons learnt) and allow for analysis to improve future engagement processes. When publicly disclosed, these reports can shed light on how stakeholdersâ inputs were used and whether engagement was worthwhile. Other tools such as polls and surveys can provide information for assessing the engagement process, such as levels of satisfaction. Some stakeholder categories (e.g. civil society) use evaluation mechanisms more often than others. There may be a perception that customer feedback on a given stakeholder engagement process, particularly in terms of complaints, should be avoided. However, complaints can be useful warning signs that the process can be improved."

73,293,0.269,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"In many cases it will be necessary to use very different approaches to achieve the required level of engagement to get meaningful NRM outcomes. This may include things like tapping into existing community groups that have little or nothing to do with NRM (e.g. local childcare centre, dog training groups, pony clubs, and CFA/ Rural Fire Brigade). The purpose of engaging through these non-conventional channels is simply to connect with people who may have an interest in the NRM work. Many new landholders are moving into peri-urban landscapes and they may have no connection to traditional environment groups such as Landcare and may not have a good knowledge of the local environment (Mendham and Curtis 2010). Engagement may need to begin at a very basic level of simply making a connection to landholders through any channel in order to identify whether they have any interest in the local environment and NRM."

These countries have a well-established reputation among vacationers worldwide, world-class infrastructure, world-class connectivity, and milder climates affording longer tourism seasons. It took a grand vision, an enormous effort, and tremendous teamwork to make it happen, but it did happen.

Rather, the big vision was that all stakeholders in the country â the population, investors, local businessmen, and civil servants â would rally around and work toward a common goal: building a better Georgia â a country that is free of corruption, has a highly efï¬cient government, and acts as a hub in its region.

221,35,0.268,Enabling Asia to Stabilise the Climate,"significantly depending on a countryâs perspective of what is âfair.â Thus, for âlowcarbon governanceâ that will achieve large, long-term reductions in GHG emissions in order to achieve the 2  C target, national commitments are important, but it is also important that other nongovernmental stakeholders make voluntary commitments, depending on their ability to do so. Also, it will be important to create institutional designs that will allow mainstreaming of low-carbon policy, in an integrated way, of the frameworks that have so far been built on a sector-by-sector basis. And, based on them, it will be important to create efficient administrative management frameworks. Notably, many Asian countries have formulated action plans to become LCSs, but in many cases the plans are not being implemented, or, even if they are being implemented, the effects are limited. In some cases, government fraud or corruption due to inadequate legislation or governance results in a failure to effectively utilize physical, economic, and human resources. Also, due to inadequacies in governmentsâ management philosophy or concepts, it is not uncommon to see redundancy of policies and measures by different government ministries and agencies or inadequate sharing of information. In this context, as a national-level initiative to establish LCSs in Asia, it is necessary to build the foundations of transparent and accountable government and to institute corruption prevention measures in the public sector, including central and local (municipal) governments. Meanwhile, the international community is expected to provide support to accelerate those efforts at the national level. For example, the World Bank and other institutions have developed frameworks for country-specific evaluations of public sector policies and institutions, and attempts are being made to reflect these efforts in their international assistance. Thus, strengthening the role of the international community in encouraging improvements in public sector management in Asian countries could be a major step forward to implement policies and measures proposed under Actions 1 through 9 of this document. Also, as described below, Asian countries are characterized by the diversity of their political systems, and they need to plan and implement policies not only for sustainable development but also other development objectives, such as reducing health problems and poverty. In many cases, the differences between countries are mainly in scale, but they have much in common. Thus, there is a need for intergovernmental policy coordination in the planning and implementation of policies that have some compatibility between development objectives and GHG emission reductions. Regarding the public-private sector relationship, in the past there has been excessive protection of government-related and/or certain private companies. However, it is important to establish healthy public-private partnerships by establishing objective standardization and certifications."
169,701,0.267,Riverine Ecosystem Management : Science For Governing Towards a Sustainable Future (Volume 8.0),"Both Eco Masterplans I and II were designed to designate the ecological sensitivity of Austrian rivers and subsequently identify protection priorities with respect to the future use of water resources. The four underlying criteria were the ecological status, the situation in a protected area, the hydromorphological status, and the length of the free-ï¬owing section (WWF Austria 2009, 2010). Springing from these initiatives, the Eco Masterplan III (WWF Austria 2014) provides the fundamentals for an effective âHydropower Masterplan,â in which the options and limitations for the expansion of hydropower in Austria are investigated from an ecological and energyeconomic perspective. Due to subsequent scenario development, different degrees of expansion with the corresponding ecological consequences and energy-economic implications can be illustrated and discussed on a national scale for the ï¬rst time. One key element of the Eco Masterplan III is the decision support tool âHY: CONâ (HYdropower and CONservation) developed by the IHG (Seliger et al. 2016; Scheikl et al. 2016): HY:CON represents a strategic and transparent methodological approach to balance the energy-economic attractiveness of planned hydropower projects and the conservation needs of the river stretches that are affected by these projects. In total, 39 ecological criteria were used to assess the ecological sensitivity of sites earmarked for power plant construction. Due to the high number of single criteria, almost all of the 102 investigated hydropower projects overlapped with at least one criterion. In order to avoid an overestimation of the ecological sensitivity, related criteria was assigned to one out of eight thematic groups: (1) ecological status; (2) hydromorphological condition; (3) river continuity; (4) ï¬oodplains; (5) situation in a legally binding protection area, where new hydropower projects are prohibited by law; (6) situation in another designated protected area; (7) actual habitats of key species (endangered and/or indicator species); and (8) key habitats (see Table 23.1). In order to cover possible future trends regarding the prioritization of conservation and river ecological aspects, different scenarios were developed. To evaluate the conï¬ict potential of hydropower projects with regard to the conservation need of a river stretch, each criterion was classiï¬ed according to its protection priority. These scorings were a function of the priority given to conservation objectives in the scenarios (minimal conservation up to high conservation). Depending on the scenario, the scoring ranged from âlow conservation valueâ to âexclusion of further hydropower development.â If no âexclusionâ criterion was affected, the ï¬nal evaluation was conducted by calculating the mean of the highest-rated criteria per thematic group. The energy-economic assessment of recorded hydropower project is geared to the âclassicâ energy-economic, optimization principles of economic, safe, and environmentally friendly electricity supply and is based on the criteria for assessing hydropower projects in energy-economic terms. Finally, the results of the energy-economic assessment were interrelated with the results of each conservation scenario (Fig. 23.2). The results show that, not only in the âhigh conservationâ scenario but even in the âmoderate conservationâ scenario, a large share of planned hydropower projects was in conï¬ict with exclusion criteria"

Analogously, government accountability increases significantly with lobbying, with the accountability level decreasing by approximately 50% for the no lobbying scenario compared to the base-run scenario (see Fig. 9). Interestingly, the positive impact of lobbying does not change significantly if different lobby structures are assumed. Hence, as demonstrated in Fig. 9, for the CSO scenario, the majority of performance indicators remain unchanged (e.g., they lie on the 0% line in Fig. 9). The only exemptions are accountability (GA-total), which improves by 20%, and the dominance of donor organization (PO-donor), which is significantly reduced when changing form donor-dominated to CSO- or farm-dominated lobbying structures.13 As described above, the high own control of politicians is a characteristic feature of the CAADP policy process in Malawi, which implies that politicians rely primarily on their own expertise when making policy choices. As demonstrated in Fig. 9, increasing the importance of public discourse for the political belief updating of politicians would imply that wisdom of the crowd effects can be better exploited in Malawi. Thus, in particular, the effective use of political knowledge would increase significantly. Please note that in this context, increasing the physical participation of stakeholders fails to automatically guarantee higher political influence of stakeholders because the political influence of stakeholders only results if politicians in fact update their beliefs based on the political views and opinions communicated by national stakeholders. Thus, as long as stakeholder participation is only formally imposed, as is partially true for the CAADP process in Malawi, the impact on performance is rather limited. A change in the political culture such that politicians increasingly consider the potential political expertise of national stakeholders is needed. However, in this context, a warning also appears necessary. An increase in the effective participation of national stakeholders in political communication only triggers wisdom of the crowd effects and improves political performance if stakeholders have a relatively high political knowledge in comparison to their total political power. Our analysis indicates that this scenario is relevant for Malawi, but this scenario does not necessarily hold true for other countries. Finally, shifting legislative power from the government to the parliament implies a trade-off between increased political ownership and sharply decreased effective use of political knowledge. In contrast, political incentives (i.e., accountability and capture) are only slightly changed by this power shift (see the party leadership scenario in Fig. 9). Basically, this result follows from the fact that in contrast to governmental organizations, parliamentary parties have significantly less political knowledge (see Fig. 10 in the appendix). Hence, although these parties are generally more open to political opinions communicated by other organizations in the political discourse (i.e., parties have a lower own control), the overall effect of this"

Such public involvements also can infuse public values into technology development discussions and are essential for a healthy democracy (e.g., Rip & Robinson, 2013; Wilsdon & Willis, 2004). Public engagement with science can increase the public understanding, appreciation, and opportunity to argue for or against acceptance of emerging science and technology advances (e.g., Gastil, 2017). There is, therefore, great hope for the value of public engagement. In contrast to the great hope for engagement, there is a dearth of science about engagement. As we have argued previously (PytlikZillig & Tomkins, 2011), simply deploying listening sessions or other types of engagement with the public may not suffice: It is essential to ascertain what is a successful engagement, what works to ensure successful engagements, in what contexts, and why. As noted in Chap. 1, and as underscored by our own unwillingness to offer a hard-and-fast definition, the concept of âpublic engagementâ itself is ill-defined. Currently, public engagement encompasses everything from opinion surveys to information campaigns, to interactive museum exhibits, to citizen science, to voting behavior, and to deliberative discussion. The definition of âpublicâ is also broad and wide ranging. Consider, for example, that public engagement through deliberation can involve dialogues among or between peers, policymakers, technologists, scientists, and many other stakeholders. Furthermore, engagement methods and terminology used to describe those methods within studies of public engagement are widely varied; numerous dimensions of public engagement have been proposed without much consensus on which dimensions are most important to future research agendas; potential differences and opportunities for engaging marginalized populations for the most part have not been the target of theory or extended empirical focus (but see Young, 2002); and current categories of public engagement effectiveness criteria do not easily lend themselves to suggesting theories that would advance understanding of how various forms of public engagement work for different purposes and aims. Given all these challenges, whatever is an aspiring public engagement researcher to do? Our work provides but one example of an approach forward. For our research, we functionally operationalized our engagements as deliberations about a target (learning about and assessing nanotechnology/synthetic biology) using accessible and appropriately thorough written materials as part of a class to inform studentsâ decisionmaking as part of specifically designed tasks (see Chap. 2). We hope in the future much of what we need to know about public engagements we will know because experimental methods and valid assessments reveal what works to ensure engagements are successful according to clear criteria, under what circumstances, and why. We hope that a science of public engagement will answer questions that go beyond our current data, such as whether, when, and why: Face-to-face encounters are or are not preferable to online engagements. Written materials are or are not a more effective way of providing background information than a brief video. Engagement discussions are or are not more productive in small groups than in town hall formats. Bringing people together in the real, versus the virtual, world enhances certain outcomes and so on."
395,48,0.266,Beyond Safety Training : Embedding Safety in Professional Skills,"Abstract Constructing rules for work that foster both health and safety and efï¬cient production entails, in many organisations, the introduction of procedures, tools and techniques implemented by specialists. The purpose of this is to combat the amateur practices and lack of expertise supposedly found not only amongst employees, but also in their managers. This chapter argues that, on the contrary, ï¬eld managers possess knowledge about working conditions and are actors who are necessarily involved in organising those conditions as well as the work of their teams. In so doing, they protect employees from or expose them to the real and varying circumstances of work. This is the role that needs to be reinforced in order for safety rules to become a real part of work cultures and working practices. However, the forms of power in organisations increasingly limit the recognition of this expertise in the work of managers. The chapter advocates the importance of giving managers power to set situated organisational rules, instead of making these the exclusive prerogative of central management departments.

Initial efforts to have stakeholders identify interventions, irrespective of modelling capacity, were unsuccessful as stakeholders defaulted to the policies they already knew and understood. For example, stakeholder recommendations included mainstreaming poverty reduction in all development projects, proper implementation of the national social protection scheme and capacity development of local government. As these could not be analysed in the models, a series of suggestions that could be analysed were subsequently provided to stakeholders in advance of their technical discussions. These proposals included renegotiation of the Farakka Treaty, construction of the Ganges Barrage, changing polder height and other structural interventions to manage flooding and sea-level rise, improved drainage to reduce waterlogging, groundwater use policies, land zoning policies, new potential crops and subsidies for farming. Unfortunately however, this appeared to drive group discussions and frame their proposed interventions, instead of providing indicative suggestions. It remains a challenge to have stakeholders identify interventions that are outside of existing sectoral approaches or beyond research-driven suggestions. It is for this reason that the iterative learning loop and integrated model approach (Fig. 9.1) are particularly valuable, as stakeholders have multiple opportunities to engage. After developing the inputs, they see the modelled results of their sector-driven interventions in terms of broader impacts across ecosystem services and livelihoods. They are then able to propose alternative interventions that are able to respond more directly to the integrated model results considering cross-sectoral impacts. With the application of the integrated model to test specific interventions in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, this process is ongoing. The continuation of this work demonstrates the success of the approach."

There is an ambiguity in Norwegian government policy in this ï¬eld: The aim of supporting ethnic community-based organizations is not to strengthen the group as such, but rather to use the organizations as an arena to nudge individual children and youth towards civic and political participation in the Norwegian mainstream society. According to Berkaak (2012) the Norwegian policy is both ambiguous and vague, and when this policy is gradually implemented it might lead to measures that counteract each other in practice."

As a result, progress in improving ï¬shing methods is blocked by lack of capacity to learn or to organize. In the face of poor inter-level communication and sporadic or absent monitoring, the use of illegal equipment and ï¬shing practices only mounts. It is hard to imagine how trust in governance can be built to strengthen compliance with laws and policies under such conditions, and evidence of this eroding trust is that in some areas local ï¬shermen have swung their allegiance from republican to traditional authorities. Traditional authorities still constitute legitimate local sources of governance. Traditional institutions play a vital role in reafï¬rming the identity of communities reliant on aquatic ecosystems and thereby broadly inï¬uence water and ï¬sh management. However, the current governance structure has failed to link and harmonize republican and traditional sources. And efforts to decentralize have been poorly implemented, e.g., local management committees lack the funding to even meet regularly, or have been taken over by special economic or political interests, i.e., elite capture. The governmental bodies responsible for the ï¬sheries sector are unaware of womenâs speciï¬c role in the ï¬sheries management. Consequently they did not consider females adequately as crucial actors in their strategic and political programs. SUSFISHs sociological research on ï¬sh as an important income-generating resource shed light on women as important preserving stakeholders (e.g., systempreserving functions) in the economic, nutrition, and health domains. Interdisciplinary work revealed important cross-sectoral activities, interrelated power relations, and hindering factors that play key roles in the value chain issue of the resource ï¬sh in BF. However, notwithstanding their important economic role, since women are excluded from decision-making processes on local levels, the focus of future analysis should be oriented toward the impeding factors emerging from incomplete or misguided education, structures of associations, and power asymmetries. These ï¬ndings resulted in the draft of a strategy for the integration of these aspects in the ï¬sheries management policies, which was developed in SUSFISH. By law there are two kinds of status of ï¬sheries based on management type: concession and PHIE (Perimetre Halieutique dâIntÃ©rÃªt Economique), i.e., a ï¬shery that impacts the national economy. But actually, there are three categories of ï¬sheries management: very large reservoirs that never dry out and ï¬shing continues for much of the year [PHIE; BagrÃ©, Kompienga, Sourou, Ziga, ToÃ©cÃ©, Douna, Yakouta, Sirba (eight reservoirs) and Lake Bam] and concessions and âothersâ that have no legal status. Note: subsistence ï¬sheries exist in all three categories mentioned above. Besides this, by law there are four categories of ï¬sheries deï¬ned according to the use of the catch: commercial, subsistence, sport, and scientiï¬c. According to SUSFISH ï¬ndings, this categorization does not reï¬ect the status quo. Besides subsistence ï¬sheries all other categories are not represented signiï¬cantly. Into what category a ï¬shery falls depends on how national policies are prioritizedâthe PHIE are ânationally importantâ reservoirs, whereas the latter are more âsubsistence levelâ ï¬shing for local markets (Fig. 27.5).

140,166,0.265,R.J. Rummel : An Assessment of His Many Contributions,"Rummelâs work is an integrated worldview: its foundation is that the kind of government is of utmost importance to its own citizens (will our government kill us?) and other countries (will there be war?), so Rummel can by synthesized: regime type matters. This bridges the empirical democratic peace with a powerful prescription: if you want peace, and life, you must choose the regime type that protects it best: democracy. From this worldview comes one general principle, that democracy is a powerful and reliable method of nonviolence, and ï¬ve associated propositions, best set forth in Rummel (1997): ï¬rst, a pair of democracies do not make war on each other; second, the more democratic any two countries, the less their bilateral violence; and third, the more democratic a country, the fewer its own casualties in war. These are about international relations. The fourth is internal: the more democratic a country, the less internal political violence. Finally, the more democratic a country, the less its democide. Ending war and mass murder, and building positive peace, are the highest goals of secular life, and because Rummel offers empirically valid, theoretically sound, practical solutions to that end, I view Rummel as one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century. To understand this I have found Chadwickâs (2006) Goal-Drift-Actual framework invaluable. The GDA model centers on science, philosophy, and praxis, integrating political science (the empirical, what we know), political philosophy (theory, our understanding and convictions), and political action (what we do). The GDA is a powerful alternative to Johan Galtungâs Diagnosis-Prognosis-Therapy (DPT) model, which treats human interactions as illnesses to be cured. The GDA is less arrogant, lacking the DPTs presumptive privilege of the analyst as wise doctor, and from a power-limiting, freedom-favoring perspective, the GDA is a preferred model. Using the GDA to look at Rummelâs work we ï¬nd extensive political science in his robust empirical work that was essential to establish the democratic peace. There is highly developed political philosophy, from the âthe conflict helixâ (Rummel, 1991), to the three levels of explanation for democracy as a method of nonviolence (Rummel, 1997). Regarding praxis, Rummel argues that because of the science of the democratic peace, and the conviction that democracy reliably reduces violence, there is an imperative to âfoster freedom.â This integration, linked by regime type, offers a transformative politics, transcending realism and liberalism, while negating neither. For Rummel, realism must understand that democracies behave differently, and liberalism must understand that peace is best achieved among democracies."
164,537,0.265,"Marginality : Addressing the Nexus of Poverty, Exclusion and Ecology","From a political economy perspective, the use of own taxes at the margin is critical for ensuring that the electorates of a locality, region, or country hold governments responsible for their spending. It is through the need to raise additional revenues to meet spending needs that there is a clearer political linkage between spending and financing. This is clearest in the case of debt incurred. Without the ability to raise additional revenues in order to meet future repayments and liabilities, a local government is able to pass liability on to the central or other government levels and related sanctions are just not credible (Ambrosiano and Bordignon 2006). In such cases there are no hard budget constraints or accountability for spending. Typically in developing countries there has been relatively little focus on designing adequate sources of subnational own-source revenues (see Ahmad and Brosio 2006, 2009 for a discussion of developing countries). Split bases, such as the Goods and Services Tax on services in Pakistan are not generally workable, as the crediting and refunding mechanisms are difficult to handle by subnational governments"
242,1143,0.265,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","For the research team that has been involved in studying Nicaraguan migrants in Costa Rica, various challenges have come up in the attempt to intervene in policy formulation, the critique of imaginaries, and community work. The first one refers to the ethical dimension, and relates to the responsibility that follows from listening. In other words, listening does not just involve attentively following what the migrants are saying, but it also involves raising questions about the ways in which what was said could be translated to decision-makers. Here there seems to be an important challenge for the social sciences, since needs assessments are frequent, and most often agree in their main conclusions, but there is usually no great willingness to follow up on the demands that are identified. A second challenge consists of the possibilities of creating work teams in which colleagues with different backgrounds can contribute to the research work and the ways in which the main findings can influence public policies, but also to the political work in a broader sense. The demands posed by the communities recall the tensions that arise from the relations between those social science perspectives most centred on analytical or comprehensive perspectives and those most interested in normative perspectives. Such tensions become more alive when what they are dealing with is not so much reproducing the analytical/normative distinction, but linking and articulating findings and policy-making (or politics) based on concrete situations and cases."

In concrete terms, conservation standards are determined according to a formula (called the âtop-runner methodâ) that takes into account such factors as the performance of the item among products currently commercialized that has the best energy efficiency (i.e., the top-runner), and future projections of technological development. If a company continues to sell a product that does not meet the standards without sufficient reason, the companyâs name may be published and fines may be levied. Goods made subject to these regulations were mainly home electrical appliances and automobiles; the energy efficiency of these items has since seen great progress. For example, the energy reduction of air conditioners was noted above. Because the achievement of higher regulatory standards increases the competitive power of products, these policies are evaluated highly for having created strong incentives for energy conservation. In the 2013 revision to the Energy Conservation Law, building materials with enhanced insulation properties were also included in the top-runner system. Also, in 2012 the Japanese Government decided on a policy making it mandatory for all newly constructed buildings (homes, office buildings, etc.) to comply with energy conservation standards by the year 2020. In the future, the rapid realization of these insulation mandates will lead to innovations that serve to boost the competitiveness of the construction industry. In this way, a rational technological prediction contrasting theory and technology is indispensable for examining regulations and their economic impact."
376,986,0.264,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","water, and mineral resources, and increased conflicts (Turner et al. 2014). There is growing recognition within policy circles of the importance of the livestock sector and livestock mobility, especially in the context of climate change (Bonnet and HÃ©rault 2011). This has led to national (RÃ©publique du Mali 2001; Wabnitz 2006) and international (CRCM 2013) laws, policies, and agreements in support of pastoral livelihoods and tenure rights. These initiatives are important, but they alone cannot lead to a significant transformation of pastoral rights. Significant political and institutional questions have to also be addressed for effective implementation (Brottem 2013). In general, local understanding and enforcement of existing laws are weak. Some newly organized formal community-based rangeland management groups have creatively circumvented these challenges by working closely with their local government to obtain use rights over defined pasture areas, create their own management plans, and then lobby local government to pass an ordinance or decree that gives certain elements of their plan the force of law (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez et al. 2012; Upton 2008, 2009). For example, if a group of herders wants to rest a certain pasture area for a season, they ask the local government to issue an edict forbidding grazing in that area for the rest of the season, with violations punishable by a fine.28 Mongolia. The pasturelands of Mongolia are state property used in common by the herders within a given administrative district. Privatization of pasture is unconstitutional, but herders may obtain long-term private leases on nomadic winter and spring campsites (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez and Batbuyan 2004; Upton 2009). Mongoliaâs Law on Land contains provisions related to pastureland tenure and management, devolving most decisions and authority to regulate stocking rates and seasonal movements to the local level (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez and Batbuyan 2004). Under Mongolian law, organized groups of herders may obtain collective use agreements for defined areas of pasture, but âuseâ does not denote the right to exclude other potential users. Pastureland âpossessionâ would confer exclusive rights to a given pasture area, but pasture possession is not authorized under the current law.Mobility has been a hallmark of Mongolian pastoralism for centuries and continues to be an important strategy today. Mobility patterns historically have varied widely across the country, depending largely on local topography and climate. During the collective era, the collectives allocated pasture to their member herders and both regulated seasonal movements and provided transportation for moves (FernÃ¡ndez-GimÃ©nez 1999). In addition, collectives arranged for long-distance moves in weather disasters such as severe winter storms. Following privatization of livestock and the dismantling of collectives, no formal institutions have filled the role of allocating pasture and enforcing seasonal mobility, although the current law"

The first, and the most important, is sharing. Fully aware of differences between the two countries, the idea behind this sharing is to provide Myanmar, once an isolationist state, with real evidence that transition into a democratic civilian-led government is not an impossible idea, as demonstrated in the Indonesian case. It is always debatable whether Indonesiaâs past experience, with its dual-function military and semi-authoritarian regime, is a good example to present. However, one argues that at least the Indonesian case presents an alternative to the Myanmarâs leaders for the country to follow in walking the path of limited democratic reform and economic development (Renshaw 2013). Based on interviews with several Indonesian stakeholders, the âsharingâ activities conducted so far are aimed not only to share best practices, but also more importantly discuss Indonesiaâs mistakes of the past, which should not to be repeated in Myanmar. Moreover, by elucidating the concept of âsharingâ, Indonesia positions itself not as being superior to its Myanmar counterpart, with the former dictating to the latter, but rather as a partner on equal footing."

They also helped to ensure that research results were acceptable and directly beneficial to the target community. A key project output was the development of a participatory tool, âMpangâameâ, a simulation game that helps stakeholders identify and reflect on appropriate actions for better NRM practices. At the local level, the game was disseminated to schools, vocational institutions, local government leaders and policymakers within various fora. At regional and international levels, the game was disseminated at meetings for AFROMAISON partners and NRM stakeholders in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mali, South Africa, Tunisia, as well as to graduate students in France, on special request from university administrators. Other dissemination channels included articles published in the International Journal of Innovation Sciences, book chapters, brochures, leaflets and the project website. According to Arseni Semana, principal investigator of AFROMAISON in Uganda, the main challenges that the project encountered were related to the attitudes of the communities (CAAST-Net Plus 2014, p. 32). There was slow adoption of integrated NRM practices mainly because of the commercial culture that has emerged within the beneficiary communities. NGOs facilitate communitiesâ participation in NRM planning and implementation. As a result, it is almost impossible to engage the communities without attaching a monetary incentive. Private sector involvement is still minimal and participating private sector players are mainly informal and micro. Nonetheless, the project held a consultative meeting between the ministries of agriculture, animal industry and fisheries, and water and environment to enhance policy level integration of NRM using tools from the research. This constitutes a more valuable, critically reflective account of the relationship between the projectâs outputs and outcomes, and one which integrates key contextual factors to explain the barriers and constraints to achieving the intended impacts. Overall, we a found that statements of âintended impactâ are often more akin to aspirations expressed by project designers and managers. In most cases, these aspirations do little more than offer rhetorical support to wider climate and development targets, such as the MDGs. As such, there is generally no explicit explanation of how these impacts canâeven theoreticallyâbe achieved. Instead, there is a significant level of assumed attribution; that is, broad statements about how the research projectâs focus relates to the wider issues and how it contributes knowledge necessary to tackle these challenges vis-Ã -vis the stated aims and objectives."

Van Meenen and his followers were shocked to ï¬nd that the Fundamental Law did not allow Parliament to hold the government accountable for its actionsâ especially given the absence of parliamentary initiative for the prosecution of ministers.62 LâObservateur began a campaign of systematic opposition to the government, lobbying for ministerial responsibility and freedom of the press. In the face of the increasingly autocratic government of William I, this initiative failed to achieve practical results, but it did succeed in laying the theoretical groundwork for the large-scale Belgian opposition of later years. LâObservateurâs last issue appeared in 1820. In the same year the Estates General approved the decennial budget, their only real check on government policy. The opposition did not manage to take a stand in the following years, despite its protest against the Conflict Law of 1822 and the continued postponement of the creation of a High Court for the judgment of ministers. The Estates General were too divided along North-South lines to allow for organized opposition against the government.63 Moreover, economic prosperity in the South took away much of the oppositional drive. The middle of the 1820s marked a turnabout. In 1815, political consciousness in Belgium had been relatively limited, a majority of the population remaining indifferent towards politics, but around the middle of the next decade, a new generation of liberal intellectuals entered the scene. These men were mostly born and educated under French or Dutch rule and had no active memories of the Old Regime.64 The ï¬rst sign of the growing political awareness of this group was the foundation of the newspaper Mathieu Laensberg in LiÃ¨ge, which commented critically on political and constitutional issues.65 These younger liberals remained strongly under the influence of the older generation who had already embraced modern constitutional theory, especially as formulated by Benjamin Constant.66 Around the same time, a fundamental shift, triggered by recent political events, occurred within the Catholic intelligentsia and the Catholic opposition embraced a liberal-constitutional discourse.67 Both oppositional movements joined forces in 1827. From 1828 on, debate between the Belgian opposition and the government flared up, both in the Estates General and in the press. The question of accountability of government was central to the controversy. This issue came to the fore in debates"
10,175,0.262,Governance For Drought Resilience : Land and Water Drought Management in Europe,"seen to be highly political and highly insensitive to the lived experiences of flooding recovery (Medd et al. 2014). After all, water is materially and socially a highly emotive subjectâwhether through its overabundance, its lack, or when polluted (Sultana 2011). As can be seen in the Somerset case, the use, control and conflicts around water shape peoples everyday experiences with water (Sultana 2011). Water in complex landscapes such as Somerset have substantial emotive aspects, as discussion of its control and use intersects with experiences of place, livelihoods, and social, economic, political and environmental futures. It is these futures that are directly being intervened with in both longer term planning (such as water resource management plans, drought plans), and emergency management and policies that emerge during and after periods of crisis. Whittle et al. (2012) have captured strongly the emotional work that occurs simultaneously to the practical work in restoring built and natural environments after a flooding event. Clearly then the discussion of the future of water scarcity for an area such as Somerset at a time when the whole region is concentrating on recovering from a period of water abundance is an emotive and contested conversation. Nonetheless, it is a fundamentally important one. Despite these restrictions in this broader governance system, the pilot measures initiated by a number of stakeholders in the Somerset region (cp. Sect. 5.3) demonstrate a positive example of the sorts of water management activities that can bridge across the policy silos of flood and drought even in a period of âdisaster recoveryâ. Far from just satisfying certain WFD requirements for participation and catchment management, these initiatives reflect concrete attempts to change the experiences of stakeholders and engagements with the breadth of water management issues facing their region now and into the future. These are highly politicised and emotive processesâthey tap into conversations about âwhat the Somerset Levels and Moors are forâ; highlighting conflicts between protection of people, agriculture and nature; and arguably reflect the ongoing entrenchment of neoliberal and meta-governance failures in relations to drought and water scarcity across England (Walker 2014). As Clout (2014) reflects, such conversations about the purpose of the Levelsâwhether to maintain agriculture or support nature conservationâare not new and they have probably been happening since the middle ages, when the area was ï¬rst drained and developed. Within this project and chapter, we can neither prescribe what the future of the Levels should be or what activities need to take place in order to continue opening up conversations about ways to bridge silos within water management activities within the region. However, we do call on leaders and stakeholders in the Somerset region to continue collaborative processes of water governance across the widest possible range of stakeholders. This will ensure that a diversity of views from these stakeholders are catalogued, when adaptation policies are developed across water policy domains. Hopefully, in this way broader meta-governance failuresâwhich often entrench siloed"
383,467,0.262,Elements of Risk Analysis with Applications in R,"There are various stakeholders in risk communication, each having different responsibilities and interests. Each risk situation involves several or many stakeholders, where some are decision-makers, and some are affected. In the Covid-19 pandemic, everyone was a stakeholder, from governments, doctors, nurses, cleaners, and researchers to public individuals. In what follows, we briefly list the types of stakeholders. Government agencies include public health departments, environmental protection agencies, and regulatory bodies. They are responsible for assessing and managing risks, providing accurate information to the public, and coordinating emergency response efforts. An example was Covid-19 and health departments and government representatives needing to decide what action to take concerning the lockdown and what to say to the public. Scientific and technical experts and subject matter (e.g., experts in virology). They analyse data, conduct risk assessments, and provide evidencebased information to inform risk communication strategies. These experts often collaborate with government agencies, industry representatives, and other stakeholders to ensure accurate and up-to-date information is conveyed to the public. Industry and business entities that produce or handle potentially risky products (such as toxic waste) or processes (such as AI-related risks where AI wrongly classify a person as healthy) have a responsibility to communicate the associated risks. They collaborate with government agencies to adhere to regulations, provide necessary warnings or precautions, and ensure the safety of their products or services. Industry stakeholders also play a role in crisis communication during incidents or accidents related to their operations. Industry and business entities also want to ensure that their businesses are profitable and not victims of risks too caused by, e.g. digital attacks, the"

In our module evaluation questions, we often asked âOverall, to what extent was the public participation module a beneficial part of your learning in this course?â with responses to both on a five-point scale ranging from ânot at allâ to âa great deal.â In addition, to better understand perceptions of conducting ELSI engagement activities in the context of science courses, we asked students at different points, sometimes both before and after engaging in all of the module activities, to answer an open-ended question that read, âIn your opinion, how important is it that science students--including beginning science students such as you and your classmates--learn how to think about the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) pertaining to science? In 2â3 sentences, give your answer and a brief explanation of why you think as you do.â Finally, to assess perceptions of the value of public engagement in general, in A4 of Study 5, we additionally asked âSome people feel that the government should primarily rely on expert opinions, not citizen opinions when making policy decisions. What do you think? In your opinion, how much weight should government give to citizen opinions (like you wrote above) when making decisions about the future of nanotechnological development and regulation?â This question was accompanied by a five-point response scale ranging from âNone!

73,83,0.258,Balanced Urban Development : Options and Strategies For Liveable Cities,"The experience of managing land devoted to the conservation of the ï¬ying fox in urban Australia has been complex and lengthy. Several lessons emerge from the research into ï¬ying fox management that could be helpful in the management of other species that affect properties neighbouring bushland areas. The following lessons have informed Councilâs management approach within the KFFR: â¢ Interfering with habitats or attempts to modify the natural behaviour of the ï¬ying fox inevitably exacerbates the problem through unintended consequences. Attempts by the Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens to move ï¬ying foxes out saw the ï¬ying foxes end up in Centennial Park. Attempts by Cairns City Council to move the ï¬ying foxes out of trees in the main street saw the animals move into trees at a local school. In both cases the magnitude of the problem was ampliï¬ed by bringing more people into closer contact with the animals; â¢ Community education: the most popular community education events run by Ku-ring-gai Council concern local wildlife particularly when it involves species that are controversial and have a human impact such as ï¬ying foxes, ticks, bandicoots and bush turkeys. People can happily co-exist with the ï¬ying fox habitat nearby when they better understand the values associated with ï¬ying foxes, the general magnitude of impact and options available to manage any negative impacts; â¢ Modiï¬cation of the built environment: a far more practical, effective and efï¬cient management measure is to strengthen the resilience of homes, properties and lifestyles to the impact of wildlife; As Roberts et al. (2013) note it is the magnitude of the perceived problem that is important. This needs to be understood before responding. For example, if noise, smell and faeces from a camp affect only a small number of residents, then smaller, local-scale mitigation options should be applied. In this way the unintended consequences of the management action will be minimised and be less likely to result in a worsening of the problem. It is the unintended consequences of management actions that need to be thoroughly investigated and understood. For example altering the ï¬ying fox habitat or the animalâs natural behaviour may inadvertently foster the incidence of zoonotic disease by increasing the stress on animals who are already experiencing pressure for resources from urbanisation of habitat areas. Biodiversity integrity and human health have long thought to be inextricably linked (Pongsiri et al. 2009). Strategies to manage wildlife impacts on urban populations need to be mindful of the bigger picture surrounding the immediate context of these decisions. Increasing pressure by further degrading biological resources to the point where the system declines could have a range of signiï¬cant consequences. Conserving the integrity and diversity of biological resources can assist in maintaining resilience to emerging diseases. The response to the problems created by urban development encroaching on conservation areas must prioritise minimal disruption to the service and functions of the natural systems for any successful resolution to emerge."

The administrator of Debub Omo Zone, in an interview for Fortune magazine, stated: We granted the land to the company along the Omo valley, which is the most suitable area for the plantation of palm oil, to encourage investors to come to the region with the prospect of exploiting this huge potential. Dasanech village settlements and lands listed in Table 7.4 were among those expropriated by the GOE, according to local resident reporting to SONT researchers, mostly during late 2012 and early 2013. â¢ The GOEâs planning and impact assessment documents describe agricultural development plans as part of âcommunity development and âsocial servicesâ provisionâa clear misrepresentation of the reality of the lowermost Omo region as well as GOE policies. The following false statements in the GOEâs downstream impact assessment (GOE 2009) reflect this misrepresentation. The following examples of such statements by EEPCO ofï¬cials illustrates GOE fabrication of its development plans for the âbeneï¬tâ of the Dasanech. â¢ The South Omo project area is âhardly inhabited at all except at a widely scattered pattern,â and that the population density âat the South Omo project site is below ï¬ve persons per square kilometer.â12 To the contrary, SONT researchers documented thousands of Dasanech living in major village complexes along the west shore of the Omo River riverine zone in proximity to one another, as indicated in Fig. 7.14. This condition is manifest, even to the casual observer visiting the riverside zone. â¢ The government âwill not displace a single person involuntarily in Gambella, or elsewhere within the country.â Firsthand accounts by Dasanech elders, describing their evictions from settlements and lands (Table 6.4), directly contradict the governmentâs assertions. â¢ An irrigated land of 0.75 ha of land each is prepared for 2050 households. There will not be any land scarcity for any family with a capacity to produce more. Training on improved agronomy practices, technology inputs and livestock management including rangeland will be provided. This statement is also false. The communities listed in Table 7.4 are among those whose riverside farming areas or settlement areas have been expropriated. While thousands of villagers are expropriated with nowhere to go, the GOE frequently speaks of âproviding employmentâ for the local population. A very few Dasanech are incorporated into selected commercial farms, they are in essence wage labor, not âparticipantsâ in local cooperative or community based development. SONT investigation of two major expropriation/farm establishments on the west bank, for example, revealed that only 20 to 30 young men were hired while hundreds of villagers were sent away. â¢ The Ethiopian government consistently describes its âconsultationâ with local communities participatory. Dasanech elders, however, consistently report that, the Ethiopian government has forcefully ordered them to vacate many of their different their village locales, as well as major grazing and recession agriculture lands. â¢ Development bank documents refer to the consultations carried out by the GOE, but these rely entirely on the GOEâs description of its actions, not that of local residents. â¢ A culture of fear prevails among Dasanech villages. Omorate based GOE militia and security personnel take repressive, even violent measures against individuals and groups protesting their eviction and expropriation. â¢ Villagersâ acts of resistanceâeven questioning, have been met with swift and sometimes violent action by police or militia."
243,371,0.257,Information Infrastructures within European Health Care : Working with the Installed Base,"13.4.3 Engage Multiple Stakeholders The governing bodies and financing partners of sundhed.dk consist of members from Denmarkâs five regions, the Danish Regions, the Municipal Organization, and the Ministry of Health. This broad representation of key actors gave legitimacy to the portal at an early stage: âThe purpose was to establish a common public healthcare portal [â¦] that vision was crucial, and then of course it was important that they managed to engage the most influential partners, such as Danish Regions, that primarily runs sundhed.dk, together with the municipalities and the Ministry of Health as partnersâ (representative, The Ministry of Health). In addition, informants describe it as a clear advantage that the organization of the governing bodies resembles the way in which the remaining healthcare system is organized. For example, the relationship between the regions, the government, and GPs has been maintained through general agreements: âThe collaboration model we find in the Danish healthcare system is reflected in the organization of sundhed.dk. I believe that if we wouldnât have had this organization in place, it would have been very difficult to establish sundhed.dkâ (representative, the regions). The initial phase of sundhed.dk can be characterized as a political showcase for regional collaboration with solid political unity and common ambition. The involved parties have largely gathered around the common ambition of having one access point to the healthcare services: âAt the outset, there was a clear vision, which was politically anchored in the Association of County Councils â one entrance point to healthcare services and cross-sectorial collaboration â it was a vision we all could agree uponâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). In addition: âWe were told that if we could find a project that could strategically mark the 14 counties across, and not as silos, we would receive fundingâ (representative, the regions). In the initial phase, there was little disagreement concerning what should be offered to citizens and healthcare providers. The political unity and broad collaboration of stakeholders was described as key reasons for the success of the portal. While there was a clear political mandate and a broadly agreed-upon vision, the partners had different starting points in terms of already existing digital services. One of the initial challenges was to get everyone at the same level: âIt was a great opportunity to establish cross-sectorial collaboration, but this was also one of the biggest challenges [â¦] For example, not all regions had very advanced webpagesâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). In addition, it was a challenge to get everyone onboard: âIn the beginning, a lot of partners were happy about sundhed.dk and many believed in the overall vision. But if a region was working on a local project, it was difficult to get its buy-in. We spent much time in the beginning to go out locally and defend our existence. There was no choice for opting out. We basically told them that they themselves had decided that we should existâ (head of administration, sundhed.dk). The engagement of multiple stakeholders did not come automatically but had to be enabled actively by the staff at sundhed.dk. It was important to engage actors, since sundhed.dk did not have any authoritative responsibility or obligations. The overall purpose was to make services available and to establish"
233,75,0.256,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"natural conservation goal (e.g. Mooers and Atkins 2003). This fundamental relationship between evolutionary history and conservation goals traces back at least to the IUCN 1980) proposal that taxonomically distinctive species may deserve greater conservation priority. At about the same time, SoulÃ© (1980), in his book, Conservation biology: an evolutionary-ecological perspective, articulated a broad evolutionary perspective for conservation, and argued that âreduction of the biological diversity of the planet is the most basic issue of our time.â The term âphylogenetic diversityâ is relevant to these biodiversity conservation perspectives. The term can be traced back to the introduction of the âPDâ phylogenetic diversity index (Faith 1992a, b, 1994a). PD was designed as a simple measure of the degree of representation of evolutionary history (by a given set of taxa). Faith (2002) summarised the basic deï¬nition and rationale for PD: ârepresentation of âevolutionary historyâ (Faith 1994b) encompassing processes of cladogenesis and anagenesis is assumed to provide representation of the feature diversity of organisms. Speciï¬cally, the phylogenetic diversity (PD) measure estimates the relative feature diversity of any nominated set of species by the sum of the lengths of all those phylogenetic branches spanned by the set.â That summary mentions species, but Faith (1992a, b) in fact applied PD from the outset not only to phylogenies whose tips were species, but also to phylogenetic pattern among genetic haplotypes or populations, in order to set spatial priorities to conserve within species genetic diversity (see also Faith et al. 2009). The common element across these levels is the inference of underlying diversity, where the units of variation are features or traits of taxa. This link to âfeaturesâ reï¬ects the attempt, through PD calculations, to address a fundamental concern of biodiversity conservation - unknown variation, with unknown future values. Faith (1992a, b) suggested that the interpretation of phylogenetic diversity as a measure of feature diversity helps to clarify its link to conservation values: âDiversity is seen as important as the raw material for adapting to change (McNeely et al. 1990), and so provides what McNeely et al. (1990) and others call âoption valueâ: a safety net of biological diversity for responding to unpredictable events or needs. The diversity of features represented by a subset of species provides option value in ensuring not only that one or more members of the subset can adapt to changing conditions, but also that society may be able to beneï¬t (e.g. economically) from features of these species in response to future needs.â Examples of these beneï¬ts include many from bioprospecting. For example, Smith and Wheeler (2006) have used phylogeny to assess potential for new discoveries of piscine venoms. Pacharawongsakda et al. (2009) have applied PD to help ï¬nd natural products from microbes. Another interesting example is found in the study of Saslis-Lagoudakisa et al. (2012). Phylogenetically-related plants have provided a key medical component, discovered independently in the plants found in three different regions. This perspective accords well with the IUCN (1980) argument for conservation of diversity in order to ensure beneï¬ts âfor present and future useâ. Reid and Miller (1989) echoed these ideas in their early paper, âKeeping options alive: the scientiï¬c basis for conserving biodiversityâ (see also Wilson 1992; McNeely 1988; Faith 1992a, b).

Additionally, knowledge about the effectiveness of different management practices is usually scarce or poorly documented. A methodical adaptation approach has to deal with these uncertainties and knowledge gaps in order to foster decision making with a limited workforce and limited time and funds available at local levels (Hansen and Hoffmann 2011). External scientific input and support is essential for all protected areas but must be tailored to meet the needs and decision contexts of each areaâs management (see Chap. 5)."
284,370,0.255,Environmental Governance in Latin America,"The community consultation followed the procedures of regular communal elections (secret, registered voters) without the support of local governments; the result was a 91% mining rejection (1,896 votes, 47.4% turnout). The process was supported and observed by CONCAMI, the Red Muqui and leaders of local organizations. The regional governor, the Ministry of Agriculture, and representatives of regional ofï¬ces of development and production, and energy and mines, also participated as observers (Servindi, 2012). When this consultation occurred, the national government was promoting a law to regulate indigenous consultation rights. The question of whether the KaÃ±aris are peasant or indigenous, and hence entitled to FPIC according to ILO 169, triggered a wide debate (Greenspan, 2013). While the national ombudsman and transnational indigenous groups recognize the FPIC for KaÃ±aris, the government denies this right and claims that the government consultation is the valid one. In 2013 the Candente mining company stopped mining exploration, pointing to low copper prices as the reason. Ecuador, Kimsakocha project (Azuay) In October 2011 the ï¬rst mining community consultation of Ecuador took place. The conï¬ict arose from an open-pit project owned by a junior Canadian company. Concerns rose regarding the impact on water resources among indigenous and peasant groups located downstream from the project area (PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). The idea to conduct a consultation emerged in the context of growing pressure from the national government to promote mining activities in the country, in the midst of verbal and legal delegitimation and criminalization campaigns against Ecuadorian indigenous and anti-mining activists (interview with local activist, 2012). Moreover, local indigenous and peasant leaders were in contact with Latin American indigenous, anti-mining and human rights movements, in particular from Ecuador and Peru (interview with national anti-mining movement leader, 2012). In June 2011, local indigenous leaders led the organization of a continental peoples meeting with a strong emphasis on the impact of mining agendas on the environment and indigenous groups (PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012). A community consultation was called by the Junta de Aguas, an indigenous and peasant organization that administers access to household water. The consultation was grounded in ILO 169, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the Ecuadorian Constitution (PÃ©rez Guartambel, 2012).

282,159,0.255,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"In his frequently quoted and powerful words, James Madison describes the importance of knowledge for democratic government as follows: A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. (Hunt, 1900â10, Vol. 1, Chap. 18, Doc. 35)70 Organisations like Privacy International, which runs a major campaign for freedom of information legislation, emphasise the link between access to information and the ability to participate: Democracy is based on the consent of the citizens and that consent turns on the government informing citizens about their activities and recognizing the right to participate. The public is only truly able to participate in the democratic process when they have information about the activities and policies of the government. (Banisar, 2006, p. 6) Because of its centrality to both accountability in general and to participation, transparency has become a very broadly recognised standard of democratic governance. Thus, for instance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognise the right to seek, receive and impart information.71 Moreover, the UN Convention against Corruption requires governments to take measures to enhance the transparency of their public administration and the Rio Declaration demands access to environmental information to enable participation.72 The importance of transparency is also increasingly reflected in government practice. Thus by 2006 70 countries from across the globe had adopted comprehensive freedom of information legislation, while another 50 were in the process of developing it.73 Consequently, the codes defining governance norms for standard-setting organisations also emphasise transparency. Both, ISO guide 59 and the ISEAL code of good practice, demand that standard-setting organisations publish their future work programmes or notify stakeholders of upcoming decisions, make available copies of the draft standards, publish approved standards promptly and document the process of standard development. Beyond that, ISEAL proposes that organisations publish all received comments, as well as the ensuing reactions and that they create a dedicated focal point for enquiries to facilitate the provision of information.74 As discussed in section 2.2.2.4, as well as in section 4.2.3, transparency can concern many different aspects of an organisation. Several of these areas are"

His son Jagan Mohan Reddy was widely expected to become the Chief Minster, but the Congress High Command decided to appoint old loyalist Rosaiah. This led Jagan to rebel. He kept looking for issues to raise and the one about microfinance borrowers feeling so harassed that some committed suicides caught his attention. He found the perfect issue to embarrass Rosaiah and the High Command in Delhi â a picture of Rahul Gandhi sitting with Vikram Akula in a SKS women borrowersâ group meeting, which was carried in the media in 2006. There was also a photo of Smt Sonia Gandhi, the Congress party president, presenting Akula with an award for Social Entrepreneur of the Year at the World Economic Forumâs India Economic Summit.22 Jaganâs newspaper Sakshi and his TV channel by the same name hammered the point â âWhy would Rosaiahâs government act against MFIs, when the Gandhis are their friends?â. The other media picked up the issue. This led to acute embarrassment for the Congress and they even issued a denial but the charge stuck23. In October 2010, when media criticism against the MFIs was at its peak, the statements by leaders of political parties had its affect and the Congress government in AP had to enact a harsh law curbing MFIs. The Government of Andhra Pradesh brought in the Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending) Ordinance, 201024 which was later passed as the Andhra Pradesh Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Money Lending) Bill 2011. This law had several features which effectively made it impossible for MFIs to function in the state. For example, MFI staff could not go to the residence or workplace of the borrower for recoveries, but instead had to go and sit at a central public place, hoping for borrowers to come and repay. No additional loans were permitted without prior approval by the government. Though the law was ostensibly aimed to protect MFI borrowers from coercion and over-indebtedness, it virtually stopped MFIs from functioning in AP, Two crucial provisions were â visits by MFI staff to the residence or work place of the borrowers for recovery could be construed to be a coercive practice, so instead they had to sit in a âcentral placeâ hoping for borrowers to come there. Second, no further loans were allowed with government permission for each individual loan. This by itself slowed down recoveries drastically. But Opposition leaders, particularly former Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, used this as an opportunity to"
381,627,0.253,The Dynamics of Opportunity in America : Evidence and Perspectives,"Mobilizing an Engaged Citizenry Professional accountability is not enough, however. There have been many examples in recent years of equity-focused reform effortsâeven some with fair support among educatorsâthat fell to partisan politics and pushback from a public that didnât understand or agree with the rationale for the changes. Often, public and political support for the status quo is based on deep-seated beliefs about meritocracy, the scarcity of educational goods, and the inability of some children to take advantage of opportunities when offered (Oakes and Lipton 2006). Behind these beliefs sits a power structure that preserves advantages for wealthier and more privileged communities at the expense not only of less privileged communities but also the nation as a whole (Stiglitz 2012). To create and sustain meaningful policies and practices to equalize opportunities for low-income students and students of color requires more than technical solutions and more than an engaged profession. It also requires public constituency and mobilization. We see this mobilization as necessarily occurring on two levels. One is the coordination of efforts at the âgrass topsââthat is through building coalitions among the leaders of the many education stakeholder groupsâeveryone from higher education institutions to employer groups, parent organizations, advocacy and civil rights groups, and health care and community-based organizations that work with children in other capacities. Political figures and public agency representatives may be a part of these coalitions, but they focus primarily on gathering support and involvement of organized constituencies outside the more formal education system and political structure. In the past few years, the social sector has seen increased interest in and use of collective impact strategies that employ such coalition efforts to address particularly intractable and complex social problems. The concept of collective impact seems to have emerged from the Strive Together initiative in Cincinnati, which brought together local leaders to tackle the student achievement crisis in greater Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. Defining system change as community-wide transformation in which various partners (a) productively use data to improve their decision making and (b) constantly weigh the impact of their decisions on both their own institutions and the broader ecosystem that work to improve the lives of children, the leaders of Strive Together posited a four-pillar theory of action for collective impact: establishing a shared community vision, instituting evidence-based decision-making and shared accountability among the partners to improve selected outcomes, using continuous improvement approaches to identify and spread promising practices to improve community-level outcomes, and aligning financial and other resources to support and sustain improvement (Edmondson and Hecht 2014, 6â7). Though Strive Together may have coined the phrase, others have instituted similar collective efforts, sometimes over decades (e.g., El Paso). All are based on the theme that cross-sector, cross-organization coordination is more likely to contribute to large-scale, sustained social change than are the isolated actions of individual organizations and agencies. Within this coordinated approach, the goal of eliminating"
38,561,0.253,The GEO Handbook on Biodiversity Observation Networks,"13.2.1 Kenya Northern Kenya is a region of high biodiversity conservation value. It is a hotspot of mammalian diversity in Africa and is critical habitat for several endangered and threatened large mammal species. This region is largely under tribal communal tenure, and the rich flora and fauna of the region are threatened by heavy and continuous grazing by domestic livestock, which has caused moderate to severe land degradation over large areas (Georgiadis et al. 2007). Several NGOs, the largest of which is the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), have been working to promote wildlife conservation and better land stewardship in this region. In 2008, NRT and other scientists developed a simple protocol useable by community members to monitor rangeland condition, which, in turn, determines the amount and quality of forage for wildlife. These methods were based upon pastoralistsâ traditional knowledge and monitoring practices that were also be scientiï¬cally defensible. Through a series of conversations at which the NGOs, scientists, and community members were present, all participants agreed that the indicators currently used by pastoralists to make management decisions were insufï¬cient, as they were largely focused on livestock condition and grass conditions affected by rainfall. All agreed that a new protocol was needed to capture information about long-term (>3 year) trends in rangeland functionality. However, these methods would need to be simple so that they could be learned and used by community members with low literacy. With support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID-East Africa), a team of scientiï¬c experts was assembled, as well as a diverse advisory panel, to guide this project. This team conducted focus group interviews with community members representing the Maasai, Samburu, Borana, Afar, and Karyu ethnic groups in Kenya and Ethiopia. In these interviews, researchers asked community members to describe the changes in their rangelands they had observed over the last several decades. The responses were markedly similar across diverse social and ecological contexts: increased bare ground, decreased perennial grasses, increased woody vegetation, and increased soil erosion. These observations also matched the general indicators of degradation that have been observed by scientists working in rangelands around the world. Researchers then used this traditional knowledge to adapt an existing set of rangeland monitoring methods (originally developed and thoroughly tested in the western United States) for the East African context. Notably, the US methods were simpliï¬ed by basing them on a stick 1 m long (rather than measuring tapes or other manufactured tools) and created a single graphical data sheet on which data could be collected by circling icons. The intent was that these methods could be used by people who could not read or write but could count and recognise simple icons (e.g., a picture of a shrub representing a sample point with shrub cover)."

In emerging countries, many Western companies aggressively participate in infrastructure operations such as water distribution, railways, and roadways. Moreover, there has been a lag in Japanese companiesâ participation; however, the Japanese government has recently taken measures to encourage âinfrastructure exports.â Currently, these infrastructure operations in emerging markets have gained momentum from both public and private sectors.

376,650,0.252,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","Abstract On rangelands the livestockâwildlife interface is mostly characterized by management actions aimed at controlling problems associated with competition, disease, and depredation. Wildlife communities (especially the large vertebrate species) are typically incompatible with agricultural development because the opportunity costs of wildlife conservation are unaffordable except in arid and semiarid regions. Ecological factors including the provision of supplementary food and water for livestock, together with the persecution of large predators, result in livestock replacing wildlife at biomass densities far exceeding those of indigenous ungulates. Diseases are difficult to eradicate from free-ranging wildlife populations and so veterinary controls usually focus on separating commercial livestock herds from wildlife. Persecution of large carnivores due to their depredation of livestock has caused the virtual eradication of apex predators from most rangelands. However, recent research points to a broad range of solutions to reduce conflict at the livestockâwildlife interface. Conserving wildlife bolsters the adaptive capacity of a rangeland by providing stakeholders with options for dealing with environmental change. This is contingent upon local communities being empowered to benefit directly from their wildlife resources within a management framework that integrates land-use sectors at the landscape scale. As rangelands undergo irreversible changes caused by species invasions and climate forcings, the future perspective favors a proactive shift in attitude towards the livestockâwildlife interface, from problem control to asset management."

366,380,0.251,"The Future of the Law of the Sea : Bridging Gaps Between National, Individual and Common Interests","sovereignty does not allow for other States to participate in this exercise, unless expressly authorized.66 The EU has been seeking to obtain the consent to enter Libyan territorial sea, but up to now Libyan authorities did not appear as willing to provide such authorization. The international relationships are clearly complicated by the fact that since 2014, Libya has been facing a grave political crisis and, as a consequence of such crisis, Libyan authorities lack the capacity to effectively control their territory, as well as their territorial sea. The current political scenario may probably change in light of the recent UN-led formation of a government of national unity, which, according to the Security Council Resolution 2259 (2015), is the sole legitimate Government of Libya.67 Accordingly, only this government would be considered by the International Community as the authority legitimate to authorize the entry into Libyan territorial waters for the purpose of disrupting the business model of migrant smuggling and human trafficking. This legal option may find support in a precedent case and, specifically, in the context of the international response to maritime piracy in Somalia. Over 20 years, Somalia has lacked any functioning institutions or any form of political control of the territory, to the extent of being defined by the literature as the locus classicus of a failed State.68 In 2004, after nearly 2 years of insidious negotiations and numerous international attempts to deal with the problem of the crisis of sovereignty, a provisional transition federal government (TFG) was formed. The latter was a highly precarious body held together artificially by the UN and, at the same time, the sole Somali government recognized by the International Community. Likewise, in Libya, the political instability of Somalia contributed to the fervent and atrocious resurgence of a violent crime, i.e., maritime piracy. In order to address this phenomenon, the TFG (replaced in 2012 by the new Somali Authorities) explicitly asked for international assistance.69 In light of this request and thus in light of the TFGâs consent, a number of Security Council resolutions were adopted to ensure the implementation of the rules of international law concerning coercive powers against piracy on the high seas also in the territorial sea and even on the mainland of Somalia."

Such trust could also be seen in the most sensitive issue of ethnic relations in Rakhine state. While initiatives from many countries and international organisations to help were turned down by the Myanmar government, President Thein Sein formally asked Indonesia during the 21st ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh in November 2012, despite the fact that the country is majority Muslim, to help his government in resolving ethnic tensions in Rakhine state (Santosa 2012). Another interesting piece of evidence appeared when President Joko Widodo was received as the first guest, among other ASEAN countries, by President Thein Sein on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in November 2014 in Naypyidaw, although not many issues were directly discussed by the two leaders. Indonesia has been welcome to expand its economic engagements in Myanmar, as President Thein Sein has encouraged his Indonesian counterpart to increase its investments, particularly to take advantage of the new policy that allows foreign banks to operate in the country (Otto 2014). One unanticipated positive result from these engagements, as argued by some Indonesian stakeholders, is that instead of Myanmar simply learning from Indonesiaâs experiences, a two-way learning process has evolved, in which Indonesia is also learning from its Myanmar counterparts. For example, according to Lt-Gen. (ret.) Agus Widjojo, who was actively involved in the Indonesian military reform process, Myanmar actually has a better sense of the supremacy of law as compared with Indonesiaâs political system. According to him, before the Myanmar military deployed in conflict-prone areas, such as in the northern regions, the government first issued a state of emergency status, while in the Indonesian case military action, in most cases, took place before issuing any regulations, placing the legality of the military actions into question right from the outset.16 Another example, as shared by a leading think-tank based in Jakarta, is the degree of openness shown by the stakeholders from Myanmar, including from some of the countryâs politicians.

Two important observations can be made about black swans. First, a black swan cannot be described by any of the stakeholders because the event is completely unknown to all of them. Second, while a black swan is a total surprise to all the stakeholders considered, there may be other individuals outside the group of stakeholders for which the event is not a big surprise. As an example, while the economic crisis of 2007/2008 came as a huge surprise to most people, a few individuals, including Taleb [9], foresaw the crisis, even though they could not say when the crisis would occur or exactly how serious the consequences would be. A gray swan is a metaphor for rare global behavior with a large negative impact that is somewhat predictable but typically overlooked by most of the stakeholders considered. It is the âknown unknown,â a rare event that some know is possible but no one knows when or whether it will occur. Because a gray swan is not a complete surprise to all stakeholders, it tends to have less impact than a black swan. However, its impact is still huge. For simplicity, we often neglect to define a set of stakeholders when we discuss gray and black swans. However, the reader should assume that users, owners, software developers, operators, and regulatory government agencies are always among the stakeholders."
143,91,0.251,Digital Kenya : An Entrepreneurial Revolution in The Making,"Erik, there is a lot of controversy about government intervention into private-sector activities. What is your take? What should be the ideal role of government? So the role of the government is very simple: To reduce friction in the system for the technology industry to grow. What does that break down into? It breaks down into regulation that is actually good for businessâ speed of setting up business, tax breaks for new companies, things like that. Another example of friction in the system that does not need to exist is legacy laws that are 30 to 40 years old and put a 20 to 30 % duty on components imported into the country. I can import a fully assembled, packaged BRCK duty free. Yet the components to make it have a heavy import dutyâwhich means it does not make sense to import. In other words, I cannot create a new manufacturing industry in Kenya if we do not have the ability to bring in raw materials that are not produced in Kenya. Like this, we never will create industries unless we change these legacy laws. So again, governmentâs job is to reduce friction. And by reducing friction, they increase wealth and they increase jobs. Then there are other things, such as providing foundational access, of which the subsidization of the undersea cable by the government was a massive example. That is exactly what the government should be doing, massive projects that bring in both the public and private sectors and help things move further. Another one is regulation around spectrum allocation or licencing. How about foreign aid and NGOs? What should their role be? In a well-functioning state, most NGOs would not exist. There is only a limited role for them, because the market answers many of the problems, and the government should answer the rest. However, here in Kenya, we have one of the highest count of NGOs per capita in the world. It is an interesting dynamic though, because international NGOs bring in money for some things, which bastardizes the market for other things.

Politically less powerful actors also strive to rescale decision-making processes in order to overcome undesirable policies and developments, structural constraints or environmental degradation. Chapter 11 describes the efforts of local communities to build up both glocal connections and coalitions with local governments in order to have control over consultations and decide about the implementation of mining projects in Latin America. According to Chapter 10, the scaling down of environmental governance to the local level is fundamental in safeguarding the self-determination of local communities. Chapter 9 argues that social capital and institutional strength in communities are key factors for the protection of forest commons and for local capacities to face traditional and emergent pressures on forest ecosystems. The extent to which local communities and social movements succeed in bringing about institutional change partly depends on their interactions with other actors. In this respect it is also important to point out that social actors (the state, corporations, communities, etc.) are not homogeneous entities. They may consist of various groups with different power, interests and positions, which may shift over time. Local governments, for example, occasionally confront central governments by developing alliances with local communities or other state agencies. Also, experts from corporations, governments and environmental organizations may take very different stances on energy efï¬ciency, production technologies and social responsibilities, despite the fact that they work in the same sector or country (see the analysis of views and discourses of strategic actors in Chapter 6). In some cases, environmentalists support local communities against development policies that promote the expansion of infrastructure and extractive industries in fragile ecosystems (Chapter 11). In other cases, they may favour compensatory schemes in conservation policies, regardless of the criticism raised by environmental justice movements (Chapter 8). In sum, while the central state has repositioned itself in processes of environmental governance of Latin America, institutional adaptation to the new contexts, discourses and demands has come from a range of (contesting) actors, and the interactions among them, across multiple scales. Overall, elite groups have tried to adjust some of their discourses and practices in order to partly comply with new demands and regulations, without having to give up their prominent position. Simultaneously, various marginalized groups have attempted to strike back by (re-)establishing and (re)appropriating local decision-making processes"

In part, the conservation value of the phylogenetic approach is in its ability to guide pre-emptive actions towards identifying and prioritizing the most at-risk species. For example, by identifying species with traits or in regions that predispose them to high risk of extinction, we can identify species that are not yet at risk of extinction but which might become threatened in the near future if current extinction drivers increase in intensity or geographic extent. Cardillo et al. (2006) referred to such species as having high âlatent riskâ of extinction.

For stakeholders to be able to deliver meaningful inputs, they need sufficient information about the rule-setting process, including the schedule of planned activities and the procedures for submitting contributions, as well as the subject matter under consideration. To strengthen the credibility of the process, two further elements of transparency are instrumental. Firstly, organisations should handle submissions in a transparent way so that stakeholders know how their contributions influence the rule-setting process. Secondly, transparency on their financial sources can help address potential concerns about a partnershipâs independence and objectivity. Organisations can take very different steps to create transparency. Which activities are required to generate an adequate level of transparency depends on the nature of the stakeholders involved. In the case of ICANN, for example, affected stakeholders are by definition engaged in activities related to the Internet. Therefore, it seems appropriate for ICANN to rely mainly on electronic means of communication to publish and disseminate relevant information. For partnerships dealing with well-organised and well-informed stakeholders, moreover, a relatively passive approach to information dissemination may be sufficient. EITI, for instance, predominantly addresses multinational companies active in the extractive industries that have a strong interest in and awareness of international norm-setting processes. The WCD, by contrast, faced different requirements. Among its key stakeholders were local communities affected by dam-building projects. To inform them and encourage their participation, on-site meetings, non-electronic communication, active outreach, capacity building and the use of local languages were essential. This dependence on context makes it difficult to establish general standards relating to the concrete modalities necessary for generating appropriate levels of transparency. Nevertheless rule-setting partnerships should respect the following principles to create the conditions for effective participation: â¢ Provide and disseminate information about the rule-setting process, the procedures for participating, the subject matter under consideration, the way contributions are dealt with and the partnershipâs financial sources. â¢ Choose the format and language for providing and disseminating information depending on the needs and capacities of key stakeholders. A basic starting point for partnerships is to publish relevant information online. In many cases, however, information will have to be available in several languages and may require the use of non-electronic forms of communication. â¢ Where necessary, reach out actively to disadvantaged stakeholders and provide them with training and capacity building. As described in the previous section, measures to support disadvantaged stakeholder groups may include the organisation of separate meetings, capacity building, mandated representation or the use of levelling techniques in facilitation."

302,201,0.249,Freshwater Microplastics : Emerging Environmental Contaminants?,"Most of African freshwater bodies are transboundary (see Table 1), and therefore their management requires cooperation and effective, coherent regional environmental policies [58]. However, the management of most African transboundary lakes and rivers ecosystems is largely compromised by conflicting political standings among the riparian countries [59]. A good example of this is Lake Victoria which is shared by Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. Its management has been challenging due to a lack of good cooperation and harmonized policies mainly following the collapse of East African Community of 1977. Despite its reformation, there are still country-specific political issues hindering the management of the lake. This is also the case for other African Great Lakes like Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi. However, when policies, conventions, and cooperations do occur, the major focus is often on how natural resources can be shared [60], rather than the control of pollutants. Thus, at an international level, the political will to combat issues like MP pollution is not strong and is equally problematic at the local level. In most African countries, MP pollution is not recognized as emergent issue of concern, although the efforts to levy, reduce, and ban the use of plastic bags [26, 27] would suggest that the plastic issue is not entirely ignored. It is perhaps stereotypical to consider, but in many African nations, the challenges faced are greater than MP pollution â war, famine, literacy rate, infrastructure, clean drinking water, poverty, and corruption [61]. Moreover, most African countries have insufficient budgets from which to plan and execute governmental projects including research activities. A number of countries receive financial aid, and under these circumstances, and understandably, the study of MP pollution is not of the highest priority. Based on this, the current financial challenges of working with MPs in African waters may not be solved by local budgets but rather by bringing together different stakeholders (i.e., local community, local and national governments, NGOs, researchers), in order to first collect data, evaluate steps forward, and implement effective measure to halt MP pollution."

This will also be the case for water use and regulation where budgets need to be transferred in the same way. The issue with this is that the functions of these units are linked to the type of account and moving the units will have human resource implications. For instance, service-level agreements need to be in place between the CMA and the regional and national offices so that the services to be supplied by the DWS and/or CMA need to be well defined and stipulated.14 Effective management of stakeholder relations is another important component of CMAs, and this is the fifth practice identified by the authors. We also observed this practice when interviewing the representatives of the FGG Elbe. For the FGG Elbe, stakeholder relations are not only an important communication endeavour (e.g. keeping stakeholders abreast of what is happening in the river basin and flood warning) but also necessary in the daily functions like river health monitoring.15 We argue that without good stakeholder relations, decentralisation cannot be adequately achieved since decentralisation involves the interface (e.g. communication) between authorities and stakeholders at grassroots level. In this regard, both established CMAs have relatively close and remarkably good relationships with stakeholders. These relationships, as with any relationship, had to be built from the onset. For instance, initially, stakeholders were reluctant to engage with the Breede-Gouritz CMA owing largely to challenging experiences with the regional/national DWS offices. For instance, some individuals in stakeholder groupings have been waiting on DWS for numerous years with regard to licencing applications.16 Because of this matter, stakeholders wanted to know whether the CMA would be any different from the way in which DWS carries out water-related activities and tasks. In other words, there is an expectation from stakeholders that the CMA will, in certain instances, do a âbetter jobâ than the DWS. The onus was on CMA staff attending the meetings to persuade the stakeholders firstly to participate in stakeholder meetings and explain the benefits of these meetings and secondly to give members the assurance that the past is the past and that the CMA would have other options at hand to assist stakeholders with their needs.17"
242,1127,0.247,"Migration, Gender and Social Justice : Perspectives on Human Insecurity","Spanning the analytical and the normative, one of the tasks still pending is to conceive a public policy on migration that starts by recognizing the profound interdependence between migrants, their relatives, and the receiving communities. Thousands of people have found employment and residence in Costa Rica, providing services to Costa Rican citizens; for example, many Costa Ricans can work at paid jobs because a Nicaraguan is caring for their children or for older adults. Some economic activities, such as construction, export agriculture, private security, and of course paid domestic work structurally depend on the participation of Nicaraguans. Although, as Benhabib (2004: 93) notes, âpeoples are radically and not merely episodically interdependentâ, she emphasizes that âcitizenry and the practices of political membership are the rituals through which the nation spatially reproduces itself. The control of territorial borders, which is coeval with the sovereignty of the modern nation state, seeks to ensure the purity of the nation in time through the policing of its contacts and interactions in spaceâ (Benhabib 2004: 18). For normative-cum-transformative work, rather than suggesting new totalities Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2009: 125) favours the work of âtranslationâ, which he specifies as âthe procedure that permits the creation of reciprocal intelligibility among the experiences of the world, both the available and the possible, revealed by the sociology of absences and the sociology of emergencesâ (de Sousa Santos 2009: 136). Translation involves links between various kinds of knowledge, agents, and social practices and is particularly necessary in the search for links between perspectives of a more analytical kind and those more focused on regulatory approaches. The importance of this link acquires more relevance if one recognizes, as Jonathan Rutherford (2007: 19) has noted, that the predominating theories that emphasize the de- and reconstruction of social identities, generally related to post-structuralism, have lacked the ethical references to generate new, more egalitarian social relations than the ones they seek to deconstruct. The emphasis on the possibility of reconstruction has not been accompanied by a similar impetus in terms of articulating emerging worlds. Translation also facilitates the configuration of âcontact zonesâ (Sandoval 2009b) between kinds of knowledge, perspectives, and actors who do not frequently encounter each other.

Another niche tourism sector, which is very much growing, is Indigenous tourism. Canada has chosen to focus much of its marketing on Indigenous (Aboriginal) products and attractions, particularly in the Arctic and provincial peripheries. This focus is echoed through new governance regimes (autonomy, self-government, etc.) that give Indigenous communities more say and engagement in many regions of the Arctic.

While total government funding for apprenticeship in the U.S. is only about $100 to $400 per apprentice annually, federal, state, and local government spending annually per participant in two-year public colleges is approximately $11,400 (Cellini 2009). Not only are government outlays sharply higher, but the cost differentials are even greater after accounting for the higher earnings (and associated taxes) of apprentices compared to college students. Given these data, we can attribute at least some of the low apprenticeship penetration to a lack of public effort in promoting and supporting apprenticeship and to heavy subsidies for alternatives to apprenticeship. However, the historical reasons for apprenticeshipâs low penetration in the U.S. are less important than the potential for future expansion.8 Recent experience in Britain and in selected areas in the U.S. suggests grounds for optimism, but the barriers to expansion are significant. One is limited information about apprenticeship. Because few employers offer apprenticeships, most employers are unlikely to hear about apprenticeships from other employers or from workers in other firms. Compounding the problem is both the difficulty of finding information about the content of existing programs and the fact that developing apprenticeships is complicated for most employers, often requiring technical assistance that is minimal in most of the country. Experiences in England and South Carolina demonstrate that effective marketing is critically important for expanding the number of firms offering apprenticeships. Another barrier is employer misperceptions that apprenticeship will bring in unions. There is no evidence that adopting an apprenticeship program will increase the likelihood of unionization, but reports about such close links persist. An additional barrier is the asymmetric treatment of government postsecondary funding, with courses in colleges receiving support and courses related to apprenticeship receiving little financial support. Policies to reduce the government spending differentials between college subsidies and apprenticeship subsidies can help overcome this barrier. Another significant complication to developing more apprenticeships is that U.S. apprenticeships are categorized in three different ways: registered apprenticeships with the Department of Laborâs Office of Apprenticeship (OA), unregistered apprenticeships, and youth apprenticeships. Official data generally fail to track unregistered apprenticeships; evidence suggests their numbers exceed registered apprenticeships.9 Small youth apprenticeship programs operate in a few states. Tiny budgets and an excessive focus on construction have hampered expansion of the registered apprenticeship system. The federal government spends less than $30 million annually to supervise, market, regulate, and publicize the system. Many states"

Analysis of statewide data can help states set priorities for moving forward to ensure that all students have access to the standards. But standards and priorities are only one step toward setting direction for the state. Equally important is ensuring consistency in the signals to local districts and schools through consistent leadership and sustained commitment to improvement. This has been and continues to be a major challenge in the majority of states. All too often, state leaders do not have a deep understanding of the nature of the problems; state bureaucracies are locked into patterns that are directive and punitive rather than supportive; and lobby groups work to maintain current practices, often by guiding the votes of legislators and the behavior of the administrators. These practices will not change quickly, but they can be ameliorated over time. Though not yet fully successful, leaders in states such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Texas, and now California have made substantial progress. The key is sustaining the work over time. One- or two-term leadership is not enough; change of the sort we describe here takes a decade or more to embed itself into the fabric of the system. The task is not easyâthe commitment to sustain a policy direction that is based on continuous improvement and equal opportunity is difficult to keep up without succumbing to the siren call of âmagic bullets.â But it is necessary.

282,250,0.245,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"40. Witte and Reinicke (2005), p. 63, for example, analyse the following motives for companies to engage in partnerships in decreasing order of importance: showing good corporate citizenship, increasing reputation, individual leadership, improving the investment market and meeting government requirements. According to Reich (2002), governments mainly engage in partnerships because they recognise that they need partners to address crucial public policy problems. Companies, by contrast, are suspected to pursue various objectives including future profits and markets, control over international agendas, tax deductions or subsidies for new products. For a more detailed account of the motives of governments, including local governments see, for example, Collin (1998). 41. As mentioned earlier, accountability to mission is a fuzzier concept than accountability for complying with rules or financial accountability. As a result, there are no strict âstandardsâ governing the development of mission statements, neither for partnerships, nor for NGOs. There are, however, numerous handbooks providing relevant advice. Radtke (1998), for example, advises that mission statements should describe the purpose of the organisation, its contribution to that goal and the values guiding its work. Bryce (1992) recommends that missions should be so clearly defined that they can be applied to all NGO activities. Drohan (1999) emphasises that mission statements are working documents that require continued attention. Ingrim (1990) stresses that all those connected with the organisation should understand its mission and that the mission statement should serve as a guide for planning. For a more detailed annotated bibliography relating to NGO missions and visions see, for example, http://www.centerpointforleaders. org/toolkit_biblio_vision.html, last accessed 27 August 2009. 42. Logical frameworks and results chains are crucial elements of results-based management strategies. These management strategies are broadly applied in bilateral and multilateral development agencies and are increasingly adopted by other organisations working in the field of development. Results chains link short-term outputs to medium-term outcomes and long-term impacts. Thereby, they show how individual activities contribute to the achievement of broader development goals. The logical framework is a tool to help results-based planning which links the different levels of objectives and goals to information on how the objective can be measured, how relevant information can be obtained and what external factors could intervene. The handbook and âhow-toâ literature on results-based management is vast. For a brief bibliography on logical frameworks see, for example, den Heyer (2001). UNDP has compiled a short bibliography on resultsbased management (Evaluation Office, 2002, pp. 110â11), as has the Canadian International Development Agency (Results-Based Management Division, 2000, pp. 135â8). 43. Edwards and Hulme, for example, emphasise the difficulty of measuring the performance of NGOs: âA great part of the dilemma faced by GROs [grassroots organisations] and NGOs lies in the nature of the work they do and the messy and complex world in which they do it â measuring performance in relation to the kind of development subscribed to by most NGOs is an extraordinarily difficult task, particularly in relation to âempowermentâ and other qualitative changesâ (Edwards and Hulme, 1995, p. 11). Similarly, Slim (2002) stresses the difficulties of implementing social and environmental accounting practices in NGOs. For the public sector, GÃ¶ran Arvidsson has articulated the problems of efficiency and effectiveness-focused performance evaluations as follows: âPublic activities have intrinsic values which cannot be expressed in terms of economic"

It then goes on to brieï¬y explain about designing innovative learning activities and concludes with methods to evaluate the innovation. Training courses incorporating this toolkit have been developed to ensure that stakeholders outside the project can replicate the iTEC scenario development process at national, local and community levels. In addition, the toolkit resources are available on the web2 so that teachers and other stakeholders can create scenarios independently. The toolkit encourages whole school use of ICT by: â¢ Creating an educational vision that is ambitious but achievable; â¢ Involving all key stakeholders involved in designing a schoolsâ curriculum; â¢ Focusing on advanced pedagogical practices and change management."

329,185,0.245,Pragmatic Philanthropy : Asian Charity Explained,"Western companies tend to work in this fashion as well. They identify a need they want to address and then find the SDO partner that has the capability and experience to deliver that good. For the SDO, corporate support can be a tremendous boon. Oftentimes, however, the relationship between the two entities encounters difficulties. Companies and SDOs might have different approaches and necessarily have different aims. In a 1999 book Corporate-NGO Partnership in Asia-Pacific, editor Tadashi Yamamoto writes of the numerous challenges that face ongoing corporate-NGO partnerships. During our work, we have found two innovative programs that seek to address these challenges and improve the relationships between companies and SDOs. CCPHI is an Indonesian nonprofit that promotes partnerships among companies, NGOs, and local governments to encourage sustainable communities. CCPHI acts as a sort of marriage counselor to the corporate-SDO partners. Every relationship needs a third party from time to time. CCPHI acts as that third party, offering training, counseling, and tools for effective and sustainable corporateâSDO partnerships. Singapore Management University (SMU) has also developed a program to address the disconnect that often occurs between companies, SDOs, and the government. In the new Master of Tri-Sector Collaboration degree program now offered, students learn skills to traverse the barriers between these three parts of society. Center Director Martin Tan says, âAs societal issues in the world become more complex, we need to recognize that there isnât a one-size-fits-all approach to solving these issues nor will there be one single entity that will have all the answers. Not the government, businesses, or civil society on its own. However, we could if we collaborate across all sectors and leverage on each otherâs strengths and expertise to address some of society's greatest challenges collectively.â This course, now in its second year, is the only one of its kind in the world. Both SMUâs program and CCPHI offer innovative means to bring about more effective partnerships. Both recognize that the need to work together to solve complex problems, while still relatively untested in Asia, will be critical going forward. 2. Volunteerism Another tactic embraced by many Asian companies is volunteerism.

Define precisely. Before defining the problem of assessing FLOSS communities maturity, it is crucial to explain what we mean by maturity in this work and its impact on communityâs healthiness. By maturity we mean the degree of accomplishment a FLOSS community exhibits in reaching the goals of delivering high quality technology and becoming an ecosystem which supports socio-technical advances for all of its constituent actors. We elaborate this concept of maturity around three major underpinnings: (i) userbase management; (ii) long-term sustainability; and (iii) inner/outer communication. Userbase management encloses all practices which ease the delivery of high quality technology to an ever increasing userbase. This includes, for instance, quality assurance, software localization, and the availability of user-friendly installers or binary packages. Long-term sustainability refers to those practices which try to keep the communityâs health in spite of disturbances in the underlying socio-technical infrastructure, such as contributors leaving the project, disruptive strategical changes, or internal conflicts. Finally, inner/outer communication includes all practices which enable the effective communication inside the community and between the community and other ecosystem actors. Such maturity underpinnings represent overarching views of maturity and are further detailed as a set of disciplines that make up the model we propose herein. With that view of maturity in mind, the problem addressed in this work can be defined: how should one proceed to assess the maturity degree of a given FLOSS community? How to make such evaluations more systematic and replicable across different researchers? How to identify improvement opportunities in a given FLOSS community to enhance its maturity degree? Position and justify. We believe that assessing FLOSS communities maturity is a significant and challenging problem of general interest. It may appear in quite diverse practices. For example, knowing about a community maturity is an important decision-making information for a FLOSS investor selecting a community to support. Community managers may benefit from such a maturity model by carrying out self-assessments and identifying improvement opportunities. Social sciences researchers doing ethnographic studies may want to deliberately choose a mature community or an incipient one depending on their research goals. FLOSS educators may select communities with established mentoring programs (and, therefore, with increased maturity) to push their students into initial contributions. End users or companies may want to assess maturity to decide about the adoption of competing FLOSS solutions. Software Engineering researchers may undertake maturity assessment as an early exploratory/descriptive study and then, afterwards, decide about future research."

258,194,0.244,New Horizons for Asian Museums and Museology,"The most important step in the conservation process is to document the existing condition of the object. Documentation is done for every object that has been brought into the conservation laboratory prior to any treatment. In this document, the physical condition such as any cracks, disï¬gurement to the object, any sign of damage or wear, addition and losses, previous restoration, color change, insect damage, and bio deterioration are mentioned. And then the method of treatment is documented to allow the conservators to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the treatment in the future. Moreover, reconstruction and restoration works are also completely documented and the administrative details are recorded. When the treatment is completed, the condition of the object is documented again for comparison with its pretreatment condition. The National Museum (Nay Pyi Taw) is using both textual documentation and visual documentation. For textual documentation, the checklist style of documentation is used and digital photos are used for visual documentation. And then both are installed as a computer database (Moore 2000). A major objective of all conservation treatments is to increase the chemical stability of the object being treated. Cleaning often forms an important part of the stabilizing process. This is because dirt on an object can be a potent source of deterioration (as, for example, when chloride salts set up corrosion reactions on bronze, or moulds grow on organic materials like paper or textiles). At other times, cleaning may be a necessary preliminary to a further treatment (Conservation Unit Museums and Galleries Commission 1992). Therefore, cleaning the dirt is the main conservation work in the National Museum (Nay Pyi Taw) (The National Museum (Nay Pyi Taw) 2012). âDirtâ can be classiï¬ed into two types: 1. Foreign matter that is not part of the original object (Examples: soot, grease, stains, adhesives, and ï¬llings from previous treatment) 2. Products of alteration of the original materials"

364,172,0.243,Sustainable Living with Environmental Risks,"Abstract This article discusses community-based mangrove forest management and its implications for environmental risk management. The article draws on the case study of Pred Nai village in Trat province, near the Cambodian border in southeast Thailand. The village of Pred Nai has successfully re-forested 1,920 ha of mangrove forests that were previously converted into shrimp aquaculture ponds in the mid1980s. The village has set up a community forest committee and a community resource use regulation and management plan in order to regulate, control, and manage the use of resources by community members. In the process of community mangrove forest management, local villagers have been encouraged to participate in every single step of forest management and planning. It is the active involvement of the local people together with the support of the relevant authorities and national institutions that makes the Pred Nai example a success. The article concludes by pointing out the key lessons learned from community-based mangrove forest initiatives in Pred Nai that can be applied in natural disaster risk management processes.

14,175,0.243,Contested Childhoods : Growing Up in Migrancy,"LNUâas a body for youth organizationsâ interestsâcan be understood as integrated in the wider Nordic tradition of voluntary organization. As mentioned above, central characteristics of this tradition is that voluntary organizations often have a broad membership base, participation in voluntary work is generally seen as an integral part of being a member of an organization and organizations are democratically structured (TrÃ¤hgÃ¥rdh and Vamstad 2009; WollebÃ¦k and Sivesind 2010). The normative ideal is that organizations should be democratically organized in such a way that their actions reflect their membersâ preferences (Lorentzen 2004, 31). Groups are seen as a collective of individuals, and democratic procedures within groups give all members an opportunity to participate. Participation in organizations socializes each individual member into democratic values and gives them training in practical democracy. The Nordic tradition of voluntary organizations is also characterized as a peopleâs movement model, and in the Norwegian context, peopleâs movements have brought broad groups from all over the country into the public domain since the latter half of the 19th century (Ãsterud et al. 2003). Historically, the aim has been to create political weight and legitimacy through mass membership, built on a broad social mobilization. The Norwegian emphasis on democracy can partly be explained by the fact that civil organizations were established in the same period as national independence. Nineteenth century mainstream popular movements followed the same organizational structure as the political parties. They have been characterized by a hierarchical organization, where local organizations are linked together in regional and national organizations (Ãsterud et al. 2003). Peopleâs movements provided local interest in the political centre, and in many cases acted as counter-cultures to the majority culture. In line with the Nordic tradition, hierarchical and rule-based organizations are established outside the state administration. They function as an alternative political channel, and a form of political influence outside the party system and the election channel (Rokkan 1966). The voluntary organizations function as a parallel bureaucratic structure, but there are also huge overlapping zones between voluntary organizations and state administration. Voluntary organizations are crucial to Norwegian democratic culture and identity (Lorentzen 2004). The idea is that voluntary organizations can be places where members learn democratic values in practiceâboth civic and political. They are socialized in democratic decision-making procedures even when the organizations do not aim to have political influence, but are rather engaged in civic, cultural and social activities. Hence, within the Nordic tradition, the distinction between civic and political engagement often becomes blurred. Both types of engagements imply relations between individuals or groups and public institutions. This can include civic engagement in public institutions and political participation such as voting in elections or running for elected ofï¬ce. Although scholars ï¬nd that there has been a gradual transition in the Norwegian voluntary sector away from the peopleâs movement model towards philanthropy, they simultaneously conclude that as a normative ideal, the membership-based,"
347,279,0.243,Environmental Governance of the Baltic Sea (Volume 10.0),"Science-based advice is universally regarded and used as a primary trustworthy basis for environmental management and decision-making. However, at the same time, in many areas, there is an ambiguity and increasing concern about the sole dependence on expertise from the (natural) sciences, which often acts to the detriment of sufficient consideration of other knowledge claims, stakeholder perspectives and values held by actors such as NGOs, citizens or business people. Bijker et al. (2009: 1) have called this phenomenon the paradox of scientific authority and asked the question of âhow can scientific advice be effective and influential in an age in which the status of science and/or scientists seems to be as low as it has ever been?â One reason for this paradox lies in the fact that science becomes politicised whenever it is called into a political context (Weingart 1999) and is hence subject to constraints, i.e. rules, norms and evaluation criteria, other than those set by the scientific community. A basic challenge is that the demarcation that exists between the spheres of science and politics falls apart in such contexts, which consequently leads to concerns and potential conflicts about the legitimate role of science and its relation to policy. Both the role of science-based advice and the political decisions based on it may therefore become contested with respect to credibility, legitimacy and accountability (cf. Cash et al. 2003). In management practice, a distinction is often made between a science system (representing factual knowledge claims) and a social system (representing political, business and other concerns of public life) â a division that is inscribed in the institutional design of most policy systems in modern societies. Science is responsible for providing the best available knowledge in terms of a presumed value-free and objective input to political decision-making, which is accordingly seen as most rational and democratically legitimated (Funtowicz and Strand 2007; Wilson 2009). This idealised model of interaction between science and policy relies on what has been called the âideal causal chainâ of implementing scientific knowledge in policy processes (Fig. 8.1; Gezelius 2008). The ecosystem approach to management (EAM) is seen as a necessary and idealistic approach for managing marine resources and other environmental issues with regard to all five areas of environment and risks analysed here (Backer et al. 2010; Garcia et al. 2003; Hammer 2015). As a consequence, assessment and management"
175,1013,0.243,"Water Resource Systems Planning and Management : An introduction To Methods, Models, and Applications","So far this chapter has focused on the critical qualitative aspects of identifying objectives and general alternatives. The remainder of this chapter will focus on quantifying various criteria and how to use them to compare various alternatives and to identify the tradeoffs among them. What is important here, however, is to realize that considerable effort is worth spending on getting the general objectives and alternatives right before spending any time on their quantiï¬cation. There are no quantitative aids for this, just hard thinking, perhaps keeping in mine some of the advice just presented. Quantiï¬cation of an objective is the adoption of some quantitative (numerical) scale that provides an indicator for how well the objective would be achieved. For example, one of the objectives of a watershed conservation program might be protection or preservation of wildlife. In order to rank how various plans meet this objective, a numerical criterion is needed, such as acres of preserved habitat or populations of key wildlife species. Quantiï¬cation does not require that all objectives be described in comparable units. The same watershed conservation program could have a flood control objective quantiï¬ed as the"
282,48,0.243,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"Why do organisations generally, including partnerships, need appropriate accountability mechanisms? For many this may seem like asking âwhy should individuals behave morally?â so obvious seems the normative content of accountability. As argued in the Introduction, the moral appeal of the concept of accountability is so strong that it has become a rallying cry for partnership critics. If the charge that partnerships are unaccountable can be substantiated, this would seriously undermine the partnership approach to public policy. It may be because accountability is a âhurrahwordâ (Bovens, 2005, p. 182) that it is rarely discussed why we actually see it as a âgoodâ. Without a clea r normative basis, however, there is bound to be confusion over what accountability means in practice. Note, for example, that our accountability expectations differ significantly depending on the kind of institution concerned. Thus an accountable government needs democratic elections, an informed public, effective parliamentary control systems and transparency on decision making and the budget. An advocacy NGO, by contrast, may be expected to be transparent about the sources of its funds and their allocation, but not necessarily to be democratic in its operations. Mulgan and Uhr confirm these differences in expectations when they write: Although the term âaccountabilityâ is fundamental to governance discourse, expectations of accountability vary quite markedly with different institutional and community perspectives. (Mulgan and Uhr, 2000, p. 1) Faced with these variations, some analysts propose to abandon accountability as a normative principle. Brown and Moore, for example, propose to treat accountability not as an abstract, fixed moral ideal, but instead as a strategic idea. [â¦ In this conception,] instead of there being one right answer of how best to structure accountability, one gives a contingent answer. (Brown and Moore, 2001, p. 2)"
282,53,0.243,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"For corporations, the argument has been developed most extensively in stakeholder theory. A stakeholder, in the original definition of R. Edward Freeman, is âany group or individual who is affected by or can affect the achievement of an organizationâs objectivesâ (Freeman, 1984, p. 5). The normative claim is that stakeholder groups should have a say in important decisions of the institutions they are affected by. Again, in Freemanâs words, each of these stakeholder groups has a right not to be treated as a means to some end, and therefore must participate in determining the future direction of the firm in which they have a stake. (Freeman, 2001, p. 39) What Freeman is advocating is much more than just consulting stakeholders before taking decisions. He envisages a system in which the claims of other stakeholder groups have the same weight as the interests of shareholders. The goal of his theory is to replace âthe notion that managers have a duty to stockholders with the concept that managers bear a fiduciary relationship to stakeholdersâ (Freeman, 2001, p. 39). Kenneth Goodpaster calls this the âmulti-fiduciary stakeholder synthesisâ and explains that this would involve a management team processing stakeholder information by giving the same care to the interests of, say, employees, customers, and local communities as to the economic interests of stockholders. [â¦ And] all stakeholders are treated by management as having equally important interests, deserving joint âmaximizationâ. (Goodpaster, 2002, p. 53) Stakeholder theory thus falls clearly into the category of arguments justifying accountability on the basis of power. Stakeholders include those who are influenced by a companyâs activities.7 They are said to have a right to be included in decision making, which means that the company has the corresponding duty to establish an accountability mechanism working through participation. Many advocates of stakeholder theory simply assert that there is a moral basis for this claim, rather than argue for it.8 As his last quote indicates, however, Freeman does make the normative argument and bases his claims on a Kantian deontological approach to ethics.9 According to this approach, acts are ethical when they are guided by considerations of rights and duties, not consequences.10 For Kant, the defining characteristic of humans is their capacity to reason. Reason enables humans to transcend their desires, make ethical judgements and act accordingly. This free will gives humans dignity and constitutes their unconditional worth."
219,389,0.243,Economics of Land Degradation and Improvement â A Global Assessment for Sustainable Development,"Government Effectiveness and Governance As noted by Nkonya and Anderson (2015), government effectivenessâdeï¬ned as the quality of public & civil services and their degree of independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the governmentâs commitment to such policiesâhas a positive impact on SLM. Government effectiveness index (GEI) scale ranges from â2.5 (weak) to 2.5 (strong). Using the average GEI in 2005â07, we divided countries in three groups, weak government effectiveness, whose GEI was lower than â1.0; medium (â1.0 < GEI < 0.0), and Strong (GEI â¥ 0). SSA has the lowest government effectiveness in the world as a third of the 48 SSA countries reporting have a GEI index below â1âthe worldâs largest share in this group (Table 9.3). There has been signiï¬cant improvement in democracies in some SSA countries and setbacks in democratization in other countries (Lynch and Crawford 2011). About 35 % of the SSA countries experienced improvement in government effectiveness in the 2007â12 period compared to the 1997â2000 period (Table 9.4). Nine of the 16 countries that experienced GEI improvement fall in the medium GEI category and two in the best GEI (Mauritius and RÃ©union). The remaining ï¬ve fall in the worst case group (GEI smaller than â1). This suggests the difï¬culty in government effectiveness improvement for countries with weak GEI. Accordingly, most of the countries which experienced weakening of government effectiveness are grouped in the worst case group, i.e., a GEI smaller than average GEI."

Therefore, the concept is distinguished from more traditional and top-down conservation, e.g., via protected areas towards finding solutions that aim to meet the needs of a diverse range of stakeholders. For this purpose, participatory approaches to co-design, co-creation and co-management (âco-co-coâ) of nature-based solutions are advocated (EC 2016). Fourth, the concept of NbS is action-oriented. While IUCN recognises the need for linking policy with action on the ground, the latter is emphasised (MacKinnon et al. 2008, IUCN n.d.). However, the Horizon 2020 work programme for 2016â 2017 seeks for systemic solutions to the development and implementation of NbS (EC 2016). This will require that attention is placed on regulatory frameworks, planning systems and economic instruments. Concurrently, Horizon 2020 expects largescale pilot and demonstration projects that may serve as reference points for the upscaling of NbS across Europe and beyond."

152,91,0.242,interdisciplinary Perspectives On Mortality and Its Timings : When Is Death?,"Through his embalming, Poelman responded to, and redefined, funeral rituals in Belgium. He acknowledged the growing importance of the tomb as a âpious object of veneration that speaks to our soulâ and place where the living and the dead could reunite in an âinvisible communionâ.51 Poelman urged that people considering a tomb should also consider embalming as a means to commemorate the dead, something he called a âsacred obligationâ.52 As presented by Poelman, embalming was a consolation for the living and a means by which they could still maintain a relationship with the dead. In the 1840s, just as Poelman promised to create a corpse that appeared to be sleeping, a Belgian pharmacist named Joseph Michiels promised to immortalise the corpse as a kind of living statue. Michiels experimented with several bodies in an effort to conserve them by covering them with copper, gold, or silver. His efforts were praised in the Belgian medical press as a method to conserve pathological specimens and as a form of embalming.53 Michiels presented his preparations at one of the meetings of the Belgian Royal Academy of Science and Fine Arts in 1843, where an audience admired the âperfect representation of the traits of the faceâ in the preparations.54 Though Michiels presented his conservation method in the form of anatomical preparations, the scientific community encouraged and discussed its application in a non-medical context: âfamilies can place their parents in accessible galleries, as an alternative to enclosing them in dark tombsâ.55 Instead of tracing the features of the face, as the death mask process did,56 Michiels traced the entire body and transformed it into a sculpture, or a âstatue for everyoneâ, as one local newspaper reported.57 Michielsâs conservation method allowed families to hold on to the corpse, literally, and keep it at home as if it were a jewel or decoration. As the Journal de MÃ©decine de Bordeaux noted: âit seems that a gilded corpse would do well in a comfortably furnished apartmentâ.58"
258,13,0.242,New Horizons for Asian Museums and Museology,"One of the main features of these museology courses has always been a comprehensive approach to covering matters related to museums, rather than focusing on a single topic. From FY2004 onwards, all courses have been comprised of a 10 week general program (for all participants) and a 3-week specialized program (various electives). The general program includes an overview of museology, such as collection, conservation, exhibition, collaboration with society, and museum management. The lectures and practice cover these topics, and participants are asked to give presentations resulting from their own experiences and to take part in study trips. The study trips are designed for experiencing the diverse styles and conditions of Japanese museums. In addition to this, during weekends and holidays throughout the course, participants visit museums in the region, according to their own interests and specialties. Usually, they visit a total of 40â50 museums during their stay in Japan. For a 3-week specialized program, three specialized programs are offered each week, from which participants select one. For example, the specialized programs for the 2014 curriculum were; ï¬rst week, âPreventive Conservation,â âManagement of a Local History Museum,â or âPhotography,â second week, âConservation and Restoration of Objects,â âMuseum and Local Communities,â or âFilming,â and third week, âExcavating and Controlling Archaeological Resources,â âExhibition Design,â or âDocumentation and Databases.â Interactive exchange of experiences and information, in other words âforumorientedâ learning, instead of unilateral classroom lectures, is what the courses seek to achieve.

Though the discussion about the role that advocacy groups play in society is a worthwhile one, it is not the point of our study and of this book. We are confining our analysis to social delivery organizations (SDOs), those aiming to provide social benefits within the given political framework of each nation, and even among those, to groups working in areas associated with basic human needs such as education, health, poverty alleviation, and the environment. Advocacy organizations working in areas such as human rights, legal reform, and labor issues do important work, but it is also necessary to clarify the differences between these types of efforts and those that seek to address challenges lower on Maslowâs hierarchy, which places food, shelter, and health among our basic needs. The distinction between SDOs and advocacy organizations can be difficult to ascertain. Many SDOs also advocate for regulatory change around a specific set of issues. As we will see later in the book, a number of the organizations we studied were encouraged to provide input to the government. Bainian Vocational Services, for example, worked with the government to change the scope and availability of vocational training opportunities for children of migrant workers and the rural poor. Eden Social Welfare Foundation pushed government to create greater access for the disabled in Taiwan, and the Magic Bus was instrumental in getting the Indian government to change educational policies and programs around sports and athletic programs. But when we talk about advocacy organizations and those that are encountering resistance in Asia, we are specifically referring to those organizations that combine two elements: (1) they do not have intervention programs and spend 100 percent of their time and financial resources on policy change; and (2) these changes are perceived by government as antagonistic rather than complementary. Throughout Asia, the largest donations to these types of organizations come from outside the region. For this reason, states such as India and China are reassessing the way that foreign funding comes into the country and the types of organizations it supports. Currently, in many countries around the world, the degrees of freedom for foreign-funded advocacy organizations are shrinking. This book does not make a judgment about these changes, but merely attempts to describe the phenomena and the possible ramifications on local philanthropy and SDOs."

282,18,0.24,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"While these definitions differ from one another in various respects, they all belong to the same emerging discourse that places partnerships in the context of a public policy or governance context. As such, they have a significantly different understanding of the term than a standard dictionary definition such as Merriam-Websterâs that defines âpartnershipâ as a legal term. [A partnership is] a legal relation existing between two or more persons contractually associated as joint principals in a business, or a relationship resembling a legal partnership and usually involving close cooperation between parties having specified and joint rights and responsibilities. (Merriam-Webster, 2004, entry for âpartnershipâ) 2.1.2 Partnerships between networks and corporatism While the term âpartnershipâ is by now much used in political practice and analysis, there is no extended theoretical work establishing a theory of policy partnerships. Networks and corporatism, by contrast, are concepts or models with a much longer and more refined theoretical pedigree. Both terms deal with modes of policymaking that include actors from the private and/or civil society sectors and have been applied to the study of partnerships. This section provides a brief summary of both traditions of thought and explains the overlaps and differences as compared to the partnership concept used here. 2.1.2.1 Corporatism Corporatism is a political system that provides for a legal representation of different industrial, economic and professional groups and their inclusion in political decision-making processes.7 Early proponents of corporatist political structures such as Adam MÃ¼ller saw corporatism as a way to transform class conflict into class cooperation. Fascist economic theory and practice drew heavily on this concept, contributing to the negative associations made with the term today.8 Are partnerships between governmental organisations, corporations and civil society organisations, then, just a revival of corporatist structures under a new guise? This, in fact, is one of the more powerful criticisms that have been directed against proposed and existing partnerships.9 Some significant parallels exist between corporatism and partnerships that warrant a careful analysis of the arguments made and evidence collected in the literature about corporatism. First, corporatism, like partnerships, is about including organised interests in the policymaking process. As a consequence, the participation of individuals in the political process takes a setback in both arrangements â an argument that is particularly important for partnerships operating at the national or local level. At the same time, this means that in both cases the participation of groups can be regulated, thereby potentially minimising existing inequalities of access to people in power."

This also includes diversification of the connections between society and individuals. As agricultural people, Japanese people have long been connected to land. Beginning with growing rice, work has had its roots in the local community, leaving no other option than to belong to the local community group. Anyone who disrupted that unity was ostracized and could lose their work as well as their domestic base. Not all that long ago, corporate culture was somewhat close to that. Lifetime employment was the base for life and participation in company events such as parties, sports days and company-sponsored recreational trips for employees were practically compulsory. The local community that was bound together by rice-growing, and companies from some time ago, were places for forging bonds through group work. An affluent society was made possible because of the solidarity in such groups. However, now that people have acquired that affluence, its value has faded. These days, whenever something occurs, there is a clamor about the importance of bonds but that could be due to an instinctive feeling of crisis about the disappearance of such bonds. Bonds are formed when people take part in group work earnestly. If so, then group work for creating the Platinum Society could take on that role too. These days, aside from working to earn oneâs livelihood, people often have some other kind of work they do because it gives their life meaning, or else they do something"
376,114,0.239,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","the adage âan ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cureâ is applicable. In areas where WPE is at advanced stages, grassland restoration may not be economically feasible or sustainable and alternative land uses should be considered. Grasslands and savannas are integral to the global carbon, water, and nitrogen cycles, and to human well-being (Campbell and Stafford Smith 2000; Reynolds et al. 2007; Peters et al. 2015). Their extensive airsheds and watersheds provide habitat for wildlife and a variety of ecosystem goods and services important to both local and distant settlements and cities. As such, they have considerable multipurpose value. A key component of dryland ecosystem management is maintaining the proportions of herbaceous and woody plants within a range that satisfies a given set of objectives and values, some of which may be conflicting (e.g., wildlife vs. livestock, Du Toit et al. 2010; Augustine et al. 2011). Perspectives on woody plants in rangelands vary widely depending on cultural traditions and land-use goals and objectives. In many regions of the world, woody plants are a valued source of food (e.g., honey, fruits, seeds), fuel, charcoal, and construction materials and an important source of fodder for browsing livestock (e.g., goats, camels), and wildlife. Additionally, there is growing recognition that woody plants on rangelands can provide products with potential commercial (e.g., gums, resins) or medicinal value. Policy and management issues related to rangeland conservation have evolved to extend well beyond the traditional concerns of livestock production and game management (wildlife valued for sport hunting) to include potential effects on hydrology, carbon sequestration, biological diversity, atmospheric chemistry, and climate system (Archer 2010; Eldridge et al. 2011). The research community is challenged with quantifying and monitoring these varied impacts so that trade-offs (Fig. 2.15) can be assessed objectively and used as the foundation for science-based decision making. The management community is challenged with devising approaches for creating or maintaining woody-herbaceous mixtures in spatial arrangements that negotiate and balance competing land use and conservation objectives."
341,249,0.239,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,"The decision-making architecture of transboundary water governance comprises two scales, namely, organisation and institution. In this chapter the definitions from North (1990) are adopted, where institutions are considered âthe rules of the gameâ and include principles, policies, regulations, legislation, conventions, agreements, treaties and social norms and organisations are considered the âplayersâ, for example, government departments, non-government organisations, civil society groups, river basin organisations, municipalities and community-based organisations. These organisations and institutions can be explicitly mapped out for each transboundary water issue of interest as a mechanism to develop a deeper understanding of the levels within each scale that comprise this architecture."
233,622,0.239,Biodiversity Conservation and Phylogenetic Systematics : Preserving Our Evolutionary Heritage in An Extinction Crisis (Volume 14.0),"Phylogenetic diversity is now a core part of conservation biology, reï¬ecting its link to option values and to evolutionary potential. Further, there is good overlap with related issues in broader ecology. These include community ecologyâs interest in productivity (e.g. Cadotte et al. 2012), resilience (e.g. Pugliesi and Rapini 2015) and the functioning of evosystems (e.g. Srivastava et al. 2012) and microbial ecologyâs use of PD as a cornerstone for exploring diversity patterns at multiple scales (Lozupone and Knight 2005, 2008; Faith et al. 2009). As the chapters in this book demonstrate, the development of new methods and their applications are very much tuned into human impacts and sustainability issues. Thus, red listings, drivers of extinction, and changes in spatial and temporal distribution of phylogenetic diversity are common elements of these studies. All this promotes the incorporation of phylogenetic diversity in the international conservation agenda. These prospects are magniï¬ed by the remarkable facilities for obtaining entire or large parts of genomes or other molecular sequences of any kind of organisms, and by the sheer magnitude of biological (gene sequences, trait databases, species occurrences, red lists) and environmental data (climate layers for past, present and future interpolated to very ï¬ne spatial scales; land-use layers, spatial data indicating particular important risks such as ï¬res, ï¬oods, and so on) now available in the public domain. All these allow for rapid estimation of the phylogenetic relationships for a large number of organisms in association with potential distribution and threats for species and lineages. In addition, under the stimulus of modern phylogenetic and molecular methods, systematics is going through a signiï¬cant transformation that will certainly inï¬uence biodiversity conservation (Mace et al. 2003; Pons et al. 2006; Vogler and Monaghan 2006; Faith et al. 2010; Yahara et al. 2010). For closing this book, we will brieï¬y describe this transformation of systematics and then discuss some impacts of these changes in biological conservation. We ï¬nish by exploring the possibility of deï¬ning âplanetary boundariesâ for biodiversity on the basis of phylogenetic diversity, and its important role in linking biodiversity into broader societal perspectives and needs."
341,80,0.238,Freshwater Governance for the 21st Century,A first step in the process of effective stakeholder engagement is to identify who they are and to determine what motivates them. Knowing who is responsible for what and at which level is an essential starting point and can help identify
282,139,0.238,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"â¢ Mission statements should be published in a prominent position in publications and reference documents and should be known to the partnershipsâ key stakeholders. â¢ To increase the mission statementâs practical relevance and ensure that it is and continues to be backed by partner organisations, partnerships should periodically discuss and review their missions. 5.1.3.2 Orient partnership activities along the mission Once a partnership has created a clear and meaningful mission statement, the next challenge is to ensure its relevance to the partnershipâs activities. Accountability to mission implies that the mission statement plays a central role in the planning and work of a partnership. This can be achieved if the following principles are respected: â¢ Partnerships should not conduct any major activities that are unrelated to their mission. Instead, all important elements of their work programmes should promote their mission. â¢ Mission statements should guide the strategic planning of partnerships. Using a results chain or logical framework approach,42 partnerships should identify which courses of action are likely to contribute to achieving their mission and select them accordingly. â¢ To make the rationale behind their work programmes transparent, partnerships should also structure their activity reports around their mission. These reports should contain an explanation of how the partnershipâs main efforts are intended to contribute to the mission. Moreover, activity reports should portray the partnershipâs achievements, the obstacles it encountered and the consequences it drew from past experiences. 5.1.3.3 Employ resources efficiently in pursuit of the mission Finally, an organisation intent on creating accountability for working towards its mission needs to demonstrate that it uses its resources efficiently in pursuing its goals. Measuring efficiency in organisations addressing public policy problems is notoriously difficult, because they have no clearly defined bottom line and address complex issues.43 Most efforts to evaluate the efficiency of public policy programmes rely on benchmarks. Benchmarking is a technique originally developed by companies. It involves identifying the best competitor and using that organisationâs performance as a yardstick.44 Benchmarking can be a useful tool for assessing the relative efficiency of partnerships or other organisations working in the same field. It could be used, for example, to compare the efficiency of the Global Fund, RBM and other health providers in fighting malaria. Benchmarking, however, cannot usually serve to establish detailed"
72,256,0.238,New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research,"Between November 2011 and November 2012, forty-one CCFs were held, with a total of 5,456 citizens in attendance. The forty-one forums produced 717 citizen suggestions and 538 suggestions (75%) were subsequently implemented. The remaining 166 suggestions were to be included in SMGâs long-term plans. The 717 suggestions can be categorised into three groups: development of new programmes (84.1%); improvement of existing systems such as youth employment and homelessness policies (13%); and allocation of new budgets (2.9%). A key outcome of the CCF after its first year of operation was the creation of new public-citizen governance bodies that aimed to develop and support public policies. One of the biggest tasks was to report on the progress being made while SMG implemented the citizen proposals made at the CCF. This required SMG to set up publicâcivic groups to gather feedback and to ask these bodies to take some responsibility in implementing citizen ideas. One example of a programme implemented as a result of the CCF is the Seoul Library Network, which was created after discussing new policies supporting libraries in Seoul. The Mobile Mayoral Office The Mobile Mayoral Office (MMO) was designed to identify the root causes of unresolved issues or hidden problems and suggest possible solutions. To achieve this goal, key decision-makers, including the Mayor, two deputy Mayors, the head of a borough, Members of Parliament, and city and local councillors, visited local sites where there were long-standing issues and met residents affected by those issues. The MMO employed multi-channel communication tools (the CCF, Suk-Ui and other online communication tools) during the course of its operation. SMG ran two types of MMO: an MMO for boroughs in Seoul and an MMO for selected issues.9 Borough-level MMOs took place regularly while MMOs for selected issues only took place when a certain issue became pressing. Borough-level MMOs typically ran for two days. A preparation team, which usually consisted of officers from the Local Authority Team at SMG and from a borough office, selected ten major issues within the borough. The team also set out a visiting plan and arranged citizen meetings. The MMO started with a briefing for decision-makers on the issues, followed by visits to key places and meetings with local representatives. During the first day, key decision-makers and their working teams often came across new issues that they felt should be added to the list of critical issues to be discussed. In the evening of the same day, key"
282,240,0.238,Accountability in Public Policy Partnerships,"4 Partnerships in Practice 1. The terms âclassâ, âcategoryâ, âtypeâ, âgroupâ and âkindâ can all have more specific meanings in different contexts. Within a biological taxonomy, for example, a class of animals occupies a clearly defined position in the hierarchy of groups, subgroups and further subdivisions. Likewise, categories in their original Aristotelian use denote a limited number of fundamental classes that together encompass all phenomena. Despite these differences, and corresponding to their common usage, the terms are used as rough equivalents here. 2. For the purposes of a review of the literature and research on partnerships addressing social issues, Selsky and Parker, for example, organise partnerships in four âarenasâ: non-profit â business partnerships; government â business partnerships; government â non-profit partnerships; and partnerships involving actors from all three sectors (Selsky and Parker, 2005, p. 854). 3. The Business Partners for Development (BPD), for example, orient their work along partnership clusters, including partnerships working on natural resources, on water and sanitation, on youth development and road safety. For more information on BPDâs work, see http://www.bpdweb.com (last accessed 27 August 2009). 4. Anne-Marie Slaughter, for example, categorises transnational regulatory networks based on their institutional characteristics. Thus she distinguishes networks of national government officials that develop and operate within international organisations from networks that are based on executive agreements between governments and those that arise âspontaneouslyâ outside existing institutional arrangements. These three types of transnational networks have significant differences in their accountability (Slaughter, 2001, pp. 9â14). 5. BÃ¶rzel and Risse, though operating with a definition of partnerships that is much wider than the one employed here, use this criterion for classifying partnerships between public institutions and private organisations. They identify four types of partnerships: the regular consultation or cooptation of private partners; the delegation or âoutsourcingâ of public functions to private institutions; co-regulation, where private actors hold at least a veto over outcomes; and publicly encouraged self-regulation of private actors. Cf. BÃ¶rzel and Risse (2005) p. 200. Similarly, Murphy and Bendell (1997) categorise partnerships between businesses and NGOs according to the degree to which NGOs are involved in business operations. They distinguish involvement in business processes, in business projects or relating to a product. 6. Klaus Dieter Wolf analyses the contribution of private actors to governance. To determine different levels of de-governmentalisation, he measures both the scope of involvement (from agenda setting to monitoring compliance) and its intensity (marking hierarchical, cooperative, complementary or intervening models). Cf. Wolf (2001), pp. 7â11. Long and Arnold (1995) characterise environmental partnerships by the degree of conflict prevailing between partner organisations and distinguish between preemptive, coalescing, exploration and leverage partnerships."
