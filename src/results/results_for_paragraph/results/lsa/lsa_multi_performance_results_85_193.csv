Suppose S, â is a CSA with a single unit E, top element F, and â complements s. Suppose further that shares satisfy the disjointness property aâa = b â a = E. For the multiplicative structure, assume S, â, F is a monoid (i.e. the axioms forced by the DotDot, DotMapsTo, and DotFull rules). It is undesirable for a share model if multiplying two positive shares (e.g. the ability to read a memory cell) results in the empty permission, so we assume that when Ï1 and Ï2 are non-E then their product Ï1 â Ï2 = E. Now add left or right distributivity. We choose right distributivity (s1 â s2 ) â s3 = (s1 â s3 ) â (s2 â s3 ); the situation is mirrored with left. Let us show that we cannot have left inverses for Ï = F. We prove by contradiction: suppose Ï = F and there exists Ï â1 such that Ï â1 â Ï = F. Then Ï = F â Ï = (Ï â1 â Ï â1 ) â Ï = (Ï â1 â Ï) â (Ï â1 â Ï) = F â (Ï â1 â Ï) Let e = Ï â1 â Ï. Now Ï = F â e = (e â e) â e, which by associativity and disjointness forces e = E, which in turn forces Ï = F, a contradiction. Now suppose that instead of adding multiplicative inverses we have both left and right distributivity. First we prove (Lemma 1) that for arbitrary s â S, s â s = s â s. We calculate: (s â s) â (s â s) = s â (s â s) = s â F = s = F â s = (s â s) â s = (s â s) â (s â s) Lemma 1 follows by the cancellativity of â between the far left and the far right. Now we show (Lemma 2) that s â s = E. We calculate: F = F â F = (s â s) â (s â s) = (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) = (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) â (s â s) The final equality is by Lemma 1. The underlined portion implies s â s = E by disjointness. The upshot of Lemma 2, together with our requirement that the product of two positive shares be positive, is that we can have no more than the two elements E and F in our share model. Since the entire motivation for fractional share models is to allow ownership between E and F, we must choose either left or right distributivity; we choose right since we are able to prove that the Ï â² -uniformity side condition enables the bidirectional DotStar."

70,689,0.536,Optics in Our Time,"possible to produce and observe the interference of matter waves as well. A simple way to do so is to mimic Youngâs optical double-slit experiment. Practical challenges are that for interferences to be easily observable the width of the slits must be much narrower than de Broglie wavelength, and also that the slit separation should typically be of the order of that wavelength. Modern nanotechnology has solved this problem and makes it possible to fabricate a variety of combinations of holes and slits through which matter waves can propagate. For example, one can pass a beam of atoms through a large array of parallel slits. This is an atom optics analog of the diffraction gratings widely used in optics. An important and useful property of such gratings is that the interferences of the individual wavelets result in different wavelengths (colors) exiting the grating at different angles. Likewise, a nanofabricated mechanical grating can redirect an atomic beam, or even a single atom, in a direction that depends on its energy and momentum. As a result, properly designed gratings can act as mirrors or as beam splitters for atoms (. Fig. 14.6 ). One can also use light instead of nanofabricated elements to achieve that goal. In the discussion of laser cooling we mentioned that if a photon is absorbed by an atom, then its momentum must be transferred to that atom because of momentum conservation. So, if a photon propagating from left to right is absorbed, then that atom must experience a small velocity kick in that same left to right direction. If, however, the photon propagates from right to left, the velocity kick to the atom will be from right to left as well. And if the atom interacts simultaneously with two light ï¬elds, one propagating to the left and the other to the right, then it suffers both a velocity kick to the left and a velocity kick to the right. As a result the atom âgoes in both directions,â or more precisely the atomic matter wave is split into two partial waves, one propagating to the left and the other to the right. Acting together, the two light beams act as an atomic beam splitter. Much like the observation that optical interferences build up âone photon at a time,â this is his very strange. Loosely speaking, the atom can move in two directions at the same time, and be in two places at the same time. In the classical world such a behavior would be impossible: The atom would go either to the left or to the right, but not to the left and to the right."

For children, in contrast to adults, the analysis revealed strong correlations with the contralateral temporal region. The same observation was present when the seed was in the IFG. Within the same period in which homotopic connections prevail, a 5-year longitudinal study showed a linear increase with age of the left hemisphere involvement in the IFG during verb generation (Szaflarski et al. 2006), an additional demonstration that language left-hemisphere specialization develops first through callosal interactions. As a whole, these recent functional imaging studies show that anatomical and functional asymmetries of auditory primary areas are in place at birth, whereas in high-order language areas (IFG, STS, STG) leftward asymmetries develop slowly along with verbal acquisition, before reaching the adult pattern of a dominant intrahemispheric processing of language. To our knowledge, the exact time course and the physiological underpinnings of this developmental switch from inter- to intrahemispheric functioning during language processing remain to be established. It is not known whether this type of developmental scenario is also at stake for other left-lateralized function, such as praxis (Vingerhoets et al. 2013), or for rightlateralized functions, such as spatial attention."

As developed below, this observation accords with recent investigations of intrinsic connectivity (Perani et al. 2011) and functional connectivity during sentence listening (Friederici 2011), which demonstrated with a seed approach the existence of strong intra-hemispheric temporal connectivity across frontal and temporal high-order language areas."

The following organs were manually segmented: left/right kidney, spleen, liver, left/right lung, urinary bladder, rectus abdominis muscle, 1st lumbar vertebra, pancreas, left/right psoas major muscle, gallbladder, sternum, aorta, trachea and left/right adrenal gland.

95,345,0.484,Elements of Robotics,"Already from the middle left diagram, we see that it is not necessary to search towards the top left, because the f values of the cells above and to the left of S are higher than the values to the right of and below S. In the middle right diagram, the first sand cell has a value of 13 so the algorithm continues to expand the cells with the lower cost of 12 to the left. In the bottom left diagram, we see that the search does not continue to the lower left of the map because the cost of 16 is higher than the cost of 14 once the search leaves the sand. From that point, the goal cell G is found very quickly. As in Dijkstraâs algorithm, the shortest path is found by tracing back through cells with lower g values until the start cell is reached. Comparing Figs. 10.4 and 10.12 we see that the Aâ algorithm needed to visit only 71% of the cells visited by Dijkstraâs algorithm. Although the Aâ algorithm must perform additional work to compute the heuristic function, the reduced number of cells visited makes the algorithm more efficient. Furthermore, this heuristic function depends only on the area searched and not on the obstacles; even if the set of obstacles is changed, the heuristic function does not need to be recomputed."

For the STD strategy, significant features of the two words were present in the outputs of the left- and right-ear processors.

This suggests that the MOC processor may enhance the lateralization of speech, and possibly spatial segregation, in situations with multiple spatially non-overlapping speakers. Although not shown, something similar occurred for speech presented in competition with noise. This suggests that the MOC processor may (1) enhance speech intelligibility in noise or in âcocktail partyâ situations, and (2) reduce listening effort."

339,332,0.47,Etiology and Morphogenesis of Congenital Heart Disease : From Gene Function and Cellular interaction To Morphology,"20.1.1 The AV Valves and Their Leaflets The atrioventricular (AV) valves are important cardiac components that, when properly formed, prevent the retrograde flow of blood through the AV junction during ventricular systole. The precursor tissues of the AV valves are the endocardial AV cushions, formed by (1) the accumulation of cardiac jelly in the AV canal followed by (2) the population of these cushions by endocardially derived cells (ENDCs) resulting from an endocardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (or endoEMT) [1]. Not all AV cushions develop at the same time. The two âmajorâ AV cushions (the inferior and superior cushion) form first, while the two âlateralâ cushions form later [2, 3]. The major AV cushions will eventually fuse together. They will also fuse with the mesenchymal cap of the primary atrial septum and the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion (DMP) to form the AV mesenchymal complex [4]. This process is essential in the partition of the left and right atrial and ventricular components. The AV mesenchymal complex is also involved in the formation of the septal leaflet of the right AV valve and the aortic (or anterior) leaflet of the left AV valve [4, 5]. The lateral AV cushions are significantly smaller than the major AV cushions and develop at the lateral myocardial AV junctions. Just like the major AV cushions, the lateral AV cushions become populated with ENDCs. The right lateral cushion eventually forms the parietal leaflet of the right AV valve, while the left lateral cushion forms the parietal (or mural/posterior) leaflet of the left AV valve (Fig. 20.1)."

334,408,0.436,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"infiltrating local leisure clubs, voluntary fire brigades, and local social associations (Radke and Staud 2012). Also worth mentioning is the existence and activity of clandestine groups, most notably the series of murders committed by the National-Socialist Underground (Nationalsozialistischer Untergrund, NSU) between 2000 and 2006. While this group appeared to be small, one should also consider that, according to official data from March 2016, 372 right-wing activists (of which 342 had been previously sentenced) were living underground. Another component of the right-wing infrastructure, and one that partly transcends national borders, are the relatively small numbers of intellectuals, scientists, journalists and artists who directly or indirectly support the right. They serve as reference points and allegedly credible sources for right-wing claims. Sometimes these people have a long history of involvement in right-wing politics, sometimes there are also defectors who have moved from the far left to the far right. In the context of Pegida, several people of this kind gave speeches or were cited by others in the movement. To sum up, over the last few decades right-wing groups have created loosely connected and flexible structures that allow for effective communication and mobilization. The nodes in this structure vary in their concrete ideological orientation and organizational forms. While many of these groups were explicitly created to pursue political aims, there were also right-wing individuals or small groups who, nominally private, are active in non-political pockets of civil society. In organizational terms, these groups range from formal and hierarchical nationwide organizations (including political parties) to completely informal and local friendship circles. Some groups and organizations have existed for decades; others split and unite, change labels, or remain completely informal. In some cases, the link to the political right is unobtrusive, as exemplified by some music bands or web-based stores. The density of right-wing infrastructure varies considerably within Germany. In some places, it is almost absent, especially where a leftist culture prevails. In other places, most notably in some rural areas in East Germany, right-wing groups have acquired a hegemonic status so that it has become risky to express a dissenting view, let alone to live there as an apparent non-German recognizable by, for example, being nonwhite (SchrÃ¶der 1997; DÃ¶ring 2007). This anchorage and embedding in local and regional communities not only increases the self-confidence of right-wing activists but may also encourage them to engage in criminal acts such as arson attacks on asylum shelters: Acts that are sometimes publicly applauded by local bystanders, as occurred in the city of Freital (Saxony) in 2015 alongside other cities in 2015/16."
249,220,0.433,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"This is not enough to derive the rules for tonk, and hence a contradiction. This completes the proof. It has thus been shown that: â¢ Tonk cannot be defined as an adjoint functor (of some functor) in a logical system without tonk, even though tonk is an adjoint functor in a logical system that is already equipped with tonk. â This is a subtle phenomenon, and we have to be careful of what exactly the question âIs tonk an adjoint functor?â means. Due to this, naÃ¯vely formulating categorical harmony as âlogical constants = adjoint functorsâ does not work. â¢ Consequently, tonk cannot be introduced in any way according to the principle of categorical harmony. We may then conclude that tonk is a pseudo-logical constant, and the rules for tonk are not meaning-conferring, not because it is non-conservative (i.e., Belnapâs harmony fails for tonk), but because it violates the principle of categorical harmony (which is able to allow for non-conservativity as discussed above). Still, it is immediate to see the following: â¢ Tonk can actually be defined as being right adjoint to falsity diagonal ââ¥ , and left adjoint to truth diagonal ââ¤ at once. We may say that tonk is a âdoubly adjointâ functor. â¢ In categorical harmony, therefore, it is essential to allow for a single adjunction only rather than multiple adjunctions, which are harmful in certain cases. We again emphasise that tonk cannot be defined in a system without tonk by a single adjunction (i.e., there is no functor F such that an adjoint of F is tonk); nevertheless tonk can be defined by two adjunctions: ââ¥ â£ tonk â£ ââ¤ , i.e., ââ¥ is left adjoint to tonk, and tonk is left adjoint to ââ¤ . Note that double adjointness itself is not necessarily paradoxical. What is then the conceptual meaning of all this? After all, what is wrong with tonk? The right adjoint t of falsity diagonal ââ¥ may be called the binary truth constant (the ordinary truth constant â¤ is nullary), because the double-line rule of this adjunction boils down to Ï â¢ L Ï1 t Ï2 , which means that Ï1 t Ï2 is implied by any formula Ï (for any Ï1 , Ï2 ). Likewise, the left adjoint s of truth diagonal ââ¤ may be called the âbinary falsity constantâ, because the double-line rule of this adjunction boils down to Ï1 s Ï2 â¢ L Ï, which means that Ï1 s Ï2 implies any Ï. Now, the rÃ´le of tonk is to make the two (binary) truth and falsity constants (t and s) collapse into the same one constant, thus leading the logical system to inconsistency (or triviality); obviously, truth and falsity cannot be the same. This confusion of truth and falsity is the problem of tonk. To put it differently, a right adjoint of ââ¥ and a left adjoint of ââ¤ must be different, nevertheless tonk requires the two adjoints to be the same; the one functor that are"

128,214,0.431,Solidarity in Europe : Citizens' Responses in Times of Crisis,"This confirms our hypothesis that disability is not a divisive issue in political terms, whereas solidarity engagement in the other two fields is more related to political-ideological elements. Once again, the field of refugees is singled out for its specificity: here, centre-left people are by far the largest category. Finally, it is worth noting that people not self-placed on the left-right scale are under-represented in all fields, signalling again the positive linkage between political involvement and civic engagement in solidarity actions. Table 6.9 shows the relationship between the libertarian-authoritarian index and solidarity actions, too. Electoral studies have highlighted that new political issues linked to the libertarian-authoritarian dimension have become salient for voters (Thomassen 2005), besides the traditional lines of political contestation (left-right and religion). In our survey, there are several questions connected to a broader libertarian-authoritarian divide, as confirmed by a factor analysis.3 Consequently, we created an additive index linked to a unique factor component. This index is an indicator of libertarian values, and we recoded it classifying values between 0 and 4.4 as âauthoritarianâ, values between 4.6 and 5.4 as âneutralâ, and values between 5.6 and 10 as âlibertarianâ. Findings confirm that disability is not a divisive issue in political terms, whereas solidarity engagement in the unemployment field and, above all, in the refugees field is more related to political values. Indeed, in the latter field people with libertarian values are by far the largest category, whereas within the whole sample people with authoritarian values are the largest category. Focusing on voting behaviour (see Table 6.10) confirms previous analysis: a difference between centre-left and right-wing partiesâ voters emerges only among people carrying out solidarity activities in favour of refugees. Indeed, people who vote for centre-left parties (Democratic Party and radical left parties) are over-represented compared to the total population, whereas right-wing voters of Northern League are underrepresented. This is in line with our expectation. Regarding the Five Star Movement, its voters are over-represented among people engaging in solidarity actions. According to several studies, indeed, the Five Star Movement is a web-populist party (Corbetta and Gualmini 2013) appealing for direct democracy and cross-cutting the traditional left-right dimension (Maggini 2014; Tronconi 2015). This also means that among its voters there are people with left-wing values (pro-refugees) as well as right-wing people (anti-migration). The Five Star Movement is the most over-represented among people supporting the unemployed. This is"

Askenfelt and Jansson showed that vibrations perpendicular to the side of the neck, measured on four violins of varying quality during playing a single note (lowest G, 196 Hz), were above or very close to vibration sensation thresholds measured at the fingertip under passive touch conditions by Verrillo [61]. However, no evidence was found that higher neck vibration intensity would result in judging a violin as being of better quality [4]. One limitation of that study was that"

However, a direct put-execution of f with the inputs (Right (1, [2, 3])) and [ ] crashes (represented by â¥ above), for a good reason, as the two inputs are in an inconsistent state with respect to f . This is where reconciliation functions come into the picture. For the Left branch above, a sensible reconciliation function will be (Î» .Î» .Left [ ]), which when applied turns the conflicting source (Right (1, [2, 3])) into Left [ ], and consequently the put-execution may succeed with the new inputs and returns Left [ ]. It is not difficult to verify that the âreconciledâ put-execution still satisfies well-behavedness. Note that despite the similarity in types, reconciliation functions are not put; they merely provide a default source value to allow stuck put-executions to proceed. We visualise the effect of reconciliation functions in Fig. 1. The left-hand side is bidirectional execution without successful branchswitching, and since Ïm bn is false (indicating that bn is not in the range of the mth branch) the execution of put must (rightfully) fail in order to guarantee well-behavedness.

There is no problem at all if we add to a logical system the right adjoint of ââ¥ and the left adjoint of ââ¤ separately, any of which is completely harmless. Unpleasant phenomena only emerge if we add the two adjoints as just a single connective, that is, we make the fallacy of equivocation. Let us think of a slightly different sort of equivocation. As explained above, â§ is right adjoint to diagonal â, and â¨ is left adjoint to it. What if we confuse these two adjoints? By way of experiment, let us define âdisconjunctionâ as the functor that is right adjoint to diagonal, and left adjoint to it at the same time. Of course, a logical system with disconjunction leads to inconsistency (or triviality). Needless to say, the problem of disconjunction is the problem of equivocation: conjunction and disjunction are different, yet disconjunction mixes them up. Then, is the problem of disconjunction precisely the same as the problem of tonk? This would be extensionally true, yet intensionally false. It is true in the sense that both pseudo-logical constants fall into the fallacy of equivocation. Nonetheless, it is false in the sense that the double adjointness condition of disconjunction is stronger than the double adjointness condition of tonk. What precisely makes the difference between tonk and disconjunction? Tonk is a right adjoint of one functor, and at the same time a left adjoint of another functor. In contrast to this, disconjunction is a right and left adjoint of just a single functor. Disconjunction is, so to say, a uniformly doubly adjoint functor, as opposed to the fact that tonk is merely a doubly adjoint functor. The difference between tonk and disconjunction thus lies in uniformity. Hence: â¢ On the ground that uniform double adjointness is in general stronger than double adjointness, we could say that disconjunction is more paradoxical than tonk, endorsing a stronger sort of equivocation. â¢ We thereby lead to the concept of intensional degrees of paradoxicality of logical constants. Degrees concerned here are degrees of uniformity of double adjointness or equivocation. What is then the strongest degree of paradoxicality in terms of adjointness? It is self-adjointness, and it is at the source of Russell-type paradoxical constants. A selfadjoint functor is a functor that is right and left adjoint to itself. This is the strongest form of double adjointness. Now, let us think of a nullary paradoxical connective R defined by the following double-line rule (this sort of paradoxical connectives has been discussed in Schroeder-Heister [20, 22]):"

334,418,0.42,Protest Movements in Asylum and Deportation,"Macro-structural conditions affect right-wing movements in objective ways but also in the way they are subjectively perceived and interpreted. Because of their relative stability and structuration, such factors cannot explain the short and dynamic ups and downs of action mobilization. However, they are important for providing the breeding ground for widespread sentiments and perceptions that can be instrumentalized by social movements, organizations and protest entrepreneurs. Regarding the spread of populist, right-wing and xenophobic attitudes since the late 1990s, one important reference point is the processes and conditions attributed to globalization. In contrast to left-wing politics, where only some aspects of globalization (e.g., neoliberalism) were heavily criticized, those of the right tended to reject globalization on principle and predominantly recruited supporters from the losers of globalization (Kriesi 2008). This process was fostered by the declining role of nation states in an internationalized economy, the recent global financial crises, the increasing gap between the rich and the poor, and the expected rise of competition among the middle and lower classes for scarce resources. Another key background factor that fostered the growth of right-wing sentiment during this period were certain far-reaching cultural developments. Generally speaking, right-wing groups tend to fundamentally question the co-existence and blending of different cultures and ways of life. In wider society there has been a growing trend towards multiculturalism, spurred on by a whole range of factors such as economic globalization, globalized cultural patterns and styles, tourism, refugee and labor migration. This growing multiculturalism manifests itself not"

Strikingly, however, the inter-aural output difference (IOD, black arrows in Fig. 2a) was greater for the MOC than for the STD strategy. This is because the gain (or compression) in the each of the two MOC processors was inhibited in direct proportion to the output energy from the corresponding frequency channel in the contralateral processor.

It emphasizes the importance for people with autism to enjoy the same rights as all people in Europe, as far as they can, taking into account their best interests. It is also stated that these rights should be highlighted, protected and made operational through appropriate legislation in each state, taking into account the UN Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded (1971) and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons (1975). In more detail, the recommendations for people with autism are: 1. the right to lead an independent life, to be carried out according to their means 2. the right to a diagnosis and an accurate clinical assessment, comprehensible and free from preconceptions 3. the right to receive an appropriate education, freely accessible to all 4. the right for them (or their representatives) to participate in all decisions about their future 5. the right to accessible and adequate housing 6. the right to have all appropriate means, help and the responsibility necessary to lead a fully productive life with dignity and independence 7. the right to receive a pension or a salary sufficient to provide food, clothing, shelter and all other vital necessities 8. the right to participate, as much as possible, in the development and management of services that take care of their welfare 9. the right to benefit from the advice and care appropriate to their mental and physical health and for their spiritual life 10. the right to an education corresponding to their desires and meaningful employment without discrimination and without preconceived ideas 11. the right to benefit from means of transport and freedom of movement 12. the right of access to culture, recreation and leisure activities."

249,213,0.381,Advances in Proof-Theoretic Semantics (Volume 43.0),"3 Categorical Harmony in Comparison with Other Principles Here we have a look at relationships with Belnapâs harmony and the so-called reflection principle and definitional equations by Sambin and his collaborators. The categorical approach to harmony poses several questions to Belnapâs notion of harmony. As we saw above, implication â in intuitionistic logic is right adjoint to conjunction â§. Suppose that we have a logical system L with logical constants â§ and â¨ only, which are specified as the right and left adjoints of diagonal â as in the above. And suppose we want to add implication â to L. Of course, this can naturally be done by requiring the right adjoint of â§. Now, Freydâs adjoint functor theorem tells us that any right adjoint functor preserves limits (e.g., products), and any left adjoint functor preserves colimits (e.g., coproducts). This is a striking characteristic of adjoint functors. In the present case, the theorem tells us that â§ preserves â¨; in other words, â§ distributes over â¨. Thus, defining implication according to categorical harmony is not conservative over the original system L, since the bi-directional rules for â§ and â¨ only never imply the distributive law. Note that sequent calculus for â§ and â¨ allows us to derive the distributive law without any use of implication; yet the bi-directional rules alone do not imply it. Although proponents of Belnapâs harmony would regard this as a strange (and perhaps unacceptable) feature, nevertheless, this sort of non-conservativity is necessary and natural from a category-theoretical point of view. Furthermore, conservativity may be contested in some way or other. One way would be to advocate categorical harmony against Belnapâs on the ground of the Quinean holistic theory of meaning, which implies that the meaning of a single logical constant in a system, in principle, can only be determined by reference to the global relationships with all the other logical constants in the whole system. If the meaning of a logical constant depends on the whole system, then adding a new logical constant may well change the meaning of old ones. Non-conservativity on logical constants is arguably a consequence of a form of holism on meaning, even though it violates Belnapâs harmony condition. Anyway, we may at least say that the principle of categorical harmony, or Lawvereâs idea of logical constants as adjoints, is in sharp conflict with Belnapâs notion of harmony, in terms of the conservativity issue. Another distinctive characteristic of adjoint functors is that any of a right adjoint and a left adjoint of a functor is uniquely determined (up to isomorphism). By this very fact, we are justified to define a concept via an adjunction. This actually implies that Belnapâs uniqueness condition automatically holds if we define a logical constant according to the principle of categorical harmony. Thus, uniqueness is not something"

Its root extends from the left of L2 to the right sacroiliac joint and it is 15 cm long. The duodenum is the first and shortest segment of the small intestine (20â30 cm) and continues into the jejunum at the duodenojejunal flexure, fixed to the retroperitoneum by ligament of Treitz. The jejunum occupies the left upper abdomen and constitutes about one third of the small bowel. One of the typical morphological finding in jejunum are the circular mucosal folds, known as valvulae conniventes or plicae semilunaris, more prominent than in the ileum and easily depicted during an MRE or CTE. The ileum occupies the central and right lower part of the abdomen, and the ileocecal valve separates the small from large intestine. Two main normal anatomical aspects should be considered during the evaluation of small bowel: wall thickness and caliber. The normal caliber of jejunal and ileal lumen, without the administration of spasmolytic agents, must be <30 mm, and the wall thickness <3 mm [1]."

Imagine that you are sitting at the table and both of your neighbors are eating. You are blocked waiting for your right fork. Eventually your right neighbor will put it down, because eat canât run forever. Since you are the only thread waiting for that fork, you will necessarily get it next. By a similar argument, you cannot starve waiting for your left fork. Therefore, the time a philosopher can spend at the table is bounded. That implies that the wait time to get into the room is also bounded, as long as footman has Property 4 (see Section 4.3). This solution shows that by controlling the number of philosophers, we can avoid deadlock. Another way to avoid deadlock is to change the order in which the philosophers pick up forks. In the original non-solution, the philosophers are ârightiesâ; that is, they pick up the right fork first. But what happens if Philosopher 0 is a leftie? Puzzle: prove that if there is at least one leftie and at least one rightie, then deadlock is not possible. Hint: deadlock can only occur when all 5 philosophers are holding one fork and waiting, forever, for the other. Otherwise, one of them could get both forks, eat, and leave. The proof works by contradiction. First, assume that deadlock is possible. Then choose one of the supposedly deadlocked philosophers. If sheâs a leftie, you can prove that the philosophers are all lefties, which is a contradiction. Similarly, if sheâs a rightie, you can prove that they are all righties. Either way you get a contradiction; therefore, deadlock is not possible."

The center and right panels of Robert Campinâs Merode Triptych of c1425B28 contain the earliest evidence we have found to date of the use of direct optical projections. A detail of the right panel is shown at the lower left of . Fig. 11.13 . As we previously showed, this portion of the painting exhibits the same complex changes in perspective seen in Lorenzo Lottoâs Husband and Wife, resulting from Campin also having refocused his lens twice [4, 6]. The upper right in . Fig. 11.13 shows one of the two sets of slats (the set that is numbered on the lower inset), with each slat individually rotated to be vertical and expanded horizontally by a factor of 3.5 to accentuate any deviations from being straight. Marked on the slats are the locations of âkinksâ exhibited by each of them, with those kinks connected by lines. The positions of the lines connecting the kinks are shown on the inset at the lower left. Comparing with . Fig. 11.2 of Reference 5 it can be seen that the slats are kinked at the same two depths into the painting where we previously showed, with a different type of analysis using different data, that Campin had to refocus due to the DOF of his lens. Geometrical constructions can be devised which exhibit kinks, but not in the overall conï¬guration of this painting. The complex perspective exhibited by the latticework in this portion of the painting is a direct and inevitable outcome from the DOF of a lens, but would be extremely unlikely to have resulted from any geometrical construction, or from the use of a straightedge. Using the height of the head in the full painting as a scale, the magniï¬cation of this portion of the painting is M  0.27. If we assume a circle of confusion of 1 mm Eq. (11.7) yields f# Â¼ 25.2.

Clockwise rotation of motile cilia creates unidirectional leftward flow because the rotational axes of cilia tilt caudal direction of the embryos [6, 7]. There are two models why nodal flow is perceived by nodal and perinodal cells. One hypothesis (chemosensory model) is that the nodal flow produces a gradient of left determinant particles (node vesicular parcels) containing hedgehog proteins and nodal [8, 9], which activate downstream signaling of nodal in the left-side perinodal cells. Alternative hypothesis (mechanosensory model) is that the leftward nodal flow provokes an asymmetrical increase influx of Ca2Ã¾ ion in the sensory cilia cells through PKD2, a causative gene for human polycystic kidney disease [9, 10].

On admission he was described as thin and undersized, with exaggerated right knee jerks and marked elbow jerks.64 A letter from his brother gave a detailed account of Williamâs condition over the preceding three years, describing how his â¦ neuralgia in the muscles of the back [caused him to] suffer something dreadful. He would lie a handkerchief round his head when the pain went in, he used to cry and say he made no wonder that people went out of there [sic] mind if they suffered as he did. â¦ Last Saturday he woke up saying he had plenty of money, went to his work giving [his workmates] rows of houses each. They took him home and he went clean off.65"

If Ë D 1, Eq. (14.6) corresponds to Eq. (14.4). If Ë D 2, Eq. (14.6) corresponds to Eq. (14.5). The green curves in Fig. 14.5 show distributions of Eq. (14.6). We selected the parameters Ë D 1:6;  D 0:9 for BS D 0:5 and Ë D 1:2;  D 0:9 for BS D 10. The shape of the distributions of the logarithmic differences of two values is concerned with the correlation between those two values. The left side of Fig. 14.6 shows a scatter plot of ln S.x; y/ versus ln S.x C BS; y/ or ln S.x; y C BS/. From this figure, we observe agglomeration effect that many people live near places where many other people also live. The correlation coefficient is able to interpret as an index of agglomeration effect. The right side figureâsp data are transformed from the left side figureâs data by dilating both axis data 2 and rotating clockwise 45Ä± . The horizontal axis of the right side figure is the logarithmic summation between the nearest neighbor populations. The vertical axis of the right side figure is the logarithmic difference between the nearest neighbor populations. The red bars are the standard deviation inside each segment, which is equally divided by the horizontal axis. The correlation of the left side figure represents the correlation between the population and the nearest neighbor population. If this correlation is strong, the population near the large population is large. It is considered that the strengthen of this correlation is one of the indices which represents degree of the agglomeration of population. The deviation of the distribution of the vertical axis of"

339,265,0.337,Etiology and Morphogenesis of Congenital Heart Disease : From Gene Function and Cellular interaction To Morphology,"The transcription factor Tbx5 is implicated in full ventricular septation in mammals and is expressed strongly in the left part of the cardiac tube, with expression declining towards the right side [9]; we confirmed this expression pattern also in early stages of the copperhead rat snake, Coelognathus. Slightly later in the development, we show that embryonic turtle and python show expression of Tbx5 that declines at the folding septum, but not over the dorsal wall, where a sharp decline was found only near the outflow tract. In the chicken the Tbx5 mRNA gradient identifies the right ventricle (weak expression) from the outflow tract (negative expression). Furthermore, a Tbx5 decline is found at the folding septum showing only strong left-sided expression, whereas Tbx5 expression is present on both sides of the inlet septum including the septal band. Thus, in the chicken the folding and inlet septa are differentially identified by Tbx5 gradients. In the mouse two Tbx5 gradients identify the inlet and folding septum. Protein expression is strongest in the trabeculations of the left ventricle, weaker in the right ventricular inlet including septal band and weakest to negative in the right ventricular outflow."
