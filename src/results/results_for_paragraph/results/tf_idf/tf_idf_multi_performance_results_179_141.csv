During all seasons, juvenile and adult green and Kempâs ridley sea turtles used eastern Gulf waters extensively. Low numbers of hawksbills also used the eastern Gulf of Mexico, while leatherbacks were found in the eastern Gulf during the spring and fall as they migrated through to preferred feeding and nesting grounds (Teas 1993). The western Gulf of Mexico provided year-round habitat for juvenile loggerheads and for hatchlings to adult Kempâs ridleys. Throughout the year, juvenile green turtles used western Gulf of Mexico waters (Teas 1993). During the summer and fall when prevailing currents carried them into the western Gulf, hawksbills ranging from hatchling to juvenile were common. Leatherback sea turtles migrated through the western Gulf during the spring and fall (Teas 1993). Surveys were conducted in 1991 and 1992 to establish relative sea turtle abundance and seasonality in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Braun-McNeill and Epperly 2002). The study was based on surveying fishermen along the Gulf coast from Louisiana to southern Florida year-round regarding the sighting of sea turtles. The surveys indicated that sea turtle abundance along the Gulf coast was seasonal, with turtles migrating northward in the warmer months and then migrating south in the colder months. This seasonality was in agreement with historical information obtained from turtle fisheries in the Gulf States (Stevenson 1893; Carr and Caldwell 1956). The study also demonstrated that the number of turtle sightings was significantly higher in the Florida Keys than in any other location and that, throughout the study area, most turtles tended to be located within 506 km (314 mi) from the coast (Braun-McNeill and Epperly 2002). An analysis of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) aerial survey data for September, October, and November of 1992, 1993, and 1994 was conducted to determine sea turtle spatial dynamics for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (McDaniel 1998). The results of the study indicated that sea turtles were observed at much higher rates along the Florida Gulf coast than in the western Gulf, and the highest density of observed sea turtles occurred in the Florida Keys region (0.525 turtles per square kilometer [km2] or 0.203 turtles per square mile [mi2]) (McDaniel et al. 2000). These results are similar to those obtained by Fritts et al. (1983a) discussed above. Various hypotheses were proposed to explain the higher numbers of sea turtles observed in the eastern Gulf as compared to the western Gulf of Mexico; these included the following: more suitable sea turtle habitat in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the reduction of turtles by the intense shrimp fishery in the western Gulf of Mexico, low oxygen levels off the Louisiana coast, sea turtles being attracted to shrimp vessel bycatch, and more turtles inhabiting nearshore areas compared to areas offshore (McDaniel 1998). In the same study conducted by McDaniel et al. (2000), sea turtle abundance decreased significantly west from Florida toward the north-central Gulf of Mexico and increased 20-fold in south Texas as compared to other areas surveyed in the western Gulf, ranging from no turtles up to 0.10 turtles/km2 (0.04 turtles/mi2) (McDaniel et al. 2000). This is consistent with an earlier week-long aerial survey conducted in the fall of 1979 in the same south Texas area that reported a mean sea turtle density of 0.0196 turtle/km2 (0.0076 turtles/mi2) (Reeves and Leatherwood 1983). Interestingly, a small peak around the Chandeleur Islands in Louisiana was observed (McDaniel et al. 2000); this peak around the Chandeleur Islands is important because Louisiana waters are known foraging grounds for post-nesting Kempâs ridleys (ChaÌvez 1968; Pritchard and MaÌrquez-M. 1973; Ogren 1989). In aerial surveys conducted along the U.S. Gulf Coast from September through November during 1992 through 1996, Kempâs ridleys were sighted primarily in inshore waters and most commonly occurred in the eastern Gulf of Mexico (Epperly et al. 2002). During the same surveys, loggerhead sea turtles were sighted throughout the Gulf but had a very low occurrence in offshore waters of the western Gulf. Green turtles occurred offshore and primarily were"

Despite the data gaps and limitations associated with specific datasets, the current conditions of the five species of sea turtles that occur in the Gulf of Mexico have been described qualitatively, and sometimes quantitatively. Kempâs Ridley Sea Turtles. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Kempâs ridley sea turtle has made a remarkable recovery from the brink of extinction (Heppell et al. 2007; Crowder and Heppell 2011), although the current nesting populations remain far below historical levels. The increased abundance and nesting of Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years is most likely a result of many activities that affect all Kempâs ridley life stagesâconservation and education efforts in both Mexico and the United States, the Kempâs Ridley Recovery Program, the Kempâs Ridley Head Start Experiment, the elimination of direct harvest of eggs and adult turtles, nest and hatchling protection, TED use, shrimp fishery closures, and the reduced Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawling effort in both the United States and Mexico (Shaver and Wibbels 2007; NMFS et al. 2011; Crowder and Heppell 2011). Despite the partial success story, there are threats to Kempâs ridleys in the Gulf that could cause significant impacts to the population and affect its continued recovery, particularly the incidental bycatch. The future of Kempâs ridleys is optimistically bright, and nesting numbers at Rancho Nuevo and PAIS continue to increase; however, because of their mass nesting at a single site in the western Gulf and their restricted Gulf of Mexico distribution, a significant event or the synergistic effects of multiple threats in the Gulf could have catastrophic effects on the recovering Kempâs ridley population. Loggerhead Sea Turtles. The life history, distribution, and abundance of the loggerhead sea turtle is probably better understood than all other sea turtle species that inhabit the Gulf of Mexico (Bolten and Witherington 2003; USFWS and NMFS 2011). While the loggerhead is distributed globally, the goal of this chapter was to describe contemporary conditions of Gulf sea turtles; information for populations that occur in the Gulf of Mexico during some portion of their life cycle was the focus. These populations included the Peninsular Florida, northern Gulf of Mexico, Dry Tortugas, and Greater Caribbean subpopulations of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (USFWS and NMFS 2011). The annual nest counts from 2001 through 2009 on Florida Gulf coast and Atlantic beaches showed a decreasing trend, but in 2010 and 2011, loggerhead nest counts on surveyed Florida beaches were back to numbers similar to those recorded in 2000, indicating that the population of nesting females may have stabilized. Given the lack of a long historical record, it is not known whether these types of fluctuations are common or if the recent temporary decrease observed was caused by an acute factor. A recent analysis of annual loggerhead nest counts for the northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation indicated a significant declining trend; however, a longer time series of nesting data is needed for an adequate evaluation (NMFS and USFWS 2008). More years of data are also needed in order to detect a trend in loggerhead nest counts for the Dry Tortugas subpopulation. Nesting for the Greater Caribbean subpopulation appears to be stable; however, a trend analysis is challenging because standardized surveys are few, survey efforts have changed, and low-level nesting occurs in many locations (NMFS and USFWS 2008). High cumulative anthropogenic threat levels were estimated for oceanic and neritic juveniles and adults of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS during the most recent loggerhead status review (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011). The loggerhead mortalities associated with these high threat levels resulted primarily from fisheries bycatch. Significant loggerhead mortality occurred in longline fisheries, bottom and mid-water trawl fisheries, dredge fisheries, gillnet fisheries, and pot/trap fisheries that occur not only in U.S. waters (Conant et al. 2009; Bolten et al. 2011; Ponwith 2011), but also in the Azores, the Mediterranean, on the Grand Banks, in Canadian waters, and in other locations throughout the range of the northwest Atlantic Ocean"

34,683,0.467,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Until 1890, the sea turtle fisheries in Florida occurred in eight counties, but by 1897 they were concentrated in four: Monroe, Levy, Franklin, and Escambia counties on the Gulf coast. The total production in 1897 alone was 287,857 kg (634,616 lb), with 86 % coming from Monroe County at the southern tip of Florida (Townsend 1899). However, an unspecified portion of the total production came from the YucataÌn coast because turtles were already becoming scarce in Florida; by 1897, most of the turtles came from the YucataÌn coast. Apparently, the decrease in the sea turtle populations along the Florida Gulf coast was due not only to the harvest of juveniles but also of eggs, as these were sought after eagerly by local people (Townsend 1899). Indeed, although few records of egg exploitation exist, it is believed that a large number of eggs were collected throughout the entire rim of the Gulf of Mexico (Hildebrand 1963; Witzell 1994). Turtles were so scarce by the late 1800s that Townsend (1899) called for the protection of the turtles and their eggs during their breeding season. The sea turtle fisheries continued through the early and mid-1900s on the Florida Gulf coast, though at a much lower rate (Figure 11.4), presumably due to decreases in the turtle populations (Rebel 1974). The landings records for Florida indicate a preference for green turtle meat (Figure 11.4). In the 1900s, imports of live turtles into the United States were significant prior to the 1978 listing of sea turtles under the 1973 U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The total live sea turtle imports into the United States from 1948 through 1976 amounted to 8,099,950 kg (17,857,334 lb), with a peak in 1951 and a decreasing trend to a minimum of 1,814 kg (4,000 lb) in 1975 (Figure 11.5) (Cato et al. 1978). The imported species of sea turtles included the green, olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), loggerhead, and hawksbill, with the former two species being the most imported (Cato et al. 1978). These imports came from over 40 countries and demonstrate the demand for live sea turtles that existed in the United States until the"

The stranding of sea turtles is caused by many factors, including incidental capture in shrimping and fishing operations, entanglement, ingestion of marine debris, boat strikes, disease, storms, and hypothermic stunning. The STSSN was established in 1980 to collect information on and document strandings of live and dead sea turtles along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. The area includes the coasts from Maine through Texas, as well as portions of the U.S. Caribbean (STSSN 2012).

34,827,0.431,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed, often leading to the destruction of hawksbill nesting habitat (Mortimer and Donnelly 2008). For example, critical hawksbill habitats are quickly being impacted by the development along the Gulf coast of the YucataÌn Peninsula (GardunÌo-Andrade et al. 1999). Beachfront development and the clearing of dune vegetation significantly affect hawksbill sea turtles because they prefer to nest under vegetation (Mortimer and Donnelly 2008). Global climate change may affect sea turtle nesting beaches in several ways, including sea level rise, higher ambient temperatures, and changes in hurricane/cyclone activity (Hawkes et al. 2009; Witt et al. 2010). Higher water levels associated with sea level rise will gradually and directly decrease the availability of suitable nesting sites (Witt et al. 2010). Increasing temperatures may open up areas that were previously unavailable for nesting (Witt et al. 2010), but recent studies have suggested that up to half of the currently available sea turtle nesting areas could be lost with predicted sea level rise (Fish et al. 2008). Sea turtle nesting is significantly affected by temperature, and incubation temperatures can affect incubation success, duration, and the sex of hatchlings (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980; Witt et al. 2010; Valverde et al. 2010). Therefore, increasing temperatures have the potential to change current nest incubation regimes, as well as to skew sex ratios (Hawkes et al. 2007a). Changes in the global climate are predicted to increase the frequency and intensity of hurricanes (Webster et al. 2005), which can significantly affect the reproductive success of sea turtles. On Gulf of Mexico beaches, predation of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings can be significant. Known predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings include raccoons, ghost crabs, coyotes, foxes, armadillos, domestic dogs and cats, feral pigs, skunks, bobcats, badgers, gulls, fish crows, and larval insects (Witherington et al. 2006a; NMFS et al. 2011). Invasive fire ants are also significant predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings on Gulf coast nesting beaches (Witherington et al. 2006a; NMFS et al. 2011). Invasive plant species are known to invade and desiccate eggs, trap hatchlings, interfere with nest construction, and lower nest incubation temperatures because of shading (Conant et al. 2009). For example, the invasive Australian pine has caused shading of beaches, lowered sea turtle nest incubation temperatures, limited accessibility to suitable nest sites, entrapped nesting turtles, interfered with nest construction, and caused sea turtle nesting activity to decline on a remote nesting beach in Everglades National Park along the Florida Gulf coast (Davis and Whiting 1977; Schmeltz and Mezich 1988; Reardon and Mansfield 1997; Hanson et al. 1998). The hurricane season for the Gulf overlaps closely with the sea turtle nesting season (Magnuson et al. 1990). While sea turtles have evolved to deal with erosion, flooding, storm surges, and other disturbances caused by hurricanes and other severe storms by laying large numbers of eggs and distributing their nests spatially and temporally, hurricanes can affect the reproductive success of sea turtles, since they rely on specific beaches for reproduction (Carr and Carr 1972). In addition, the effects of hurricanes vary by species (Pike and Stiner 2007). For example, in the southeastern United States, leatherback turtles nest the earliest, and most hatchlings emerge before the hurricane season starts, while loggerhead turtles nest intermediately, and only nests laid late in the season would be at risk. However, green turtles nest the latest, and their entire nesting season occurs during the hurricane season; therefore, their developing eggs and nests are extremely vulnerable to hurricanes (Pike and Stiner 2007). In 1989, the effects of Hurricane Gilbert were documented on the Kempâs ridley nesting beach in Mexico. When debris was deposited, the beach was eroded, and coral rock was exposed along the central portion of Rancho Nuevo. About 20 % of the Kempâs ridley nesting activity was displaced to the north that year (MaÌrquez-M. 1990). Hurricane Andrew, a Category 4 hurricane that hit south Florida on August 24, 1992, provided an opportunity to quantify the impacts of a major hurricane on six beaches where"

Japan was historically the major importer of tortoiseshell or bekko from the Caribbean (NMFS and USFWS 1993). They agreed to stop importing bekko in 1993 (USFWS 2012). Although the volume of international trade has declined significantly in the past 20 years, it remains active, especially in Southeast Asia and the Americas (Mortimer 2008). In Southeast Asia, the extensive practice of selling whole, stuffed hawksbills is a relatively new threat (Mortimer 2008). Hawksbills are the most tropical of the sea turtle species and typically nest at low densities throughout their range (NMFS and USFWS 1993, 2007e). In the past, hawksbill sea turtles were considered to be naturally rare and to have a more dispersed nesting pattern than the other sea turtle species (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). However, the dispersed pattern currently observed is now believed to be the result of overexploitation of previously large colonies (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Hawksbill sea turtles are often associated with coral reefs (Meylan 1988; Meylan and Redlow 2006). There are many gaps in the understanding of hawksbill sea turtle biology, and the oceanic phase of the post-hatchlings remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of hawksbill life history (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Because of an almost total lack of long-term trend data at hawksbill foraging sites, nesting beach data are the primary information source used to evaluate trends in hawksbill populations. Few data are available on the at-sea mortality of hawksbills in fisheries (NMFS and USFWS 2007e)."

Low numbers of leatherback nesting also occur along the southeast Atlantic coast of the United States, from central Florida through North Carolina (Figure 11.35). In the Gulf of Mexico, leatherback sea turtles nest at low levels along the Florida, Alabama, and Mexican coasts (Figure 11.35). Leatherback nesting was reported as early as 1962 on a beach near Destin along the Florida Gulf coast (Yerger 1965). As indicated by reports from local residents, leatherbacks may have nested on Texas beaches in the 1920s and 1930s (Hildebrand 1963). One leatherback nest was recorded at PAIS in 2008 (NPS 2013d). Leatherback sea turtles that forage in and travel through the Gulf of Mexico originate from many different nesting beaches. For example, leatherbacks that were tagged while nesting on the Florida east coast and St. Croix were later recaptured along the Mexican Gulf coast (Eckert et al. 2012). In addition, leatherbacks that nest on Gulf of Mexico beaches migrate to and forage in waters outside the Gulf, and many satellite tracking studies have shown that leatherback sea turtles that nest in the western Atlantic migrate to Western Europe and West Africa (Eckert et al. 2012). Therefore, using data from nesting beaches of leatherbacks known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico to evaluate the population of leatherback sea turtles that use the Gulf is extremely challenging. However, to determine trends in leatherback nesting in the general western Atlantic Ocean area, data from two important nesting beaches in the area with longterm monitoring were evaluated: the Florida east coast and Tortuguero, Costa Rica. In addition, recent investigations have suggested that the Gulf of Mexico may be a significant year-round foraging ground for leatherbacks that nest along the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, as well as Panama (Evans et al. 2007; Fossette et al. 2010)."

34,826,0.364,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, beaches are cleaned by mechanical raking, scraping with large machinery, hand raking, and picking up debris by hand. These activities can directly and indirectly affect sea turtles (NMFS et al. 2011). Driving is permitted on many Gulf of Mexico beaches. Nesting sea turtles have been run over and killed by vehicles, and vehicles have crushed emerging hatchlings (NMFS et al. 2011). Because the Kempâs ridley has only one primary nesting beach in Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and a secondary nesting colony at PAIS in Texas, it is particularly susceptible to beach disturbance, alteration, and destruction by natural and anthropogenic events. Beach cleaning has been documented to affect Kempâs ridleys. For example, 12 Kempâs ridley hatchlings became trapped by a sand ridge created by heavy equipment cleaning the beach on North Padre Island, Texas in 2002 and were later crushed and killed by passing vehicles (Shaver 2004). The presence of artificial lighting on or near the beach adversely affects both nesting and hatchling sea turtles (Witherington and Martin 1996). Mortality from misdirection by artificial lighting on both the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of Florida kills thousands of loggerhead hatchlings each year (Witherington 1997). The proportion of all emerging loggerhead hatchlings that died because of beach lighting was estimated in the early 1990s to be as high as 5â10 % (Witherington et al. 1996). Loggerheads abort nesting attempts at a greater frequency in lighted areas. Artificial lighting also deters females from emerging from the ocean to nest (Witherington 1986, 1992). Hatchling orientation of nests located at 23 representative beaches in six Florida counties was surveyed in 1993 and 1994, and approximately 10â30 % of nests showed evidence of hatchling disorientation by lighting (Witherington et al. 1996). Similar to other nocturnal nesting sea turtles, nesting leatherbacks and hatchlings can be disoriented by artificial lighting on the beach (NMFS 2011b). A significant negative relationship was found between sea turtle nesting density and distance from the nearest of 17 ocean inlets (Witherington et al. 2005). Beach instability from both erosion and sand accretion may discourage sea turtle nesting, since the effect of inlets in lowering nesting density was found both updrift and downdrift of the inlets. When sea turtles emerged to nest in the presence of armoring structures, more returned to the water without nesting compared to turtles that emerged on nonarmored beaches (Mosier 1998; Mosier and Witherington 2002). Fewer sea turtles made nesting attempts on beaches fronted by seawalls than on adjacent beaches where armoring structures were absent (Mosier 1998). In addition, sea turtles on armored sections of beach had a tendency to wander great distances as compared to turtles that emerged to nest on adjacent natural beaches (Mosier 1998). Since oil exploration and production occurs south of Tamaulipas and Veracruz in Mexico and at PAIS in Texas, the Kempâs ridley nesting beaches, as well as the nesting turtles, eggs, and hatchlings, could be impacted by oil spills and related activities (NMFS et al. 2011). For example, in 1979, the Ixtoc I oil well blew out and caused a fire in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico. The nesting beach at Rancho Nuevo was affected by the Ixtoc I well blowout, and large amounts of oil were released daily into the Gulf of Mexico for several months. However, the oil reached the beach after the nesting season, and nesting females were not present. Also, a loaded supertanker, the Mega Borg, exploded near Galveston, Texas in 1990, causing more than 121,000 barrels of crude oil to be released into the Gulf of Mexico; sea turtles covered in oil were found after this spill (Yender and Mearns 2003). Oil spills have affected loggerhead nesting beaches in the Gulf of Mexico. In August 1993, approximately 350,000 gal of fuel oil spilled into Tampa Bay and washed onto nesting beaches in Pinellas County, Florida (Conant et al. 2009). Impacts to loggerheads resulting from the spill included 31 dead hatchlings, 176 oil-covered nests, and 2,177 eggs and hatchlings exposed to oil or disturbed by response activities (FDEP et al. 1997)."
34,720,0.36,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","variability in growth rates, there is a range in the time estimated for a hatchling to grow to a size of about 20 centimeters (cm) (7.9 in) straight carapace length (SCL), the size at which Kempâs ridleys typically transition to the next stageâthe neritic juvenile stage (Table 11.1). Juvenile Kempâs ridleys in the oceanic zone feed mostly on pelagic invertebrate prey associated with the Sargassum community (Table 11.1). No post-hatchling Kempâs ridleys were collected from the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast from 2005 through 2011 as part of a study to determine the importance of the pelagic Sargassum-dominated drift community to young sea turtles (Witherington et al. 2012). Hatchlings are typically around 4 cm (1.6 in) SCL in size (Table 11.1); the smallest Kempâs ridley collected by Witherington et al. (2012) was 17 cm (6.7 in) SCL. Witherington et al. (2012) sampled only in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from May through September, and post-hatchling Kempâs ridley would most likely occur in the western Gulf of Mexico off the principal nesting beaches. Thirty-eight juvenile Kempâs ridleys, ranging in size from 17 to 28 cm (6.7 to 11 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico from 2005 through 2011 (Witherington et al. 2012). These turtles were estimated to be between 1 and 2 years old. Because they were similar in size to the lower size range observed in nearby neritic habitats (Schmid 1998; Witzell and Schmid 2004) and because most of these turtles were not found within currents that would transport them out of the Gulf, they were hypothesized to be on the cusp of recruiting into coastal habitats of the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico. Similar to what was proposed by Collard and Ogren (1990), these data suggest that an important recruitment pulse occurs primarily in the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico, marking the end of the oceanic juvenile stage and the beginning of the neritic juvenile stage and suggests that the open waters of the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico are of unique importance to Kempâs ridley sea turtles (Witherington et al. 2012)."
34,804,0.357,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","Similar to other species of sea turtles, hatchling hawksbills enter an oceanic phase (Figure 11.44). This phase may involve long-distance travel carried by surface gyres, with eventual recruitment to neritic foraging habitat (NMFS and USFWS 2007e). Hatchlings entrained in the Loop Current could be expected to remain in the Gulf of Mexico for differing periods of time, depending on which branch of the Loop Current they enter (Meylan and Redlow 2006). Both newly hatched and early juvenile hawksbills have been found in association with Sargassum and floating weed in the Atlantic and Caribbean (Table 11.5) (Carr 1987; Mellgren and Mann 1996; Musick and Limpus 1997; Meylan and Redlow 2006). No post-hatchlings but six juvenile hawksbill sea turtles, with an average size of 20.6 cm (8.1 in) SCL, were captured from the Sargassum-dominated, surface-pelagic drift community in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean from 2005 through 2011; some of these hawksbills were large enough to be on the cusp of recruitment into the neritic zone, most likely to foraging habitat in the Florida Keys (Witherington et al. 2012). Weedlines in the Gulf of Mexico likely serve as habitat for posthatchling hawksbills from nesting beaches in Mexico and Central America (NMFS and USFWS 1993). Between 1972 and 1984, 77 strandings of post-hatchling and juvenile hawksbills were recorded in Texas, with most occurring near Corpus Christi; these turtles most likely originated from nesting beaches on the YucataÌn Peninsula in Mexico (Amos 1989; Bowen et al. 2007). Limited tagging data indicates that some post-hatchling hawksbills from the western Gulf of Mexico disperse into the Atlantic Ocean, most likely through the Florida Straits, and move northward along Floridaâs east coast (Meylan and Redlow 2006)."

The Fulton cannery was the largest and operated between 1881 and 1896; in 1890, this cannery alone processed 900 green turtles (41.7 % of the turtle catch in the state) totaling 110,223 kg (243,000 lb) and produced about 40,000 0.9-kg (2-lb) cans (Doughty 1984). The green turtle cannery located in Rockport was founded around 1886. During its first 6 months of operation, the cannery processed about 3,856 kg (8,500 lb) of green turtle meat (True 1887). Green turtles caught and processed in Texas were presumed to feed in the seagrass beds located between Matagorda Bay and Laguna Madre (Hildebrand 1982). Rapid depletion of green turtle populations in Texas and elsewhere occurred because the fishery targeted juvenile turtles, a highly vulnerable stage in the life cycle of this slow-growing, late-maturing species (Crouse et al. 1987; Witzell 1994). While the green turtle fishery in Texas developed very quickly, it declined abruptly after 1892 and ended shortly thereafter, presumably due to the scarcity of turtles and to a deep freeze along the Texas coast (Hildebrand 1982). A small turtle fishery in Louisiana remained open through the early 1970s (Figure 11.2). Prior to 1860, green turtles caught on the Florida east coast, particularly in the Indian River Lagoon, were exchanged for goods with various merchant vessels; in later years, agents purchased the catch and then shipped it mainly to New York (True 1887). By 1887, green, loggerhead, and hawksbill turtles were hunted as far north as Beaufort and Morehead City, North Carolina, where green turtles in particular were a delicacy and consumed locally (True 1887). There was no mention of Kempâs ridley sea turtles being harvested in the early records, even though this species surely was present in Florida at the time (Carr 1957). The omission appears to have occurred because Kempâs ridleys were sold as loggerheads for years (Rebel 1974; Cato et al. 1978). Two locations on Floridaâs west coastâKey West and Homosassaâappear to have supported the most abundant in-water populations of green turtles in the entire Gulf of Mexico in the late 1800s. Captured turtles weighing between 18 and 45 kg (40 and 100 lb) were kept alive in small Kraals (Dutch for corral) or seawater-filled holding pens until ready to be shipped to New York (True 1887). Estimates indicate that about 50 18-kg (40-pound) turtles per week were brought to Key West throughout the year (True 1887). The green turtle fishery in the Cedar Keys area presumably arose around 1878. Fishing was concentrated in an area 32â48 kilometers (km) (20â30 miles [mi]) north and south from the main Cedar Keys port, with the shallow foraging grounds being the most productive (True 1887). Large boats brought between 1,361 and 2,268 kg (3,000 and 5,000 lb) of green turtles to port; whereas, small boats brought in only 23â363 kg (50â800 lb). Interestingly, the largest green turtle recorded at the time weighed an impressive 544 kg (1,200 lb) (True 1887). The reported weight of this turtle was questioned by Carr and Caldwell (1956), who indicated that green turtles landed in the Cedar Keys fisheries in the 1950s were no larger than 52 kg (115 lb). Alternatively, it is possible that the discrepancy reflects the impact of the decades-long turtle fishery in the region, leaving no large adult turtles in the population. Overall, statistics show that the Florida west coast produced about 81,647 kg (180,000 lb), Louisiana about 13,608 kg (30,000 lb), and Texas approximately 24,494 kg (54,000 lb) of green turtle meat in 1880, though apparently an unspecified amount of freshwater turtle meat was also included in these records (True 1887; Rebel 1974). No mention is made of significant sea turtle fisheries for any other Gulf coast state prior to 1880 besides Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. By 1887, the most important sea turtle fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico were those of the Cedar Keys area and around Key West (True 1887; Townsend 1899). Figure 11.3 shows statistics of turtle landings on the Florida Gulf coast between 1880 and 1897 for the years for which data are available (Townsend 1899), and provides a perspective of turtle demand in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico."
34,794,0.347,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","shelf and in pelagic waters, and nonrandom, long-distance migrations between foraging and nesting grounds are typical (Eckert et al. 2012). In the Gulf of Mexico, information regarding the distribution and abundance of leatherback sea turtles, which is summarized in the following paragraphs, is incomplete. However, adult leatherback distribution in the Gulf of Mexicoâwhether in deep-sea, pelagic waters, along the continental shelf, or in nearshore watersâhas historically been associated with dense concentrations of jellyfish (Leary 1957; Fritts et al. 1983a, b; den Hartog and van Nierop 1984; Lohoefener et al. 1989; Eckert et al. 1989a, 2012; Houghton et al. 2006). In the 1950s, Florida fishermen reported occasional sightings of leatherbacks off the coast of Sarasota and claimed they had been seen occasionally in the area since at least the 1930s (Yerger 1965). A leatherback carcass was found in Copano Bay, Texas in 1951 (Gunter 1951). In 1956, 100 leatherbacks were reported only 75 yards from the beach in Port Aransas, Texas. This group of leatherbacks appeared to be associated with a large abundance of jellyfish in the area (Leary 1957). Multiple sightings and captures of leatherbacks occurred along the Florida Gulf coast during the early 1960s (Yerger 1965). In fact, leatherbacks were once reported to be seasonally abundant off the coast of Panama City, Florida (Pritchard 1976). In 1975, leatherbacks were observed off the coast of Alabama (Mount 1975). In 1979, aerial surveys of the Texas and Florida Gulf coasts reported more than 97 % of all turtle sightings to be in Florida, four of which were leatherbacks (Fritts and Reynolds 1981). Aerial surveys conducted in the Gulf of Mexico from May 1980 to April 1981 reported a total of 47 leatherbacks across all areas (except off the coast of south Texas), and found leatherbacks to be most common off the coast of Florida (Fritts et al. 1983a, b). During the survey, leatherbacks were more conspicuous on the continental shelf than in adjacent deeper waters (Fritts et al. 1983a, b). Between 1988 and 1990, NMFS aerial surveys in the Gulf of Mexico reported infrequent sightings of leatherbacks, with most sightings occurring in July through November 1989 (Lohoefener et al. 1990). A survey of sea turtles in southeastern Louisiana in 1988 reported that the only evidence of leatherbacks in the area was one report from a diver in July 1988 (Fuller 1989). During the summer of 1989, six leatherback sightings were reported in south Louisiana, five of which were by divers most likely diving offshore at oil platforms (Fuller 1989). During a 1989 cruise in the Gulf of Mexico by the University of West Florida to the head of De Soto Canyon to collect neuston and Sargassum, eight leatherbacks were sighted near a coastal-subtropical water mass boundary region that contained high densities of jellyfish (Collard 1990). Beginning in 1992, the U.S. Geological Survey performed a 3-year aerial and ship survey of the entire northern Gulf of Mexico. The study estimated an overall abundance of 168 leatherbacks in the continental slope area and also estimated leatherbacks to be 12 times more abundant in the winter than in the summer (Davis et al. 2000). Aerial surveys by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center during the fall of 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1996 sighted a total of three leatherbacks in the western Gulf of Mexico and eight in the eastern Gulf; only two of the turtles sighted were in water less than approximately 18 m (59 ft) deep (Epperly et al. 2002). In CMR studies, the low recapture rate of leatherbacks, compared to other species of sea turtles, is likely due to their highly pelagic lifestyle and uncommon occurrence in coastal waters. However, captures and tag returns of leatherbacks have indicated that adult females use the Gulf of Mexico as a foraging ground. From 1970 to 1973, researchers in Suriname and French Guiana tagged more than 2,000 nesting female leatherbacks. Two of the turtles that were tagged on French Guiana beaches in 1970 and 1972, respectively, were recaptured in western Gulf of Mexico waters in 1973 (Pritchard 1976). Also, a nesting female tagged on the Costa Rican coast in 1985 was captured a year later by a shrimp fisherman off the Mississippi"
34,724,0.344,"Habitats and Biota of the Gulf of Mexico: Before the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill: Volume 2: Fish Resources, Fisheries, Sea Turtles, Avian Resources, Marine Mammals, Diseases and Mortalities","In a related satellite telemetry study, the inshore and continental shelf waters of the northwestern Gulf of Mexico were shown to serve as developmental and migratory habitat for the Kempâs ridley sea turtle (Seney and Landry 2011). Fifteen juveniles were fitted with transmitters and released off the upper Texas coast from 2004 through 2007. Their movements were restricted to the continental shelf from Matagorda Bay, Texas, east to waters offshore Timbalier Bay, Louisiana, and during most or all of the tracking period, the juveniles remained primarily in waters less than 5 m (16.4 ft) deep (Seney and Landry 2011). While movement patterns varied among years, the juvenile Kempâs ridleys were tracked primarily during the warmer months and preferred tidal passes, bays, coastal lakes, and nearshore waters. In addition, this investigation suggested that the preferred habitat of juvenile Kempâs ridleys may differ among years and could be related to the locations and abundances of specific prey items (Seney and Landry 2011). The movements of juvenile Kempâs ridleys in an understudied region of the Kempâs ridley rangeâthe north-central Gulf of Mexicoâwere studied by satellite tracking 12 turtles that were captured incidentally by recreational fishermen on piers or stranded live in Mississippi and Alabama, and rehabilitated and released (Lyn et al. 2012). Six turtles were released in Mississippi waters, 3.2 km (2 mi) south of East Ship Island, in November 2010, and six were released near documented feeding grounds off the Cedar Keys in Florida in April 2011. The turtles released in Mississippi migrated to warmer waters offshore (when the water temperatures decreased) and stayed in the general area of Mississippi Sound and adjacent Louisiana waters. However, within days of being released, most of the turtles released in Florida quickly began swimming up the coastline toward Alabama and Mississippi. One of the turtles released in Florida, a newly mature male, was tracked all the way to Rancho Nuevo, Mexico; it remained in this area for 2 weeks in March before returning north to waters along the Texas/Louisiana border. The results of this study indicated that releasing turtles near their hooking/stranding location is preferred over releasing them in known feeding grounds (Lyn et al. 2012). A number of in-water tagging studies have characterized sea turtle distribution, abundance, use, and ecology in nearshore waters along the Florida Gulf coast. Nearshore waters that have been studied include Apalachee Bay (Rudloe et al. 1991; Campbell 1996), Deadman Bay (Barichivich 2006), Cedar Keys/Waccasassa Bay (Schmid and Ogren 1990; Schmid 1998; Schmid et al. 2002, 2003), Tampa Bay (Nelson 2000), Charlotte Harbor Estuary (Schmid 2011), and Ten Thousand Islands/Gullivan Bay (Witzell and Schmid 2004, 2005). Details of these investigations are presented in the following paragraphs. However, information gaps still exist since the Florida Gulf coast is extensive, and long-term, in-water studies are needed to monitor the status of juvenile sea turtles at key foraging areas (Eaton et al. 2008). Rudloe et al. (1991) conducted a tagging study of post-oceanic juvenile Kempâs ridleys that were incidentally captured during shrimp trawling, gill netting, or fish seining in the coastal waters of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, including Apalachee, Levy, and Dickerson bays, from 1984 through 1988. A total of 106 turtles, ranging in size from 20.3 to 57.9 cm (8 to 22.8 in) SCL (mean 36.7 cm [14.4 in] SCL), were collected over a 97 km (60 mi) stretch of the Florida Gulf coast from Shell Point, Wakulla County to St. George Island, Franklin County. While turtles were collected every month, the highest numbers of turtles were collected during May and December. Turtles obtained during December, January, and February were significantly larger than those collected in June, July, August, and September (means of 40.4 cm [15.9 in] SCL and 30 cm [11.8 in] SCL, respectively). Kempâs ridleys were collected from seagrass, sand, and mud bottom substrates at depths ranging from 0.3 m (1 ft) inshore to 32 m (105 ft) 9.7 km (6 mi) offshore, with the smallest turtles collected from depths of less than 2 m (6.5 ft). Since turtles were only recaptured within a season, the results of the study indicated a transitory Kempâs ridley population along the northwest Florida Panhandle coast. In a netting study"

The females typically left the vicinity of the nesting beach within 24 h of nesting, and movements were usually highly directed. The post-nesting females took up residence in well-defined, relatively small (median size of 2,000 km2 [772 mi2]) areas on the continental shelf adjacent to Florida, Texas, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Cuba within a few weeks of departing from the nesting beaches (Foley et al. 2008). Sixty percent of the turtles (22 of 38) from both nesting assemblages took up residence off the Florida Gulf coast between the Dry Tortugas and Cape San Blas. The distribution of resident areas of female loggerheads from both nesting assemblages overlapped off the western coast of Florida, the western and northern coast of the YucataÌn Peninsula, and the northern coast of Cuba (Foley et al. 2008). Migrations of 28 post-nesting loggerheads from nesting beaches in Sarasota Countyâtheir most important Gulf of Mexico rookeryâwere tracked between May 2005 and December 2007 (Girard et al. 2009). Post-nesting migrations were completed in 3â68 days. Five different migration patterns were observed and included the following: six turtles remained in the vicinity of their nesting site; nine migrated to the southwestern part of the Florida Shelf; two migrated to the northeast Gulf of Mexico; five turtles migrated to the YucataÌn Shelf in the southern Gulf of Mexico, Campeche Bay, or Cuba; and six loggerheads migrated to the Bahamas. Loggerheads moved along rather straight routes over the continental shelf but showed more indirect paths in oceanic waters. Smaller turtles remained on the Florida Shelf, and larger individuals showed various migration strategies, staying on the Florida Shelf or moving to long-distance foraging grounds (Girard et al. 2009). Hart et al. (2012a) recently completed a study that identified shared regional at-sea foraging areas for female loggerheads, which was the first study to consolidate tracking data from three different nesting subpopulations in the Gulf. Ten females from nesting beaches of three subpopulations (St. Joseph Peninsula for northern Gulf of Mexico subpopulation, Casey Key for Peninsular Florida subpopulation, and DTNP for Dry Tortugas subpopulation) in the Gulf of Mexico were satellite tracked in 2008, 2009, and 2010. All turtles migrated to discrete foraging sites in two common areas located off southwest Florida and the northern YucataÌn Peninsula, located 102â904 km (63.4â561.7 mi) from the nesting beaches. Within 3â35 days, turtles migrated to the foraging sites, where they all displayed high site fidelity over time. The results of the study indicated that different nesting aggregations of loggerheads in the Gulf of Mexico use common at-sea foraging areas, and these important areas should be protected (Hart et al. 2012a). In a study of nearshore waters of Gullivan Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, that was conducted from 1997 through 2004, few loggerheads (15 turtles averaging 65.5 cm [25.8 in] SCL) were captured, possibly because they prefer deeper waters (Witzell and Schmid 2004, 2005). During surveys conducted at Key West National Wildlife Refuge (KWNWR) from 2002 through 2006, more than 470 loggerhead sea turtles were sighted, and 182 neritic juveniles and adults, ranging in size from 36.4 to 98.1 cm (14.3 to 38.6 in) SCL and averaging 75.5 cm (29.7 in) SCL, were captured, demonstrating the importance of this area as a foraging site for these size classes (Eaton et al. 2008). A long-term study of Florida Bay demonstrated that this area provided year-round resident foraging areas for large numbers of juvenile and male and female adult loggerhead sea turtles (Schroeder et al. 2003; Eaton et al. 2008; Conant et al. 2009). From 1990 through 2006, 902 loggerheads were captured; they ranged in size from 33 to 98.7 cm (13 to 38.9 in) SCL, averaging 77.7 cm (30.6 in) SCL. Multiple recaptures of juvenile and adult loggerheads over periods of up to 10 years indicated some strong site fidelity within Florida Bay. Genetic studies have demonstrated that more than 80 % of the adult loggerheads that forage in Florida Bay are from the Peninsular Florida subpopulation, while about 10 % are from the Quintana Roo, Mexico nesting population (Heppell et al. 2003)."

While extensive surveys in the northwest Atlantic Ocean have resulted in the sightings of thousands of loggerheads, green turtles are rarely observed (Witherington 2002; Bolten 2003; Witherington et al. 2012). A recent analysis of stable isotopes in green turtle scute tissue suggested that, before recruiting to neritic habitats, green turtles occupy similar habitats and feed at the same trophic level as oceanic-stage loggerheads for 3â5 years (Reich et al. 2007b). Fifteen post-hatchling green turtles, with an average size of 5.4 cm (2.1 in) SCL and 44 juveniles, with an average size of 20.6 cm (8.1 in) SCL, were observed and/or captured as part of a study to determine the importance of the pelagic Sargassum-dominated drift community to young sea turtles in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico from 2005 through 2011 (Witherington et al. 2012). In contrast to loggerheads, the post-hatchling green turtles were active within the Sargassum or swimming. There was a size gap of 9 cm (3.5 in) between the juvenile and post-hatchling green turtles. Juveniles were estimated to be 1â2 years old, indicating that two discrete life stages of green turtles were observed in the Sargassum community (Witherington et al. 2012)."

The Gulf of Mexico provides critical spawning grounds for many highly migratory fish and shark species of great ecological, commercial, and recreational importance. Only a small fraction (4.6 %) of finfish is endemic to the Gulf of Mexico, although some fish species of commercial and recreational importance can complete their entire life cycle within the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Almost half of finfish species in the Gulf of Mexico are omnipresent and can be found throughout the Gulf; the other half is limited to parts of the Gulf of Mexico."

A number of non-Passerine species (N Â¼ 93) occurred in all 12 sectors of the Gulf of Mexico (Table 12.4). Only the non-Passerines are listed because they are more typical of the species that inhabit the coastal and marine areas. The non-Passerines that are distributed throughout the Gulf include ducks, grebes, loons, boobies, pelicans, herons, egrets, ibises, spoonbills, storks, rails, shorebirds, gulls, terns, skimmers, and a kingfisher. As might be expected, shorebirds (N Â¼ 31 species), ducks (N Â¼ 10 species), herons and egrets (N Â¼ 10), and gulls and terns (N Â¼ 13) are the most diverse groups. Scientific names in Table 12.4 are not repeated in the text that follows this section. While the non-Passerines are normally considered the key avian component of the Gulf, Passerines are important because millions migrate around or over the Gulf each spring and fall, and others reside in the coastal environment (e.g., Seaside Sparrows, Moore 2000b). Although Gallardo et al. (2009) lists Passerine species found throughout the Gulf, their list is necessarily incomplete because the marsh, shrub, and forest habitats are continuous landward, and it is difficult to draw a suitable line for which species to include. Moreover, the distribution of Nearctic-Neotropical migrants along the southern Gulf of Mexico may be less well known than the distribution along the northern Gulf coast. Some raptors that prey on migrants may be"
