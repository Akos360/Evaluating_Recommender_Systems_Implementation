For instance, in winter, model results tend to be too wet in northern Europe, too warm in summer and winter, and too cold in spring and autumn (Jacob et al. 2007). On the one hand, RCMs generally overestimate the number of wet days; this âdrizzle effectâ is partly because RCMs simulate area averages rather than point values. While on the other, RCMs underestimate heavy precipitation events (e.g. Fowler et al. 2007b). Generally, bias is different in different part of the distribution (e.g. Jeong et al. 2011; Fig. 10.6). A major advantage of RCMs is the simulation of spatially coherent ï¬elds. In general, RCMs with a typical resolution of 25 km overestimate the spatial coherence of precipitation events, in particular for convective precipitation. It should be noted that RCMs provide meaningful information only on the scale of a few grid cells (e.g. Fowler and EkstrÃ¶m 2009). In particular, local precipitation is dominated by internal climate variability (Maraun 2012). As RCMs integrate the equations governing the atmospheric circulation, they in principle provide a coherent picture. However, biases in one variable may propagate into strong biases in dependant variables (e.g. Fig. 10.7); for example, Yang et al. (2010) have shown for Sweden that small temperature biases may, via the nonlinear interaction with precipitation around the melting point, lead to large biases in spring river run-off. Inconsistencies arise in particular where parameterisations come into play. For example, Graham et al. (2007b) have shown for the drainage areas"

Greater percolation to depth should increase ANPP by reducing the frequency or duration of periods during which soil water content remains below the lower stress threshold. Consistent with the soil water bucket model, it was found that delivering the same total of precipitation as fewer, but larger events increased ANPP by 30 % in semiarid shortgrass steppe, but decreased ANPP by 10â18 % in tallgrass prairie (Knapp et al. 2002; Heisler-White et al. 2009). Corollary 3 Precipitation regulates the response of productivity to CO2 but not to warming. The ANPP response to CO2 varies as a function of precipitation when considered across ecosystems. The ANPP-CO2 response peaks at âmoderateâ levels of annual precipitation (300â400 mm) across desert and grassland ecosystems (Fig. 7.5; Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b). Productivity responds relatively little to CO2 when precipitation is very low because water stress inhibits growth and may contribute to plant senescence and mortality if it becomes sufficiently severe. The benefits of elevated CO2 on productivity are reduced when annual precipitation is >400 mm partly because the efficient use of water use is no longer a critical variable (Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b). Therefore, the average across-ecosystem response of NPP to CO2 likely will be greatest in systems in which NPP is or will become moderately water limited (Nowak et al. 2004; Morgan et al. 2004b, 2011; Webb et al. 2012)."

Thus, the heterogeneous reactions involve the conversion of calcium carbonate to other calcium salts such as calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2), calcium sulphate (gypsum, CaSO4) or their ammonium salts ((NH4)NO3 and (NH4)HSO4 or (NH4)2SO4) as first demonstrated in laboratory experiments (Krueger et al. 2004) and then observed in recent field studies (Laskin et al. 2005; Matsuki et al. 2005, 2010b; Sullivan and Prather 2007; Shi et al. 2008; Huang et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2010). The reactivity of inorganic acids with dust is determined by several factors: chemical mineralogy of dust (Sullivan et al. 2007), transport pathways, the extent to which dust is transported across polluted sources (Sullivan et al. 2007; McKendry et al. 2008) and meteorological and chemical processing. In particular, sulphate and nitrate coating on dust surfaces is favoured in the marine atmosphere where the relative humidity is high (Hanisch and Crowley 2001; Usher et al. 2002; Trochkine et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2003a; Okada and Kai 2004; Ooki and Uematsu 2005; Matsuki et al. 2005). Dallâosto et al. (2010), who compare African dust mixing state at different distances from the emission source, demonstrate a continuous chemical evolution of dust particle composition during atmospheric transport, consistent with the relatively slow atmospheric oxidation of sulphur dioxide. Moreover, measurements on individual particles show evidence of the mineralogy-dependent formation of sulphate/ nitrate on dust particles (Matsuki et al. 2005; Laskin et al. 2005; Sullivan and Prather 2007). Sulphate formation is favoured on aluminosilicate-rich particles (Laskin et al. 2005; Shi et al. 2008) while preferential nitrate formation on carbonate-rich dust is observed (Ro et al. 2005; Sullivan et al. 2007; Matsuki et al. 2010a; Fairlie et al. 2010). It was proposed that the preferential association of sulphate with Al-rich dust is partly due to the oxidation of SO2 to H2SO4 catalysed by transition-metals, mainly iron, present in aluminosilica minerals (Sullivan et al. 2007; Sullivan and Prather 2007). Yet, the opposite behavior of sulphate and nitrate formation on carbonates could be explained by their difference of hygroscopicity (Sullivan et al. 2009; Formenti et al. 2011). Calcium sulphate is poorly water soluble, preventing further uptake of water and other gaseous species, and hence suppressing the transformation of sulphur dioxide to"

(2002) stated that the quality of their output did not allow for direct use in hydrological impact studies, because the spatial and temporal scales were too coarse. Wilby et al. (1999) recommended the use of downscaling techniques before the GCM output data could be used in impact studies. There are many possibilities for downscaling GCM output: direct use of RCM output (Wood et al. 2004), use of bias-corrected RCM output (Wood et al. 2004; Fowler et al. 2007a), statistical downscaling (Wilby et al. 2000; MÃ¼ller-Wohlfeil et al. 2000), stochastic weather generators (Evans and Schreider 2002) or weather typologies, and/or indices (Pilling and Jones 2002). The skills of different downscaling methods differ considerably between variables and regions. Hydrologic simulation was found to be sensitive to biases in the spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation at the monthly level, especially where the seasonal snow pack transfers run-off from one season to the next (Fowler et al. 2007c). Using the example of the Lule River in northern Sweden and two GCMs used to force the same RCM, Graham et al. (2007a) have shown that the choice of driving GCM has a greater impact on results than the choice of GHG emission scenario. The strong impact of the choice of GCM was also emphasised by Widmann et al. (2003), Jasper et al. (2004), SalathÃ© (2005), and Wilby et al. (2006). Fowler et al. (2007a) stated that at least two variablesâ temperature and precipitationâhad to be downscaled for impact studies in hydrology. In impact models, the physical consistency between variables is very important. To obey this requirement for physical consistency, multi-variate methods should be applied which yield simultaneous correction of relevant variables. This is possible when RCMs are used (Fowler and Kilsby 2007; Fowler et al. 2007a; Graham et al. 2007a, b), but is generally not in statistical downscaling. A multi-site approach should be used when spatial consistency is needed."

For example, models generally have problems with sub-grid precipitation, simulating precipitation more often, but in lower amounts, than reality. As precipitation scavenging is a complex and nonlinear process (e.g. Barrie 1992) such issues will cause errors in modelled wet deposition that are difï¬cult to evaluate. There are also many uncertainties inherent in the deposition monitoring methods themselves (Draaijers and Erisman 1993; Erisman et al. 2005). Large differences between models were found in the global models participating in the COSAM study, in which the wet deposition efï¬ciency varied by a factor of four (Roelofs et al. 2001). A similar spread was also found for global models by Dentener et al. (2006) and Textor et al. (2006).

An important constraint of these algorithms is that, at typical non-bloom concentrations, the PIC scattering represents only a few percent of the total scattering. Thus, to maximise the signal to noise ratio, satellite pixels must be aggregated in space and time, in order to define accurate mean concentrations. Currently, more verification with PIC field measurements is underway to optimise the use of PIC ocean-colour data in models (Balch et al. 2011). PIC is also produced by certain zooplanktonic organisms but these particles are too large to be detected by ocean colour (Balch et al. 1996). Different bio-optical and ecological methods have been established that use ocean colour data to identify and differentiate between PFTs or phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) in the surface ocean. These can be summarised into four main types: spectral-response methods which are based on differences in the shape of the light reflectance/absorption spectrum for different PFTs/PSCs (Sathyendranath et al. 2004; Alvain et al. 2005, 2008; Ciotti and Bricaud 2006; Bracher et al. 2009; Sadeghi et al. 2011; Brewin et al. 2010a; Devred et al. 2011), methods which use information on the magnitude of chlorophyll a biomass or light absorption to distinguish between PFTs or PSCs (Devred et al. 2006; Uitz et al. 2006; Hirata et al. 2008; Brewin et al. 2010b; Hirata et al. 2011; Mouw and Yoder 2010), methods that retrieve the particle size distribution from satellite-derived backscattering signal and derive PSCs (Kostadinov et al. 2010), and ecological-based approaches which use information on environmental factors, such as temperature and wind stress, to supplement the bio-optical data for investigating PFTs (Raitsos et al. 2008). All methods derive dominant phytoplankton groups, while Uitz et al. (2006), Bracher et al. (2009, improved by Sadeghi et al. 2011) and Hirata et al. (2011) also give chl a for the different PFTs. Nearly all the PFT methods mentioned use information from the multispectral ocean colour sensors SeaWiFS, MERIS or MODIS and are based on the parameterisation of a large global or regional in situ data set in order to yield PFTs from satellite chl a or normalised water leaving radiances. Unexpected changes in the relationships between these parameters resulting from a regional or temporal sampling bias leads to a bias in the"

Experimental warming has been shown to reduce soil water content by increasing evapotranspiration (Harte and Shaw 1995; Wan et al. 2005), with potentially negative effects on ANPP. Warming also may enhance productivity by alleviating low temperature limits on plant growth (Luo 2007; Lin et al. 2010) and increasing N mineralization (Rustad et al. 2001; Dijkstra et al. 2008). These opposing influences of warming may explain why many rangeland experiments have shown little consistent warming effect (Polley et al. 2013) and why interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation are smaller than expected from single-factor effects (Fig. 7.2b; Wu et al. 2011; Morgan et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2013). Corollary 4 Precipitation seasonality regulates ecosystem responses to both CO2 and warming. Warming and CO2 enrichment combined should lead to earlier and more rapid plant growth in ecosystems dominated by winter precipitation because warming will reduce temperature limitations on both growth and growth responses to CO2. On the other hand, warming may reduce CO2 benefits on arid and semiarid rangelands dominated by summer precipitation by increasing evaporative demand. The evaporative potential of air increases nonlinearly with temperature, such that a given increase in temperature will cause a disproportionately large increase in evaporative demand when temperature is high. Plant responses to CO2 enrichment alone also depend on the seasonal distribution of precipitation. CO2 stimulated ANPP of Australian grassland most during years when summer rainfall exceeded rainfall during spring and autumn (Hovenden et al. 2014). High rainfall during cool spring and autumn seasons may reduce production in this grassland by intensifying N limitation to plant growth."
241,735,0.237,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"For the Baltic Sea area, statistical downscaling methods have mostly been applied to estimate future changes in hydrological variables, such as precipitation and run-off, and storm-related variables such as wind. The usual large-scale predictors are SLP and geopotential height. One particular aspect of the applications of statistical downscaling to the Baltic Sea so far is the frequent use of nonlinear statistical methods, such as weather typing, fuzzy networks and clustering algorithms, whereas for other areas linear regression methods, such as principal component regression, have generally been more frequently found in the literature. Rogutov et al. (2008) gave an example of how a standard statistical downscaling method for precipitation should look. The authors considered the whole of western Europe, but the results are also relevant for the Baltic Sea area. The method used principal components regression, which has been applied not only for downscaling purposes but also for climate reconstructions based on proxy data since mathematically the problem is very similar. Both the predictor (SLP) and the predictand (precipitation) are decomposed by a previous principal component analysis, and the leading components are retained for further analysis. This ensures that the covariance matrices that result in the regression analysis are not singular, avoiding over-ï¬tting of the statistical model. There is no clear rule to determine the optimal number of retained principal components, but the number can be approximately estimated by sensitivity calculations until the skill of the reconstructed predictand, when compared to observed data, does not grow. Linear regression methods produce predictands with the same probability distribution as the predictors. Since atmospheric circulation variables tend to be approximately normally distributed, linear statistical downscaling methods may work well to estimate changes in monthly, seasonal or annual precipitation, which also tend to be approximately normally distributed. However, this is not the case for daily precipitation. In this case, more sophisticated nonlinear methods are needed, for instance those based on classiï¬cation of weather types (see Chap. 10, Sect. 10.3). Wetterhall et al. (2009) employed a classiï¬cation scheme constructed on a fuzzy logic algorithm to estimate changes in daily precipitation over Sweden based on the output of the GCM HadAM3H driven by the SRES scenarios A2 and B2. They also employed a weather generator that takes into account the weather type and is able to replicate the serial autocorrelation of daily precipitation. The advantage of this approach is that it is in theory able to estimate changes not only in daily precipitation amount and occurrence but also in block maxima, that is, maximum 3- or 5-day precipitation. Under these two scenarios, and conditional on the GCM used, Wetterhall et al. (2009) found that precipitation in Sweden tended to increase in the twenty-ï¬rst century and that the maximum 5-day precipitation also became larger"

Given uncertainty in climate model parameter values, 17 different combinations of parameter values were used to identify ranges in possible temperature and precipitation changes (see Chap. 11, Fig. 11.3). Despite substantial variability between the 17 iterations, all projections indicate a warmer and wetter climate by 2099. From these 17 scenarios, three were selected for application in the models to cover a range of possible change (Q0, Q8 and Q16). Ensemble members were selected to provide a central baseline (Q0), a warmer and drier scenario during the mid-century (Q8), and a much warmer and wetter scenario for both 2050 and 2099 (Q16).

Global sea-level rise scenarios are based directly on the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Church et al. 2013).

As delta regions are particularly sensitive to precipitation and river runoff, outputs from an integrated catchment model (see Chap. 13 and Whitehead et al. 2015a, b) were used to determine run-off and associated nutrient loadings from the delta rivers into the Bay of Bengal. The model took account of both climatic scenarios (Q0, Q8, Q16) and patterns of upstream water use according to three socio-economic scenarios (Less Sustainable (LS), Business As Usual, (BAU), More Sustainable (MS)) scenarios (Whitehead et al. 2015a, b). The results of the Q0-BAU, Q8-LS and Q16-MS were used in further simulations. A regional POLCOMS-ERSEM coupled model (Holt et al. 2009; ButenschÃ¶n et al. 2016) was used to project both the physical state of the ocean (temperature, salinity, currents, light level), as well as the biogeochemistry and plankton production in the Bay of Bengal (see Chap. 14). The model simulates the dynamics of nutrients (C, P, N and Si), phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria, as well as particulate and dissolved organic matter. The model domain covers the entire coastal area of Bangladesh up to 200 km beyond the edge of the continental shelf, with a horizontal resolution of 0.1Â° and 42 vertical levels. For each climate dataset, the model was run continuously for 1971â2099. Outputs from the POLCOMS-ERSEM model were then used to drive a dynamic marine ecosystem model that predicts potential production by size class of fish, taking into account food availability, predation effects and temperature effects on feeding and mortality (Blanchard et al. 2012). Size-based methods like this are useful in that they capture the basic metabolic properties and dynamics of marine food webs, describing energy flux and production by size class, independent of speciesâ ecology (Blanchard et al. 2012).

Sub-seafloor and seafloor surface three-dimensional seismic profiles, multibeam bathymetry, and side-scan sonar swaths are used to identify areas of potential fluid gas expulsion. Acoustic wipe out zones indicate bubbles near the seafloor. Sea surface slicks seen from satellites can be followed back to natural releases of oil and gas at the seafloor (MacDonald et al. 1993; De Beukelaer et al. 2003). With these three types of information, the next step is to confirm existence of seep communities using bottom photographic surveys, ROV observations, or deep submergence research vehicle sampling (Roberts et al. 2010). Although seafloor trawling provided some of the first clear confirmations that seep communities exist (Rosman et al. 1987), this is now frowned upon because of the damage it does to the structures. The Gulf of Mexico seeps are the most well known worldwide (Fisher et al. 2007). The cold seep faunal assemblages occur in five categories: mussel beds, clam beds, vestimentiferan (tube worm) clumps, an epifauna of brachiopods and solitary corals, and gorgonian fields (Kennicutt et al. 1985; Rosman et al. 1987; MacDonald et al. 1989, 1990a, b, c). According to Roberts et al. (2010), of the thousands of seeps on the northern Gulf of Mexico slope, many surround the edges of the intraslope basins where shallow subsurface salt bodies give rise to bathymetry with faults that provide pathways for salt, gas, and oil to flow up to the seafloor. Stable isotope measurements suggest that a principal energy source is hydrogen sulfide in addition to methane (Brooks et al. 1985; Demopoulos et al. 2010; Becker et al. 2010). Physiological studies have suggested that endosymbiotic relationships exist between mussels and methanotrophic bacteria, but clams and vestimentiferans contain sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Cordes et al. 2005a). It is assumed that the seeping fossil hydrocarbons nourish sulfatereducing bacteria that provide sulfide to the sulfide-oxidizing endosymbionts (Freytag et al. 2001). The bathymodiolids harbor at least four symbiotic functional groups: methanotrophs (consume methane as an energy and carbon source), methylotrophs (consume a methyl group at the end of a fatty acid), and two different thiotrophs (oxidize-reduced sulfur compounds for energy) (Dupperon et al. 2007). The community of organisms on the deep Florida Escarpment is not supported by fossil hydrocarbons (Paull et al. 1984). The composition of the principal fauna associated with fluid expulsion varies over time as the seep matures. Bathymodiolus mussels with methanotrophic symbionts arrive first (Roberts et al. 1990; Bergquist et al. 2003). Prior to this, the sediments may need to be stabilized by carbonate precipitation that is a byproduct of the oxidation of the hydrocarbons (Aharon and Fu 2000; Joye et al. 2004; Luff et al. 2004). Vestimentiferan tubeworms follow after enough carbonate substrate is available (Cordes et al. 2003). The clumps of tubeworms and mussel beds are considered the foundation species of the seep communities (Cordes et al. 2010). The three species of mussels are Bathymodiolus brooksi, B. childressi, and B. heckerae. The tubeworms are known to be Escarpia laminata and Lamellibrachia luymesi (Miglietta et al. 2010) and Seepiophila jonesi (Gardiner et al. 2001), among others. These foundation species serve as habitat for a speciose assemblage of smaller organisms, but the small organisms associated with the larger individual clumps are difficult to sample quantitatively (Bright et al. 2010; Cordes et al. 2010; Lessard-Pilon et al. 2010). Fauna associated with tubeworms appears to have a higher diversity than mussel beds on the upper slope (550 m [1,804 ft] depth), but at greater depths, this distinct difference is less obvious in rarefaction curves (Cordes et al. 2010). The mussel beds appear to have a mid-depth maximum (MDM) diversity but the fauna associated with the tubeworms did not. This is an interesting observation because MDMs have been observed on many continental margins, but their cause is equivocal at best. The nonseep macroinfauna of the Gulf of Mexico has a distinct MDM, but this was not apparent in the polychaete worms (Rowe and Kennicutt 2008). Many of the species associated"

The good performance of the multi-model ensemble means holds true in a general sense, although for individual variables, seasons, and regions, it is possible to ï¬nd single models that are better than the ensemble mean.

241,1223,0.23,Second Assessment of Climate Change for the Baltic Sea Basin,"Model simulations indicate that rising temperatures could improve tree growth in the northern boreal zone, while changes in precipitation are not likely to have a major effect on growth at these latitudes (Bergh et al. 2003, 2007; Ge et al. 2011b). In the southern parts of the Baltic Sea basin, tree growth is strongly water limited (Lasch et al. 2002, 2005). Here, an increase in temperature but without an increase in precipitation could further exacerbate the water deï¬cit and thus decrease growth. In general, the temperature response optimum (the ability of tree species to manage higher temperatures) is higher and the effect of rising temperature is more positive, if precipitation also increases, whereas the main effect of higher temperatures is negative and the temperature response optimum lower if precipitation is reduced (Lindner et al. 2010). For example, growth of Norway spruce in the southern boreal zone is projected to increase up to 2050, but then decline due to more frequent dry spells during the growing season (KellomÃ¤ki et al. 2008; Ge et al. 2011b; see also Chap. 16).

They found that RCMs tend to produce a reasonable annual cycle of temperature but clearly overestimate precipitation in winter and underestimate precipitation in summer. By applying their bias correction method to daily precipitation, they were able to bring the model results much closer to observations. The same correction function would then be applied to the output of scenario simulations, under the assumption that the causes that produce the mean biases in the models remain unchanged under a future climate. The corrected values of precipitation and temperature were used by ApsÄ«te et al. (2010) to drive a hydrological model to estimate changes in run-off in the eastern Baltic Sea catchment area. Future run-off will be modulated by changes in two factors. On the one hand, evaporation will tend to increase due to higher air temperatures, while on the other, precipitation is expected to increase, as simulated by most RCMs participating in the PRUDENCE project (Christensen and Christensen 2007). A surprising result of the study by ApsÄ«te et al. (2010) was that the ï¬rst factor seemed to be more important in the future, and river run-off would tend to decrease according to the RCM simulations analysed. Also, important is that the annual cycle of run-off tended to change considerably, with the late spring maximum observed in the present climate shifting to earlier seasons even into the months of January and February. This is a consequence of the rising temperatures and an earlier onset of the melt season, as well as changes in the annual cycle of precipitation and increased evaporation. This represents a major shift in the annual run-off cycle that may have profound consequences on many economic sectors should it remain unmanaged by reservoirs. However, the study by ApsÄ«te et al. (2010) is based on the mean of data simulated by 21 models and does not indicate the spread of individual simulations. Previous projections of river run-off into the Baltic Sea indicated that the uncertainty was large enough to encompass a broad range of projections, from slight reductions to substantial increase (Graham 2004). In a further study aimed at reconstructing run-off in the past 500 years, Hansson et al. (2011) also applied a statistical downscaling method using predictors from climate reconstructions of atmospheric circulation and temperature. Although the study is not focused on future projections but rather on past evolution of run-off, their ï¬ndings about past variability in river run-off were also interpreted in the context of future climate change. Hansson et al. (2011) briefly indicated that if their statistical downscaling model is correct, run-off would tend to increase in the northern Baltic Sea and decrease in the southern Baltic Sea. This result is mainly driven by the signal of increasing temperature in the northern Baltic Sea catchment area and by a decrease in precipitation in Central Europe. Chap. 12 deals explicitly with run-off projections."

The repair of DSBs via nonhomologous end-joining is error-prone to some extent and therefore can lead to nucleotide deletions or insertions (indels) at the breakage site (Waterworth et al. 2011). Depending on the type of mutation, this can result in functional modification, complete disruption of gene function, or removal of whole gene clusters from the plant genome. For application of this technique in model and crop plant species, the following customizable endonuclease platforms with different benefits and drawbacks are available: meganucleases, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs); the latter derive from a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPRassociated (CRISPR/Cas) microbial defense system [reviewed in Fichtner et al. (2014)]. TALENs are created by the fusion of a customized TALE DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the FokI restriction-endonuclease domain (FokI-R) (Christian et al. 2010). Primarily, a TALE-DBD from plant pathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas sp. consists of a variable number of nearly identical amino acid repeats. Each repeat has a length of 33â35 amino acids and binds preferentially to a certain nucleotide of the target DNA sequence (Boch et al. 2009; Moscou and Bogdanove 2009). Different binding specificity of distinct repeats can be explained by variations in amino acids 12 and 13, which are therefore called repeat variable diresidues (RVDs). The amino acid pairs most commonly used in RVDs of TALE-DBDs are NI (binding to adenine), NG (thymine), NN (guanine), and HD (cytosine). Given the opportunity of rearrangement of these repeats, it is possible to assemble a TALE-DBD for virtually any DNA target sequence of choice. Such customized TALEN-DBD in combination with the 25 kDa FokI-R domain, with the latter not having any own DNA-binding specificity (Li et al. 1992), TALENs represent a universal tool for DSB induction. However, FokI-R needs to form dimers to be catalytically active (Bitinaite et al. 1998). Therefore, two TALEN subunits binding to the desired target sequence in inverse orientation to each other are required. This obligatory dimerization decreases the probability for off-target mutations but also doubles the effort to produce an effective TALEN. TALENcoding DNA subunits can be highly efficiently assembled via Golden Gate cloning [e.g., Cermak et al. (2011)], PCR-based methods [e.g., Yang et al. (2013)], or FLASH assembly (Reyon et al. 2012). TALENs are more cost effective and much easier to handle than zinc-finger nucleases (Beumer et al. 2013). Therefore, TALENs were successfully applied for site-directed mutagenesis in a number of model and crop plants like Arabidopsis (Christian et al. 2013), tobacco (Zhang et al. 2013), Nicotiana benthamiana (Mahfouz et al. 2011), Brachypodium distachyon (Shan et al. 2013), rice (Li et al. 2012), Brassica oleracea (Sun et al. 2013), soybean (Haun et al. 2014), wheat (Wang et al. 2014), maize (Liang et al. 2014), and barley (Wendt et al. 2013; Gurushidze et al. 2014)."
376,97,0.222,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","cover. A recent meta-analysis showed that these effects are highly context dependent (Eldridge et al. 2011). Shrub encroachment into grasslands is often classified as a âtriggerâ for soil degradation and âdesertificationâ (Schlesinger et al. 1990). But a study conducted in a semiarid Mediterranean grassland in Spain showed that the effect can also be opposite (Maestre et al. 2009). In this example, shrubs establishing in degraded pastures created âislands of fertilityâ that enhanced vascular plant richness, microbial biomass, soil fertility, and nitrogen mineralization. In this sense, shrubs may be seen as reversing, rather than causing, desertification. Regardless of changes in vegetation and soil structure, there are physical limits to the magnitude with which WPE can modify the hydrological budget. Potential effects are greatest where precipitation approximately equals PET (Zhang et al. 2001); above or below this threshold, ET is constrained either by precipitation or PET. Grassland and savanna biomes occur under both climate conditions. The Great Plains of North America, for example, straddle regions with precipitation surplus to the east and precipitation deficit to the west (Fig. 2.10). Therefore, WPE should have maximal hydrological consequences in central regions of the USA. There are several caveats to these generalizations and we mention two: first, there are hydrological systems with large bypass-flow components. Bypass flow is"
344,278,0.22,Development Policies and Policy Processes in Africa : Modeling and Evaluation,"Please note that our example demonstrates the inefficiency of non-cooperative bargaining (e.g., in Fig. 4, the mean voter position remains rather distant from the Pareto frontier). In general, policy outcomes are stochastic under non-cooperative bargaining (i.e., risk-averse legislators prefer the mean voter rule as a deterministic cooperative decisionmaking procedure). Further, legislators are less able to coordinate their actions under the one-step mean voter rule than under the two-step procedure (e.g., legislators collectively prefer a shift of the status quo beyond the mean voter position (i.e., Î»g is larger than 1 for all legislators) (see Table 2)."

120,109,0.219,Genome Editing in Neurosciences,"neuronal diversity and disease (McConnell et al. 2013; Poduri et al. 2013; Weissman and Gage 2016). In this regard, beyond inherited germline mutations, somatic, âbrain onlyâ, mutations have been implicated in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (Poduri et al. 2013). However, the potential causes of genomic alterations in brain cells continued to remain largely unexplored and speculative. Based on our observations regarding the effects of C-NHEJ deficiency on neuronal development and neuronal disease, namely cancer, we sought to develop and employ new technologies to test the hypothesis that genomic alterations in mature brain cells and some variations connected to neuropsychiatric diseases might originate from DSBs in NSPCs. Over the past decade, since our discoveries of the potential roles for DSBs in neuronal diversity and disease, we have developed and enhanced a highthroughput, genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) approach to rapidly and highly sensitively identify DSBs genome-wide based on their translocation to bait DSBs (Chiarle et al. 2011; Frock et al. 2015; Hu et al. 2016). For this approach, bait DSBs can be introduced ectopically by designer endonucleases (Chiarle et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2014; Meng et al. 2014; Frock et al. 2015) or recurrent endogenous DSBs can be used as bait, including those initiated by AID during IgH CSR (Dong et al. 2015) or by RAG during V(D)J recombination (Zhang et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016). Our studies have shown that various classes of DSBs, including those induced ectopically by ionizing radiation, show a much greater preference to join to other DSBs within the same topological domain due to proximity effects associated with the spatial genome organization of chromatin domains (Zarrin et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2012; Alt et al. 2013; Frock et al. 2015). As two random DSBs rarely occur within the relatively short genomic distances within a chromosomal domain, which is often a megabase or less, this phenomenon most greatly impacts the joining of closely linked recurrent DSBs (Alt et al. 2013). Our HTGTS studies provided additional insights into our prior finding (Zarrin et al. 2007; Gostissa et al. 2014) that indicated that CSR joining exploits the predisposition of high frequency DSBs within topological domains to be joined to each other to achieve physiological joining levels (Zarrin et al. 2007; Dong et al. 2015). We also showed that, during V(D)J recombination, RAG exploits chromosomal loop domains to not only achieve high joining frequency but also to developmentally restrict its activity directionally within a loop domain (Hu et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2016). To identify the sources and functions of neural DSBs, we applied our HTGTS DSB identification approach to cultured, primary mouse NSPCs. For these HTGTS studies, we employed ectopically generated bait DSBs on several different chromosomes to search for significant, recurrent clusters of DSBs genome-wide that joined to bait DSBs on more than one chromosome. These studies identified 27 recurrent DSB clusters (âRDCsâ) in the NSPC genome, all of which were enhanced by mild replication stress via treatment with aphidicolin, a compound that inhibits replication (Wei et al. 2016). Strikingly, all 27 of these RDCs lie within genes, most of which encode surface proteins involved in synaptogenesis and related neural processes (Wei et al. 2016). Moreover, variations of most RDC genes also have been"
376,395,0.219,"Rangeland Systems : Processes, Management and Challenges","The combined effect of climate change drivers may differ from that anticipated by summing single-driver effects (Fig. 7.2; but see, Dukes et al. 2005). For instance, plant biomass responses to combined warming and CO2 enrichment treatments often are smaller than anticipated from single-factor experiments (Morgan et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012). Interactions also are evident in driver effects on plant community composition. Responses of foliar cover to experimental warming were species specific in an old field, varied through time, and were contingent on precipitation treatments (Engel et al. 2009). Warming may exacerbate effects of reduced precipitation on rangelands (Hovenden et al. 2008; Sherry et al. 2008), but the ecosystem consequences of the combination of climate change drivers generally are not as extreme as would be anticipated from single-driver effects (Wu et al. 2011; Dieleman et al. 2012)."

This finding validates those of many studies conducted by authors like Allogni et al. (2004), Ntsama (2007), Pycroft (2008), Tiamiyu et al. (2009), Mugisha and Diiro (2010), Maruod et al.
