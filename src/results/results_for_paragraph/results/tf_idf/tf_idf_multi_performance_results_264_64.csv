68,33,0.519,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","2.5 Motivation James A. Middleton, Amanda Jansen and Gerald A. Goldin 2.5.1 Introduction Mathematics education has been plagued, over the years, by a kind of paradox. We teach mathematics for the public good, with the goal that all citizens be able to reason quantitatively; understand scientific, economic, and social arguments based on data; and use this understanding to make informed decisions about themselves and our collective polity. Yet in many countries, while mathematics is viewed as beneficial societally, it is not seen by a majority of students as beneficial personally. Such beliefs and norms about mathematics have hindered significant progress in democratizing access to quality mathematics teaching and learning, and even those with such access tend to avoid advanced mathematical topics and courses (Simpkins et al. 2006). This paradox is also manifest in public attitudes towards science and other mathematically intensive fields (National Science Board 2014). In our view, the root of the problem lies not in mathematics content per se. We do not regard mathematics as more difficult, more complex, or more boring in and of itself than other academic content. Rather, the norms, beliefs, and practices that have arisen over the past century and a half related to mathematics teaching, learning, and assessment, have ignored or poorly articulated the role of motivational processes in mathematics learning. This section considers the broad field of motivation in mathematics education research. We suggest that, until recently, the focus on individual motivational"
15,34,0.512,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","2.2.3.1 Social Issues Writing of her work with the Landless Peopleâs Movement, Gelsa Knijnik stresses the cultural nature of mathematics and the power the subject gives to those who teach and do academic mathematics while subjugating practitioners of indigenous or âstreetâ mathematics (Knijnik 1997). Benn follows a similar path when detailing her journey from a believer that mathematics is value and culture-free to a person questioning the power it holds over the adult population, particularly mature students. In her words, âI became committed to the notion that adult education has a vital role to play in a democratic society. I became convinced that the low level of numeracy in our society limit participation and critical citizenship (Benn 1998, p. 156).â In a separate paper, Benn argues that the education system perpetuates a limiting social class and working-class adults who return to study lack the social support system needed to prevail (Benn 1999). This is reminiscent of Parkerâs study on successful studentsâone of the key elements she found was the existence of a backup person willing to shoulder responsibilities so that the adult student is free to study. Cobenâs paper on Freire and mathematics education has been cited earlier in this chapter. She has also researched extensively on the Gramscian view of âcommon senseâ and its relation to mathematics education. Like Benn, Coben argues strenuously that knowledge of mathematics is socially powerful and possessing it carries prestige along with an assumption of superior intelligence in general. Common sense, on the other hand, is devalued and individuals who rely on it for mathematical decisions see themselves, and are seen by others, as socially inferior to individuals who can âdoâ academic mathematics (Coben 1999). Dias investigated the applicability of Freireâs liberation pedagogy to a basic education program in Brazil. The teachers were accustomed to using his work in a literacy program but struggled to transfer that experience to the teaching of mathematics. Teacher discussions revealed âthe existence of strong ideological beliefs about how mathematics should be taught, who can learn it, and who knows it"

17,23,0.487,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"Recent developments of critical mathematics education are, for instance, formulated in AlrÃ¸ et al. (2010), Ernest et al. (2015) and Skovsmose and Greer (2012). Looking into the future much more is on its way. Let me just refer to some doctoral studies in progress that I am familiar with. Ana Carolina Faustino addresses dialogical processes in primary mathematics education. Not least inspired by the work of Freire, dialogic education has developed with many references to adult education. However, Faustino is going to rework the very conception of dialogue with particular reference to younger children. Amanda Queiroz Moura investigates mathematics education for deaf students. This brings her to address particular aspects of inclusive education as well as of dialogical education, and in this way to provide new dimensions to the discussion for mathematics education for social justice. JoÃ£o Luiz Muzinatti works with middle class students, and through different mathematical projects he is challenging a range of assumptions and preconceptions that dominate middle class discourses. Thus Muzinatti formulates new concerns of critical mathematics education. Guilherme Henrique Gomes da Silva addresses afï¬rmative actions. He investigates the different components of such actions, emphasising that afï¬rmative actions also must address the very educational format of university studies. This way da Silva brings a new speciï¬city to the discussion of afï¬rmative actions. We always have to remember that much research in mathematics education is not presented in English, but in other languages. The same applies to critical mathematics education. Here one ï¬nds important contribution in Portuguese as, for instance, Biotto Filho (2015), Marcone (2015) and Milani (2015). (See also, Skovsmose 2001, 2007, 2008; Valero and Skovsmose 2012.)"
333,37,0.478,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"Since the introduction of electronic calculators in mathematics education in the 1970âs, the discussion of using those aids has been ongoing. Many studies have been conducted (cf. Barzel 2012) and many questions have been surveyed: â¢ Which speciï¬cations are necessary for designing tasks in mathematics education as well as in mathematics assessments by considering technology? â¢ How is it possible to work meaningfully in mathematics classrooms by using technology? â¢ Is it possible to raise the motivation for discussing mathematical problems by using technology in mathematics education? â¢ Where is it possible to identify mathematics in everyday life and what is the role of technology? â¢ Is it possible to form another picture of mathematics when using technology in mathematics education? â¢ How does the use of technology influence mathematical skills and competencies of students? It is beyond controversy that the use of technology broadens the palette of tools in mathematics education. By using digital tools as a black-box (cf. Buchberger 1989), complex and real problems can be discussed (cf. Rousseau and Saint Aubin 2008). Besides real-life applications, problems of everyday life that do not have an explicit connection to mathematics can be discussed (cf. Siller 2015). Meaningful questions like evacuating a special region or a football stadium, ï¬nding the optimal path on a mountain or position-planning can be discussed because the complex mathematical part and the mathematical solution can be outsourced to technology. There are only the personal requirements of identifying and understanding mathematical connections and applying mathematical skills. These are the (new) challenges in mathematics education. Laborde (2002, p. 285) writes: When a new element such as technology is introduced, the system is perturbed and has to make choices to ensure a new equilibrium is attained, choices that may be related to the various interrelated elements of the teaching system mentioned [â¦]."
15,68,0.47,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","its importance in their lives and strengthen their beliefs about its teaching and learning. Second, as parents themselves learn mathematics with an emphasis on understanding they will become quite vocal about the importance of mathematics education for their children. Therefore, involving adults (parents) in mathematics education of their children will be a win-win situation. This involvement will help them to understand mathematics from point-of-view of a teacher and learn about its different aspects. Besides, this involvement will also make them more committed and eager to become a lifelong mathematics learner and practitioner."
333,50,0.467,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"This report is based on a review of research papers published during the last ï¬fteen years in four leading journals in mathematics education: Journal for Mathematics Teacher Education, Educational Studies in Mathematics, Technology, Knowledge and Learning (formerly International Journal of Computers in Mathematics Learning), and ZDM Mathematics Education, as well as in proceedings of major international conferences in this area: technology groups at CERME 3â9 congresses, ICTMT 10 and 11 conferences and ICMI studies 1 and 17. A selection of forty or so papers considered as relevant to this overview were analyzed. Clearly, we do not claim to have done an exhaustive search, yet we can deem that these papers are representative of current trends in research on teacher education. Some of the studies address prospective mathematics teacher education, while others focus rather on professional development of practicing mathematics teachers, and we consider both. This paper is organized around the following four questions from the point of view of integrating technology to upper secondary mathematics instruction: (1) What knowledge and skills do the teachers need to efï¬ciently use technology? (2) How these knowledge and skills can be developed in teachers? (3) How do researchers design their studies to follow teachersâ development? and (4) What theoretical frameworks inform the research in teacher education? The concluding section brings to the fore issues highlighted in the literature review that seem worth being addressed in the TSG 43."

287,19,0.459,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"Out of the previous presentation arose the result that the development of theories in mathematics education cannot be cut off from clarifying the notion of theory and its epistemological ground related to the scientiï¬c foundation of the ï¬eld. Steiner (1983) construed this kind of self-reflection as a genuine task in any scientiï¬c discipline (see Steiner 1986) when he addressed the comprehensive task of founding and further developing mathematics education as a scientiï¬c discipline (see Steiner 1987c). At a post-conference meeting of ICME5 in Adelaide in 1984, the ï¬rst of ï¬ve conferences on the topic âTheories of Mathematics Educationâ (TME) took place (Steiner et al. 1984; Steiner 1985, 1986). This topic is a developmental program consisting of three partly overlapping components4: â¢ Development of the dynamic regulating role of mathematics education as a discipline with respect to the theory-practice interplay and interdisciplinary cooperation. â¢ Development of a comprehensive view of mathematics education comprising research, development, and practice by means of a systems approach. â¢ Meta-research and development of meta-knowledge with respect to mathematics education as a discipline (emphasis in the original; Steiner 1985, p. 16). Steiner characterized mathematics education as a complex referential system in relation to the aim of implementing and optimizing teaching and learning of mathematics in different social contexts (ibid., p. 11). He proposed taking this view as âa meta-paradigm for the ï¬eldâ (ibid., p. 11; Steiner 1987a, p. 46), addressing the necessity of âmeta-research in the ï¬eld.â According to Steiner, the ï¬eldâs inherent complexity evokes reduction of its complexity in favour of focusing on speciï¬c aspects, such as curriculum development, classroom interaction, or content analysis. According to Steiner, this complexity also creates a differential classiï¬cation of mathematics education as a âï¬eld of mathematics, as a special branch of epistemology, as an engineering science, as a sub-domain of pedagogy or general didactics, as a social science, as a borderline science, as an applied science, as a"

88,3,0.452,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"The ï¬eld of mathematics education also sees international comparative studies as a means to generate theories and to identify practices that may improve studentsâ learning. According to Cai (1995), international comparative studies in the domain of mathematics provide mathematics educators with opportunities to identify effective ways of teaching and learning mathematics. Examination of what is happening in the learning of mathematics in other countries helps researchers and educators understand how mathematics is taught by teachers and how it is learned and performed by students in different countries. It also helps them reflect on theories and practices of teaching and learning mathematics in their own culture. Stigler et al. (2000), themselves researchers conducting international studies, explain the value of this research on trends over time and context in a more nuanced Consequently, we may be blind to some of the most signiï¬cant features that characterize teaching in our own culture because we take them for granted as the way things are and ought to be. Cross-cultural comparison is a powerful way to unveil unnoticed but ubiquitous practices (pp. 86â87)."

17,12,0.435,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"The above ï¬ve questions and their concomitant sub-questions might be taken to represent a âbottom upâ introduction to the philosophy in mathematics education, because they start with, interrogate and problematise the practices of teaching and learning mathematics and related issues. A âtop downâ approach might use instead the abstract branches of philosophy to provide the conceptual framework for analysis. Thus it could consider research and theory in mathematics education according to whether it draws on ontology and metaphysics; epistemology and learning theory; social and political philosophy; aesthetics, ethics and axiology (the philosophy of values) more generally; the methodology of mathematics education research; or other branches of philosophy. Ontology and metaphysics have as yet been little applied in mathematics education research (Ernest 2012). Work drawing on aesthetics is still in its infancy (Ernest 2013, 2015; Sinclair 2008). However extensive uses of epistemology and learning theory, social and political philosophy, ethics and methodology can be found in mathematics education research and literature. In addition to the contributions of the substantive branches of philosophy to mathematics education, there are also beneï¬ts to be gained from applying philosophical styles of thinking in our research. For example, many of the constructs we utilise need careful conceptual analysis and critique. I have in mind such widely used ideas as understanding, development, progress, progressivism, mathematical ability, nature/natural, cultural/artiï¬cial, values, objectivity/subjectivity, identity, working like a mathematician, learning, discovery learning, problem solving (including pure, applied, ârealâ and âauthenticâ problems), teaching, assessment, mathematics, knowledge, sex/gender, special needs in mathematics, multiculturalism/antiracism, ethnomathematics, context, both social and task-related, and so on. Understanding is perhaps the most basic and obvious of these terms, so what can deconstructing it add to our knowledge? Can it contain hidden assumptions and pitfalls? First of all, it is based on the peculiar metaphor of âstanding underâ. In what way does this capture its meaning? Synonyms like âgraspingâ, âgetting a handle onâ or âseeingâ it are all based on familiarity through a sensory encounter with meaning,"

15,20,0.424,"The Troika of Adult Learners, Lifelong Learning, and Mathematics","Instead of these multi-faceted benefits, adult learners still feel reluctant to lifelong mathematics learning. The reasons are many. First among them is negative perception about mathematics. Many adult learners approach math with anxiety and frustration. Negative previous experiences with math instruction create legitimate barriers for many adult learners (U.S. Department of Education 2015). Mathematics in particular is often associated with negative memories, and so people try to avoid using mathematics in their everyday or vocational lives. This leads to a problematic affective situation in adult-educational mathematics courses (SchlÃ¶glmann 2006, p. 15). According to Klinger (2005, p. 7), A major challenge for practitioners in adult mathematics education is to achieve effective learning outcomes in the face of prevailing negative attitudes in their students, often present as a consequence of unsatisfactory early mathematics learning experience and flowing from the well established connection between adult innumeracy and mathematics anxiety."

17,4,0.394,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"1 Introduction This ICME-13 Topical Survey is designed to provide an overview of contemporary research in the philosophy of mathematics education. This is a broad cluster of overlapping but at times disparate themes. In the ï¬rst instance, this publication exposes some of the problems and questions in mathematics education that the philosophy of mathematics education clariï¬es, illuminates and sometimes helps to solve. A metaphor for what is offered is a three tier pyramid. At the apex is this publication, presenting an abbreviated âproblematiqueâ of the subï¬eld, that is, the cluster of problems and issues at the heart of the area. At the next level, is the breadth of problems, issues and research results that will be shared when the group of authors of this publication meet with the âpublicâ at the ICME 13 conference in Hamburg, July 2016. Finally, at the base level is the full spread of research and its results, books, journals, papers, conference presentations and other activities that make up the subï¬eld, the philosophy of mathematics education, which is beyond the scope of this publication and conference. This publication thus briefly sketches some of the topics, problems and areas of active research (the apex) and through this point to some of what will be offered at the conference (the middle level). In doing so it serves as an introduction to the extent of the sub-ï¬eld overall, through references to current publications and classic literature (the base of the pyramid). Why the philosophy of mathematics education? What does it offer? The philosophy of any activity comprises its aims or rationale. Given our shared commitment to the teaching and learning of mathematics it is vital ask: What is the purpose of teaching and learning mathematics? What do we value in mathematics and its teaching and learning? Why do we engage in these practices and what do we"

317,44,0.37,Transitions in Mathematics Education,"During the past decades many studies have looked at the transition from out-of-school to school mathematics (and vice versa). Three main themes of this literature are: (1) exploration of out-of-school mathematical practices and cultures (in comparison to mathematics learnt at school), (2) difï¬culties in the transition between out-of-school and school mathematics, and (3) attempts to facilitate these transitions. As stated above, since the early works on ethnomathematics and everyday mathematics from the 1980s (Nunes 1992), researchers have continued to explore and describe forms of informal mathematics that are embedded in everyday cultural activities (Nunes 1992; Presmeg 2007).

The assumption was that not purely cognitive factors play a role in the learning of mathematics. In these pioneering studies, the definition of attitude is rarely made explicit, and the main goal is to prove causal correlations between attitude and other significant factors (for example, mathematical achievement). Describing the state of the art, Aiken (1970, p. 592) states, âThe major topics covered were: methods of measuring attitudes towards arithmetic and mathematics, the distribution and stability of mathematics attitudes, the effects of attitudes on achievement in mathematics, [and] the relationship of mathematics attitudes to ability and personal factors.â"
210,30,0.37,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"1 Introduction Practitioners and researchers interested in prospective secondary mathematics teacher (PSMT) preparation can see technology as both an object of PSMT learning and a means for that learning. In this chapter, we present a systematic review of empirical literature to describe how PSMTs beneï¬t from technology use in teacher preparation. To arrive at the set of references, the ï¬rst author searched each of nine core mathematics education journals for articles published between 2000 and 2015 using key words: âtechnologyâ, âpre-serviceâ or âprospectiveâ, and âsecondary mathematics teachersâ. Abstracts, theoretical backgrounds and methodology sections indicated 25 articles that reported empirical results. A search of six refereed journals focused on technology, mathematics education, or teacher education1 for articles published between 2000 and 2015 using âsecondary mathematics teachersâ and either âpre-serviceâ or âprospectiveâ as key words. Upon careful reading the 35 articles, we selected 18 that focused on prospective secondary mathematics teachers and reported an empirical study.

17,21,0.357,The Philosophy of Mathematics Education,"education. Naturally, it needs to be recognised that âsocial justiceâ is an open concept, the meaning of which can be explored in many different directions. Addressing equity also represents concerns of critical mathematics education, and the discussion of social justice and equity bring us to address processes of inclusion and exclusion. Social exclusion can take the most brutal forms being based on violent discourses expressing racism, sexism, and hostility towards âforeignersâ or âimmigrantsâ. Such discourses might label groups of people as being âdisposableâ, âa burdenâ, or ânon-productiveâ, given the economic order of today. It is a concern of critical mathematics education to address any form of social exclusion (see, for instance, Martin 2009). However, social inclusion might also represent a questionable process: it could mean an inclusion into the capitalist mode of production and consumption. So, critical mathematics education needs to address inclusion-exclusion as contested processes. However, many forms of inclusion-exclusion have until now not been discussed profoundly in mathematics education: the conditions of blind students, deaf students, students with different disabilitiesâin other words: students with particular rights. However, such issues are now being addressed in the research environment created by the Lulu Healy and Miriam Goody Penteado in Brazil. Such initiatives bring new dimensions to critical mathematics education. Mathemacy is closely related to literacy, as formulated by Freire, being a competence in reading and writing the world. Thus, DâAmbrosio (1998) has presented a âNew Trivium for the Era of Technologyâ in terms of literacy, matheracy and technoracy. (DâAmbrosio talks about matheracy, while I prefer to use mathemacy.) Chronaki (2010) provides a multifaceted interpretation of mathemacy, and in this way it is emphasised that this concept needs to be re-worked, re-interpreted, and re-developed in a never-ending process. Different other notions have, however, been used as well for these complex competences, including mathematical literacy and mathematical agency. Jablonka (2003) provides a clarifying presentation of mathematical literacy, showing how this very notion plays a part in different discourses, including some that hardly represent critical mathematics education. The notion of mathematical agency helps to emphasise the importance of developing a capacity not only with respect to understanding and reflection but also with respect to acting. Dialogue. Not least due to the inspiration from Freire, the notion of dialogue has played an important role in the formulation of critical mathematics education. Dialogic teaching and learning has been presented as one way of developing broader critical competences related to mathematics (see AlrÃ¸ and Skovsmose 2002). Dialogic teaching and learning concerns forms of interaction in the classroom. It can be seen as an attempt to break at least some features of the logic of schooling and as a way of establishing conditions for developing mathemacy (or mathematical literacy, or mathematical agency). Problem-based learning and project work can also be seen as way of framing a dialogic teaching and learning. Pedagogical imagination. Critique in terms of imagination has been formulated in terms of sociological imagination. Through such imagination one reveals that something being the case could be different. I ï¬nd that a pedagogical imagination"

287,22,0.354,Theories in and of Mathematics Education,"In the following decade, from 1992 up to the beginning of the 21st century, the discussion on theory concepts died down in the German community of mathematics educators while the theoretical diversity in the ï¬eld grew. Considering the two main scientiï¬c journals, we identiï¬ed scientiï¬c contributions from several theoretical communities addressing three topics related to the TME program (without any claim of completeness): 1. Methodology: methodological and thus theoretical aspects in interpretative research (Beck and Jungwirth 1999), interviews in empirical research (Beck and Maier 1993), multi-methods (Wellenreuther 1997); explaining in research (Maier 1998), methodological considerations on TIMSS (Knoche and Lind 2000); 2. Methods in empirical research: e.g., two special issues of ZDM in 2003 edited by Kaiser presented a number of methodical frameworks; and 3. Issues on meta-research about what mathematics education is, can, and should include: considerations on paradigms and the notion of theory in interpretative research (Maier and Beck 2001), comparison research (Kaiser 2000; Maier and Steinbring 1998; Brandt and Krummheuer 2000; Jungwirth 1994), and mathematics education as design science (Wittmann 1995) and as a text science (Beck and Maier 1994). This short list indicates thatâat that timeâdistinct theoretical communities seemed to share the need for methodological and meta-theoretical reflection. However, the German community of mathematics education as a whole did notâ and still does notâshare a common paradigm. In order to provide deeper insight into theory strands of German-speaking countries, two examples are presented. The ï¬rst one is the theory of learning activity that originates in activity theory developed by Joachim Lompscher. It is used today in several educational subjects: for example, Bruder has further developed and adapted this concept to the needs of mathematics education, and she and Schmitt will present this theory strand. The second theory strand is a speciï¬c view on semiotics presented by DÃ¶rfler and contrasted with Otteâs view on signs as a vehicle for doing mathematics as a human activity. The theory of learning activity provides a general educational theory that has been borrowed then applied and adapted to mathematics education, while DÃ¶rfler bases his work profoundly in the philosophies of Peirce and Wittgenstein and reconstructs mathematics as a kind of game using diagrams in a more home-grown Open Access This chapter is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits use, duplication, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, a link is provided to the Creative Commons license and any changes made are indicated."

68,14,0.351,"Attitudes, Beliefs, Motivation and Identity in Mathematics Education : An Overview of The Field and Future Directions","2.1.3 The TMA Model for Attitude: A Characterization of Attitude Grounded in School Practice The attitude construct has been widely used by mathematics teachers: often teachersâ diagnosis of ânegative attitudeâ is a causal attribution to studentsâ failure and perceived as global and uncontrollable rather than an accurate interpretation of studentsâ behavior that is capable of steering future action. To make this diagnosis useful for dealing with studentsâ difficulties in mathematics, we conducted a long study based on the collection and analysis of studentsâ autobiographical narratives (Di Martino and Zan 2011) in order to construct a characterization of attitude strictly linked to studentsâ experience with mathematics. An analysis of 1662 anonymous essays entitled âMaths and me: my relationship with maths up to nowâ written by students of all school levels was conducted. According to a grounded-theory approach to the data (Glaser and Strauss 1967), we used the collected data to discover a set of categories aimed at understanding how students describe their own relationship to mathematics. At the end of our analysis, we identified three main dimensions in studentsâ narratives: emotional dispositions towards mathematics, view of mathematics, and perceived competence in mathematics (only 32 essays, 2.1 % of the entire sample, did not refer to at least one of these three dimensions)."

210,78,0.344,The Mathematics Education of Prospective Secondary Teachers Around the World,"Throughout the survey one can see that there is a steady growth in the research around prospective secondary mathematics teacher education. Also several of the studies were repeated in at least two of the sections due to the nature of the factors that were studied. It is difï¬cult to write about teacher knowledge without some acknowledgment of how knowledge or lack of knowledge can impact teachersâ mathematics identities. Furthermore, ï¬eld experiences are contexts in which PSMTsâ knowledge and identities are impacted and shaped. In addition, the survey revealed that mathematics education researchers are thinking more deeply about how to foster the growth of effective mathematics teachers in a myriad of ways. For example, we know more about teacher education strategies that appear to have a positive impact on the development of PSMT knowledge, such as designing classroom tasks, looking closer at studentsâ thinking, and linking theoretical models"

333,3,0.333,Uses of Technology in Upper Secondary Mathematics Education,"1 Introduction The use of technology in upper secondary mathematics education is a multifaceted topic. This topical survey addresses several dimensions of the topic and attempts at referring to international research studies as it is written by a team of several authors from ï¬ve countries of three different continents. The survey is structured into four subchapters, each of them addressing a theme of the TSG 43 at ICME 13. â¢ Technology in secondary mathematics education: theory Technology is often arousing enthusiasm as well as reluctance among teachers and mathematics educators. Therefore it was necessary to start the survey with a theoretical analysis of features of digital technologies from an epistemological and a cognitive perspective. A unique epistemological feature of mathematics is their symbolic dimension. It is impossible to gain direct access to mathematical objects as to physical objects. The only way is to access them is through representations. Digital technologies mediate mathematics and some of them offer new kinds of representations, like dynamic and socially distributed representations. Based on a Vygostkian perspective and an instrumentation approach, the use of digital technologies is analyzed as a coaction or a creative interplay between tool and human and as social coaction with socially distributed technology. This theoretical analysis is presented in the ï¬rst subchapter and the second subchapter also refers to it. â¢ The role of new technologies: changing interactions Part of the role of new technologies is to change the process toward an outcome for learning. This process includes developing a mathematical discourse, providing opportunities to conjecture and test, and active not passive learning. New technologies can add to these processes by connecting learners in different ways with each other and the phenomena under study, mediating learning in different ways, and can offer the opportunity for students to build on the work of one Â© The Author(s) 2017 S.

This approach aids with the dilemma discussed in the introduction related to the number of secondary mathematics teachers who are strong reform mathematics teachers. Santagata et al.

306,16,0.327,"Early Geometrical Thinking in the Environment of Patterns, Mosaics and Isometries","It is a common opinion among researchers that the formation of geometrical concepts takes place in the different way than it does in the formation of arithmetical concepts. Tall (1995) has formulated a theory on how an individual builds up mathematical ideas. He has distinguished three main sources for creating mathematical concepts: perception, action, and reflection. These three sources are the basis for three essentially different kinds of mathematics: â¢ space and shape (geometry), based on theorizing about the (geometric) objects: we perceive and construct at increasing levels of sophistication; â¢ symbolic mathematics where actions on objects (such as counting) are symbolized giving new mathematical concepts (number); and â¢ axiomatic mathematics, built by reflection on the properties of the ï¬rst two forms of mathematics in terms of formal deï¬nitions and logical deductions (Fig. 1)."
88,68,0.321,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"3 Summary and Looking Ahead Over the last three decades, international comparative studies have completely transformed the way we see mathematics education. For example, because of the very high ranking of some Asian countries, the ï¬eld of mathematics education has become interested in mathematics education in Asian countries. We used to think that there was one basic way of teaching mathematics; international comparative studies, however, showed us many different ways of teaching mathematics in the classroom. We also learned that some student background variables (e.g., attitudes, gender) operate in different ways for students in different countries. In this Topical Survey, we have reflected on a sample of the lessons we can learn from international comparative studies. To conclude, we would like to emphasize the complementary roles of small-scale and large-scale international comparative studies. While we have used âsmallâ and âlargeâ scale throughout this paper, we have not described what we mean about the scale. The small- and large-scale international comparative studies can address different research questions. To make this point clear, we cite the report from the Institute for Education Sciences and National Science Foundation in the USA (U.S. Department of Education & National Science Foundation 2013), which presented six classes of research in their Common Guidelines for Education Research and Development: (1) Foundational Research, (2) Early Stage or Exploratory Research, (3) Design and Development Research, (4) Efï¬cacy, (5) Effectiveness, and (6) Scale-up.

Section 5 considers two kinds of transitions and corresponding research: the transition between prior to school and school mathematics, and the transitions (in both directions) for students between school and out of school mathematics. Finally we describe some directions for future research on transitions in mathematics education."
88,64,0.307,international Comparative Studies in Mathematics : Lessons For Improving Studentsâ Learning,"We need to move beyond the estimates of national mathematics achievement scores to investigate the factors that influence mathematical performance. The emerging results from our analyses conï¬rm the effects of home and school socio-economic factors on mathematics achievement. As expected, students who speak the language of the test at home are more likely to achieve higher scores than those who do not. Similarly, the analysis conï¬rms that student achievement is higher for age appropriate students. We explored the effects of two contemporary, South African issues on achievement, namely gender and school violence. We found new complexities in the schooling experience of South African boys and girls. On average, across South Africa, gender differences in mathematics test results were small or non-existent. We also probed students about their attitudes to mathematics and found that both boys and girls valued mathematics. A particularly worrisome ï¬nding is the level of indifference among boys about their education. Boys were found to have lower aspirations about their academic careers, showed less interest in mathematics and engaged less often with an adult regarding their school work. The link between negative attitudes and weak performance was stronger for boys than for girls. Boys were also at a higher risk of being victims of bullying than girls. The second issue we explored was the extent of violence in South African schools and the effects on mathematics achievements. Although concerns about school safety are increasing internationally, violence in schools is considered more serious in South Africa than elsewhere. We found that school related violence may be linked to conditions in communities. The extent of school safety largely depends"
