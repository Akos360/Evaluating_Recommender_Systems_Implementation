It is important to make a firm diagnosis before commencing treatment. Diarrhoea should be investigated with stool culture and virology examination to exclude C. diff and CMV in particular (Couriel et al. 2006b). Patients may also suffer from pancreatic atrophy and exocrine insufficiency that causes malabsorption and can respond to pancreatic enzyme supplementation (Jagasia et al. 2015). For upper GI, early satiety, anorexia or nausea and vomiting are scored on occasional symptoms with little reduction in oral intake during the past week being âmildâ; a âmoderateâ score of cGvHD as intermittent symptoms with some reduction in oral intake during the past week; and âsevereâ if the patient has persistent symptoms throughout the day with a marked reduction in oral intake on almost every day of the past week. Lower GI disturbance with diarrhoea will score âmildâ if the patient has occasional loose or liquid stool on some days throughout the week. If the patient is having intermittent loose or liquid stool throughout the day, on almost every day of the last week without requiring intervention to prevent or correct volume depletion scores as âmoderateâ. Those with âsevereâ disease have voluminous diarrhoea on almost every day of the past week requiring intervention to prevent or correct volume depletion."

258,13,0.231,New Horizons for Asian Museums and Museology,"One of the main features of these museology courses has always been a comprehensive approach to covering matters related to museums, rather than focusing on a single topic. From FY2004 onwards, all courses have been comprised of a 10 week general program (for all participants) and a 3-week specialized program (various electives). The general program includes an overview of museology, such as collection, conservation, exhibition, collaboration with society, and museum management. The lectures and practice cover these topics, and participants are asked to give presentations resulting from their own experiences and to take part in study trips. The study trips are designed for experiencing the diverse styles and conditions of Japanese museums. In addition to this, during weekends and holidays throughout the course, participants visit museums in the region, according to their own interests and specialties. Usually, they visit a total of 40â50 museums during their stay in Japan. For a 3-week specialized program, three specialized programs are offered each week, from which participants select one. For example, the specialized programs for the 2014 curriculum were; ï¬rst week, âPreventive Conservation,â âManagement of a Local History Museum,â or âPhotography,â second week, âConservation and Restoration of Objects,â âMuseum and Local Communities,â or âFilming,â and third week, âExcavating and Controlling Archaeological Resources,â âExhibition Design,â or âDocumentation and Databases.â Interactive exchange of experiences and information, in other words âforumorientedâ learning, instead of unilateral classroom lectures, is what the courses seek to achieve. To that end, participants are given many opportunities to share their"

Among 101 cases in England outside London recorded in the sheriffsâ cravings, the mean interval was 10.71 days, although there was considerable variation around this (Fig. 2.4). The Berkshire assizes at which Abraham Tull and William Hawkins were condemned began on 7 March 1787 and they were executed and gibbeted on the 9thâonly two days later, or even one day if their case was not heard on the first day of the assize sitting. Thomas Colley, on the other hand, was tried at the Hertfordshire assizes beginning on 29 July 1751 but not executed and gibbeted until 24 August, nearly a month later. Delays of more than two weeks, however, are uncommon. Given that the start of assizes is likely to be before the date of conviction in many cases (assize sittings could take up to a week in this period), we can assume that the blacksmith would normally have a week or less to make a set of irons. It was necessary therefore to start on the construction of a gibbet and a set of irons as soon as possible after a sentence had been passed. Where possible, the condemned man was measured for his set of irons before execution, a harrowing experience. When Ralph Smith of Lincolnshire was being measured for his irons in 1792, for example, he found it"
